                        <para>- At the request of the Australian Wheat Board, the Treasury has agreed to make the necessary financial arrangements to enable a further payment of ls. per bushel, less rail freight and handling charges, to be made to the wheat-growers in the &#34; old pool,&#34; making a total payment of 4s. per bushel, less rail freight and handling charges. This will involve making a temporary advance to the Wheat Board of a considerable amount in addition to the funds from sales coming to hand; but the whole amount advanced will, it is believed, be liquidated by the Wheat Board in a very few months. It is expected that this payment of ls. per bushel, less rail freight and handling charges, will be made available about the end of April. </para>

There are many things that could be done in that way if the House would agree, but once the portals of the Tariff are opened, where are we going to stop ? How can we draw the line between cornsacks and woolpacks? The honorable member for Maranoa has already made the suggestion that the duty on woolpacks should be remitted. </para>

Every piece of meat sent, not only to this camp, tout also to the Old Country, on behalf of the Commonwealth is most carefully inspected. I do not think that there is any country in the world in which there is more careful inspection of meat. I would be glad if honorable members, in all such cases as this, would specify the particulars, because the difficulty in connexion with general complaints is to get down to bed-rock. Honorable members would facilitate the work of investigation if they could specify, names and dates as far as possible. </para>

                        <para>--The honorable member is aware that the Governments of the four wheat-producing States, together with the Commonwealth Government, have agreed to guarantee to the farmer a minimum price for the 1917-18 crop. If the honorable member now asks me whether we are prepared to do the same in respect of the 1918-19 crop, I must say at once that I am unable to give that assurance. In the first place, the arrangement is one in which the State Governments jointly and severally take the liability of the amount, each for its own State, while the Commonwealth finances and, as it were, indorses their bill. Until the Wheat Board, as well as the State and Commonwealth Governments, have had an opportunity of considering the question of the 1918-19 crop, and what prospects, if any, there are of marketing that crop, I think it would be premature for us to speak of what the Commonwealth can do. In respect of the coming crop, however, every farmer in the Commonwealth has the positive assurance that he has a guaranteed price of 3s. per bushel f.a.q. at the station. The Wheat Board has made a recommendation, and I hope the States will agree to it, to substitute for that a guaranteed price of 4s. per bushel f.o.b. The Commonwealth Government approve of that recommendation. </para>

I was not aware of the far-reaching consequences of rabbit poisoning on bird life; but, owing to the fact that we have completed with the Imperial Government a contract for the supply of rabbits for the British Forces, we have requested the various State Departments to actively co-operate with us in prohibiting the poisoning of rabbits where facilities for freezing exist. Since rabbits now are no longer, as it were, a pest to be got rid of at all hazards, but a means of affording employment to large numbers of people, and a source of wealth to the community, this has already been done. </para>

                                <para>- In hunting parlance, I might fairly call this question a &#34; rascal &#34; ; and, if I get over it, I think I shall do pretty well, considering the difficulty of the matter, and the fact that I did not hear quite the whole of what the honorable member  said.  The subject is most complex ; and the assistance that my honorable friend, the member for Maranoa, gave me yesterday- in regard to wool packs, will help me very much. Perhaps I might be permitted to furnish the House with what information  is at  my disposal  in  regard to the transaction generally. This will, at any rate, clear up  some  of the points raised by the honorable member for Wannon, particularly as  to  what interest may be expected, and, consequently, what probabilities there are of a writing-off  or  setting-off, as against a later appraisement,  in  the amount of the settlement. As this matter is of great importance, I make  no  apology for setting out. the position in detail. At the close of last year, negotiations were concluded with the Imperial Government whereby the balance of the clip was sold  at  the flat-rate of 15Jd. per lb. of greasy wool. The necessary machinery has been installed, and put into working order. At&#39; first, the  Work  of appraising the wool was slow, but, now that appraisers have had experience with the operations, excellent progress is being made. The payments regularly follow the appraisements, and a deduction of 10 per cent,  is  retained by the Commonwealth Government to cover any contingencies that may arise through overvaluation of wool by the experts. In other words, 90 per cent, of the appraised value is paid at the close of each appraisement, and the adjustment will be made&#39; at the close of the final appraisement on the 30th June next. The point to. which I wish to direct the honorable member&#39;s attention is that the money represented by the 10 per cent, deduction is invested with the Bank of England,- and is earning interest for the whole  of  the time, and the proceeds will be added to the wool-growers? account,&#34;&#39; and form part of the final &#39;distribution. In addition to the interest earned on the 10 per. cent..1 deduction, a considerable sum of money will be returned on earnings from exchange as between London and Australia; The Central Wool Committee have also recommended that the manufacture of wool tops for export shall be controlled by the Commonwealth Government during the war period. This has. been confirmed, and agreements have been . prepared for the proper performance of the extension of contracts for wool tops for Japan. The price obtained . for the wool tops is that fixed by the Imperial Government, so that the buying and selling prices are controlled by the Government. Substantial monetary guarantees have been lodged for the due performance of these contracts by the manufacturer. As to profits arising from these contracts, all documents and accounts will be investigated and audited by an independent accountant, and approved by the Central Wool Committee ; and of the net profits 50 per cent, will be paid to the Commonwealth Government, and the remaining 50 per cent, will be retained by the manufacturing company. It will be seen that it is proposed to divide the profits. It is probable that if this wool scheme be extended to cover next season&#39;s wool, in addition to the clip now in hand, sufficient money will be recovered by the Commonwealth Government to equal the amount paid as bounties for the encouragement and establishment of the wool tops industry in Australia since its inception. There is this to be said, that the amount of the clip that is not required for Imperial military purposes will be sold to manufacturers in Britain, and the difference between the flat rate of 15 Jd. plus freight and insurance, and the price obtained, will be divided between the growers and the British Government. The grower, therefore, whether he hae his wool appraised early or late, is to look, first of all, to the fact that the 10 per cent, deduction is earning interest, then that he is making money out of the exchange, which he never did before, that he is getting the highest price he ever got in his life, and that he is going to- get a still higher price, or half of the profit of all wool sold for other than military purposes; and, lastly, the community is to be congratulated on the fact that the wool top industry is to be kept going here, the export rates, being maintained, and we maintaining our manufacturing interest. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Brisbane asked me yesterday to make it plain to the House whether members of the Australian Imperial Force abroad, in the matter of their treatment, have to seek redress from the Australian authorities, or whether their only appeal is to the Imperial authorities? In reply I have to say that Australian soldiers abroad seek redress, in the first instance, from their own Australian officers, who are bound by the Defence Act. They can then appeal to General Birdwood, an Imperial officer, who, with the approval of the Imperial authorities, was appointed by the Australian Government as the General Officer Commanding Australian Troops. The honorable member for Brisbane also referred to some other circumstances which, he said, indicated considerable dissatisfaction among the troops, and these will be inquired into, and the honorable member advised later. The honorable member has sent me a letter in which several complaints are made in a very vague way. For instance, there is one letter containing an allegation that, when a soldier dies the blanket in which he is buried is charged against him. I shall make inquiries concerning the general allegations, but, as I earlier said to the honorable member for Echuca, it would be much better if honorable members would specify time and place, and so on, so that we may at once get to bedrock. </para>

I am not aware whether the facts are as the honorable gentleman has stated. For the policy of the Government I refer the honorable member to my answer to the honorable member for Maribyrnong. We are endeavouring to arrive at an understanding with the States as to the control of these funds. </para>

The Ministry consider that, however difficult it may be to obtain a proper method of voting, it would be a great pity if these men were not given an opportunity - subject, of course, to military necessities, as to which we are in communication with the Imperial Government - to discharge one of the highest functions of citizenship, by voting for candidates for the next Commonwealth.

                            <para>- The Bill covers all who belong to the Forces, and are at the front, or have returned home. If they are qualified in other respects, the fact that they have discharged in the most efficacious way their obligations to the Commonwealth, and to the Empire, will give them the right to vote, even though they may not be enrolled. I think a question was asked early in the day by the honorable member for Nepean concerning the men employed on the transports. </para>

                            <para>- A transport is not a vessel of war, and, by international law, is not subject to the ordinary contingencies of war. It would be very hard to make provision for the voting of munition workers, who may be grouped in two classes. There are, first, those who went Home at the invitation of the Imperial Government, sent through this Government, and who may, therefore, be regarded as associated with our Military Forces, their names appearing on lists. It would be possible, though not convenient, to take the votes of these persona, because, instead of being in one or two places, they are so scattered about &#39;that it would be very difficult to provide machinery whereby their votes could be properly registered. In proportion to the number of men at the front, the number of Australian munition workers in Great Britain is small. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but they are so scattered that it would be practically impossible to record their votes, and, therefore, provision has not been made for doing so. Those employed on the transports were allowed to vote on the compulsory military service proposal, but, speaking from memory, I do not think that more than 370 of them took advantage of the opportunity provided. They would have to vote under the Bill and law, after the issue of the writ, and either before leaving port or on arrival, which would be after the polling day. It would be very difficult to provide properly for the voting of these men. Their names are not on official lists, most of them will be at sea when the vote is taken, and, in any case, their votes could not be easily allocated to particular districts. </para>

In addition to the munition workers who have gone Home on the special invitation of the Imperial Government, there are others who have gone Home on their own account, for whose voting we could not make any provision, because we do not know their names, nor do we know their qualifications. The voting will be, not according to electoral divisions, but according to military lists. Ordinary Australians who are now visiting Great Britain, or are elsewhere absent from the Commonwealth, will not be able to vote, and  these  munition workers will be in the same position. </para>

                            <para>- Their names are not on any official list. As for the voting at the front, it would be impossible to follow the methods in vogue in the Commonwealth requiring the men to vote according to the electoral divisions from which they went away. In the Commonwealth there will be six Senate ballot-papers, one for each State, and seventy-five ballot-papers for the divisions returning members to the House of Representatives. The men at the front, however, are not grouped according to their States, and it would be practically impossible to provide the machinery that would enable them to vote according to State and electoral divisions. What is proposed, therefore, is that their votes shall be recorded according to their place of residence as entered on the military or naval lists, or, where, through some oversight, their place of residence has not been recorded, according to the place of residence of their next of kin. </para>

                            <para>- Our Bill practically adopts the Canadian system. . As the ordinary electoral method cannot be followed, it is &#39;proposed to allow our men abroad to vote for definite groups, that is, for Ministerialists, or for Opposition ists, as they choose. The Prime Minister will determine, within five days of the polling, which of the candidates are to be identified as Ministerialists, and the honorable member for Yarra will determine which of them are to be identified as supporters of the Official Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- It is the grouped candidates who will be certified to. I do not think that it is necessary for every man who stands to be certified to. Out of 300 or 400 candidates it would be hard to say whether every man belonged to a different party or not. But it will be done so far as it can be done. The identification of a group is all that is necessary, and the men will learn from the printed lists circulated among them the divisions for which the candidates are standing. </para>

                            <para>- If our friends opposite think they should be designated as the Official Labour party, there is really no reason why the term should not be used, but there is nothing invidious in calling honorable members led by the honorable member for Yarra the Opposition. Furthermore, the designation of Opposition will cover any variation of humour and opinion inside or outside the chamber. Goodness knows, there are enough such variations in Parliament. If .honorable members opposite are for the time being designated as members  of the Official Labour party, the significance of the term may be varied from moment to moment. I think, on the whole, it would be better to accept the suggestion made in the Bill under which the various parties are to be grouped. Of course, the voting will be absent voting, and as was the case in regard to the recent referendum, the votes will be sent to London to be counted, except that in the case of the men stationed in German New Guinea their votes will be sent to Rabaul. The head of our Forces in London is Brigadier-General Anderson, and he will be the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in London. There will be another Commonwealth Electoral Officer at Rabaul. The count will be made in the presence of scrutineers appointed by each party- that is, the Ministerialists and the Opposition. Provision is made in clause 17, paragraph (c) that the scrutineers shall be an equal number, nominated by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition respectively. This should be a guarantee that the voting will be above suspicion. </para>

                            <para>- The voting being by groups, men&#39;s votes being assigned to divisions as indicated by residence entered on military lists, and the divisions not being set out in the ballot-papers, the allocation to the various divisions will be made at the time of the scrutiny by the electoral officers. They .-will se&#169; from the military lists where each man&#39;s residence is, and they will declare that his vote is to be attached to the division of the State according to those lists. That is the only convenient way in which the allocation of the votes&#39; can be done. Some of the men will not be enrolled, and it will be impossible to get them to declare the district for which they would care to vote. Furthermore, experience shows that many men who are enrolled cannot say at a particular time the divisions for which they are enrolled. Therefore, seeing that we are not following the present electoral roll, but are enabling every man at the front over twenty-one years of age to vote, the provisions of our electoral law have had to be somewhat altered in order to meet the circumstances&#39;. Part III. of the Bill deals with the disqualification of certain persons. Clause 10 provides - &#34; Every naturalized British subject who was born in an enemy country shall be disqualified from voting at elections.&#34; This is a time when we should take every precaution against danger, and it has been decided that those who were born in any country with which Britain is at present at war shall be debarred from voting at an election so long as this measure is in force. No questions are to be asked. It is simply a matter of disqualification for the time being. We may have our differences of opinion upon this point, but on the whole, seeing that the Empire is at war, and that the war has reached such a critical stage, there is some justification for saying that the ordinary electoral rights of the persons covered by this part of the Bill must give way to a reasonable degree of caution as to the possible effect of their votes at an election. Exemptions are provided in clause 10, sub-clause 4. This clause provides that the following persons shall be exempt: - </para>

It is also thought that Christian Syrians, who are devoted to the British Empire, should be permitted to vote. At the recent referendum, provision was made by which the parents who had a son at the front could vote ; but this Bill extends that privilege to the parent, wife, brother, or sister of a person who is or has been a member of the Forces. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the names on the military lists would coincide with the divisions in which soldiers who were enrolled prior to their departure stand enrolled upon the electoral lists; but in any case, the man who has just returned, and is not enrolled, can vote in accordance with his residence as it appears on the military list. Practically in all cases the division in which he was entitled to enroll as an elector would be indicated as his residence on the military list. Returned soldiers who are enrolled would vote for the division in respect of which they are enrolled. It will be necessary to take the military lists as a guide; but, as I have said, in nearly every case the places of residence as given on the military list will coincide with the electoral divisions for which the men are enrolled. The only other provision in the Bill to which reference need be made covers the case of a candidate for the Senate who may die after the date of nomination. Provision is made by which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition can nominate some one, as their parties may determine, to take the place of the deceased candidate on the list. </para>

The Bill merely provides the machinery to enable men to vote at the front, and while it is not, perhaps, as perfect in all respects as would be possible in ordinary circumstances, it is the best that can be brought forward under the conditions described. </para>

                        <para>. - When the debate on this Bill was adjourned last night, I was discussing the method by which the Prime Minister proposes to confer certain benefits upon users of cornsacks, and particularly the farmers of Australia. I wish to emphasize my objections to that method, which, in my opinion, is very questionable. A far more wholesome and legitimate course would have been to submit an amendment of the schedule to this Bill. The Government might have embodied it in a small list of amendments, and have said, &#34; We require these amendments to be made, but are not prepared to go any further at this stage with the revision of the Tariff.&#34; Had they done so, the Bill would have passed just as speedily as it will do in the existing circumstances. We are giving the Prime Minister unlimited power under the War Precautions Act to make regulations dealing, amongst other things, with the Tariff. If at any time an influential deputation points out some serious Tariff anomaly, and can sufficiently impress the Prime Minister, he may bring its representations before the Cabinet, and, provided that he can convince his colleagues of the wisdom of granting the request of the deputation, he may, by Order in Council or by means of a regulation under the War Precautions Act, do what the deputation asks. In this piecemeal way the Government can withdraw nearly all the benefits that the Tariff gives through the Customs House. </para>

                    <para>I am not objecting to this proposal in regard to cornsacks merely because it is a concession to be granted to the farmers. In the existing conditions, I think that the remission of the duty on cornsacks would be unanimously agreed to by the House ; but it is the method by which this concession is to be granted to which I take exception. Such a system opens the door to abuses, and will reflect no credit on the Parliament or the Administration which sanctions it. We already have a long list of concessions and innovations, made by way of regulation, in regard to various industries. As the result of a deputation which waited on the Prime Minister, and which consisted principally of the sugar-growers and the sugar-millers, the Cabinet quite recently came to a certain decision with regard to the sugar industry. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which is one of the biggest combines in Australia to-day, and is in a position to make bigger profits than ever before, must be included amongst the sugar-millers. </para>

                            <para>- There is only one way to get rid of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and of any other company which is manipulating things in its own interest and against the public, and that is for the Commonwealth Government to take absolute control of the industry. The decision at which the Cabinet has arrived in regard to the sugar industry will mean the doling out of money already in the public purse. It is a most unwise one. At the behest of a deputation, the Treasurer is told by a majority of his colleagues to dip his hands into the public Treasury and to hand out to a section of the community a very large sum of money. </para>

Commonwealth, as the result of this decision in regard to the sugar industry, will lose nearly &#163;1,000,000.

If there is one thing which the honorable member for Lang, in common with a number of other honorable members, has voiced in this House, it is the feeling that this country should not be governed by regulations. We like to see everything placed in black and white by the&#39; Parliament itself. </para>

                    <para>The Government, having a majority in this House, could have submitted and have carried in connexion with this Bill a proposal to remit the duty on cornsacks. That would have been much better than their devious methods for making this concession to the farmers. The British Government to-day have practically full control of the Indian jute mills. They have assumed that control for the reason that they require millions of sand bags in connexion with their military operations, end it is from those jute mills that we obtain our bags and the material for making bags. We are still a long way from the1917-18 harvest, and I contend that the question of remitting the duty on cornsacks might well have been allowed to stand over until after the general elections. There would have been ample time, after the elections, to make provision for the 1917-18 harvest. Why has this concession to the farmers been announced just before a general election? The reason is obvious. I leave it to the people to say for themselves whether these tactics should be adopted merely for the sake of securing a political advantage. </para>

                    <para>Concerning the question of Protection, much has been said, and the Labour party has been blamed for its failure to deal with the Tariff. The last general election took place on 5th September, 1914, and on 3rd December, 1914, the present Tariff schedule was laid on the table of the House by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor.</inline> At that time no honorable member was conversant with the terms of the schedule. Only a few officials of the Customs Department were familiar with them. As we all know, the Tariff schedules must, of necessity, be framed in the greatest secrecy. It would be wrong to the country to do otherwise, so that with the exception of a few Customs officials and the then Minister for Trade and Customs no one in Australia knew what sort of a schedule would be submitted. We were hopeful, however, that when we were afforded an opportunity to consider it, the Protectionists in this House would be able to frame a schedule that would be in consonance with the opinions of the advanced Protectionists of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- As I have said, the Tariff schedule was laid on the table of the House on 3rd December, 1914, three months after our return. It has been declared that the only excuse we have for our failure to deal with the Tariff is in respect of the period subsequent to a certain announcement by the Prime Minister after he returned from Great Britain. If it was only then that the difficulty arose, there must have been a number of Rip Van Winkles in the Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Tariff schedule was no sooner laid on the table of the House than the great bulk of the members of this Parliament knew that there was a menace ahead of us in connexion with it. The honorable member for Wide Bay was not then a member of this Parliament, but if he will take the trouble to look up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he will find that I had something to say about this question long before he was returned. If there were one reason more than another for the journey which the Prime Minister made to the other side of the world, it was that he should do something in this regard. That, so far as I was concerned, at all events, was the main reason why he undertook that mission.  Unfortunately, things in that regard are still unsatisfactory. If we are not to do anything for the industries of our country merely because there happens to be a certain difficulty in the way, then we are recreant to the promises we made and to the principles we espoused when before the electors. In October, 1914, shortly after the elections, I suggested to the then Prime Minister a means by which this country could be placed, in a far better position than she is now to meet the times coming after the war. Our organization is almost nil. Wo organization can be complete in this direction without a proper Tariff schedule. I see no reason why even before we go to the electors we should not encourage our industries without giving offence to any nation, allied or neutral. We ought to have one common Tariff, without preference to anybody, and absolute prohibition of all articles which we can produce and manufacture here for our own use. Would such a Tariff give offence to any country, seeing that we should treat Great Britain just as we treated her Allies and enemies? It is absolutely essential, in the present state of Australian industries and the labour market, and in the interests of the whole of the people, that drastic measures should be adopted. </para>

If honorable members knew the uphill task which we in the Labour party had to face on behalf of Protection during the past seven years, they would give us credit for the distinct advance in that direction that there has been. At Maryborough, in 1913, the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> for the first time in the history of the Labour party, made the policy of Protection one of the chief planks in the platform ; and that was only as the result of continued agitation against great odds. In 1914, that declaration of policy was repeated; and then we had a kind of Tariff schedule laid on the table, </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Dampier, in the course of his remarks, endeavoured to make us believe that the primary producer receives no benefit from the policy of Protection.- I do not know whether that honorable member represents many producers, but I do not think he would find any number of his constituents to accept such a doctrine. We are all agreed, I think, that our cities are too large, containing, as they do, about one half of our total population ; and for this, the better wages, and other attractions of city life, are held responsible. T am a country boy myself, and, if I had my choice, I should go &#34;back to the country, for I regard the life as the freest, best, and healthiest. I remember, however, that when I finished my apprenticeship, and was thinking of getting married, I found that my employer offered me no more than 35s. per week - having the idea of taking two boys on in my place; and this, of course, forced me to find better terms elsewhere. Similar conditions met the budding journeyman, whether he was a blacksmith, a wheelwright, or a printer, though at the present time, with our Wages Boards, things are a little better. This accounts largely for the continual flocking of the sons of farmers and other country residents to the city. At the same time, the honorable member for Dampier surely does not suggest that every son of a farmer should follow his father&#39;s occupation ? Boys are fitted for varying careers, and I feel certain that, if I were to go to the Newport railway shops, an agricultural implement factory, or any other place of business of the kind, I could find a great show of hands by those who had originally come from the country. The man who grows wheat, barley, maize, oats, or any other crop, is no more a producer than is the working man at Sunshine or any other place where agricultural implements and other machinery are turned out. The workman in the factory is as much a producer as the man on the land, and, thanks to our mechanical inventors, two men can now do the work on a farm where twelve were necessary thirty or forty years ago. Further, what better customers has the man on the land than are furnished in those engaged in the factories in our populous centres ? There men and women earn good wages, and are able to buy produce freely, and this interdependence renders it folly to say that the farmer reaps no benefit from Protection. Even with the limited Protection we now have, the man on the land enjoys very tangible advantages, and he would be much better off if the Protection were increased. But there are other ways by which the industries of the country can be assisted. Without divulging any secrets, I may say that, at a certain gathering of parliamentarians, when we were told that we would have to be very careful how we handled the Tariff, the question was asked whether that applied to every effort that might be made in other ways to help the producer or manufacturer - whether there were not other ways in which assistance could be given; we were then told that assistance could be given in the shape of bonuses and by other means, but nothing has been done. By way of illustration of how help may be rendered to the development of industries, and thus provide employment, I may say that in the Old Country considerable attention has been given by experts to the treatment of coal. The coal of Australia is just like the coal obtained elsewhere, and in it th&#39;ere are quite a number of elements which are of considerable commercial value, but which, unfortunately, are lost under present conditions. The test of the gas supplied by the gas companies, both in England and here, has hitherto been that of illuminating quality. But that test is now not so necessary, in view of the introduction of the incandescent mantle; and in Great Britain an Act has been passed altering the test to that of calorific or heat value. This means that, without in any way interfering with the quality of the gas supplied, much less coal is required, and certain important elements of the coal are saved. One of these elements or products is known as benzol, which, I understand, is equivalent to benzine, gasolene, or petrol, and it is used for the propulsion of vehicles. One gas company in London has, by means of this alteration, used 65,000 tons less of coal in two months than under the old system. The Government have power to take what action they please under the War Precautions Act, and I understand that engineers connected with our gas companies are prepared to make a similar change if they are permitted to do so. In view of the high price of petrol, it would be well to do something in this direction, and it is said that the Defence Department is making some efforts, though, I am afraid, only in a  tiddly-winking sort of way. There are many other means by which the Government could lend their aid towards the creation of new industries and increased avenues of employment in various directions. For instance, it seems a scandal that we have to import one ounce of cement when we have mountains of the very best necessary material in this country. Yet we are importing cement to the value of &#163;270,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad the honorable member made that interjection. The honorable member for Dampier spoke of how the slowing down policy was crippling the steel industry in New South Wales. In refutation of that statement, we have the sworn testimony of on&#169; of the largest employers of labour in this country. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat,</inline> the general manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. He was questioned in regard to the adaptability of Australian workmen in connexion with the establishment of steel works, and he said, on oath, &#34; We do require a few men who are experts at the trade, but, generally, the ordinary intelligent working man such as we find in Australia can do the work, and I say of the Australian that lie is one of the best and most adaptable workmen in the world.&#34; The man who used those words is one of our biggest captains of industry, and he. speaks from a wealth of experience. I would refer the honorable member for Echuca to the testimony also of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria. The gentlemen who comprise that council are graziers and farmers, and, according to a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning, the council had had certain work carried out by contract, and some by day labour. Asphalting was done under the contract system for ls. Sd. per square yard, and by day labour for ls. 3d. per square yard. That is the experience and testimony of some of the most conservative men in the community. We contend that, with proper guidance by the employer or overseer, day labour beats contract every time. Evidence in support of that view is overwhelming. Recent experience in the Old Country has provided another proof of the efficiency of Australian workmen. I have indisputable testimony that Australian fitters and others who went to England to engage in war work are carrying out in seven hours certain operations in connexion with the manufacture of guns that used to occupy the English workmen eleven hours. Yet these are the men who, honorable members allege, are slowing down. Men who come to Australia from America acknowledge that the pace of the Australian workman is too hot for them. Far be it from us in Australia to do as they are doing in certain parts of America, where men are being killed outright at their occupations. According to the finding of a medical commission which investigated industrial conditions in the United States of America, these are the four stages of ill-health through which the workmen pass: - First, fatigue; secondly, colds; thirdly, tuberculosis; and finally, death. At thirty-five and forty years of age, men are too old and broken in health to be further employed by the large employers of labour. </para>

                    <para>The Prime Minister ridiculed my proposal for the establishment of steel works in Australia. We are in this lamentable position, that, if anything went wrong with some of the steel plates of the vessels that defend our shores, we have not in the Commonwealth mills that can roll out a plate. We talk about the setting up of workshops of our own for naval repairs, but we have not a mill capable of rolling a steel plate. I admit that, at Newcastle and Lithgow, steel rails are being produced, but that is only one small department of steel work. The steel industry must be extended, and Tariff or no Tariff, if private enterprise will not develop the valuable iron ore deposits of Australia, the Commonwealth &#39;Government should proceed to do so. If the recommendation of the Public Works Committee had been adopted, the Government would be to-day manufacturing all its own cement, and would have been saving <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> or &#163;2 per ton. </para>
                    <para>Here is another important point : The honorable member for Lang stated that we are protected to a certain extent by reason of the seas not being free, because those foreign vessels which brought large quantities of goods to Australia are not coming to our ports to-day. That is true. But, although the competition of Germany has been shut out, goods are entering the Commonwealth from another country. During the war, there have been established certain new industries, but their outlook is by no means assured, and when the war is over they will be again left to the tender mercy of the importer. What encouragement are we giving the chemists and other experts to engage in research so that we may manufacture in Australia articles which were previously imported from abroad <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Some people have done well in new industries since th&#169; outbreak of war, with but very little encouragement from the Government and this Parliament. We cannot continue this policy of procrastination. We must not be afraid of obstacles or other circumstances which we know exist. It is the bounden duty of this. Parliament to stand by the people who are &#39; establishing new industries to see that their enterprises are not brought to a standstill as soon as the war is over, and the old channels of trade reopened. Every other country that is at war has made preparations for post-war trade; Australia is only starting to do so. For over twelve months we have had&#39; in existence a Bureau of Science that was supposed to render a great deal of assistance to the industries of this country : but, beyond issuing a few glowing reports in flowery language, nothing has been done. Parliament should set itself the task of mobilizing the best intellect of the country. Our chemists and mechanics ought to be mobilized, and the Commonwealth ought to establish a staff of chemists to conduct research work for the assistance of industry. Germany has thousands of chemists engaged in assisting every industry - not only chemists who are giving assistance to the workmen at the benches and at the lathes, but experts who are engaged in the laboratories in research work. Before Germany was able to turn out an aniline dye fit for the markets of the world, chemists were investigating for twenty-six years. The result was that, before the war, .Germany had practically a monopoly of the dye trade of the world. What investigations are we carrying out? With the raw material for many industries at our feet, our chemists are doing nothing, and they are receiving no encouragement from the Bureau of Science, the Government, or Parliament. One of the first steps that should have been taken when war broke out was the organization of our chemists, and <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> setting of them at work in investigating means for establishing and improving our industries. </para>
                    <para>We hear a good deal of talk to-day about the importation of luxuries. I shall read to the House a few paragraphs from an article on &#34; Industry and Finance &#34; in the December number of <inline font-style="italic">The Bound</inline><inline font-style="italic">Table.</inline> In the first portion of the article dealing with &#34; The higher direction of British industry,&#34; the writer says - </para>

They reduce <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">tanto</inline> the wealth available for spending on productive  efforts,  and they demoralize that part of the population whose lives are spent purely in ministering to the useless pleasures of the rich. </para>

                    <para class="block">That form of wastefulness is in evidence in Australia, and the Government ought to take steps to prevent luxuries being imported. I do not like the idea of the Prime Minister taking action through the medium of regulations under the War Precautions Act, By a few words  in this Bill, he could achieve all that we desire for the time being. <inline font-style="italic">The Bound Table</inline> article deals with the relations between employer and employee, and also the assistance rendered by the banking institutions to industry. Although Australian banks have assisted industries to a certain extent, that assistance has not been given to anything like the degree that is necessary. One reason why Germany was able to penetrate the markets of the whole world was that her commercial agents were always preceded by the assistance of the banking institutions. We must go further in that direction, and the banks must be prepared to risk something, not only for their own interests, but also for the interests of the nation.

                        <para>A third defect is the lack of co-ordination between industry and research. The work of research, much neglected in this country, can no longer be carried out in a haphazard and unmethodical way. Modern industry is founded on natural science, and its application to the material world. There may be a,  time  far distant when we shall have found out nil that we can about nature. But to-day that is far away. To-day we are in an age of incessant scientific discovery, and the increased production of wealth and our power of competition depends on the application of all this knowledge, both in small and great things, to industry. Wherever wo look, whether it is in the VaSt development of electricity, not only for the ordinary purposes of lighting and power, but in the refining and production of metals or products such as nitrate from air, or the development of chemistry and its universal application to industry and agriculture, or to the vast economics possible in the proper utilization of our coal resources,- or whether we consider the development of the internal combustion engine, everywhere we. see grunt progress. If we are to live in competition with other nations, we must keep ourselves abreast of them, not only- in actual knowledge, but in its practicable application to industry. </para>

The Acting Prime Minister said that something more would be done. Promises were plentiful, but there has been no performance. Looking at Australian conditions, not only during the continuance of this awful conflict, but also in the period to follow the declaration of peace, one cannot regard the prospect as other than gloomy. We have wonderful advantages, and a country that contains everything necessary to make our people happy and prosperous, and full of employment and industry; yet, with 300,000 men absent from Australia, there are thousands of men unemployed throughout the Commonwealth. This is a disgrace to us as a people, and we shall be reproached by all other parts of the civilized world if, after the war, this country, still almost virgin of industries, is crowded with unemployed. Are our soldiers, when they return, to swell the army of the unemployed ? God forbid ! We must bestir ourselves. We can do something. The Tariff should not pass beyond the consideration of this Chamber until the definite promise has been made by the Government that in this hour of the nation&#39;s need something shall be done to encourage industry, and to find employment for our people. To-day the products of foreign countries are flowing in through our ports, and finding their way to the shelves of the emporiums with which our people do business. Particularly in the drapers&#39;shops are foreign goods to be met, and one of the main difficulties of my women-folk is to ascertain the countries of origin of the stock offered to them. Some persons, through not being careful enough in their investigations, have brought home goods made with the blood and sweat of little children, who live in compounds, herded together like sheep and receive only a few pence a day. I hope that the Government will rise from its lethargy, and do something for Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- It would have been amusing, had it not. been so grotesque, to hear yesterday afternoon the remarks which fell from the lips of several honorable members who spoke from the other side of the chamber; the bid for the high Protectionist vote and for the support of a certain well-known newspaper was so palpable that it could not escape notice. Something of the same sort occurred just before the last election, and the price that was paid for support by a certain section of candidates was that they pledged themselves to high protective duties. That promise had a marvellous effect, so far as Victoria was concerned. The party which offered what seemed to be wanted was returned with an overwhelming majority. It had such strength in both branches of the Legislature that it could do anything it liked, and was, therefore, under the obligation to fulfil the pledge by which it secured election. Therefore, shortly after the new Parliament met, an amending Tariff schedule was introduced, which increased the rates of duty on a large number of items. Those who think that the salvation of the country depends on a high Tariff were inclined to sling their hats into the air as if the millennium of prosperity was about to dawn. The amending schedule that I speak of, though it has not received the ratification of Parliament, has been in operation ever since it was introduced. Has it had the effect of benefiting local industries ? It is the Tariff which was introduced by those who are now clamouring for higher protective duties. According to the honorable member for Maribyrnong, high duties will multiply the number of industries existing in our midst. All of us, I suppose, would be inclined to support anything that we thought would do that. But what are the facts <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I shall mention industries which have been injured by the operation of the present Tariff schedule. In the vicinity of Geelong is a large sawmilling establishment which, under the old Tariff, was a prosperous concern. Work was given there to a large number of persons, who were engaged in operating a valuable plant for sawing up logs imported from abroad. At that time timber in the rough was admitted free, but the new Tariff imposed an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 5 per cent., with the result that logs are not now imported. The plant that I speak of is lying idle, and the men who used to operate it have been thrown out of employment. </para>

                            <para>- Under the old Tariff the raw material used by soap makers was free. Ground-nut and soya bean oil is still admitted free from the United Kingdom, but under the Tariff schedule is dutiable at the rate of 3d. per gallon, if imported from other countries. As this oil does not come -from the United Kingdom, the whole importation has to pay duty. The man who clamours for high duties on everything has no conception of the real meaning of Protection. The soap making industry has been further interfered with by the duty of1d. per gallon on whale oil. If whale oil came from the United Kingdom, it could be imported free, but none of it comes from there, and consequently all of it has to pay duty amounting to &#163;1 per ton. This has actually led to the closing down of some departments of soap production. Is it in the interests of the country that duties should be imposed which injure industries? Some honorable members seem to think that we should be satisfied whatever duties may be imposed, so long as they are high. They are not prepared to give serious consideration to the scientific adjustment of duties, forgetting that the finished product of one manufacture is the raw material of another. </para>

                            <para>- No. The referring of the Tariff to the Inter-State Commission was a step in the right direction, but I am afraid that the Commission&#39;s recommendations will not be seriously regarded when the House comes to deal with the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- I hope so. It was stated yesterday that the balance of trade is altogether on the wrong side, so far as this year&#39;s business is concerned, our imports exceeding our exports by more than &#163;12,000,000. We are not justified in accepting those figures without considering the surrounding circumstances. We have had seasons of unparalleled prosperity, and if we could have realized the full value of our wheat and wool, instead of being to the bad, we would probably have been &#163;12,000,000 or &#163;20,000,000 to the good. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Some persons say that importation should be prohibited. But what would be the result of that ? The vessels that came here would have to come in ballast, and consequently the produce that we sent away would have to pay higher rates of freight than are charged now. Some advocate the policy of not trading with other people. But we must trade with other people. The true principle should be to produce what we can produce to the best advantage, and supply it to other people, receiving in return what they can produce to so much better advantage. In that way there will be mutual gains to both parties to the trading. There is an agitation on foot at the present time to prohibit the importation of motor cars, which are now coming from America, whereas formerly they came from France, Great Britain, and other countries, as well as America. The motor car is no longer a luxury. We will need to depend on better means of transport if we hope to  develop central Australia, and motor cars will be of great assistance in that respect, not the light vehicles that one sees about the city streets, but cars designed for the practical average work of the inland producers. If we prohibit the importation of these vehicles we make it more difficult for our producers to succeed. The honorable member for Maribyrnong considers it a shame that we are not able to produce steel plates, but is it not known to every one that the steel works we have already in Australia were held up by the recent coal strike? Steel works depend on a steady supply of coal, but those who &#34;rule the roost&#34; in the coal mines, not the miners themselves, but those who beguile the miners, and are paid handsomely to provoke strikes, have created a feeling of unrest in the minds of the actual workers, so that on the slightest provocation it is a case of &#34; down tools.&#34; It is said that we are not holding our own as against Canada, and the statement is perfectly true. I had the privilege and pleasure of passing through Canada recently, and I was simply astonished when visiting the hives of industries there and comparing them with the condition of things in Australia. No Tariff will be high enough to enable us to cope with the labour conditions here, because the very fact of having a high Tariff in operation is used as justification for still further labour demands. </para>

                            <para>- The fact that the farmers&#39; sons are deserting them and going to the cities shows the fallacy of a high Protective policy ; because it induces men to leave the work that they would legitimately take up as sons of farmers. The rates of pay, the hours of labour, and the conditions of city life which attract men away from rural pursuits induce them to desert the very thing that should make for our national prosperity. Surely it would be more rational for us to so frame a Tariff that the inducement would be for men to go on the land rather than come to the cities. I agree that our industries are stagnant, but I would have my friends look to something else than the Tariff for their &#39;salvation. I know that if my friends come into power after the elections, they will be no more in earnest in the matter than they have been during the past couple of years. </para>

                            <para>- The fact of the matter is that we are building up industrial conditions that will render it absolutely impossible for Australia to manufacture anything for export. Canada is manufacturing for export. In Australia wo have better natural conditions than Canada possesses, and we should be able to manufacture for export, but we cannot do it under the artificial conditions that have been created. A high Tariff is made the basis of an argument for increased pay. It increases the cost of living, and that increase is made the ground of a demand for increased pay. So we are going up the ladder, higher and higher, and our conditions will finally be so artificial here that workers will not be able to live in Australia. The &#39; appeal of the thousand  carpenters to be allowed to go abroad, and work in other lands, because they cannot find employment here is a beautiful example of the condition to which the Labour party have brought Australia. They were going to make Australia a paradise for the working man, but to-day we find that working men are being driven from our shores. </para>

                            <para>- I seek to show that the Tariff for which the honorable member is clamouring will work for our undoing, and not our uplifting. The honorable member for Maribyrnong told us that the Council of Agriculture had employed certain men to do some work, and that they had done it for so much less than a similar portion cost under contract conditions. If that be true, the Council of Agriculture, of which the honorable member is a member, was not safeguarding the interests of those they represent when they made the contract. Let me quote a higher authority than this Council of Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon, of New South Wales, who recently heard a case in connexion with the electrical trades, and made the statement that under piece-work the men did twenty times as much work as was done under the day-labour system. </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible for us to make this country prosperous under a high Protective Tariff. A Protective duty is helpful only if it is applied wisely and properly, but this mad rush for higher and higher and still higher duties, with the simple intention of basing on them claims for still more artificial labour conditions, is killing our Australian indus tries, undermining that sense of self-respect that should animate the workers of any community, and is more and more teaching people to look to the Government for sustenance. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Of what use is a protective policy to the mining industry? And yet the miners keep on making demands for improved labour conditions and shorter hours, the result being that every doubtful proposition is closed down, and they lose employment. This principle, which has been adopted in regard to the mining industry, has been applied also to other industries. I venture to suggest that, no matter how wisely conceived our Tariff may be - no matter how nearly it may be in consonance with protective ideals - it must in itself absolutely fail unless it is based on common-sense conditions. </para>

                            <para>- In some cases it might be possible under our protective policy to increase duties with advantage ; but a start must be made at the very base. A beginning must be made with the raw material, which, if it cannot be produced here, should be allowed to come in free. Then, as it spreads out into the various ramifications Of trade, we should give a protective duty to such of our industries as should be protected under our policy. But it is absurd to ruthlessly submit a Tariff, as this was submitted by the honorable member for Yarra, and to claim that it is a truly protective one, and such as will assist the industries of this land. I am astonished that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> should have been satisfied with this schedule. Judging by its leading article to-day, I do not think it is. </para>

Many of my honorable friends opposite have that judgment, but because of the force of circumstances surrounding them - the compelling influence of the junta, by which they are controlled, as well as the influence of the great newspaper which is capable of settling certain elections - they are bound to advocate a policy that is contrary to their own sense of justice and right. </para>

                    <para>Instead of always abusing the workers it would be better for honorable members to devise some twentieth century method of securing for them better economic conditions. We hear the workingmen spoken of as &#34; slow-downers.&#34; Where should we be if it were not for them ? We should be well on our way to the destitute asylum. A few months ago the coal miners refused to hew coal, and there was a universal execration of them. People who were in the habit of denouncing workingmen began to discover that, after all, the workingman is very useful. Why should those to whom every day is a day of sunshine and hope be always abusing the poor workingman. Seventeen years ago, when I was in Tasmania putting men on the rolls, for the first Federal election, I met a man in the early morning going to his work. He looked sick and sad, and in reply to my inquiry, said that he was very bad. &#34;Then why go to work?&#34; said I.  His  answer was, &#34; I must; if I do not work my family will starve.&#34; I mention this in order to show how hopeless is the position of such men. The honorable member for Echuca has lived, so to speak, in a cave for the greater part of his life. He has been in the world, but has not understood it. He has lived in the back blocks, and wealth has been poured into his pockets. Managing to secure a little monopoly, he became independent, and to-day he denounces the poor workingman. He has had a lot to say this afternoon about the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> Years ago, when I travelled with him on the same train, if the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> criticised him a little he trembled like Alexander&#39;s butler when the sun shone. </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall not blame the honorable member for Echuca for the stand that he takes up. The trouble is that to all intents and purposes there is no national sentiment in Australia. People in Australia talk like foreigners. They curse the Germans, but it cannot be denied that the Germans are patriotic. Travelling on the mail steamers &#34;between Victoria and Western Australia, one hears wealthy people cursing Australia - denouncing the country that gave them their wealth. I have sat at the same table with such people, and have heard them curse Australia as they left it. Quite recently I have been hunting round for a copy of the Australian National Anthem. I found that no one had. heard of such a thing. To-day I obtained from Cole&#39;s Book Arcade a copy of the &#34; Australian National Song.&#34; I do not know whether it is the Australian National Anthem. One never hears any one singing such an anthem here. And yet they tell me I am a foreigner! When I was in Tasmania recently quite a number of the boys said that they wanted to be represented by natives who understood Australia, and not by foreigners. I am not a foreigner, but an Australian. I got my bit, such as it is, here, and I am an Australian taxpayer. It would be well for Australia if we were to cultivate a truly Australian sentiment, and sing Australian songs. What could be grander than these lines from the &#34; Australian National Song &#34; - words by Arthur H. Adams, music by Theodore Tourrier - </para>

                    <para class="block">The men who went to Gallipoli, Pozieres, and the French frontier have proved to the world that there is an Australia. How are we to have Australian industries unless we have a Tariff? The <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> has told us lately, in a series of letters, that in Japan people are paid 5d. a day, and live in compounds, with 21/2d. for their tucker and 21/2d. for their clothes. How can Australians defend themselves against the products of such labour if we do not have Protection? How can Australia become rich if she is only a primary producer? If a man has a forest, and sells raw timber, he gets very little for it; but if, by genius and skill, he transforms the timber into baskets, chairs, and other necessaries for the people, he will make a fortune. Yet it is said that we ought to have Free Trade. The Tariff ought to be revised at once. Why have we not revised it? Because we could not. </para>

                            <para>- Even he failed to get salvation 1 Are we to wait until after the war to revise the Tariff? Are we going to allow -this country to be filled with the dumpings of all the world? That is what it will come to. In all the warring countries there is the best and most up-to-date scientific machinery; in fact, when the war is over, Great Britain will be one of the first industrial countries of the earth. America is already so, Japan is already so, and Germany and Austria will be. If we have the courage now to frame a real, one-column Tariff - and I do not say we have not tried or that there are not honorable members opposite who fed in the same way - we shall be in a position, after the war, to say to all lie nations of the earth, &#34;Reciprocity.&#34; We Shall have something to sell - we shall have a valuable market to exchange. But if, after the war, wo start to impose a Tariff, there will be so many divisions, so many columns, and so many preferences that our little industries will not be able to compete with &#39;those of other countries. In the little State of &#39;Tasmania, nearly all the factories had virtually to close in fiscally fighting only the mainland; and that was simply because the Tasmanian manufacturers were financially Weak, as compared with those of the other States. Great Britain was the greatest Protection- &#39; ist nation on the earth for years, until she had built up her great industries,, and had millions of money invested. Then, when she had built up her mighty industries, and was able to manufacture . for the world, she started to become gradually Free Trade. She sold kil the world goods; but soon the world outside began to use Protection against her .; and when the war broke- out, she was no longer the greatest manufacturing power in the world. It was America that held! that position, and yet America has been built up by Protection, as it was Pro&#39;tection that built up Germany and made that country rich. For two &#39;years and a half Germany has been financing the war out of the money, credits, and wealth she gathered from the world by means of Protection. France was another Protectionist country, and is in a similar position, Britain was supposed to be a Free Trade country. Free trade, on account of  her  wonderful banking system, was better <inline font-style="italic">fox</inline> Britain than Protection, in  the  sense  that  we desire it. Britain was a creditor  country,  and the banker of the world. London was the chief exchange city of the world for years. More exchange  was written  in sterling there than in all  the  other money denominations of the world prior to the war; but, at present, more  is  written in dollars. When the war is over, if Britain enters into a nonsensical trade war, she will never be the financial centre of the world again; if she does not, the financial centre of the world must go back to her.

                            <para>- No ; it does not need Protection. It will be through her wonderful organization of &#39; banking, and .of acceptance houses.  Just  think  of  it!   In 1907, Britain was operating the finances of the world on &#163;120,000,000  in  gold. The United States had nearly &#163;400,000,000 in gold, and yet many  of  her banks closed their doors. Why ? Because she had no great organization like Britain. Why is  it  that America can never become the financial centre of the world ? Because there is no speculation going on in America, except in American securities,. On the other hand, you may go to Britain and speculate in any securities, almost those of  Mars.  That is because Britain has her bill houses, her acceptance houses, and her foreign exchanges. A Chinese merchant has tea, and a business man in Australia requires tea. The business man goes to his banker in Australia, and the banker finances him. The Chinese merchant does not know the business man, but he knows the acceptance house in London, and through it he sends the goods, the acceptance house becoming responsible to him for the money of the Australian. This organization is lacking in every country except Great Britain. I could easily see there were no financial men at the Paris Conference - no men who had the slightest idea of finance- when the representatives talked about having a trade war. If Great Britain has a trade war, then she will go through a neutral country to other countries, and those other countries will reach her in the same way. You cannot stop trade. Why did London become the great financial centre? </para>

                            <para>- It is because the business men of London stand out pre-eminently in the eyes of the world. When Thomas Edison was being entertained by the merchants of Berlin, he was asked who stood highest in his opinion in the world as business men, and he declared that Englishmen did. The financial organization in England has, moreover, made money cheap. The banker in Australia can lend all his money at high rates, whereas the London men cannot. One of the reasons why I battled for years for a Commonwealth Bank and a note issue was that every time the rate of interest rose in London, Australian bankers sent millions there on call loan,  and left Australian producers and traders without the necessary money to finance their obligations. What will be our position if we allow ourselves, as the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> says this morning, to go to the bad at the rate of &#163;27,000,000 a year?

                            <para>- Did I not kick up enough &#34; music &#34; about it before I left office? The withdrawal by the war of 300,000 men from the productive industries of Australia means a loss of &#163;38,000,000 worth of products every year. Every time we withdraw a certain number of men from productive industries we must throw out of work the men who handle their products. It is a tremendous mistake to think that men can be withdrawn from the farms without serious consequences to the rest of the community. There are farms in my electorate from which all the boys have gone, and the old gentlemen and the daughters are trying to do the work. </para>

                            <para>- Those men cannot be on the Labour side. I am talking of the Christians I visit. The lessening of production by &#163;38,000,000 must result in the throwing of men out of work. When travelling as an insurance agent, I found, to my sorrow, that only about sixty-five men in a hundred could pass the doctor. Will the 35 per cent. who failed to pass the insurance doctor be more successful with the military doctor? </para>

I looked at his pocket, and then I looked at his eyes, and always knew how his internal arrangements were. The honorable member for Yarra has spoken as Leader of the Opposition, but, speaking for myself, I say that we on this side should not rest until we get a Tariff that will make this country independent of the world. If we desire to deal with other countries, we should give Great Britain the preference, and other countries reciprocity, but an Australian Tariff we must have. There is nothing that Australia cannot produce. It. has every sort of climate. Those who are not healthy and happy can go to Tasmania, which is a healthy, hopeful country, and those who do not like Tasmania can come to Melbourne to get into the wind storms. </para>

If that discovery proves to be a success, motor cars will be so cheap that the Government will not be doing right in&#39; depriving the people living in the Australian interior of the opportunity to meet each other.

I have read that motor cars are sold in America to the trade at &#163;49 each. The utilization of motor cars enabled the French to drive the Germans across the Marne. If the French command had not been able to transport troops from Paris to the Marne in a few hours the Germans would have been in Paris. </para>

                    <para>I wish to read what Professor Anderson, of Harvard University, wrote in regard to the labour question. My experience is that if you meet and talk with men they will always meet you on reasonable conditions. There were strikes enough on the trans-Australian&#39; railway, and the men complained to me about their tucker-shops. Their complaint was just, and I immediately ordered the officials to put the tucker-shops in repair, and conduct them departmentally. They charged up the &#163;600 worth of repairs to the cost of the first week&#39;s running of the establishment, in the same way as &#163;60,000 was charged up for the expenses in connexion with the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. I have been reading in the press constantly that the tucker-shops lost &#163;600 in a short period, and in the same way it was said that the Commonwealth Bank had lost &#163;60,000 in the first year. If the men at the head of the railway had been good business men, they could have operated the tucker-shops at a good profit by charging 25s. per week. I know ladies who are doing well in Melbourne by charging only 18s . per week. </para>
                    <para>My name will live in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank when many are dead and forgotten. The Tariff is part and parcel of the industrial life of Australia. This is what Professor Anderson says - </para>
                    <para>The question of industrial warfare and the great losses entailed by strikes and lockouts is indeed fundamental. Employers are often lacking in apprehension of the right relation between employer and employee.  If  the employers were to consider the employees from the view-point of their requirements  as  human beings - that is, men under the obligation in general to continue the work of the country through their children, who require to be wellborn, well-reared, and well-educated - they might find themselves in agreement with the demands of the employees as to the living wage. </para>
                    <para>There were, doubtless, few instances among the numberless strikes which totalled appalling losses in which the employees demanded more wages than would afford them even limited opportunity to advance the true well-being of their children and families- a well-being essential to the country&#39;s future. </para>

                        <para>Modern industry rests on the law of supply and demand, and, therefore, proceeds on the wrong assumption, namely, that the necessary labour and men and women should be paid for on the basis of the same law of supply and demand that determines for the product of labour. </para>

                        <para>The dominating public opinion of the Commonwealth is at last becoming enlightened as to the fundamental wrong of putting human labour and the material products of labour in the same classification as articles of barter and sale. This issue goes deeper and broader than  we  can realize.  We  know its complexity, but it must be solved. Strikes may be stated as the recurring protest by producers of the country&#39;s wealth against the results to them of the various methods of distributing the product which modern civilization has developed to so high a degree. These methods of division include all business steps, from transportation to banking.  I  am profoundly confident that the workers&#39; hopes lie in the success of justice. - The rights of the producers of wealth must, as a matter of course, come before the claims of those who, controlling the distribution of the product in its multiform equations, not only fix their own salaries in the form of profits, commissions, and foes, but purpose to continue to fix the wages of the industrial producers by individual contracts. If the employers gave more attention to what is necessary for the decent living of the employees, there would be more happiness and less trouble. </para>

                    <para>Harvard was founded in the early colonial days of America, and has always been known as the home  of  the&#34;boodleier &#39; &#39; ; yet its Professor  of  Economics had the courage  to  state his opinions in the words I have read. If the employers  did  not always take the stand that, because they have the management of business affairs, they should not condescend to meet their men, but discussed differences with their employees, there would be hardly any strikes. How many strikes were there while I was in charge of the transcontinental railway? During the thirteen months before I became Minister there were sixty-one strikes. Yet how many concessions  did  I grant? Very few. I allowed the men to hear the other side, and, generally, they were satisfied when they had done so. That is the way  in  which men should be treated. They should not be abused and condemned by those who have plenty of money, because they will not  do  this or that. A working man with a family growing up sees no hope for them. God help him, say I. </para>

                            <para>- The interest bill to  be  paid this year on the indebtedness of the Commonwealth, the  States,  and the municipal bodies of Australia is &#163;26,900,000, and the Commonwealth will have to find &#163;12,050,400 for interest and soldiers&#39; pensions this year before meeting any  of  the ordinary expenses of government. Is it any wonder that we find in Holy Writ that the wicked fleeth where no man dares to follow ? Men have come into this House pledged  to  the hilt to  a  Protective Tariff, yet Australia  is  the dumping ground for the foreign producer. A tariff should be arranged scientifically  so  that the protection should be based  on  the difference between the high cost of Australian labour that gives the Australian working man the chance of bringing up his family in decency, and not under conditions  of  hunger and starvation and the cost of cheap labour outside. To claim that the cost of transportation is sufficient defence is useless. It is no defence nowadays. The Government should realize what  a  mighty country we have walled  in, as  it is,  by  great oceans, but it can only grow when its people have a love for it. We do not hear Australians singing Australian songs. The children in our schools do not sing about Australia as American children sing <inline font-style="italic">The Star Spangled Banner.</inline> An American may be abusive  of  many things, but he never abuses his country. He may curse labour. He always praises the nation, though  he  may curse  Gompers,  who,  by  the way,  is an  Englishman. It is wonderful how these Englishmen go  to all  parts  of the  earth and run it. We need an economic declaration  of  independence. We  want  to see this country develop and be great like ancient Greece, this country which has produced the Torrens Land Act and the secret ballot. There has not  been such secrecy  lately, but that does  no  matter. There  is  hope. The Lord  has  said, &#34; The wicked shall not prosper.&#34; &#93; wish to call the attention  of  Australian! to their own music. Here is another Australian song - </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to waste the time of the House as it is being wasted. The attitude taken up by honorable members of the Opposition in regard to the Tariff is quite untenable, and no one knows it better than they do. &#39; They know very well that the delicate balance of the nations is such that any untoward event or presumptive action on the part of any Ally at this juncture might have very far-reaching effects. Therefore, all this talk about the necessity for an immediate revision of the Tariff is so much hot air. For one thing, time will not permit of an immediate revision of the Tariff, but, altogether apart from that point, the circumstances are such that any attempt to touch the Tariff just now would be most unwise. Honorable members opposite know this full well, hence it is only right that the country or, at any rate, those who read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> should know that all the talk that is now being put up in the House is merely an electioneering placard. The grandiloquent language of honorable members, and the spread-eagleism  of the honorable member for Darwin, will not get us any further forward in Australian affairs. If honorable members were really honest in their protestations they would fall into line with what has been done on this side of the House, and would get their representations heard in the proper quarter. By actual contact with those on the other side of the world they would know just what it is possible for us to do at the present time. We know that we cannot act independently. The talk of some honorable members reminds, me of the attitude of the children of rich parents who, being secure in their positions for the time being, by reason of parental provision, can be impudent to all the world. These arrogant fools - I do not know that I should use those words, but certainly some honorable members are behaving as if we were not a country that is absolutely dependent on the strength of our paternal protector. It is our paternal protector who has made it possible for us to go as far as we have gone and to be as independent as we are, and no. one knows better than honorable members opposite the extent to which they have exhausted all the possibilities of the liberties which we enjoy in this country. When they talk about flouting the advice which has been given from the highest sources, and about erecting a high Tariff barricade, they are simply courting disaster. When they reflect upon the actions of a Government which has recently gone out of office they are obviously reflecting upon some members of their own party. They know that perfectly well the Leader of the Opposition was largely responsible for the conduct of the Hughes Government. He was Minister for Trade and Customs in the first two Labour Governments that held office during the currency of the war, and no one knows better than he does the difficulties that stand in the way of interfering with the Tariff. I do not know that the honorable member for Yarra has been urging the revision of the Tariff at this particular time, but his followers have been urging it, and, therefore, they are reflecting on their own leader, or else the honorable member has lost the wisdom that he displayed on this side of the House by the change that has taken place. The only way in which we can get any satisfaction on Tariff matters - and all but those who are wilfully blind  can see it - is by participating in the Empire Conference that is now about to take place. If the view is accepted - which is unescapable - that we are simply part of an Empire which is now struggling - perhaps to its death - the only hope we have of getting any terms for Australia is by participating in the Conference, realizing the exact situation, and doing what is best for all parties in the struggle. We cannot stand alone. If we could we would be ungrateful, and to stand alone would be outrageous conduct on our part in view of our past history. But it is useless to say that we can stand alone. We cannot do so. If honorable members who have been elected to this House do not realize the situation it is a reflection, not only upon them, but also upon the community. No one knows better than honorable members how utterly dependent we are on the success of the Empire in the gigantic struggle that is now in progress, and all that we can gain is what may be obtained by participating in the negotiations that are now in progress at Home. But all this has been made impossible by honorable members opposite. I would go so far as to say that even now if they would nominate a representative he should be sent Home with the delegates already chosen. However, that matter is not under discussion now.. They have not been satisfied to take a constitutional course. They have not been satisfied to sink party differences and take a hand as true Australians in doing the only thing that it is now possible for us to do. They have neglected the constitutional method. They have spurned it; and yet they have the presumption to charge the Government in this House with not attending to the Tariff. They charge the Government with having failed to do what they know very well we dare not do. </para>

                            <para>- That is just the sort of remark I should expect from the honorable member. He has no sense of responsibility, no feeling of gratitude to the country which has made him possible, and afforded him an opportunity to utter all his follies. He should thank God for the opportunities he has enjoyed in this country. He should be thankful that he has been permitted to go on the rampage and talk at large, as he has done. A man who says, as the honorable member does, that we are at liberty to do what we please, in regard to the Tariff just now, in my opinion is not right in his thinking functions. It must be obvious to any man who can think consecutively that we are dependent on the rest of the Empire. We have flung ourselves into this war; we are, in fact, one of the Allies who have struck a deadly blow at the German Empire. We have been able to do that, for the most part, only because of the might of Great Britain, assisted by those other noble peoples who have spilled their blood in rivers so that the little nations of the earth may have a freedom such as we have so long enjoyed. In these circumstances, it is absurd for any honorable member to stand up here and assert that we are at liberty to do anything we please, regardless of whether or not it may hamper the operations of Great Britain or alienate the sympathy of the Allies, to say nothing of prejudicing our own country. Such a contention is not only absurd, but treacherous. </para>

                    <para>There are several phases of the Tariff issue which must be considered. No question has provoked more debate, or led to more protracted sittings in this House than has that of the Tariff. Prior to my coming here, some ten years ago, one of the longest sittings in parliamentary history took place in connexion with the Tariff then under consideration. This was due to the fact that a majority of the members recognised that industries were essential to Australia if we were to have a civilization of which we might be  proud. All over the world it is realized that a non-manufacturing nation cannot hope to reach that high state of civilization which should be the object of every country. In purely agricultural countries the people - I am speaking now, not of the owners of the land, but of those employed upon it - seem to be always in a very low state. </para>

                            <para>- I was speaking of their position from a financial standpoint. I have not a word to say against the rural population of this or any other country. It is a well-known fact, however, that purely agricultural countries, and there are several in Central Europe, are the poorest, whilst the manufacturing nations are the wealthiest. When the first Federal Tariff was under consideration the parties in this House were fairly evenly divided. The Protectionists, however, won over a few Free Traders who favoured the collection of certain taxation through the medium of the Customs House, and so succeeded in passing a sort of Tariff which had to be accepted. In 1907-8 the Tariff issue was again brought forward, and a great fight was put up. The duties imposed for the protection and encouragement of certain iron industries were retained on that occasion by the votes of two Free Traders - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilks,</inline> who then represented Dalley, and the present Prime Minister. They entered this House as Free Traders, and rarely gave any but a Free Trade vote ; but on that occasion they saved the iron industry of the Commonwealth. Since then almost the whole of the Free Traders in Parliament have shed, or have pretended to shed, their Free Trade skins. I use the word &#39; &#39; pretended &#34; advisedly. We have in this House, I believe, quite a number of Free Traders, and in some parts of Australia Free Trade may be regarded as the right policy for Australia to adopt. Unfortunately there has been a great division of opinion in regard to the particular form of Protection that should be selected. The question at issue has been whether we should adhere to the old form of Protection, under which only those who invest in industry are protected, or whether we should adopt New Protection under which the consumers and the workers are also protected. This diversity of opinion has prevented Australia from securing a higher Tariff than she enjoys to-day. New Protection is one of the planks in the Labour platform, and I believe it approaches more closely to the desires of the Free Traders than does the policy of the old Protection. The only argument that the Free Trader can advance against Protection is that the imposition of a duty on any commodity makes that commodity dearer to the consumer. If by a rational scheme of Protection we can protect both the consumer and the producer, I fail to see why Free Traders should take exception to it. The principle of the New Protection is now generally conceded. Some four years ago the Labour party, then in power, were condemned all over&#39; Australia for their failure to revise the Tariff. Higher duties had been imposed on a number of new commodities, but the Tariff in existence was, after all, of a patchwork character. At that time I had to defend the policy of the New Protection which had been adopted by our party. We repeatedly told the Protectionists of Australia that we would not bring in a comprehensive Tariff until we had the power to protect the consumer and the worker, as well as the manufacturer. </para>

The present leader of our party was then Minister for Trade and Customs, and was condemned by the Protectionists for his failure to bring in a Tariff imposing higher duties. As a responsible Minister he had to take that condemnation; if he did not like it, he ought to have resigned. Towards the end of the life of that Parliament <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> to my surprise, announced that he intended to throw over our ideas as to the New Protection, and that if, as the result of the then approaching election, we were returned to power, he would . bring forward a new Tariff providing for the old form of Protection, taking the chance of some future opportunity presenting itself to protect the consumer. </para>

                    <para>Since the passing of the 1908 Tariff no effort has been made to bring in such a schedule as would establish the true form of Protection. &#39; There are many reasons for this, and I propose to put one or two before the House. The present Parliament came into existence after the outbreak of war, and both parties avowedly supported Protection, despite the fact that both had a leavening of Free Traders. At the last general election the Labour party came back with a majority, but with the exception of a little bit of patchwork, which was good so far as it went, nothing has been done to establish a truly Protective Tariff. The amendments brought in by our present leader, who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, provided for certain increases, but the Tariff was full of anomalies in the sense that in many cases the duties imposed were not sufficiently Protective. At the close of this Parliament we are in practically the same position that we occupied in 1908. I shall not quote figures, but we know that the Tariff of 1908, to a large extent, built up industries in Australia, with the result that in 1910-11 our exports were considerably in excess of our imports. Since that time we have so gone to the bad that today our exports are about &#163;12,000,000 less in value than our imports. There is not an honorable member, not a thinking man or woman in Australia, whether Free Trader or Protectionist, but realizes that this cannot go on. We have to consider coolly and calmly what can be done to break down that wall which stands in the way of our doing what we know we ought to do from an industrial standpoint. This is a serious question for every honorable member, no matter what constituency he represents. Even the honorable member for Parkes, who is no doubt of the same opinion he was years ago, must admit there is something wrong when our imports far exceed our exports, and we are not producing gold to pay for the difference. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Parkes knows that a ton of wheat is not of equal value with a ton of manufactured articles. Of course, it is the argument of Free Traders that if we do not import goods we cannot send away our raw material - that if ships are brought here in ballast, the fact only adds to the cost of sending away our produce. Irrespective of the fact that there are millions of pounds&#39; worth of wheat and other commodities that cannot be exported because of the peculiar position in which we find ourselves to-day, it must be admitted that our exports have not increased in the same ratio that our imports have. If we can import tons of commodities, we ought to be able to export produce of equal value, for it is the value, and not the tonnage, that has to be considered. However, what is our position to-day ? We. are told that there are certain things we cannot do because of the present situation. That is said by the present Government, and was said by the preceding Government, and the Government before that. There is something in the air that prevents our moving. The interests of Australia are now intermixed with those of the Empire as never before. We are told that, in pre-war times, we were left by the Mother Land to carry out our own free will in regard to our Tariff arrangements; but the position today is quite different. Indeed, the position, so far as the outside public is concerned, is surrounded with mystery.I believe, however, that the Protectionist associations and Protectionist newspapers- are just as conversant with the situation as we are ourselves. When, some three weeks ago, the Protectionist associations, of Australia waited on the Prime Minister on the question of the reopening of the Tariff, I told one of the delegates that I could not understand why I was not allowed to discuss the matter, while he and his friends and the Protectionist press, who knew just as much as we do about the situation, were allowed to say what they liked. I cannot think that these newspapers and organizations are ignorant of the difference between the situation before the war and the situation now; and yet they are allowed to publicly condemn this Parliament, and every honorable member here, for not doing certain things that they deem desirable. There are nien in gaol to-day for doing much less than these associations and newspapers have done during the last few weeks. Are we to understand that one section of the community may discuss such matters, while another section, which happens to consist of members of Parliament, have their mouths closed? If so, it does not appeal to me as a fair position in any respect. </para>

                    <para>I believe that the Protectionist associations and the Protectionist press are quite justified in the stand they have taken, but their weakness is that they opposed the referendum in the year before last. At that time the Labour party - of course, this was before the rift - had decided to take a referendum on certain questions, an affirmative reply to which would have enabled this Parliament to protect the manufacturer, the consumer, and worker alike. We remember, however, the intrigue that took place ; how the State Governments promised the present Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Labour party, to concede to the Commonwealth Parliament certain powers which would render the referendum unnecessary. Unfortunately, that offer was accepted; and we know now how it was honoured . Now we are told that there is no need for action, because the Government possess all the requisite power under the War Precautions Act. It is true that the High Court has said that that is so, but, in my opinion as a layman, it is bad law. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly; but I claim to have formed an opinion from my experience of the Court during the time I have been a member of this Parliament. When the referendum was proposed, we were told that it was a most inopportune time - that we ought not to have the turmoil and strife of such a contest while we were at war. Further, some cant was indulged in, and we were implored to think about our boys at the front, and not to divide the people at such a time. That is the sort of stuff we were asked to listen to. The position was just as serious at the front, and even more serious, in 1915, than it is to-day; and then, as now, we had these objections raised. The truth is that the Protectionist associations of Australia did not wish to give this Parliament power to fix prices and wages conditions, but preferred the old form of Protection; and, unfortunately, the Free Traders helped them to gain their point. Newspapers are allowed to change their minds every three months or three days, but if a politician, after due consideration, arrives at the conclusion that he was not right in the past, he is hounded down from one constituency to another. The Protectionist leaders and newspapers said, in 1915, that the time was too serious for the submission of the Constitution Alteration Bills to a referendum, because it would rend the people asunder. I ask whether that referendum would have rent the people asunder as much as did the referendum on conscription. </para>

                    <para>I believe that the Protectionist press is correct in the stand it is taking now. Australia is the only country in the world that has unemployed, and if there is any difficulty in deciding what shall be done by the different nations engaged in this fight in the matter of commercial arrangements, I remind the British people that Australia is in a different situation from any other portion of the Empire; and if it be necessary for them to make arrangements with our Allies as to future commercial relations, they should leave Australia out of any such arrangements, and make an agreement that relates only to the trade of Great Britain. Britain today is one vast &#39;hive of industry, because a great portion of its population is engaged in producing munitions of war. A similar state of affairs obtains in the countries of the other combatants. In Australia the position is different. We have not had the opportunity to engage in the production of munitions, and we have not the industrial establishments for the purpose. Moreover, we shall never have them if some specious reason is always advanced as to why we should not make our Tariff effective. I wish to read an extract from to-night&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> Messages of similar import have been published frequently. I do not know whether that is done for the purpose of taunting Australians, or to incite them to gird up their loins and to make them&#34; realize how foolish they have been in the past.

When, a few years ago, artisans were imported from Great Britain and America and set to work alongside our men the Australian pace nearly killed them. In time they became accustomed to the pace at which the Australian works for eight hours per day, but at first they could not hold their own. I believe that the honorable member for Henty was satisfied, after a visit abroad, that as much work is done in eight hours in Australia as in ten hours in America. </para>

I believe that the industrial magnates of Australia are just as willing as those of other countries to extend their establishments if they receive enough fiscal encouragement. The reason we have not more industries is not that wages are too high, but that the duties are too low, and we lack organization. </para>

                            <para>- One cannot say off-hand what a <inline font-style="italic">71/2</inline> per cent. increase would mean. There may be a 10 per cent. duty on certain commodities for revenue purposes only, and no more duty is necessary, but there may be other duties of 35 per cent <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> which should be increased to 100 per cent. if they are to be thoroughly Protective. I know that the industrial men of Australia are just as greedy as any other capitalists, and if a high Tariff is imposed without protection for the consumer they will take advantage of it. The men working in the industry, too, will get all they can, but I shall not blame them for that while the employer makes all the interest he can on the money he has invested. What is good for the master is good for Andrew. </para>

                    <para>When we see Canada getting enormous contracts from Great Britain, and have regard to the fact that the Dominion has been manufacturing munitions during the war, we must see that Australia will go by the board unless it takes some steps to protect itself. Men are returning from the front, and a large proportion of them will not be too eager to resume occupations in which they were engaged before they left Australia. The war will unfit many of them for their former trades. Of course, all the warring countries will be in the same position, but the others are industrially prepared and Australia is not. </para>

                            <para>- Some say that distance is a deterrent. I do not know whether that is so or not, but I do know that the principal deterrent to an increase in our industrial activities is the insufficiency of the Tariff duties. The men who have invested their money in industrial establishments are not likely to increase their productivity unless they can feel assured that they will get a full opportunity of making good. They are not likely to substitute new machinery for old until they are assured of a return on the money invested. I admit tha.t a Tariff a thousand times higher than the present will be useless if we attempt to manufacture with the old order of machinery. But before up-to-date machinery can be installed we must give men who invest their money some security of tenure. I know that by a sudden increase of duties there will be a possibility of a peculiar situation being created; but surely there is enough common sense in Australia to devise some legislative machinery that will give security to the manufacturer and to the consumers during the transition from the present order of things to the new. I suggest, in order to prevent the inflation of prices when the increased duty is imposed, that if it is known that other countries are rushing material into Australia in order to sell before the higher duty operates, the Government should be given power to prevent that material being landed. If we are not likely to manufacture locally for a number of years sufficient of a commodity that is in much demand, and there is a likelihood of some body gaining enormously by an increase in the duty, we might make provision either that the duty should be increased by degrees, or that it shall come into operation, by proclamation, as soon as there is&#39; a reasonable guarantee that the interests of the consumers are safeguarded. It is useless to say that some arrangement cannot be devised that will meet all requirements. An idea has been created in the minds of many people that we have no right to discuss the Tariff, but I say, again, that Australia is in a different position from the rest of the Empire. Other countries are prepared for manufacturing; Australia is not, and something must be done immediately, otherwise Australia will be made a scapegoat. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members are always shifting their ground. When the workers of Australia are paid as well as the workers of Canada there will be no Labour troubles here, and what Canada has done Australia should be able to do. Canada pays high wages, and yet manufactures for export. Why cannot we do the same ? We &#39;have been fooled in the past, and no doubt every one is somewhat to blame. Now that we are on the eve of an election we are told that we must not breathe a word about the Tariff question. If, for international reasons, Great Britain is compelled to make concessions to her Allies, Australia cannot be expected to do the same. If she does, she will get the worst of the deal - not being prepared for competition on such terms. While we have our duties to the Empire, we have also our responsibilities to the people who sent us here, and we must not forget their needs. </para>

                        <para>.- I should have liked to see the Tariff revised before the election, because the people were told when last we faced the music that this Parliament would revise the Tariff. Many Victorian and some New South Wales members were strongly in favour of Tariff revision. But the circumstances arising out of the war have prevented Tariff reform, and I am surprised that some of those who sit behind the Ministry now should taunt the members of this party with&#39; having done nothing for the two and a half years during which they were in power. An industry which I should like to see get a fair show is the steel industry and allied industries. I believe that the workmen engaged in those industries in Australia have among  them  some of the most experienced men at their trade in the world, and every one who has the interest of the country at heart feels that something should be done to establish the manufacture of steel and iron in this country. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for .Maribyrnong has referred to me as a converted Free Trader. He said last night that I have shed my last Free Trade skin. My fiscal creed is this : I believe in voting for what I think best for Australia. I believe that Protection - not Protection run mad - is necessary for many of our big industries. When the last Tariff was under discussion, however, the honorable member for Wimmera was almost crying in his anxiety to have the duty on dried fruits increased. He spoke of the great industry that was flourishing at Mildura and Renmark, and said that Australia should make all the dried fruits that she consumed. Having heard his plea for the protection of the dried fruit industry, I voted for the duty that the Government then proposed. But I find in going through the files of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that since the war began dried fruits have risen in price, not <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per ton, but many pounds per ton, although for the last two years the crops ha/ve been better than ever before. The consumer has not benefited in the least by the duty on dried fruits. What do we gain by exchanging a fat importer for a fat manufacturer? When I see one or the other sitting behind a fat cigar driving a motor car, I cannot notice any difference. </para>

We, in the Maranoa district, pay through the nose for everything that we drink, everything that we wear, and everything that we use.

                    <para>The more I look into Protection the deeper I get into the mud. I would like to  have back the good old days of this Parliament when  we  first discussed Tariff matters. I remember then how Protectionist members used to. inveigh against the rich importers. But how does the. working man or other consumer benefit by doing away with the rich importer and creating another brand of rich man, the wealthy manufacturer ? If Protection is to benefit industries in this young country, I am going to give all the reasonable Protection that any Government chooses to propose, because I believe in starting industries and in giving them some chance of succeeding. I believe also in making people use Australian goods. Goods manufactured in Australia are equal to any that are produced in other parts of the world. About three years ago, when I was in a shop in South Melbourne purchasing a pair of boots for 17s. 6d., two working men entered the establishment. They described the boots they wished to purchase, and the attendant in the shop brought along some of Marshall&#39;s boots, good enough for the King to wear. But they said, &#34; We want something better than that. Have you no imported boots?&#34; He said, &#34;Yes; but they are very expensive.&#34; And what did he do but put some of Marshall&#39;s boots into a box labelled Bostock, and bring them along; but these men said they were not the right shape, and they left the shop. Victorians are rampant Protectionists, and these Victorians wanted to buy imported boots at 30s. a pair, while I, as a Free Trader, was satisfied with the Australian article at 17s. 6d. a pair. On another occasion I went into a shop in Swanston-street to purchase a pair of boots. I asked for Australian-made boots, and they tried to palm off on me an imported pair, but I would not take them, although I am a Free Trader. It just shows what thoroughbred Protectionists will do. </para>
                    <para>The iron industry is a great industry, and we have all the raw material here&#39;, millions of tons of iron ore merely awaiting the efforts of the miner to dig it out. If we give a measure of protection to that industry, and those which are allied to it, I believe that Australia will become a rich and prosperous exporting and manufacturing nation. </para>

This item deals with jute piece goods for the manufacture of cornsacks, which. I think, should be free of duty, no matter from what country they are imported. As honorable members know, they come solely from India, but I propose to move that they be free. I propose to take the same step in regard to item 134 dealing with cornsacks but I do not wish it to be said that I sought to remove the duty on cornsacks, and place the local manufacture at a disadvantage by retaining the duty on its raw material.

                        <para>. -  I maintain that the ruling of the  Chairman  is sound. The purpose of this Bill is primarily to validate duties which are being collected under a resolution of the House, and not by the authority of an Act of Parliament. It is undesirable, for reasons which have already been explained elsewhere - reasons of an international character - to reopen the Tariff at the present time; we cannot do it owing to the war. This Bill will enable us legally to retain the revenues that have been collected&#39; during the past three years under resolution laid before the Committee of Ways and Means. It will also legalize the collection of these duties until such time as a new Parliament shall have been elected and can deal with the whole question of the Tariff. &#39; If you, sir, had decided that any item could be amended, I should have claimed the right to propose reductions in a number of items occurring in the schedule before that which the honorable member for Yarra desired to amend. I should, for instance, have proposed to make certain amendments in division 5, which deals with textiles. As it is, I submit, sir, that, having regard to the title of the Bill, which is to validate the collections, your ruling is correct. </para>

                            <para>- I hold that it is. By regulation or Order in Council, the Government are going practically to hand over to a section of the community a big sum of money. Such a question should be decided by Parliament, and not by a Government controlled by Free Traders. I hope that the Committee will disagree with your ruling, sir. The whole question really hinges on whether or not corn- sacks are to be allowed to come in free. Is the remission of the duty on cornsacks to be done in a legitimate way, or in the illegitimate way proposed by the Government? </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that the discussion must be governed by the title of the Bill. This is a Bill for an Act to provide for the validation of certain duties that have been collected since 1914 on the authority of resolution laid before the Committee of Ways and Means. If the amendment be allowed, and is carried, the whole of the duties collected since that resolution was laid on the table will have to be refunded to the importers. That is the position we shall have to face. The question is whether we are prepared to go on as originally arranged, or whether, as appears to be the case, there shall be an attempt to make political capital out of the position. </para>

                            <para>- That instance was not in my mind; and, in any case, two wrongs do not make a right. I protest against an action that is, however, absolutely in keeping with other actions of a Government fully determined, it would appear, to &#34; win, tie, or wrangle,&#34; every time. It seems that nothing can be safe in this country so long as the present Government is in power; and this is only another infamy added to many more committed by them. It is preposterous that a Ministry, without a majority in another place, should take such a stand, and absolutely put aside a definite promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, when Prime Minister, that the Tariff should be dealt with in the first session of this Parliament. Meeting after meeting of Parliament has been held, and any attempt to deal with the Tariff has been blocked by the Free Traders in Caucus, and in the House. It is simply ridiculous to tell us, in mysterious tones, that we would &#34;Tremble if we only knew all&#34;; and I regard it as an insult to a great nation who has been our faithful ally, and carried out every pledge she has made. In a book on Japan that I published, and in my speeches in this House, I have said that which enables me to now speak freely; and nothing that could be said now could be stronger than what I have written and spoken. I resent the idea that the Tariff should be delayed on a pretext so frivolous, and that I should be prevented from submitting a proposal that would permit the Government, under the War Precautions Act, or some other legal process, to remove Tariff anomalies and assist manufacturers whose businesses are dying, and whose employees are being thrown out of work. </para>

The Government, when introducing the Bill, should have had the fairness to say that they would not allow a word or a comma to be altered. If I had known of their intention I would have opposed and entered a protest on the first reading. If the Government will not accept amendments in this Chamber, I hope there may be a majority in another place which will compel them to do so. It would be better for the Government to allow amendments to be moved, and then vote them down, than to use their majority to silence the minority. I shall divide the Committee on this issue, for I would sooner go down with the minority than passively accept the dictation of the Government in this matter. </para>

If this were a protective item jute goods would not be on the free list in regard to the United Kingdom. If the Government will vote against my proposal openly, I shall be ready to accept my defeat, bub I do not wish to be defeated on the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman.  It seems to me that if the Government wishes to prevent amendments such as I have moved, its best course is to withdraw clause 4. As items are specified therein, I take it that any member can move to amend the clause by specifying other items. </para>

                        <para>. - Because of the approaching prorogation and dissolution, the Bill is necessary to authorize and validate the collection of duties. Millions of pounds of revenue have been collected under the schedule introduced in 1914,&#39; and the money has been spent on purposes of government. It is therefore necessary to validate the collections that have been made up to the present. We need also authority for future collections, and the Bill authorizes the continuance of collecting. It validates the collection of all revenue that has been received up to date, and authorizes and validates the continuance of collections in accordance with the Tariff proposals, introduced on the dates mentioned. As the honorable member for Henty has pointed out, in some instances where duties are remitted by these proposals, they are being collected under the authority of the Customs Tariff Act 1908-11. </para>

                    <para class="block">I was prevented from moving to amend an item of the Tariff on the ground that the amendment went beyond the order of leave. I think that the clause, in providing for the amendment of certain items, also goes beyond the order of leave. Had the Government had the courage to say, &#34; We intend to prevent you from moving any amendment of the Tariff schedule,&#34; it would have adopted a straightforward attitude, but it is now sheltering behind the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman.  I spoke last week of my intention to move this amendment. By a side wind the Government is hand ing back &#163;139,000 obtained from the duty on cornsacks, a duty that I have never favoured. Now we have an opportunity to wipe out that duty. Ministers also propose to hand back to the sugar farmers &#163;500,000 that they have made by selling sugar to the people. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the ruling is that the amendment that I moved cannot be moved on clause 4.- I have moved that the ruling be dissented from, and I am pointing out reasons for so doing. The Government have not come forward with a straightforward proposal to deal with the duty on cornsacks. We imported &#163;1,400,000 worth of cornsacks last year, and the farmers will not have to pay a 10 per cent, duty on that amount. That is the position. Either the Wheat Board will have to refund 10 per cent, on &#163;1,400,000 out of the farmers&#39; profits, or the money will come out of Consolidated Revenue. I maintain that there is a straightforward method of dealing with the matter. </para>

The clause simply validates the practice of the Department, and all this talk about dissent from the Chairman&#39;s ruling, and about the  Chairman  depriving honorable members of their rights and privileges, is so much moonshine. I am surprised at the Leader of the Opposition using such arguments. </para>

Another purpose is the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition to make jute piece-goods free, instead of charging 10 per cent., on them. I contend that the Leader of the Opposition is just as entitled to move an amendment to say what the construction of the Tariff shall be, as the Minister for Trade and Customs is to propose what the construction of the Tariff shall be in regard to four items of the Tariff: We wish to add to the four items, and I submit that we should be permitted to do so. No doubt honorable members will vote to support the Chairman; but they will not deceive the general public in regard to the conduct of Ministers, namely, bringing down a Bill to which amendments cannot be moved. </para>

                            <para>- I do so. The honorable member for Yarra, under the disguise of disagreeing with your ruling, has made a statement that is absolutely incorrect, and he knows it. He was the only Minister of the Fisher Government who knew what was to be the duty on cornsacks. Until he unloosed the Tariff in this Chamber, no one else knew what the duty was <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be. Yet now the honorable member says that he does not believe in that duty, and he is seeking to have it removed. I remember the facts, and the sequence of events well. When the honorable member brought into the Chamber a proposal to impose a duty of 10 per cent. on cornsacks, honorable members who were then sitting in Opposition, took a certain course of action, the object of which would have been to remove that duty. </para>

                            <para>- The statement is absolutely correct. The honorable members for Indi and Werriwa, and certain other country members, intended to vote with the Opposition at the time; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> came in and said to the then Leader of the Opposition, &#34; This proposal is a dirty flank attack, intended to interfere with a Government which is charged with the conduct of the war.&#34; Consequently, the course of procedure that the Opposition proposed to take was not pursued ; but several honorable members who represented country constituencies waited, by appointment, on the honorable member for Yarra in his Ministerial room, and pressed every phase of the cornsack question on him. They asked for the removal of the duty, but the Minister was adamant; he would not budge an inch. Yet to-day he has the hypocrisy to come forward and pretend that he would like to see the duty on cornsacks removed. It is merely a belated election dodge that will <inline font-style="italic">nob</inline> deceive any one. When the honorable member says that he is in favour of the removal of the duty, he knows very well that he would not yield or budge an inch when he was asked to remove the duty. </para>

                            <para>- While we may fight our political battles as hard as we can, I am confident that neither the honorable member nor any other honorable member of the House desires to do anything that is unfair. Let me say that every member of the Fisher Government went through every item in the Tariff schedule. The present Minister for Trade and Customs, who was a member of that Administration, will bear out my statement&#34; that some items were included in that schedule with which I did not agree. What I brought down to the House, therefore, was the product of the Government. Once I laid it on the table of the House I was responsible for it, and I accepted the responsibility just as I have always been prepared to accept my responsibility as a Minister. The honorable member for Wannon said, further, that on the question of the duty on cornsacks I remained adamant to the appeals of every deputation that waited upon me when I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs. As I said a night or two ago, when I held office as a Minister I never told a deputation that I would agree to its proposals; I invariably said that I would submit the proposals put before me to the Cabinet. It was not possible for me, or any other individual Minister, to frame the Tariff schedule. The Ministry as a whole framed our policy, and I make this statement so that honorable members may not be under any misapprehension as to how the Tariff was framed, or in regard to the answers I furnished as a Minister to any deputation which waited upon me. </para>

                        <para>. - I respectfully protest against the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman.  The title of the Bill is couched in the widest possible terms. This is &#34;A Bill for an Act to provide for the validation of collections of duties of Customs under Tariff proposals, and for other purposes.&#34; Nothing could be wider than the closing words of that title, and I am satisfied that when the result of this division reaches the public they will take the view that we have not received fair play. Since you ruled, sir, that no amendment could be made to any of the preceding clauses, I submit that you should take up the same position in respect to this clause, and rule out of order any amendment, whether it be moved by a Minister or a private member. I hold that your ruling is quite wrong, and I think you will regret it. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the Government will accept this proposed new clause it will get them out of a very difficult position. It will enable them to remove any anomaly in the Tariff, and every one knows that the present schedule contains hundreds, if not thousands, of anomalies. Further, it will permit them to increase the duties on any article manufactured in Australia. That is surely a very necessary power at the present moment. It. will, likewise, give to private enterprises chances to carry on manufactures, some of which are now dying. The records show that we have fewer manufactories now than we had at the outbreak of the war. That should not be. In view of what the war has brought about, the consumption of Australian-made products should be greater than ever. </para>

The clause would give the Government power to deal with the matter of drugs with German names; and it is a fact that, in New South Wales, enemy aliens, who had their patents cancelled, have been granted new patents. The clause would cover the interregnum which always follows a dissolution, and would enable the Government of the day to perform a duty that honorable members have carelessly and callously neglected. It is a mere verbal quibble to regard our prolonged sitting as one session, and I am sure that any average man, or any member of the House, does not regard it in that light. It is a mere technicality, that is used to cover the pledge given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> If I am beaten in Committee, I shall repeat the proposal in the House, if the rules of Parliament permit. </para>

Then, again, there are honorable members opposite who are not too sure that they can support all that the Government have done since it was formed, after the huckstering and bickering about the apportionment of the portfolios. There are men who call themselves Liberals, and, perhaps, others who do not decorate themselves with the name, who can be relied on to assist the four honest men I have mentioned, if the Government seek to do any injustice in their dying days. </para>

                        <para>. - I am afraid &#187; I shall have to use the same argument in relation to this amendment as I used in relation to other amendments. The Bill is one to validate something that has been done, namely, the collection of certain duties. Here is an amendment which goes quite beyond the validation of the duties, and proposes to give the Government power to increase duties. This, as I say, is quite outside the title of the Bill, and, further, it would place a wonderful power in the hands of any Government, and leave them to do practically what they liked with the Tariff. The Government have a certain power now, inasmuch as they may meet in Cabinet, and, at any time, place on the table a Tariff resolution to at once take effect. That power the clause only seeks to give in another way. </para>

                        <para>.- I cordially sympathise with both the mover of the proposed new clause and the Minister. The latter gentleman is very naturally anxious to have the Committee assume that he is one of the four righteous persons to whom the honorable member referred in his eulogistic speech, and he is, therefore, prepared to believe that the Government could properly exercise the tremendous powers proposed. </para>

                            <para>- Then all we have is a suggestion to the Government that they may, by Order in Council, reduce any duties. For the first time I have seen some disagreement between the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Melbourne, inasmuch as the latter would give power to reduce duties. This, I take it, is a well-considered motion, submitted after consultation with the party opposite, for I am quite certain the honorable member for Melbourne would not launch a proposal of such importance without a solid backing behind him. I am also sure that the honorable member would not so change the apparent purpose of the motion without the complete acquiescence, not only of his party, but of his leader. I hope that the motion will not be ruled out of order, but that we may have a vote on it as it stands, or as the honorable member for Melbourne is prepared to see it amended. I should like to see the members of the Opposition voting with the honorable member for Melbourne to put this enormous power in the hands of a Government he so implicitly trusts. </para>

                            <para>- Here we have a &#34; rift in the lute &#34; at once, even before we get to a division. There seems to be a split in the party - a split between the honorable member for Melbourne and his nominal leader. As I said before, I think honorable members should have a chance of expressing their utmost confidence in the Government, or of being consistent in the policy they have so recently adopted. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to tender my &#34; meed of praise &#34; to the honorable member for Melbourne for having displayed such confidence in the Government, especially after the hard and bitter criticism of the Prime Minister from honorable members opposite. This shows the big heart of the honorable member for Melbourne, and that he, in his innermost soul, has every confidence in the Prime Minister, and is willing to trust him. This confidence will go on record for all time; and it is to be regretted that it is not in order to take a division on this important motion. The honorable member for Melbourne is to be commended, and I shall certainly, throughout the length and breadth of my electorate, emphasize the fact that, when it came to a critical point, he had such confidence in the Government as to trust them to deal with the Tariff as they choose. Why do the honorable member&#39;s colleagues desert him? They have immediately held a party meeting, and did not even wait until they got upstairs before holding it. They might have waited until they got to the party room before bringing pressure to bear on the honorable member, and I appeal to that honorable gentleman not to allow pressure to be exerted on him in the House. Why should he be compelled to withdraw such a proposal ? It was the honorable member for Indi, I think, who brought the pressure to bear, for he rushed and brought his leader in, and now we find the honorable member for Melbourne deserted because he has shown his confidence in the man whom his colleagues have so bitterly criticised. </para>

                            <para>- The thought has been in the minds of a number of honorable members that perhaps the present Government is so entirely worthy of the confidence, not only of the House, but also of the country, that it should be permitted to have special powers for the declaration by executive act of increased duties. It might possibly be held by a person who has not closely studied the Standing Orders that this Bill, being merely a Customs duties validation measure, cannot be amended in the direction I have indicated; but I suggest that any doubt as to the legality of an amendment such as has been in the minds of some honorable members fails on the ground that any validating Bill can validate to any extent, and with any exceptions the House may care to name. We might have a Bill providing for validation with certain specific exemptions. In the case I have in mind an honorable member with chivalrous instincts sought to place on record his appreciation of the trustworthiness of the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - In the absence of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer a very cruel case. A discharged soldier has had his pension reduced from 69s. to 23s. per fortnight. He has been employed in the Post Office since November, at Ss. 6d. per day. He is leaving that position at the end. of the week, because he is unable to do any work. He has no lower jaw, and will never be able to chew food as long as he lives.  His  arm muscles are injured, and his wife is expecting a child. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abigail,</inline> one of Sydney&#39;s best-known legal experts, recently christened the Defence Department &#34; the Department of Muddledom.&#34; These cases are doing more to injure enlistment than anything of which I have knowledge. </para>

                        <para>.- I asked the Prime Minister a question to-day as to whether Australian soldiers on active service, when being court martialled, are tried in accordance with the regulations under the Australian Defence Act or the regulations under the British Army Act. The Prime Minister replied that they are tried under the regulations of the Australian Defence Act. I have received certain information which confirms rumours that are widely current throughout Australia as to the very harsh penalties which are being imposed On Australian soldiers who are tried for disciplinary offences. In England recently two young fellows were charged with having been absent without leave, they having left Salisbury Plain and visited London. One of them, aged nineteen, was fined &#163;7 10s., and the other, who was twenty-one years of age, was sentenced to imprisonment for two years. Another young fellow, a former resident of Port Melbourne, is now serving a sentence of three years in a prison in France for having been absent without leave from the base. He had been in the trenches in France for a considerable time, and had an excellent record both in Australia and on active service. In Geelong Gaol to-day is a batch of soldiers who have been returned from Egypt and other parts to serve terms of imprisonment. They are nearly all disciplinary cases. The men have petitioned the authorities here to be given their liberty, so that they may return to the front and make good again, the majority of them feeling their position keenly. Yesterday I was given an instance of the severe treatment of our men by some of the officers, particularly by English officers. A young fellow who took part in the memorable landing of the Australians at Gallipoli, remained there until the end, and left on the day of the historic evacuation, took ill on his return to Egypt, and was Sent to hospital. When he was able to leave the hospital, he was ordered to go to his camp, and arrived there weary, thirsty, and hungry. On asking for rations, he was told that he could not get them, not being on the list., and that he must parade before his superior officer, who was, I understand, an English captain. He asked his superior officer for rations, telling him of the circumstances of his case, and he was told that there were not any rations for him. He then almost demanded rations, and the officer replied-, I understand, &#34; You will be wanting my afternoon lea next.&#34; Thereupon the spirit of the young fellow asserted himself, and he insulted his officer because of the contemptuous treatment meted out to him. He was immediately arrested, and was sentenced to twelve months&#39; imprisonment, serving five months in Egypt, and completing the remaining seven months in the Geelong gaol only the other day. The offence was committed under the strongest possible provocation, and splendid military services and a fine record were blotted out by it. The conduct of British officers at Salisbury Plain and elsewhere towards Australian soldiers, and the severity of the penalties they impose is widely commented on. The other day I asked the Prime Minister whether, if he went Home to the Imperial Conference, he would make inquiries, with a view to getting an alteration of the system. The English officers do not understand the spirit of the average young Australian, who cannot knuckle down in the servile manner of men in some other parts of the world, and therefore come under their displeasure. Some action should be taken, because boys who left their country prepared to give their lives for what they believe to be a good cause, are worthy of more consideration than they are receiving. Personally, I resent the imposition of such severe penalties for what we in Australia would term trivial offences. </para>

                        <para>. - To-morrow we shall proceed with the Excise Tariff Validation Bill, and then with the Electoral (War Time) Bill. I shall bring under the notice of the Prime Minister what was said about the meeting of the Wool Board, and see whether what is desired can be arranged. I do not think that the honorable member for Yarra could have been in earnest in what he said about the Electoral Bill. What was not possible in&#39; regard to a Validating Bill would be quite possible in regard to that Bill, which is open to amendment in the ordinary way; and the honorable member will have no difficulty in moving such amendments as may come within the scope of the measure. The complaints about the severe treatment of Australian soldiers made by the honorable member for Fawkner will be brought under the notice of the Minister for Defence. Matters of this kind would be dealt with more expeditiously if, in the first instance, they were brought under the notice of the Defence Department, and the names and full particulars supplied in every case. What I have done when complaints have been made to me is to address the Minister, and, if not satisfied with his reply, to address him again. Generally, I have obtained a reasonable decision. </para>
