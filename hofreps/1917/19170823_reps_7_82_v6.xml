                        <para>HOBART. - On the motion for adjournment of the Assembly on Tuesday night, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Belton</inline> said that discharged soldiers were compelled to travel from the north-west coast to attend Launceston hospital for special treatment for wounds received on active service, and pay their own railway fares. He did not think that was fair. </para>
                        <para>The Premier said it was not a matter for the State Government, but for the Federal authorities to see that the men wore properly treated. It was not lack of appreciation on the Government&#39;s part, but it should be done on proper business lines. </para>

                            said that one. man who had come back with Mb  jaw gone bad left his father killed in action in France, and yet he was compelled to travel well over 100 miles to hospital, and pay his own railway fare. The Tasmanian Government should not be so mean or so shabby as to allow their own soldiers to be treated like that. The Federal Government had no regard for Tasmanians.

He does not draw a pension, nor receive an allowance, and he cannot get work. Those in charge of the Patriotic Fund refuse to assist him. </para>

I am afraid that the Inter-State  Commission is not specially qualified to undertake this inquiry; nor do I think that evidence such as would be convincing could be given. One- may have one&#39;s opinions, and may know certain things; but I do not think that a useful purpose could be served by including this question in the cost of living inquiry..

                            <para>.- Many items of expenditure that formerly appeared in the Estimates of expenditure from Revenue have been transferred to the Loan Account. Included amongst them are lighthouse&#39; construction, the Arsenal, and. the Naval Bases. I think that we should have at this stage a general discussion on the action of the Government in distributing proposed expenditure on various new works over the revenue schedule now before us, and a loan schedule which will subsequently be considered. In last year&#39;s Estimates there was no provision for any expenditure out of loan funds on new works, buildings, &#38;c, whereas this year the Government provide in the loan schedule for an expenditure of &#163;2,742,725. The Treasurer in his Budget speech led the House and the country to believe that the Government were effecting a saving of about &#163;3,000,000 on public works. Upon examination of these Estimates we find that, whereas last year about &#163;4,000,000 was paid out of revenue on account of new works and buildings, this year the Government propose to expend, out of revenue on these services only &#163;1,200,000. It would thus appear at first sight that, as compared with last year&#39;s figures, there is a saving of over &#163;3,000,000 in this expenditure. The actual fact is, however, that the Government have transferred to loan account a large proportion of the expenditure paid last year out of revenue. It is a mere juggling with the figures dealing with &#39;the services of the Commonwealth. There should be a general discussion on this action on the part of the Government. </para>

                                <para>- I do not say that the Government should not make any provision for expenditure out of loan account. My objection is that they led the people outside to believe that they had effected a saving of over &#163;3,000,000 in these Estimates, whereas they have merely reduced the amount to be spent out of revenue, and. made provision for practically the same expenditure out of loan fund. Several of these items call for discussion. There is, for instance, the proposed vote of &#163;16,500 for public offices at Geraldton, a comparatively small town in Western Australia, having a population of about 4,000. There are Only three Customs officers in that town, and only twenty-four officers employed in the whole of the postal services of the district. I consider that it is an absolute wast&#169; of money to spend so large an amount on the erection, of Commonwealth buildings in such a town. I shall probably be met with the taunt that these buildings were promised by a previous Government. </para>

This Government, however, will declare from the platforms of the country that, whereas last year &#163;4,300,000 was expended on new works, buildings, &#38;c, they provide in&#39; these Estimates for an expenditure of only &#163;1,200,000. They will conveniently forget to tell the people what they are spending out of loan account on these services. I well remember the series of articles written by&#34; the Minister for the Navy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook,</inline> when he was in opposition, concerning the expenditure of the Labour party. They were subsequently published in pamphlet form with the title of &#34; The Financial Carnival.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- It appears to me as though the Government were trying to show as small an expenditure as possible on the war, seeing that they are paying for it out of revenue. In other words, the Government would rather tax for public works than for the war. I agree that interest and pensions should be met out of revenue, but this allocation of &#163;13,000,000 is, broadly speaking, for war purposes. I have nob gone into the items, but I doubt if for this year &#163;13,000,000 is necessary for interest and pensions; at any rate, if it is necessary this year, God help us in the future ! When we have such an enormous amount set apart for the war it seems strange to insist on a system of borrowing for public works, especially when we have not had such borrowing in the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> when Treasurer, made special arrangements for the expenditure on the east-west railway, and for the Commonwealth Buildings in London, the money being taken out of the note issue; and I cap see no reason for the present change, unless it is the ambition of the Treasurer to carry out his idea of, as far as possible, passing on these charges to the future. If* at the present time, there was an abnormal expenditure on public works I could understand the departure, but with the present restrictions I see no need for borrowing. Finance may not be my specialty, but even the knowledge I have causes me to look at the proposal with some shade of fear, the more so when I remember the Treasurer&#39;s ideas on the subject. I know it is useless voting against&#39; the proposal, because the brutal majority behind the Government will carry it. However, I hope the Ministry will not allow the Treasurer to carry out his idea of borrowing,, especially, as I say, when there&#34; are so many restrictions upon the expenditure on public works. A good deal of trouble has been caused, not &#39; only by the decrease of public works on the part of the Commonwealth Government, but also by similar action on the part of the State Governments, and that is why I am pleased that the Government are making provision for certain loans to the States for public works. It is to the restriction placed upon public works that most of the industrial unrest of today is due. I can understand the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> smiling when I make that statement, but I know it is true. During the last eighteen months there has been a feeling through- out the States that it is the determination of the Conservative section of the community to restrict Government expenditure for a certain purpose, namely, economic conscription. </para>

                                <para>- Of course it is. I am speaking in a non-party sense, for I am personally not too keen on spending these moneys on public works at the present time. But to any person who has that sort of prejudice or objection, the method adopted by the Government ought to be most welcome, because I warn my honorable friend that, when these Estimates have gone through, there will come the Loan Bill. When the Loan Bill comes forward the honorable member will have the opportunity of wiping out these items if he so desires. </para>

                                <para>- The amount to which the honorable member refers is expenditure for which no loan could decently be raised. It represents an annual expenditure which brings no return to the Commonwealth, and is spent for the purpose of honouring a financial obligation of a yearly nature. It must be met out of revenue if the Commonwealth is to remain solvent. My objection to the course taken is not the purely academic one, which, as it came from the lips of the honorable member, was slightly self-contradictory. My objection is to burdening our loan account with expenditure which we can do without until we are through the present crisis. For that reason I welcome the system of bringing forward the Works expenditure in a separate Bill, and I shall take the utmost liberty of criticism in regard to any work which seems to me to be unnecessary and wasteful at such a time as this. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not desire to discuss these Estimates generally. My object in rising is to offer a few remarks in regard to certain objections which have been voiced to the erection of a new post-office and Customs House at Geraldton, which is in my constituency. First of all, I draw attention to the fact that the item is a re- vote. In fact it was placed on last year&#39;s Estimates by the Administration of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member, holding the portfolio of Minister for Trade and Customs. I had occasion to interview the Works Department in regard to this building, and found that the matter had been referred to the Customs Department and to the Postal Department. At the time I was not desirous of seeing any large expenditure undertaken in connexion with public buildings, because of the outbreak of the war, and the Government also were not anxious to put up this building at Geraldton for the same reason, but a few thousand pounds was provided on the Estimates, so that if the position of affairs improved later on they could <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> on with the work. On this occasion the Minister has simply taken care to see that he will be in a position to commence the work if he feels it is necessary to do so towards the end of the financial year. Geraldton is a very important town. Over half-a-million pounds&#39; worth of wool was taken to Geraldton this year to be appraised. It is the commercial centre for a large agricultural district, and for the whole of the Murchison gold-fields. A new post office is necessary because of the wretchedly insanitary condition of the present building. It must be remembered that Geraldton is very close to the tropics. There are about twenty employees engaged in the building, and the accommodation is very cramped: I presume that the departmental officers in considering the question of putting up a new building, anticipated that a larger office would be required, not only for postal purposes, but for Customs and other Federal officials. </para>

                                <para>- If the existing building will serve the purpose while the war is in progress, I do not urge the early construction of the new premises. Instead of the Leader of the Opposition seeking to make a point out of this proposed building at Geraldton, in order to reflect on the present Administration, he should draw attention to the awful scandals in connexion with the buildings at the various Naval Bases. For instance, it is proposed to spend &#163;500,000 in the bush on buildings which will provide no facilities for the general public, and upon which extravagance of the grossest type has been exercised for the last few years. If he had called attention to this he would have been doing something more to the advantage of the public and the public purse. </para>

                                <para>- It was not repudiated when it was uttered. Why has not the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> been rewarded?- That honorable member has good grounds for com plaint, because, of the way in which his constituency has been overlooked, in spite of the fact that repeated requests have been made for post offices and other buildings in his electorate. -The neglect of the Oxley district would point &#187;to the fact that it is not a personal matter. The Government have exercised considerable  discrimination against Queensland. If. political support has been the determining factor, that State should have received a fairer share. When it returns to sanity in regard to its political faith,  and throws out &#39;the supporters of the present Government, it will have less than nothing if the policy of grants for political support is pursued. It has little enough now. The Ministerial party gained in Queensland three senators and one member of the House of Representatives at the last election. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking now of the poverty of the vote for postal buildings. An increasing number of requests for better postal facilities in my own electorate are reaching me, and . I am aware of the urgent need for such buildings in the constituency of Oxley, which comprises South Brisbane. A piece of land was selected there for a post-office, but the building has not been erected. Post-offices are needed in various parts of the city of Brisbane and its suburbs, but we have been told by the Deputy Postmaster-General there that the Government have imposed such severe restrictions on him that he cannot authorize any increases. If that be true, why is there no lack of funds for postal conveniences in the other States? The expenditure in Victoria is to be &#163;28,000, and in New South Wales &#163;41,000. I do not say that that is more than is needed, but I complain that a discrimination is being shown against Queensland, or that the Deputy Postmaster-General has put too literal an interpretation on the instruction to observe economy. Unfortunately, only one member of the Ministry comes from Queensland, and he is only an Assistant Minister. Apparently he has not sufficient influence with the Treasurer to secure fair consideration of his State. We all expected a severe limitation of expenditure, but Queensland should not be treated differently from the other States. Why are the urgent necessities of Queensland receiving no consideration when post-offices are being scattered here and there over New South Wales and Victoria? </para>

Should it be held that this is not the time to refer to the matter, I shall reserve my remarks until the Loan Bill comes before us. I find that the printing of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Manual of Emergency Legislation</inline> is provided for out of loan money, as is also the press cable service for supplying news to members of the Expeditionary Forces, the Conference regarding the settlement of returned soldiers on the land, and part of the cost of the referendum of October last. But the biggest item of all is the pay of the Citizen Forces, namely, &#163;100,000. Surely a regular service like this should be met out of revenue. </para>

                                <para>- It is most unfortunate that the papers presented to honorable members to help us to understand the expenditure are so confusing that we do not know whether any particular item is connected with the war or not. Under the circumstances now obtaining, we are unanimously of opinion that war expenditure must be largely, although not exclusively, chargeable &#39;to loan moneys. We cannot hope to meet our war expenditure out of revenue. But we have certainly a right to expect that the ordinary expenses of the country will be met out of revenue, and that to some extent our war expenditure also will be defrayed from those special revenues which are being raised at the present time. If that is not done, why have we a demand for extra taxation? Either our ordinary expenditure has increased, demanding extra taxation, or, if it has decreased, there is no need for the extra taxation. Members of the Government have talked a good deal lately about the necessity for economy. Some time ago, the Minister for the Navy was very free in his remarks in regard to the need for a very drastic reduction of expenditure. Sensational statements have been made, and platform speeches have been utilized to show the enormous extravagance that is taking place in the Public Service. If such extravagance exists, what indication have we that the Government propose to reduce expenditure? On the contrary, we find that items which previously were charged to revenue&#34; are now not met by the ordinary revenue, even supplemented by extraordinary taxation. The people have an idea that the extra income taxation, and the levy on war-time profits, are to meet our war expenditure. </para>

If it is necessary to transfer that expenditure to loan fund, what is being done with the extra revenue that is being raised? It is not being expended on the war. </para>

                                <para>- We are aware that the interest charges must be met, and we must find revenue with which to meet them. If we are to understand that the expenditure on interest and other things consequent on the war necessitates the charging to loan of works previously paid for out of revenue, we have an idea where we are, and we realize that the Treasurer is justified in transferring some expenditure to loan account. At the same time the country has a right to demand that loan money shall be provided for war purposes only at this time, and that our ordinary disbursements, even including the expenditure on principal public works, shall be met out of revenue. We ought to raise sufficient revenue to meet that expenditure, and if the proposals of the Government are not yet sufficient to enable that to be done, I am prepared to support them in adopting any proposal that is reasonable and fair in its application, so that during this time of war our revenue may be increased to the extent of meeting all ordinary expenditure, and preventing the charging to loan of disbursements that, in all reasonable circumstances, ought to be met out of revenue. </para>

                                <para>- That is my complaint. I do not think that work was authorized. I am not blaming the present Administration, but other Administrations seem to have obtained from Parliament a lump sum vote to be expended, without particular works being properly specified. Out of those lump sums certain officers, with peculiar whims about particular works, have commenced undertakings which Parliament, if it had been consulted, would have refused to sanction. Unless a big works policy is carried out in the Territory, I cannot see that there will be any necessity for years to come, for any surface line in the Federal Capital Territory. However, I rose particularly to ask a question of the Minister for Works and Railways. Many of us have been waiting anxiously for the verdict of the Minister or the Cabinet in regard to the inquiries which have been made into the expenditure at! the Federal Capital, and I had hoped that when these Estimates were before us, the Minister would take the opportunity of elucidating the position. </para>

                            <para>. - At the outset of my remarks, which will be brief, I wish to express surprise at  the method of discussing the Estimates. This is the first time in my experience that, during a general debate on the Estimates, members have been allowed to discuss individual items. My purpose is to discuss financial questions generally, and I desire first of all to draw the attention of the Government to what, in my opinion, is a waste of money, and at the same time evidence of a lack of appreciation of the functions, of the Federal Government, and perhaps also of the State Governments. When the people were asked to vote upon the question of federating, they were led to understand by the political leaders of the day that the functions of the Federal and State Parliaments would be clearly defined, and that there would be no overlapping of the two authorities. Yet, in my opinion, several Departments of the Commonwealth are duplicating work which is done by the States, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> For instance, the administration of the Electoral Department is costing the Commonwealth about &#163;60,000 per annum, and I think we may safely say that electoral administration is costing each State &#163;25,000. Surely we have a right to expect an effort to be made to amalgamate the Electoral Departments as far as possible. Here we have Commonwealth and State electoral officers and * offices doing precisely the same work. The same may be said of the taxation Departments. I would&#39; urge upon the Treasurer the necessity of conferring with the various States in order that we might have one taxation office covering the whole* of the taxation matters, of the Commonwealth and the States. The present system of having separate Commonwealth and State offices and staffs is not only expensive but aggravating to the taxpayers, called upon as they are from time to time throughout the year to furnish State and Federal returns relating to their incomes. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>And so with our State banking institutions. I well remember the fight that took place between the States and the Commonwealth in regard to the proposal that the Commonwealth should encroach upon a business the conduct of which was considered at that time, at all events, to be the peculiar privilege of the States. We declare that we desire economy. The Government tell the people that they are reducing expenditure as much as possible, and yet we have Commonwealth and State banking institutions, both owned by the people, and dealing with the same people, with two expenditures, and with separate offices, side by side in the smallest of our villages, doing exactly the business which could be done just as well with only one office. The Treasurer will probably say that we cannot force the States to enter into a compact with the Commonwealth  for the transaction  of this banking business. Surely it is riot asking &#39;too much of responsible Ministers, who, by virtue of their positions, must be business men, to urge that instead of duplicating the work of banking, and attending to the surplus cash of the people of Australia, they should take steps to see that the work is done by only the one office in each town !  I hope that the Minister will make an effort to bring about at the earliest date the amalgamation of the electoral, taxation, and banking systems of the Commonwealth and States. </para>

                            Heitmann. little has been done, save in the direction of uniform taxation methods; Having regard to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget statement, I am disappointed with the Government efforts at economy when I find the expenditure of different Departments increasing. The expenditure of the Commonwealth Parliament itself is increasing year by year. Honorable members are expected to look closely into this expenditure, and, if possible, to curtail it. I notice, also, that even during these times of stress quite a number of Commonwealth officers are receiving more than small increases in salary.. I believe in paying a good man well for the work he does, but during this time of war the Government should be particularly careful in regard to increasing the salaries of officers of the Public Service when there is so much poverty outside. ,

                            <para>.- I regret that the honorable member for Dampier is temporarily absent from the chamber, since I desire to refer to the item of &#163;16,500 for the erection of public offices at Geraldton - an item in which he is interested. I am not likely to say in his absence, however, anything that I would not say in his presence. I have no desire to do any injury to Geraldton, or any other town, but I feel that it is time a halt was called in the erection of expensive public buildings out of all proportion to the needs of the district for whose services  they  are to provide. Here we are face to face with a proposed expenditure of &#163;16,500, and if we agree to the item it will be rightly assumed that the Parliament approves of such expenditure. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">On reference to the Public Service list, I find that there are only three Customs officers at Geraldton, and some twenty-three or twenty-four postal officers. Two positions in the Postal Department there are vacant at present, and five members of the staff are on active service. Unless their positions are filled by temporary employees, there axe thus only some seventeen postal officers for whom we have to provide. There should be a thorough investigation into the whole matter. It is all very well to say that some honorable member who held office in a previous Administration agreed to the erection of Commonwealth offices at Geraldton, or somewhere else; but what is the actual position? I have always regarded as a well-considered rule the provision that we should not erect quarters for public servants where they can obtain accommodation outside. I think that the only exception I made to that rule was when the residence provided for an officer at Roeburne was swept away by a hurricane, and the man had no chance of obtaining outside accommodation. If there has been any departure from that rule so far as Geraldton is concerned - and I do not think there has been - there must have been some good reason for it. The post master at Geraldton receives &#163;432 per annum, and the Chief Customs officer is in receipt of a salary of &#163;335. I should say that it was not proposed to provide quarters for both these officers, and I certainly hold that, wherever possible, &#39;the provision for quarters should be struck out. If neither of these officers reside in these public buildings a caretaker might be necessary, but it is infinitely better to employ a caretaker whose family may assist him in cleaning the offices than to erect expensive quarters for the postmaster or the principal Customs officer. </para>

                                <para>- The Public Works Committee was instituted to inquire as to works estimated to cost over &#163;20,000; but I think that, if that Committee&#39;s field of inquiry had been extended, it would have been found possible to bring about great economy in connexion with buildings estimated to cost much smaller sums. In my opinion, the same care has not been exercised with public money as would be exercised by honorable members in the case of their own money. Of course, if this expenditure of &#163;16,500 is justified, it ought to be passed; but I suggest further inquiry with a view to ascertaining whether less elaborate offices and quarters will not suffice. As I have said, I do not care to move for a reduction of the vote, but that seems the only course open to me, and I move - </para>

                                <para>- Of course not. It is idle for the Leader of the Opposition to attempt to place the Rockhampton Customs House on the same level as the Hobart Post Office, for the former was erected when there was no idea of Federation. There is another Customs House at Townsville, and these two cities have a right to a proper public building. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the exports from a port do not affect the Customs House. </para>

If there are no imports there is a big staff in the charge of the sub-collector; and the ex-Minister for Customs was guilty of a gross dereliction of duty in not stopping the unnecessary expenditure. Rockhampton, as I say, is the second port of Queensland. </para>

                                <para>- That is not so. If there is one State more than another in which all business does not filter through the capital, it is Queensland. There is a port for Central Queensland, another for Northern Queensland, and others all up the coast; and there is scarcely any traffic from Central Western Queensland that does not go through Rockhampton. I shall support the Government in their proposition, because I know from personal and practical experience the difficulty which officers outback have to find quarters. </para>

                                <para>- It is a bad plan at any time, and unpardonable now, in view of the fact that the Government told the country that they were going to practise the most rigid economy in public expenditure. It is right that proper quarters should be provided for the officials, and if any necessity had been shown for the expenditure of &#163;16,000 odd at Geraldton, we might take no exception. This, however, is a very old town, which I believe is now more prosperous than ever from an agricultural point of view. The population is increasing, though not phenomenally; it is not like a mining field which experiences new and unexpected mushroom developments. </para>

If Geraldton has got on fairly well up to date, why incur this expenditure in a time of war, especially, as I say, in view of the fact&#39; that the Government told the constituencies in every part of Australia that they were going to be an economizing Government - that they were going to scrutinize every item of expenditure, and undertake none that was not absolutely and immediately necessary ? This we have not been shown, and we have the pretty spectacle of the Win-the-war Government being criticised by the Leader of the Opposition on the score of economy. </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable member says that no money should be spent unless there is justification for it; and the question. in regard to this item of &#163;3,000 is whether the spending of that amount is justified or not. I have no political interest in the item to which the honorable member is objecting, but as I lived in Geraldton for some time, and represented the Geraldton electorate in the State Legislative Assembly, I can offer some little explanation in regard to it. It is not proposed to spend &#163;16,000 upon a new Post-office in Geraldton during this year. Not more than &#163;3,000 is provided for this year. It is a pity that the Minister in charge of the Estimates has not the information in regard to the receipts and expenditure of this particular post-office, because he could have shown that it is the third most important post-office in Western Australia outside Perth, and that its receipts are nearly equal to those of the Kalgoorlie Post-office. The present building is altogether inadequate. The telegraph operators and the clerks attending to the public are compelled to work in the same room, and the public, at the counter, can see the operators at their work. It is not right that the public  should he able to hear messages being received or transmitted. </para>

                                <para>- I should say that it is good enough for Melbourne. There is a huge annual expenditure in placing telephone wires underground in the cities, and the loss on the telephone service for the cities of Australia amounts to hundreds of thousands of pounds; yet there is nothing said about that expenditure or that loss by city members. The proposed expenditure will provide between twenty and thirty officers with proper accommodation, and will also cover the cost of a bond store. </para>

                                <para>- It is a stone and brick structure, and the postmaster&#39;s quarters are upstairs. The idea is to place all the Commonwealth buildings in the one block. That is a very desirable proposition. The post-office will serve not only a population of 5,000 in Geraldton itself, but also a population of between 30,000 and 40;000 in the district of which Geraldton is the centre. Around this town is the finest belt of wheat-growing country in Western Australia, a belt which is continually expanding; the copper mines of Northampton do their business through Geraldton, and the business of the Murchison goldfields, extending north and south for about 200 miles, also filters through the same town. In fact, there are about ten electorates in the State House which transact their business through Geraldton. Furthermore, it is the largest port on the western coast north of Perth. I admit that the present building could be patched up, and that accommodation could be provided with a smaller expenditure, but I do not think any honorable member would sanction a patched-up job for a solid town that is permanent and steadily growing. I would not object to deferring the construction of a post-office there if </para>

                                <para>- Considering the honorable member considered the Estimates with this item previously, I presume he understands it. I have not the information as to the rent paid for the present Customs House. The desire is to have all the Commonwealth agencies accommodated in one building - the postal work, the Customs work, and also the electoral work, and ultimately the quarantine work. The postal revenue in 1915-16 was &#163;6,250. Geraldton is an important centre. It is a seaport from which four railways branch out, and it is the centre for a big back country. </para>

                                <para>- It is something. It indicates the importance of Geraldton. It is extraordinary how popular expenditure in a large city is, but once a decentralization policy is pursued, such as expenditure  in an economic centre which must ultimately develop into an -important place on the Western Australian coast as Rockhampton, Townsville, and Cairns have developed on ,the Queensland coast, there is opposition. The departmental  officers  have had some regard for the  future. It is cheaper to do so instead of proceeding in a piecemeal style, and having to tear down and rebuild later on. </para>

                                <para>- There is urgent necessity for building a new post-office at Geraldton. Of course, we can do without a great many works in a time of war, but it is considered advisable that this expenditure should be incurred for the efficient conduct of the postal and other business. The Government are keeping down expenditure to the greatest possible extent, and the works upon these Estimates&#39; are all of immediate urgency and necessity. Geraldton is a growing district, and its necessities have been appreciated. In fact, the work has already been delayed, and the Government have felt justified in placing this first instalment on- these Estimates. We hear the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> complaining of the parsimony of the Government in not doing anything for Queensland; but in order to provide for the efficient working of the services performed by the Commonwealth we must regard the Commonwealth as a whole, and carry out works of pressing necessity irrespective of the claims of different States. </para>

I a&#39;gree with the honorable member for Wakefield that we should not spend money on buildings at this present time if the existing offices can be made to serve. Building is most expensive now. </para>

                            <para>.- The statement of the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> that the proposed works expenditure for this year is larger than that of last year seems to me not to touch the question. What we wish to know now is whether the proposed expenditure of &#163;16,500 oh a post-office at Geraldton is absolutely necessary. Very little information has been given to us on this subject. Although the work is said to be necessary, the money voted for it last year was not spent. A town with only 5,000 inhabitants cannot be called a large one. </para>

                                <para>- Up to the present time, the existing offices have served. As the honorable member for Batman pointed out, an iron shed has served as telegraph office for the City of Melbourne for many years. That being so, a small township should be prepared, at a time like this, to make its present postal accommodation do. It is possible that the expenditure of &#163;3,000 might make the present accommodation satisfactory, but we are not told how the money is to be spent. It might be used merely to pay for foundations for a building to cost &#163;16,500. At a time like this, when private persons put off building whenever they can, we should not commit the country to an expenditure, of &#163;16,500 that does not seem justifiable. </para>

                            <para>.- No one is more ready than I am to object to wasteful expenditure. I know Geraldton, and the present post-office there. Although that centre is an important one, that in itself would not, at the present time, warrant the expenditure of a large sum of money on a post-office there. It must be remembered, however, that the existing building is an abomination, and may be condemned by the health authorities at any time as insanitary for the twenty or&#39; thirty men that are employed in it. The building is an old stone one, and, as Geraldton is close to the tropics, it is often intensely hot. Were the present accommodation condemned, the Government would probably be compelled to get other premises. There are large buildings which were erected many years ago, and were not required for the purposes for which they were erected, which, probably, could be obtained, but they would not be suitable, because they are right away from the centre of the town. Last year money was put on the Estimates for the Geraldton Post-office, but I, as the member for the division in which the town is situated, did not urge the expenditure, because I thought that, this being war time, we ought not to spend more than was absolutely necessary. I think, however, that there should be some amount on the Estimates which the Government could use should it be compelled to do something to the building. The promise of the Minister for the Navy not to do anything until further information has been furnished should satisfy honorable members. If it be shown that health considerations require expenditure, I am sure that honorable members opposite will not object to the money being spent. While the present accommodation may be put up with, the building may at any time be condemned by the health authorities, and then the Government may be compelled to spend a large sum in alterations. </para>

                            <para>.- I suggest that this item should stand over&#34; until more information has been furnished regarding it. As a rule, once its Estimates are passed, a Government does not pay much attention to the remonstrances of Parliament. The expenditure of &#163;16,500. in Geraldton should provide accommodation for a picture show or a circus in addition to , a post-office; it would pay for a much larger building than would serve a town with twice the population. I understand that there are about 5,000 persons living at Geraldton, so the proposed post-office will cost about &#163;3 10s. per inhabitant. At the present time building materials are very costly. Steel has been used a good deal in Commonwealth structures of late years, and it is three times as costly now as it was a little while ago, and galvanized iron for roofing is four&#39; times as expensive as it was twelve months ago. We should let Geraldton put up with its present accommodation until building materials are obtainable at moderate prices. I believe that the people of Geraldton would be agreeable that this work should be postponed, and would commend us for practising economy. The expenditure of &#163;16,500 at this port would not help to win the war, and I believe that when they have obtained further information on. the matter the Government will admit that they have been hasty in proposing to expend such a large sum in a place like Geraldton during war time. </para>

                            <para>. - There is a danger sometimes of Ministers allotting certain sums of money for the carrying out of works which, although they do not come within the purview of the Public Works Committee, may be the foundation for the expenditure of many thousands of pounds. The absence of information in regard to this comparatively small item discloses a very peculiar state of affairs. At this period in our history we are asked to scrutinize expenditure more closely than ever, and we should have an assurance that any works which will ultimately cost &#163;25,000 will be investigated by the Public Works Committee. </para>

The honorable member will agree, after the investigations which he and I, as members of the Public Works Committee, have made of expenditure at Naval Bases and elsewhere, that undertakings carried out by the Naval and Military authorities should not be excluded from the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. If any proposed works should be investigated by that body, they are particularly those carried out by the Naval and Defence Departments. </para>

On more than one occasion the State authorities have extended our tenure, but this year they gave us imperative notice to quit. There is no building in which to carry on the observations in Sydney, and it is therefore necessary to erect new, premises. This work is absolutely necessary, and cannot be postponed. </para>

                            <para>.- If the reasons mentioned by the Minister constitute the only justification for this expenditure the Committee should not agree to it. The erection of this building will not help us to win the war, or to do anything except to measure rainfall and record atmospheric conditions. That work can be very well done at the Observatory in Sydney. I sympathize with the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> when he states that items of expenditure should not be agreed to unless it can be shown that they are definitely and urgently necessary for the welfare of the Commonwealth. This Meteorological Bureau is a luxury. It piles up records, some of which are1&#189; inches in thickness, and members receive copies, which are immediately relegated to the waste-paper basket. That fact provides evidence that economy could be effected in the printing of matter of this kind, which should be distributed only amongst those people in the community wh6 understand it. The provision of buildings for measuring rainfall and wind velocity can very well be deferred to a time when it is not necessary to tax the people so heavily as they are being taxed at the present time in order to provide money for the carrying on of the war. Looking at these Estimates, one would imagine that a considerable saving is being effected in public works expenditure, but when to this total of &#163;1,257,000 is added the proposed loan expenditure we have a combined total of over &#163;4,000,000. These figures as to expenditure out of revenue would lead one to believe that we were making enormous reductions in the Works Estimates, when as a matter of fact we are not. We are here as a Win-the-war party to economize, and since this item will not help to win the war. I move- </para>

                                <para>- They are housed in the Sydney Observatory, where stellar observations are made by the State Astronomical Department. The State deals, not with meteorology, but with astronomical matters. We have been occupying part of the Sydney Observatory, but have now to leave, since the State requires the whole of the accommodation there. I made inquiry as to the necessity of erecting this building, and found that there &#39; was no escape from it. Our officers must continue in the same place, or as near  as  possible to it, in order to ensure accuracy  in their forecasts. </para>

                                <para>- Human efforts are directed to ideals that are rarely attained. But for that we should not be in Parliament. After spending seventeen years in Parliament, as many of us have done, I think we should deal, where science is concerned, with a little liberality and judgment. I could obfuscate the intelligence of almost every honorable member, I believe, if I were to give the details of the work of this branch of the Department. Its work is very comprehensive. There is, for instance,  a  daily weather service. Bulletins, as well as maps, are issued, giving full information concerning the atmospheric elements, pressure, temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind direction, velocity, and sea disturbance throughout the Commonwealth. Again, there are daily rain maps, and daily weather charts and forecasts which, in the majority of cases, are fairly accurate. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think we should suffer if about nine-tenths of our current . civilization were abolished, nor would the people suffer very much if we were to shut up this chamber for a year or two. We have to be guided . by the average in human life, and the nearest approach to accuracy is that which we obtain from men of scientific training. We have established throughout the Commonwealth a number of stations. There are no less than 400 climatological stations and also 5,000 rainfall stations, while a whole series of observations are taken as regard floods, weather disturbances, and so forth. I may tell the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> that I obtained from the bureau some valuable information as to the possibility of agriculture being carried on in the Northern Territory. </para>

                                <para>- No. The bulk of this proposed vote is for buildings. We shall have to erect buildings as near as possible to the site at which we have hitherto carried on these observations, and I have been advised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> that the site proposed is the best for the purpose. I have here a departmental note setting out that the buildings now occupied by the bureau are the property of the State Government of New South Wales, who desire to obtain possession of them as soon as possible. The Meteorologist points out that it is most desirable that his records should not be disturbed, and so it has been decided to erect a building on a site which is State property, but leased to the Commonwealth for fifty years at &#163;25 per annum. It is also pointed out that the present premises are ill-lighted and inconvenient, are very old, and fit only foT a storeroom. I have also gathered, from an oral examination of the officers, that we must provide for this accommodation, since the New South Wales Government cannot allow us to remain any longer at the Observatory. </para>

                            <para>.- The explanation given by the Minister ought to induce honorable members to vote for the amendment. The Treasurer, in his opening statement, said that he would not enter into details, as Ministers in charge of the Estimates of the various Departments would be here to give all the information desired. The Minister for Home and Territories has said that this item relates, not to his Department, but to that of the Minister for Works and Railways, who is not here. </para>

                            in his proposal to reduce the item as an indication to the Government that they should not proceed with the erection of the proposed new building; but I do not agree with his suggestion that the whole of the work of the Meteorological Bureau should be abandoned for a year. The whole value of meteorological records depends upon their permanency and continuity. To suspend for one year the taking of meteorological records in Sydney would throw the whole system out of gear. We have it that the work has been carried on for some considerable time in an unsuitable building, but the records seem to go on. As a member of the Public Works Committee, I know that some most valuable information as to the rainfall in the Federal Capital Territory was obtained from the meteorological records in Sydney. I believe that if the State Government were appealed to we might be allowed to continue in the occupation of the present accommodation, and should thus bo able to economize to the extent of this item of &#163;4,000.

                            <para>.- I should like a little information regarding the item of &#163;11,000 for &#34; Sundry preservative works &#34; at the Federal Capital. I understand that during the last financial year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin,</inline> the Director of Design and Construction, built a railway, or purchased some rails and other material for a railway and a bridge to cross the Molonglo from the existing terminus to what is called, by that gentleman, the proposed civic centre in the capital. I never could get any information as to who authorized the expenditure, but I am perfectly satisfied that this railway will not be of any use towards the completion of the Capital during the time that most of the members of this Parliament will live. I should like the Minister to explain whether this item to which I have drawn attention will cover such expenditure as that on this railway - whether any of that work will be done under this vote, and, if so, what ? </para>

                            <para>. - The expression &#34; preservative works,&#34; is rather indefinite, and I do not know that I can father it; but it covers two principal works. It will be remembered that about two months ago we practically shut down the works at the Federal Capital, and this vote is really to pay for works carried out up to the time we did so. There was a vote of about &#163;20,000 for avenues, but that was knocked on the head, though one, I think the Adelaide avenue, had to be completed up to a certain time, and paid for to the extent of &#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000. This vote is really for the completion of works between the 30th June and when we stopped work. </para>

                                <para>- No, it is practically a re-vote. As to the railway, about which a question has been asked, there is on the Loan Estimates about &#163;8,400 for that work, which will complete the line from Queanbeyan to that part of the city site known as the business centre. It has been constructed for about5&#189; miles from Queanbeyan to the power-house, and it is of 80-lb. rails, and will form part of the line across the Territory. It will run, as I say, to that part of the city known as the business centre, a distance of about 3&#189; miles. I do not know how much, but some work had been begun, including part of the bridge, when we ceased work; and it was suggested to me that it would be just as well to finish it. I know there will be a doubt about the expediency of doing so; and at first Cabinet intended not to go on with it, but the matter was considered, and it was thought better to complete the work. It means the finishing of the construction of what is called  the tramway, or that portion of the line from the power-house, and it will cost about &#163;8,000. </para>

                                <para>- A bridge has to be put across the Molonglo. I was told that some of the material had already been bought or contracted for, and, asa matter of fact delivered. Not very much of the line had been built, but I believe that practically all the material had been ordered or delivered. I was told that it would help the development of the agricultural interests of the Territory. At present, we receive about &#163;28,000 a year in rents, though the actual cash received is about &#163;23,000, the balance representing concessions, or covenants entered into by the lessee to clear the ground of rabbits, erect fencing, and do other work. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. We have spent about &#163;661,000 in the purchase of land, and we must try to guard ourselves against loss. There is a vote on the Estimates of about &#163;112,000 in connexion with land acquired, but in dispute and not paid for. I went into the matter very carefully, and, as I say, I waa informed that the continuation of the line would help the development of the agricultural interests. I do not know that it will have any great effect at once, for I think we shall not get very much return from the Territory until the Capital is built, and there is population there. However, we have purchased nearly 200, 000 acres of land, and it is our duty to make the best of it; and, as one of the instrumentalities, this railway may serve a subsidiary purpose. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister has given an explanation which is voluminous and complete, if somewhat unclear,butIsuppose that it is the best that we can expect. It is time this Parliament arrived at a final determination as to what it intends to do in regard to the Federal Capital. I would not mind leaving this project absolutely alone until after the war, provided that the Government retrench in a similar way, and at the same time, all over Australia. In any case, I think the Government should tell us at an early date what they intend to do with the Capital. As far as I can make out from the Minister&#39;s estimation, the only new expenditure there &#39;to which they are actually committed at the present juncture is that which cannot be avoided in connexion with claims for compensation in regard to land. </para>

I have been an advocate, I candidly confess, of more expenditure at the Federal Capital, but I have not been successful. This expenditure, as the Minister has&#39; explained, is merely to keep going work which has been done, and to pay for material that has already been ordered. </para>

The laying down of a surface line from the power-house to the proposed civic centre at Canberra is nothing but a wicked and wilful waste of public money which Parliament was never asked to authorize. I understood the Minister to say that &#163;5,000 was to go towards payment for material for this work. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking in general terms in condemnation of the manner in which expenditure has been incurred at the Federal Capital. I want to know who authorized the ordering of the material, and on whose authority the work was carried out. Some of us know something about this particular work. Some of us have traversed the Capital site over and over again. With the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Story),</inline> I question whether in the lifetime of some of the younger honorable members of this House it will be proved that this length of3&#189; miles of railway is necessary. If we had called for designs for the erection of the Parliament buildings, or any other big institution near to where Parliament House is to be erected, I could understand light tramways being run to it from the &#39;present terminus of the railway, in order to take material over them for the construction of the building; but the explanation we have had in regard to facilitating the operations of agriculturists is not worth a snap of the fingers. It is not sufficient reason to advance to honorable members with any degree of intelligence for indulging in this expenditure. </para>

I do not blame the present Minister any more than his predecessors. It seems to have been the policy to ask Parliament to vote &#163;300,000, &#163;400,000. or &#163;500,000, and very often the Minister at the table has not been able to supply any information in connexion with the items on which the money was to be spent. To-day we have a party in power which prates about economy, and yet they ask&#34; us to pass this item when the money might just as well have been tipped into Hobson&#39;s Bay for all the utility it will be at the Federal Capital. </para>

                                <para>- I had nothing to do with the selection of Canberra as the site for the Federal Capital. That was the initial mistake, and building a city under the conditions prevailing there will mean that the Capital will cost this country a huge sum of money. But, he that as it may, if I consider any expenditure is wilful waste of money, it is criminal on my part to remain silent. No proof is forthcoming that the expenditure of this &#163;5,000 is necessary, and I do not believe that any authorization was given by this House for it. It seems to me that in some Departments some officers can get the ears and the support of members of Parliament by telling them stories in regard to certain works, and by supplying them with certain information. If honorable members listen to the twaddle of certain individuals who are departmental officers for the time being, and permit the expenditure of money without justification, they are recreant to their promises to the people and to the best principles that should characterize the actions of members of Parliament. Rich as Australia is, I do not think that it can afford to spill &#163;5,000 here and &#163;5,000 there on works of no utility. </para>

I have been there more often than the honorable member, and I have been able to play a little part in endeavouring to save the Commonwealth a little money. I am surprised to hear a prominent economist of the National party saying that! we might just as well go on with this expenditure. </para>

Some of the material has been purchased, and probably some of the work has been done but if other works at the Federal Capital could be stopped at the instruction of a certain individual, this particular work could have been hung up at the same time. Some individuals wish certain work in the Territory to be proceeded with, but not other work. </para>

                        <para>Mr.SAMPSON (Wimmera) &#91;5.51&#93;. -The Minister has stated that &#163;5,000 of the &#163;11,000 that is asked for is to be used to pay for materials already purchased. There is also in the Loan Estimates an item of &#163;8,300 for the construction of a surface line of railway. It is generally agreed that the public works in the Territory which have already been constructed must be kept in good order, and &#39;that a certain expenditure is necessary to that end. But we should not spend anything on new works which are not necessary. As a member of the Works Committee, I have visited the Territory, and I know, that this surface line will not serve any useful purpose except constructional work. As a feeder to settlement it would be of very little value, being only 3 or 4 miles in length. As no constructional work is now going on, the railway is unnecessary. I hope that the Minister will take into consideration the suggestion of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> that the rails and sleepers that have been ordered be stacked and stored, or, perhaps, used on some other railway. I hope, too, that he will take out of the Loan Estimates the item of &#163;8,000 odd, providing for the construction of this surface line. </para>

                            <para>. - The Minister has given a very fair explanation of this item, and I cannot understand the excitement of the honorable member foT Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> in regard to it. It would be well to get a report from the Engineer in Chief for Railways regarding the railway that has been referred to. My opinion is that it is a Griffin proposal, sanctioned by the ex-Minister, and that the Engineer in Chief for Railways knows nothing about it. All matters of this kind should be submitted for report to our engineers, who are as competent to advise on engineering matters as any engineers in the country. If Parliament permits work to be sanctioned without the obtaining of professional advice, there will be a tremendous loss of public money. Parliament should see that Ministers who would sanction works without getting professional advice are not kept in office. Those (responsible for selecting such a Minister should take the blame of the present situation, instead of seeking to gain kudos by excitedly advocating the reduction of the item. No railway should be constructed until the advice of competent engineers has been obtained, and Parliament has authorized its construction. There&#39; are some ugly rumours regarding this particular work. It is said that a job lot of metals was bought. </para>

                                <para>- By the wise man who controlled the Territory. The present Minister is no more responsible than is the honorable member or myself. He is doing the best he can, and is giving the Committee what information he has. We must pay for the materials that have been ordered. There is a howl now about the wasting of public money, but the responsibility should be placed on the right shoulders. There was a Minister in power who allowed &#39;a certain officer to do whatever he liked in the Territory, and ignored the advice of his engineers. The outcry against the item is merely to obtain notice in to-morrow&#39;s newspapers. This sort of humbug and hypocrisy should be put down. </para>

                            <para>.- Last year &#163;80,000 was voted, and &#163;76,622 spent by the Quarantine Department on new buildings and stations, alterations, and additions, including sites, and this year it is proposed to expend &#163;59,442 in that way. In attacking this proposal I cannot be accused of being actuated by State feeling, as the various States seem to be similarly treated. I do not know why this expenditure is needed. I have visited the principal quarantine stations in Australia, and am of the opinion that unless an epidemic be expected the proposed expenditure is grossly extravagant in the present time of war. If there is any expenditure which could at the present time be allowed to stand over, it is expenditure on the quarantine stations. It is proposed to spend. &#163;9,300 at Portsea, bub I venture to say that if that amount be spent there the money will be wasted, the accommodation at Portsea being sufficient to meet any likely demands during the next few years. </para>

                                <para>- I have been through the grounds and buildings, which, in my opinion, are as good as any that could be erected to-day. In incurring this expenditure at the present time, when the prices of material are so high, we shall not get value for our money. A block of land on the Yarra, between the Coode Canal and the old river-course, is being utilized for a quarantine ground. On the occasion of the last outbreak of plague that area was covered with wooden buildings, and the facilities then provided for dealing with plague cases met all requirements. The idea seems to have got into the minds of the men who framed theseEstimates that any buildings to be constructed by the Commonwealth must be of the most expensive and elaborate type. At such a time as this, the people&#39;s representatives should take a stand and prevent money being squandered. </para>

                            <para>. - Although quarantine passed under the control of the Commonwealth some time ago, an investigation of the stations throughout the Commonwealth had to be made. It was found that in some of the States the conditions were such that we had to completely remodel the stations and establish new centres to meet the changed conditions. Last year, the sum of &#163;80,000 was provided for the erection of new buildings and conveniences, and of that sum &#163;76,522 was spent. I shall give to the Committee particulars of the amounts to be expended in each State, and the nature bf the proposed expenditure. For New South Wales we are providing &#163;5,399, of which only &#163;394 is for new works, which consist of sewerage and fencing. The balance is for the completion of works authorized last year. In Victoria, we estimate to expend &#163;9,350 at Nepean and Royal Park. Of that amount, only &#163;1,944 is for minor new works, including road making, fencing, sewerage, and minor alterations in buildings. In Queensland, the estimated expenditure is &#163;12,838, of which &#163;4,865 represents new expenditure, and the balance of the &#163;12,838 provides for the completion of the new buildings at Lytton, Cairns, Townsville, and Thursday Island. It was realized that, owing to their adjacency to the Orient, it was important to have up-to-date quarantine buildings at our. northern ports. Of the amount of &#163;4,865, &#163;1,800 is for the provision of cottages for launchmen at Lytton, as a consequence of the new policy of examining the larger boats lower down the river. Other proposed works include disinfecting apparatus, tramway, and train at Thursday Island, and minor works, such as roadways, mortuary, mooring buoys, &#38;c. Of the sum of &#163;15,000 estimated for South Australia, all but &#163;2,318 is for the completion of works previously authorized. The new work is the erection of a retaining wall to prevent the incursion of high tides at the quarantine station at Torrens Island. Western Australia is another State in which we have had to make extensive provision for quarantine purposes. The estimate this year is &#163;15,415, of which new works will absorb &#163;2,631, which will be used for improving the existing quarantine station at Geraldton, and some minor works at Geraldton and Bunbury. Only &#163;1,440 is provided for Tasmania, and that includes &#163;1,200 for the erection of a caretaker&#39;s cottage and for carrying out other minor works as a commencement on the reconstruction of the quarantine station at Barnes Bay. Honorable members will understand from the particulars I have given that nearly the whole of the money asked for in these Estimates is for the completion of works previously authorized, and that we are not undertaking any new works of considerable magnitude. </para>

                            <para>.- The quarantine service was taken over by the Commonwealth, and a Director of Quarantine was appointed in 1909. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, in 1910, the Government had under consideration a proposal for carrying out works which would bring the whole of the quarantine stations of Australia up to date. Before embarking upon the suggested expenditure, the Government sent <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris,</inline> the Director of Quarantine, on a trip round the world for the purpose of making investigations which would insure the expenditure of money to the best possible advantage. Since that date three or four Ministers have had control of the Customs Department, but I do not think the wisdom of sending <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> on that trip has ever been questioned. Any honorable member who has ever been in quarantine will admit that even the most up-to-date quarantine establishment in Australia - that at North Head, Sydney - is by no means perfect. I understand that most of the money provided on the Estimates is merely for the carrying out of. work that was recommended as a result of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris&#39;s</inline> investigations. There has been one addition to those proposals, namely, the making of provision in Queensland to cope with any outbreak of yellow fever, the danger of which , has been increased by the opening of the Panama Canal. I think that all the money provided for quarantine works has been, and is being, spent to the best possible advantage. Another interesting item in this division is that of &#34; Isolation hospitals for seamen, &#163;9,118.&#34; At the present time, seamen and others employed on vessels who, on arrival in port, are found to be infected with venereal disease are treated in our quarantine stations. I am rather surprised that no part of the proposed expenditure under that heading is to take place in Victoria. I do not think any action has been taken to provide in this State an isolation hospital for such pases. As the result of certain occurrences, the Quarantine Department considered it necessary in the interests of the travelling public to make this provision. On the occasion of my last visit to the Sydney Quarantine Station, I saw there some twenty or thirty persons who had been taken off various vessels, and were suffering from venereal disease. The cost of the treatment of these cases is borne, not by the Commonwealth, but by the owners of the vessels from which the men are taken. Quarantine is practically an insurance against the introduction of disease into the Commonwealth, and we could scarcely spend our money in a better way than in bringing our quarantine stations as nearly as possible up to date. While I have taken, and shall take, exception to other items in these Estimates, I do not think any objection can be made to those relating to the quarantine service. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> proposed to make some reference to the item relating to the Serum Institute. When I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs it was decided to establish that institute, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Penf</inline> old was selected and asked to come to Australia to take charge of it. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that he is. It was considered by the Quarantine Department, which is really a Commonwealth Department of Health, that we should, prepare our own serums. The desirableness of doing so was brought under our notice soon after the war broke out. It will be remembered that there was then a serious outbreak of cerebro-spinal meningitis in Australia, and it was considered that the meningitis serum which we were obtaining from America could not possibly be as good as that which we could prepare here. Such an institute is a valuable means of protecting the health of the people. The question as to whether the Serum Institute should be associated with the Calf Lymph Dep6t at Royal Park is a matter of policy to be determined by the Government. When I held office I was of the opinion that the institute should be established at the Federal Capital. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think there is any necessary connexion, save that the officers engaged in preparing vaccine at the Calf Lymph Depot at Royal Park could also do certain work for the Serum Institute. From a departmental point of view, it would also be desirable to have it at Royal Park, since it would then come under the direct supervision of the Director of Quarantine. Apart from those considerations, I think it would be advisable to have it at the Federal Capital. Every item relating to the quarantine service is designed to give effect to the policy inaugurated by the Government of which I was a member, and under which it was proposed to spread over a number of years the expenditure necessary to improve our quarantine accommodation. Some of the items, such as that relating to the isolation hospital for seamen and the Serum Institute, are, however, absolutely new. As far as concerns the other items, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris</inline> laid out the plan which is now being followed in regard to quarantine, and I do not think that any exception can be taken to the items relating to the Department. </para>

                            <para>.- This is another instance of where works have&#39; been transferred to loan account. Last year, for the construction of conduits and laying wires underground, we appropriated &#163;146,592 for New South Wales, &#163;18,770 for Victoria, &#163;34,080 for Queensland, &#163;15,088 for South Australia, &#163;29,000 for Western Australia, and &#163;7,280 for Tasmania, and this year we are asked to appropriate a larger total, namely, &#163;270,811, the whole of which has been transferred to loan account. Then, this year, no details are given, whereas last year all the necessary information was set out. Unfortunately, the Postmaster-General is away at present, but we ought to be afforded more information in regard to these particular items, considering that over &#39; a quarter of a million of money, which was previously obtained from revenue, is now to be obtained out of the Loan Fund. We have not heard whether it is proposed to go on with this very necessary work, although during the past few years we have been laying the wires underground, and the whole of the experts agree that it is the better and cheaper way. I am anxious to hear the reason why the Government have adopted the policy of transferring to loan, works that  hitherto  have been paid for out &#39; of revenue. In Victoria, as in the other States, some works of this kind have been paid for out of revenue, and some out of loan moneys; and this, of course, must cause difficulty in keeping the accounts clear. I should prefer the Government to follow the old procedure, adopted from, practically, the commencement of Federation, of paying for these works out of revenue. Those honorable members who were here in the first session will remember that, when the Estimates were before us, there was a proposal to borrow &#163;500,000 for various works; but there was an amendment carried, which was taken as an instruction, that, as far as possible, necessary works should be constructed out of revenue. Of course, large works such as those connected with the Capital City and the transcontinental railway, may be constructed out of loan moneys, but it is a different matter in the case of comparatively small items. We ought to have a fuller statement from the Minister in charge, and I ask : What is the policy of the Government in this connexion t </para>

                            <para>. I should quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition were I not fully acquainted with the fact that the Postmaster-General, when I was a member of the Ministry, did all he possibly could to curtail his expenditure for the year. In conversation, he &#34;agreed with me that it would not be wise to go in for an extensive policy of telegraph and telephone work, seeing that copper wire is now considerably dearer than under normal conditions. It is possible to charge certain new works&#39; to loan, but I do not believe in so treating renewal work, such as new poles in the case of .telegraph or telephone lines already in existence. </para>

He also promised that) each Minister would submit the fullest information in detail ; and he assured the Committee that the works necessary for giving employment were confined to the Estimates now before us.

                            <para>.- I must express my utter disgust! and indignation at the- action of the Ministry in transferring &#39;certain items from revenue expenditure to loan fund. Those who have any knowledge of the administration of affairs in Australia know well that in the past, State Governments have been condemned for having spent loan moneys on things for the use of the public which have a very short life. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid furnished Sydney Government House with crockery and spoons out of loan funds. I am pleased that the Government that I supported on my entry into public life decided to spend revenue on works&#39; with lives of short duration. I think I am correct in saying that though copper wire may have a long life the insulation surrounding the wire has a very short life, and that with the destruction of the insulation the copper wire becomes useless. Therefore I cannot agree to the inclusion of expenditure on undergrounding  telephone wires in Loan Estimates. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member had as much knowledge of the world as I have, be would know that a sinking fund is the greatest farce we could possibly have, because, if we&#39; have a sinking fund of &#163;1,000,000, we simply borrow &#163;2,000,000, and use half of it to create the sinking fund. I cannot understand any Parliament entertaining such an unjust and erroneous system pf administering the affairs of the country as to spend loan funds on  undergrounding  wires for the telephone services. A poverty-stricken private firm might issue debentures in order to run it&#39;s concern, but even .then its debentures would not have more than a few years&#39; life. Here we have a Government with a large revenue proposing to spend loan moneys on work that will have a very short life. A Papuan or an Australian aboriginal with a large sum of loan money at his back could manage the affairs of Australia as well as honorable members opposite are managing them now. No schoolboy would be so lacking in intelligence as to spend loan moneys on laying telephone wires underground. Since the telephones were first instituted in Sydney about twenty-five years ago the system has been altered five or six times, and we do not know that we have even now the most perfect system in operation. To ask the Parliament of Australia to permit of telephone wires, switchboards, and other telephone material being purchased out of loan moneys is to ask it to consent to the administration of affairs in a manner that is diametrically opposed to the best interests of the Commonwealth. It is asking unborn generations to pay for the telephones which we use to-day 3 I do not want my children&#39;s children tt&#62; pay for any advantages that I enjoy and should pay for. These telephone wires must deteriorate. The best insulation has not more than a life of ten years. The honorable member for Wakefield stated this afternoon that the Committee ought to accept the promise of the Minister for the Navy in regard to not proceeding with certain works, but my experience in this Parliament, and what I have seen in the New South Wales Parliament, tells me that when the Government of the day gets its Estimates, it does not care a snap of the fingers for what members may say. Parliamentary criticism then is of no more effect than a mustard poultice on a wooden leg for the curing of a cold. </para>

                        <para>Unless we block these Estimates until some definite promise has been obtained from the Ministry, we shall not secure the reforms that we desire. It will be a disgrace to Parliament if we permit the charging to Loan Fund- of works which, in their nature, can have but a very short life. There is nothing in regard, to which members are, as a rule, so devoid of knowledge as the items which make up a set of Estimates, and I am more convinced of that at the present time than I ever was before. My present attitude is determined by principle, and would be the same if any other Government were in power. I take a keen interest in financial matters, and read everything relating to finance that comes my way. I admire a certain weekly journal for its contention that the State Parliaments and this Parliament have always been too ready to place to. loan account expenditure which should be borne out of revenue. Although the British Parliament is composed largely of lawyers and railway magnates, it is more careful in financial matters than are Australian politicians. But, even in the House of Commons, the conclusion has been come to that honorable members should have more information respecting Estimates than they have hitherto had, and arrangements have been made to that end. It is no pleasure to me to oppose the passing of these Estimates. My desire is to give the Government every assistance. I have prayed to God that it may bring forward some measure which will help to the winning of the war, but I cannot remain silent when it is proposed to pay for perishable works out of loan. We should get from the Government the promise that this will not be done. </para>

It is not expected that the whole of &#34;the equipment for which orders have gone forward will be available and installed this year, but I know that the Postmaster-General is very anxious to proceed with the work. </para>

                            <para>.- I am sorry that the Postmaster-General is not present.  When we  reach the main items I hope that honorable members generally, and especially those who represent country constituencies, will have something to say in regard to the administration of the Postal Department in relation to the out-back districts. The way those districts are treated in the matter of mail and telephone services is absolutely disgraceful. We are always expressing a desire to get people to go out back and build up the country, and when they go there, Parliament will give them nothing. There is no greater enemy to the man in the back country than this Parliament. Everything that is required for the cities is given at once, but if a telephone or mail service is desired for a country district, the people are at once asked how much money they are prepared to guaranteed It is said, &#34; This service will not pay. Put up 50 per cent, of any estimated loss upon it, erect posts along the route, and assist, us generously in building the line.&#34; The way in which the Department is treating out-back settlers is disgraceful. Only the other day the residents of a little country district were told that,&#39; unless they contributed &#163;20 2s. a year towards an estimated loss of &#163;40 a year on a projected mail service, they could not have it. A similar condition of affairs exists in regard to the telephone system. A perusal of the Postmaster-General&#39;s report will show that an enormous loss has been sustained on telephone services within the metropolitan areas throughout Australia during the past two or three years. In the Sydney metropolitan area, for example, the loss the year before last amounted to &#163;146,000, and last year to &#163;116,000. Yet the people of Sydney have never been asked to guarantee a single sixpence of that loss. But when it is proposed to confer a few of the benefits of civilization on settlers in remote parts of this continent, they are told that they must furnish substantial guarantees against possible loss. </para>

The Postmaster-General is not present, and, therefore, we cannot obtain an answer to our inquiries in connexion with it. It is a pity that, in the matter of mail services and telephonic communication, more consideration is not extended to the country districts. If any of those services ought to pay, certainly they ought to pay within the city areas. </para>

                                <para>-No. Sydney occupies the worst position. &#39;I find, however, that in <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales the loss on these services last year aggregated &#163;142,000, of which &#163;116,000 represented the loss within the metropolitan area of Sydney. There were also big losses in Melbourne and Perth. All these city services should be compelled to pay before the country districts are called upon to furnish guarantees. The Department is treating the rural areas of the Commonwealth altogether too harshly. Indeed, there seems to be a disposition on the part of the Government to refuse country districts the postal and telephonic facilities which they so urgently require. Only the other day I received from the Postal Department a memorandum to the effect that the establishment of a telephone service for a distance of 25 miles in the country would cost &#163;50 per mile. </para>

                                <para>- I have often heard that statement made. But the honorable member for Parkes has had some experience of the Public Service, and he knows that it is the feeders to our main-line system which make that system pay. Every honorable member will recognise that if it were not for the little bit of back country that is being served with means of communication there would be no cities. However, I shall defer my remarks upon this question until the Postmaster-General is present. I hope that the Government will see that settlers in remote country areas are provided with some of the conveniences of civilization. </para>

                                <para>-Then there is another item of &#163;83,900 for &#34;new switchboards and extensions&#34; in that State. Where are they to be placed? I would direct the attention of honorable members to the fact that we now have in office a Treasurer who prides himself that he has had twenty years&#39; experience in that capacity. So that, unless one has had an experience as Treasurer of at least five or ten years, he cannot offer a suggestion to the honorable gentleman without being informed that he knows very little about the subject of which he is speaking. I invite the attention of honorable members to page 279 of these Estimates, where the Treasurer has apparently decided that he will furnish the Committee with some information. There we find that the sum of &#163;63 <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> to be spent upon the Inverell Post-office, and &#163;3 in respect of the Delungra Post-office. These details show that it was the desire of the Treasurer at one time to give some information to the Committee. In respect of a total expenditure of &#163;6,141 in Division No. 7, with which we have dealt, there are no less than nine different items, set out with extraordinary detail, but in respect of a total expenditure of &#163;171,400 on telegraphs and telephones in New South Wales, under Division 11, we have &#39; practically no information. </para>

                                <para>- No; it is a libel. Mark the revengeful spirit of this National Government as displayed in these Estimates. We have an item of &#163;250 towards the cost of a parcels post building at Brisbane, and &#163;460 for the Caboolture Post-office. Compare those items with the provision made for new services in other States. 1 am glad, however, that the Treasurer has been able to obtain some information in regard to the special items to which I have called attention. It is within the power of a Ministry to order the expenditure of large sums of public money in constituencies that are represented by their own supporters. The present Postmaster-General toured his constituency quite recently, and boasted of the number of new post-offices and telephone lines he had been able to secure for it. We ought to know what money is being expended in the various constituencies in New South Wales. </para>

                                <para>- That does not improve the position. We look to the National Economy party to set a good example. If we failed in that respect- and I deny that we did - it is for the National Government to set a good example by making a fair distribution of Commonwealth expenditure. I do not suppose that we shall find in these Estimates a single proposal to expend Commonwealth moneys in the electorates of Capricornia, Brisbane, or Maranoa. </para>

                                <para>- There may be a little expended in&#39; Oxley, but it cannot be much, since the total proposed vote for Queensland is only a few thousand pounds. We should also know in what constituencies the proposed vote for telegraph and telephone services in Victoria is to be expended. In the event of unification it would be a disastrous thing to have in this House, as we have now, apparently, some fifty members representing New South Wales and Victoria, and playing ducks and drakes with the public money. That is what is happening now, notwithstanding that we have six State Parliaments. The greater part of our Commonwealth expenditure is taking place in the two States of - Victoria and New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable gentleman has directed attention to votes of &#163;70,000 and &#163;83,900 for New South Wales, of &#163;40,881 and &#163;59,094 for Victoria, and also to some votes to be expended in Queensland.  His  complaint is that these votes are not itemized in such a way that honorable members may know exactly what city, town, or district is to be benefited by the proposed expenditure. The Estimates which the honorable gentleman himself would have presented to this House would have been submitted in exactly the same way as these are submitted. The reason why the details sought for cannot be specifically set out as regards telephones is that this is recurring expenditure, and a vote is put down to meet applications for telephones and telephonic extensions. Applications come in for extensions in country districts to meet the development of those districts, and, as a matter of fact, we do not know at the pre&#39;sent moment what particular cases or lines these votes will cover. It is, however, known from the experience of the Post and Telegraph Department that these votes will be devoted in the main, if not wholly, to country expenditure. . A general vote is included in the Estimates for applications for telephones and extensions to districts during the year. People send in applications for the construction of country lines- </para>

                                <para>- I am dealing now with expenditure. Honorable members will see that these items could not be detailed in the way suggested. The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr: Higgs) was Treasurer, and, if he had continued in office, he would have brought up these Estimates in exactly the same way. He would take the Estimates prepared by his officers, and would suggest to honorable members that they were perfectly right, but to-night he has made the alarming discovery that these votes ought to be itemized. I have shown that if the votes were not submitted in this way it is possible that country necessities arising during the next twelve months could not be met, as they cannot at present be foreseen. </para>

                            <para>.- The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> said that it was impossible to itemize this expenditure, and in the next breath he told us that so many thousand pounds were to be spent in installing an automatic exchange at Malvern. The Minister could ascertain from his officers that certain automatic switchboards are to be put in. The honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spence)</inline> will bear me out when I say that we have two automatic exchanges in Victoria - one at Geelong and one at Brighton. </para>

                                <para>- As for my own electorate, we have no exchange, and many of the subscribers have to pay extra rental because they are more than 2 miles away from the nearest switchboard. Some of the subscribers are connected with Hawthorn, some with Northcote, some with Windsor, and others with Central Exchange. Each successive Government for years have proposed to place an exchange in either Abbotsford or Collingwood, and I believe the necessary land has been acquired. As we all know, telephony varies from most other enterprises inasmuch as the more subscribers there are the more expensive it is to work an exchange; and at the Central Exchange the manager will point out to visitors thousands of wires that axe necessary for the purpose of connecting every subscriber with every other subscriber. Sydney, I believe, has a better service than Melbourne, simply because in the New South Wales capital there are more exchanges; and this is one of the reasons why telephony is cheaper in the northern city. </para>

                            <para>. - In very few words I desire to call the attention of the Minister to the recent policy of economy adopted by the Postmaster-General, so far as it concerns country settlers. While I indorse the statements made by the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> I am quite in sympathy with the Postmaster-General in his desire to make two ends meet as far as possible. But there is a limit beyond which he has no right to go, and in his treatment of outside services he can be most rigid and unsympathetic. I have. a good many instances in my mind, but I shall content myself with one. I have in my hand a letter from the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in reference to a town which for thirty or forty years has had two mail services. Those interested are informed that, because the cost of these services is &#163;12 in excess of the revenue, the services will have to be discontinued unless the settlers make up the difference. </para>

                                <para>- It is a service of two days a week. This is not a solitary case. A good many honorable members, I think, could cite similar cases. I urge upon the Department the necessity of being generous to outside settlers who have few of the advantages of civilization. I do not like to speak of the treatment of the country as compared with the city, but I cannot refrain from quoting a few figures from&#39; a return regarding the telephone service in the metropolitan areas of the Commonwealth. In 1914-15 there was a loss of &#163;298,000, while in the following year there was a loss of &#163;190,000 in four out of the six capitals. Brisbane and Adelaide showed a profit. </para>

                                <para>- My honorable friend knows if it did a considerable loss would still be shown. He is aware that the aggregate loss in the Postal Department is much more than what I have quoted. There is no complaint made about this loss on the telephone service in the capitals, and the people in the metropolitan areas are not told that their privileges will be curtailed because of that loss. I wish to impress upon the Honorary Minister that these facilities to country districts are necessary instruments of production. We could not continue settlement and development were it not for the facilities. Does he not think it is going a little too far, when there is a discrepancy of only a few pounds between the expenditure and the revenue, to &#39;fell the people outside, who deserve every encouragement instead of this kind of rigid treatment, that they will have to make up the paltry few pounds, otherwise the service will be discontinued ? </para>

                            <para>.- My complaint is that in regard to postal matters enough money is not asked for. I cannot understand honorable, members criticising these Estimates so severely! It is supposed to be a business Department, but it has never been provided with a sufficient working capital. As has been explained by the Honorary Minister, a great deal of the money which the Committee is now asked to pass is for the carrying on of necessary work which has to be done during the financial year. If the work had to be planned out before voting the money there would be an immense delay. </para>

                        <para>Regarding the automatic telephone exchanges, it is generally recognised that they have proved a very great success. At Perth, as well as at Geelong, when I was in charge of the Department, the Chamber of Commerce took the trouble to ask its members to report their experience of the working of the automatic exchange. On the receipt of the reports, the chamber passed a resolution expressing their great satisfaction with the system. In Sydney the automatic exchange is working satisfactorily, too. I understand that a portion of the new money on these Estimates is wanted to make the connexion complete.- I am surprised to hear that Malvern has only reached the stage when it is to have an automatic exchange. When the war broke out, in 1914, the Malvern exchange was so congested that we had to refuse to accept more subscribers. It was in such a disgraceful condition that no more business could be undertaken. On the Estimates of the Department for that year I put down a very large sum - something like &#163;300,000, I think. We were aiming at an extension of the cables and the installation of the automatic principle in the exchanges. The instruments, of course, involved a very considerable sum. Owing to the war we had a reduction in the number of subscribers. An increase in the telephone rates also affected the subscribers&#39; list. I presume that through the operation of these two factors, more particularly the war. the Department has had to struggle along. &#39; It is really, surprising to me that it has been able to exist so long with the money at its disposal. The very large sum which I had put on my Estimates was cut down by the desire of the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher;</inline> otherwise, more automatic exchanges would have been in operation to-day. </para>
                        <para>I desire to say a few words regarding the difference between Sydney and Melbourne. It is, and always will be, far more costly to establish and work a service in Sydney.&#39; The country is very rough, the city is divided by the harbor waters, ^ the cables have sometimes to be put under the water, and the streets are very crooked, many of t.hem running into dead ends. Solid rock has to be cut to lay the cables. In Melbourne we find alluvial formation and long streets. There is no comparison between the&#176; two cities as regards overhead wires. Sydney is more subject to storms than is Melbourne. The repairs cost more, and there are far more angles to be run. These reasons often explain the difference in the estimated and actual cost of the original work and the difference between the estimated and actual cost of working. The Department has always lacked sufficient working capital. At the same time, as it is a Government Department, I recognise that it is proper that the Estimates of any work should come before Parliament for approval, particularly in regard to the larger works that have to be planned some time ahead. The Collingwood exchange is a case in point. </para>

                                <para>- When I was Postmaster-General there was an idea of making a re-arrangement in regard to that particular exchange for the purpose of connecting the existing subscribers. The work was  mapped  out, but pressure upon the finances prevented the completion of the scheme. It is three years since we planned these automatic exchanges, and I am surprised that it has taken so long to supply particulars of all these works. I see no reason why there should be any hesitation in giving information as to when they will be put in hand. My complaint in regard to the other expenditure that is not specified is that the amount is not big enough. The Postmaster-General is absent, but there will be another opportunity of bringing matters under his attention. , </para>

                        <para>I agree with the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that the country interests are unfairly treated. I do not think that people should be called upon to give guarantees. My idea was to raise the charges, and in that way make the people pay for the service given. The Postmaster-General has had under consideration for some time some suggestions that I have put before him in regard to giving improved facilities in country districts, and I know that he is collecting information in regard to the matter. I was very much surprised to &#39;find that the telephone exchanges in fairly large towns in the Darwin electorate were closed at 6 o&#39;clock. For instance, Ulverstone formerly had a continuous service, but the Department increased the amount of revenue which would justify a continuous service, from &#163;150 to &#163;250, and as the people of that town were not able to provide a revenue of &#163;250, although they were able to provide within a few pounds of that amount, their continuous service was cut off. It causes a great deal of annoyance to the people of the town. In the neighbourhood  of these towns in the Darwin electorate the -problem of closer settlement has been solved. There are small farms of 50 acres and 100 acres of rich land, so that the farm houses are very close together. The farmers are willing to use the telephone service, but as they work away from their houses during the day, the exchange is closed by the time they get home to their tea. I have urged the Minister to extend the hour to 8 o&#39;clock. This would enable the farmers who have the telephone to do their business when they return from their work at night, and I am .sure it would lead to yan extension of the use of the service. In my opinion, the telephone should be installed in every farm house. Iri the case of the neighbourhoods of these towns in the Darwin electorate no great extension of lines would be required, so that the cost to the Department would not be very great. The Minister is collecting information in regard to the cost, and so on; but I have suggested to him that the exchanges should not be closed in some cases until 8 o&#39;clock, and in other cases until midnight. I have also suggested that there should be continuous service in other cases. In the Darling electorate there is a continuous service in towns not a quarter of the size of some of the towns in the Darwin electorate. The Postal Department takes as a basis the revenue received in the particular office, whereas in the Darwin electorate there is a considerable trunk-line revenue between different adjacent&#39; towns. I have suggested to the Minister that if he is to consider the revenue of an office as a basis for deciding at what hour an exchange should close - things must be looked at from the Ministerial point of view as well as from the point of view of the public; he should also take into consideration the whole of the revenue received in a district where there are quite a number of towns a few miles apart. These towns in Tasmania are quite a contrast to towns in other portions of Australia. Par instance, . there are immense distances between the towns in the Darling electorate. </para>
                        <para>Some three years ago I had a draft design which, I think, should &#34;be carried out, that is, a re-arrangement in connexion with the telegraphic section of .the Department. My idea was&#39; to make it self-supporting. The telegraph service in Australia is cheaper than that which is provided in any other part of the world. The public servant in Australia receives higher wages and works less hours than apply in any other part of the world, and the telegraph and telephone rates are the cheapest in the world. The public would not complain if they were asked to pay a fair thing. I agree with the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that the cost of these low charges should not fall upon the people in the country districts. It is a shame that the people in the congested places should not be made to pay more than they are paying. It is unfair of the Department to offer the country people a service only on condition that they share the loss. , That condition is not imposed in the cities, and I agree with the honorable member for Dampier that the big cities are what they are because of the efforts of the producers in the country. I do not want to raise the old cry of town against country, but the Department should be run for the Commonwealth as a whole, with uniform charges and uniform regulations throughout. The times are abnormal just now, but I understand that the Department is now nearly approaching the period when its accounts will balance. Some of the changes made when I was Postmaster-General, in the direction of securing more careful supervision, economy, and efficiency, and cutting out waste* have contributed towards that result. The present Postmaster-General has told us of other steps which he has taken in the same direction, but it has been a big job to get the accounts to balance, because it is not long since the Department was nearly &#163;500,000 behind on its yearly accounts, when interest was included. The general question of what work  should be charged to loan and what to revenue, can be dealt with later , when the whole policy of the Government is debated ; but with regard to the conduit work mentioned, I am in a .position to point out that that has always been paid for out of loan money, because it is very big work of a semi-permanent character. The cables, if laid .down properly in this way, have, according ito the experts, a life of at least fifty years. When the conduit work was begun it was intended to extend it &#39;also to the country towns, because&#39; it means an immense saving in the working of the service. The only difficulty is that if the cables are laid too close in the cities there is a risk of interference from the electric tram lines, but, generally speaking, the views of our experts as to the value of this system are upheld by experience in other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member who has just resumed his seat has indicated that, as far back as 1914, when he was Postmaster-General, he was of opinion that the building of the new automatic telephone exchanges for Malvern, Collingwood, Ascot Vale, and Sydney had been authorized. It is a marvel to <inline font-style="italic">me-</inline> that any factory inspector should allow the Malvern Post-office to be conducted as it has been for so long, with so large a number of telephone operators on the upper story. If any private employer treated his employees in that way he would be heavily fined. In the case of Ascot Vale, I was informed on a Friday that on the Monday morning the erection of the new telephone exchange would be begun. The money was provided on the Estimates, yet on the Saturday morning the Home Affairs Department was notified by the Postal Department not to begin operations, as the automatic equipment was not available. The war has certainly prevented us from obtaining the automatic material essential for these exchanges, but several times to-day I have asked, without receiving a reply, whether the Department is now in a position to inform the Committee if the equipment is now available. The Department has purchased sites in Sydney, Collingwood, Malvern, and Ascot Vale, at a cost of many thousands of pounds, and still holds the land. The Ascot Vale exchange was authorized before the Public Works Committee came into existence, but the other three works were submitted to the Committee, and passed by them. No building operations have yet been commenced, and the reason given is that the automatic equipment is not yet available. </para>

                                <para>- It is to be hoped that this really means a commencement. The delay is costing the Department and the subscribers a considerable sum.. The plan was to place in certain4 areas in the big cities automatic telephone exchanges, which would allow shorter lines to be constructed, and a cheaper service to be given. Sydney and Melbourne have been plotted out in that way, but until the automatic exchanges are established the Department cannot reasonably look to the telephone branch to pay as it ought. The new exchanges, when erected, will lessen the cost to the subscriber and the Department, and create a far better service. I am glad that at Malvern, at any rate, the congestion is to be relieved, and hope that this will be but the forerunner of the establishment of the other exchanges at a very early date. </para>

                            <para>.- J can assure the Treasurer that I will offer no objection to expenditure for the Post-&#39; master-General&#39;s Department, as I shall be glad to see an increase, so far as  country services are concerned; for out of ? total national revenue of something like &#163;35,000,000, this is the only Department which renders direct service to the people; this is the one Department that delivers the goods straight to the family home. I regret to know, therefore, that the funds for the construction of telephone lines will, be less than previously. </para>

                                <para>- Not on country construction. I am not an advocate of reckless expenditure, but I want to emphasize the fact that the installation of the telephone will go a long way towards solving the difficulties of country settlement. At present, every time a country resident, or group of country residents, desires the erection of a telephone line, the proposal has to be submitted to the Department, , which sends an inspector to report on the scheme; but, unfortunately, the Department does not get in close touch with the intending subscribers. In a business of such magnitude, there ought to be close connexion between customers and the Central Administration. The present method is too costly, too slow, and too cumbersome. The people get tired of so much backing and filling on the part of the Department. We talk frequently of decentralization. Surely this is the time to practice it. Steps should be taken to see that country postmasters have some grounding in engineering, as well as general knowledge, so that they may be able to deal with country proposals of this nature. </para>

                                <para>- I do not suggest that the Commonwealth should make additional appointments, but those who do the Commonwealth work should be Commonwealth employees. I pointed that out when the very first set of Commonwealth Estimates was under discussion. There are State employees who although they have been employed continuously for more than twenty years, are still classed as temporary employees. I understand that the reason why the Commonwealth has not provided a staff of its own is that we are always expecting that the Parliament will be removed to a Seat of Government elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>.- We seem to be doing business too rapidly to permit the Minister for the Navy to give us the information which he promised regarding the proposal to expend &#163;16,500 on the erection of a building at Geraldton to house what he referred to as &#34; all the Commonwealth activities.&#34; He promised to give the House an opportunity to express an opinion on that proposal. I should like to know how that will be possible  after the Bill has become law. Was &#34;it part of the right honorable gentleman&#39;s method of getting business through to promise an explanation, and then not give one? </para>

                <para class="block">I may explain to honorable members that subdivision F contains the only new tax. &#39; Subdivisions A, B, C, D, E, and G merely reimpose the rates of income tax which were imposed by the Income Tax Act of 1916. The wording in subdivisions A, B, and C has been altered from that used in the Act of 1916, but the legal effect is the same in each case. Questions have been raised as to whether the wording used in the 1916 Act achieved the purposes of that measure. The Department has been advised that the desired purpose was achieved, but in order to set the purpose beyond all doubt the wording has been altered. But the rates imposed do not in any way differ from the tax imposed in last year&#39;s Act. I do not wish to do more than move the resolution to-night. The resolution will require to be passed in Committee, and then a Bill will be introduced to give effect to it. Honorable members are aware that this tax has to be renewed each year. </para>

It appears to me that the Government are acting in an altogether too previous manner. What is the object of alarming the public mind in this way? The Government propose very shortly to restrict the use of gas. and electricity in the homes of the people of Melbourne. Do they desire to incense the people against the railway strikers in New South Wales? Where is the necessity for these alarmist regulations? </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister is not taking sufficient interest in this dispute - which is assuming gigantic proportions - it is his duty to do so at the earliest possible moment. The strike has arisen as the result of the New South Wales Government endeavouring to speed up employees. A number of unionists have struck in sympathy with the railway employees, and people seem to be very much surprised at their action. Because they have struck their action has been described as a &#34;mutiny&#34; and as &#34;making war on the community.&#34; But those who thus condemn them must, surely, have forgotten that amongst the wage earners and unionists of this country it is a recognised principle that an injury to one is the concern of all. No Government has any right to try to speed up its employees. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook)</inline> a matter which must appeal to him, since it refers to an industry with which he is&#39; well acquainted. I refer to the fact that the Parliament of New South Wales, after a very short discussion, has removed from its Coal Mines Act the provision that only practical men shall be employed in a coal mine. The State Government has taken control of the collieries of New South Wales; and the result of this amendment of the law is that when the Commonwealth requires coal, no coal miner will be prepared to work in them. They will be worked by men who ar_e totally unfit to do so without endangering property and life. This is a very serious matter. The right honorable gentleman knows that the amendment of the law in the direction I have named is an infringement of a principle which was embodied in our legislation only after years of agitation for it. Both the British and the American Coal Mine Acts provide that only practical men shall be employed in coal-mining. No miner will go down a mine to work alongside non-unionists. Regard for his own life and for the property of the mine-owners would prevent his doing so, because he knows that the non-unionists are not practical men. I believe that the Minister for the Navy could exercise a good deal of influence with the State Government of New South Wales, so far as this question is concerned. I hope that he will point out to them the stupidity <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> their action, and the fact that such an amendment of the law will mean a great risk to the lives of ! those who .work in coal-mines. If he &#39; does, he will receive the support of every &#39; honest citizen. Mine-owners and miners  alike will feel that he has done right. I . have received information by telephone from Sydney, from an unofficial source, to the effect that the coal mine- owners will not work their mines under this new arrangement, but will throw upon <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> State the responsibility for any loss of life which may result from it. </para>

I admit its seriousness. May I suggest, however, to my honorable friend, that there is a very easy way out of this difficulty. I hope that he, too, will appreciate his responsibility, and will advise the miners of New South Wales as to how they may very easily avoid all this kind of special legislation. They can do so by going back to their work. They have no wages quarrel, and there are no conditions of any kind that are unsuitable to them. They have had a new award. They made a solemn agreement, which was to extend over three years, but they immediately broke that agreement, after being granted better conditions and very largely increased wages. They, can avoid all this turmoil by keeping to the compact, and honouring it as they should do. </para>
                <para>Mr.West.  -  The Minister knows very well that the coal-miners cannot work unless trucks are brought alongside the mines to carry away the coal. They were blocked in Kew South Wales owing to the trucks not being available to receive thecoal. </para>

It has to do with the safeguarding of our ships, and preventing a repetition of the <inline font-style="italic">Cumberland</inline> disaster. That is all that has taken place. A more vigilant guard must be kept for that reason, and that reason alone. Now, as to the business for to-morrow.
