                        <para>- I ask the Minister for the Navy, in the absence of the Prime Minister, if he will use his influence to obtain for me, as the representative of Capricornia, a reply to my repeated questions regarding the making of Rockhampton a centre for the appraisement of the wool coming from the central district of Queensland. I have endeavoured to obtain from the Prime Minister, and from the Wool Board, full and' complete reasons for the refusal to make what is really the capital city of Central Queensland a wool appraising centre. Is the right honorable member aware that a great deal of dissatisfaction exists in Rockhampton which might be allayed if an opportunity were afforded for the appraisement there of wool from the central district of Queensland ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know why the Wool Board has not made Rockhampton a wool appraising centre; but, in the train last week, I was convinced, in the course of a conversation with some of its members, that to do what is asked would not benefit the sellers of wool in Central Queensland, but would enable another profit to be taken from them by middlemen. </para>

                        <para>- Cannot the Minister give the wool-sellers in the central districts of Queensland any reason why their wool should not be appraised at Rockhampton 1 Is it because of the vested interests of the wool brokers in . Brisbane? There is plenty of accommodation at Rockhampton for the appraisement of wool there. </para>

I have been furnished with the following reply:- </para>

                        <para>It was found that contrary to the methods followed in all other districts the motor ambulance drivers in the 2nd Military District had "been transferred to the Army Service Corps as drivers of motor lorries at 8s. per diem, instead 'of being Home Service motor ambulance drivers at 6s. per diem. The option was given to them of taking up Army Service Corps work of the Australian Imperial Force or being re-transferred to their proper corps. For obvious reasons motor lorry drivers receive higher pay than ambulance drivers. These men are not motor mechanics - they are ambulance drivers. There are no motor mechanics in the Army Medical Corps. </para>

However, we are trying to dry it as best we can, and I hope sincerely that the time will come when the whole matter may be reviewed, reconsidered, and re-adjusted by Parliament. As to a Committee to prepare a Tariff, I think, as I have already said, that there is abundance of preparation. The whole thing has been considered in every way; and all we have to trouble about is giving effect to the recommendations already made, and such others as I have no doubt my honorable friend has in his mind. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member raises a very proper question, and one which I had brought under my notice, in a most painful instance, only last week in Sydney. This seems to me to be a matter of repatriation, and the sooner something is done to establish the Repatriation Board on a proper footing, and establish an adequate network of agencies throughout the country to deal with cases of the kind, the better. I do not think that this is a matter that can be dealt with directly by the Treasurer or by the Government. However, I am only too painfully aware of what the trouble is, and I shall take steps to see if some remedy cannot be applied in the near future. </para>

I have had a case of the kind brought under my notice in Western Australia, and I think it needs only to be mentioned to the Treasurer to have an end put to this abominable disqualification, which goes beyond the intentions of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be glad if the honorable member will give notice of the question. The case to which he refers came under my notice even before I was Treasurer. It is the case of, I think, the mother or some near relative who was in receipt of an old-age pension when the soldier was killed. She became the recipient of a war pension to about double the amount of the old-age pension, and the latter ceased. I do not know that the honorable member for Perth desires that two pensions shall be paid to the same person, and I do not think that that could be allowed as the law now stands. </para>

I have in mind a case of great hardship, in which an old-age pensioner has been offered a temporary job as a watchman, but knows that if he accepts the job, even if only for a little while, he will lose all, or a portion, of his pension rights until such time as he ceases to earn money in this way. </para>

                        <para>- All the information I can give the honorable member is that these are the Maltese who were brought to Australia on the Messageries-Maritime steamer at or about the time of the referendum, and who were carried on, by arrangement with the French Government, to New Caledonia. I have informed the British Government that the Commonwealth cannot admit these Maltese. Prior to that, I may say, we had advised the British Government that we did not intend to permit the importation of any further Maltese during the war; but these Maltese had left Malta before that advice was given. Under the circumstances, which are perfectly well known to honorable members, I told the British Government that these Maltese could not be admitted. Some of these Maltese have come from New Caledonia, and have been transferred to a hulk. They are not in this country by the will of the Government. We are considering the whole question, and have made some suggestions in regard to them. </para>

The legal justification for the exclusion of Maltese, or anybody else, is vested exclusively in this Parliament; and the laws are administered, and will be exercised by the Government. The reasons for the exclusion are sufficiently well known, and I have in part declared them. The Government are now considering the question, and will shortly, I hope, submit a proposition to the House in regard thereto'. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Government take into consideration the fact that these people paid their own fares, and were not stopped by the Government from coming in the early stages? Will the Government consider the question of compensating these people for the expense they have been put to, and the time they have lost while in Australia ? </para>

                            <para>- I cannot admit that the Government is under any obligation to these men. They did not come out here' at the invitation of the Government. Having come here they are subject, of course, as all others are, to the laws of the country, and one of these laws imposes a test for admission. I admit that the circumstances surrounding this case are far from usual. The Government so far has borne the entire cost of the maintenance of these men, and has offered to take them back to the place whence they came. It has also made the further proposition to place them on the same footing as Australian citizens who are enlisting in the navvies brigade for service in the war - to enrol them in that brigade just as Australian citizens are being enrolled. In the whole of the circumstances I do not think they can complain. They have been treated quite fairly. </para>

If any honorable member will make m the House a statement that will permit of a definite answer, I shall be ready to supply that answer. But when an honorable member comes to this House, his object being perfectly well-known since he is a candidate for selection by the league, and follows up his declaration of a few days ago - that we ought to emulate the example of the American colonists who threw the shipment of tea into Boston Harbor - with a statement such as he made yesterday, no answer is necessary. The statement is its own answer. </para>

                            <para>- By way of personal explanation, I can assure the Prime Minister and the House that I should have been the last to put this question but for statements made during the debate last night. ' I refer to statements which I personally deprecate and abhor, but which were made last evening by an honorable member. In view of the fact that they were made, I asked the Prime Minister courteously and in all good faith, whether he had any answer to make to the honorable member in question. </para>

In order to meet that request, the Liberal Government in Queensland in 1914 passed the Meat for Imperial Uses Act, which practically gave them authority to commandeer for Imperial uses a sufficient supply of meat for the requirements of the Imperial Government. 'ine price was fixed, arrangements were made, and they have been going on ever since fairly satisfactorily. </para>

                            <para>- The Liberal Government, at the elections, a few months later, was displaced by a Labour Government, which has continued loyally and conscientiously to observe the principles of that Act, and to guarantee to the Imperial Government a continuous supply of the meat necessary for the troops. The Queensland Government were faced with practically three propositions. Queensland, holding, as it does, practically three-fourths of the available supply of live stock in Australia, had, consequently, a prior hold over the supply of meat. The Government was faced, first of all, with the question of supplying meat for Imperial uses. That was its first consideration. Its second duty was obviously to the people of its own State; while its third duty was undoubtedly to the people of Australia. In carrying out its obligations to the Imperial Government, the State Ministry made a certain arrangement with the pastoralists and the meat-producing companies of Queensland which have maintained that supply, and, so far as that Department is concerned, I do not think any complaint has been made, or can be substantiated, against either the Liberal Government, who passed the Act, or the Labour Government, who have had practically the administration of it. </para>

                            <para>- That is no answer to my statement. As to the first consideration, the supply of meat for Imperial uses, the action of the Liberal Government in passing the Bill and the administration of the Act by the Labour Government have been quite satisfactory. There have been no complaints, and no one, I think, objects to the contention that the Imperial Government has the first claim on the live stock and the meat supply of Australia, from whatever State, for Imperial uses. That requirement having been considered, and satisfactorily arranged, the second consideration - the duty . of the Queensland Government to its own people within the State - arose. In consideration of that duty, the Queensland Labour Government thought it necessary to secure, by arrangement with the pastoralists, a permanent, regular supply of meat for the people of the State. That arrangement was made, the price was fixed, and retail shops were opened. </para>

                            <para>- In Maryborough, Rockhampton, and several other places. Arrangements are in progress for the extension of the State butcher shops to other towns. The Queensland Government fixed the price of meat on the hoof, and by their action roused the antagonism of those whose interest in the business was purely one of pecuniary advantage. The Queensland Government found, as every other Government of the allied and enemy countries has found during the course of the war, that it is necessary to determine the price at which food shall be supplied to the people. Digressing for a moment, I would call the attention of honorable members to the following passage in <inline font-style="italic">Current History,</inline> the monthly magazine of the <inline font-style="italic">New York Times :  -</inline></para>

A famine was threatening the nation in the fall, and this in spite of the fact that Russia had hundreds of millions of surplus bu&amp;hels of grain ? Where was that vast surplus? It was not for sale.

                    <para class="block">Practically the same thing has occurred in Australia in regard to wheat, but I shall not deal with that other than to say that it is one of the standing scandals of Australia at the present time that there are millions of bags of wheat lying at railway stations in New South Wales and Victoria, rotting and food for mice and rats, while the people are paying an extortionate price for bread. With the enormous reserves we have, on account of the carry-over from last season's crop and the potentially good crop of the present season, bread in Australia ought to be half the price at which it is being sold to-day. Practically the same state of things existed in Queensland in regard to meat. Queensland had an enormous reserve supply of meat, but the people of that State were starving in the midst of plenty. Meat was at a price hitherto unknown, and there was no justification for the extortionate prices that were being charged. Allowing for all exigencies of the situation, and for every possible difficulty that the pastoralists may have had to face during the war, there was no reason why meat should have reached the extortionate price which was being charged. The Government of Queensland stepped in, therefore, with the justification that its business was to look after the interests of the people, and supply them with meat at a reasonable price. The result is that the retail price of meat in Brisbane is half the price in Melbourne. Naturally, the Queensland Governments met with considerable opposition from certain vested interests. The Federal Government some time ago tried to get the Imperial Government to transfer to it the contract for the supply of meat, and it is significant that the Imperial Government said that it preferred to continue its relations with the Queensland Government, which were quite satisfactory. In establishing State butcher shops for the supply of suitable meat to the people at a reasonable price, the State Government had to consider the insuring of a regular supply of meat. The stock was in the hands of people whose business it was to defeat the Government administration if they could. For political reasons they were prepared to oppose and defeat every action of the Government in this respect. </para>

                            <para>- I can. The Queensland Government, therefore, had to make some such arrangement as would secure a regular supply for the shops, so that the people would not be supplied from State shops this week at a low rate, and next week be buying from other shops at the extortionate rates previously charged. Let me make 'it clear that the price being charged to the people by the retail butchers was not due to any action or combination on their part with a view to making an exorbitant profit. They were in the hands of the wholesale suppliers, and the price of meat on the hoof compelled them to put up the retail rates. The same condition applies to most other commodities to-day. It is nob the retail men in close touch with the public who are raising the price of food, but the wholesale men behind them who have organized monopolies. The Queensland Government wisely, I think, bought country and cattle stations so that it might raise stock for itself, and thus secure a regular supply of meat for the State butcher shops. It has been stated that the Queensland Government in taking that action was acting illegally, particularly when it refused to allow the pastoralists to send live cattle out of Queensland to other States. We have been told that that action was in contravention of section 92 of the Constitution, which provides for Inter-State free trade. I am strongly in favour of Inter-State free trade, which is a necessary concomitant of Federation. The Queensland Government refused to allow the pastoralists to transport cattle from Queensland to other States, and it commandeered the cattle. A case was argued before the High Court, which held that notwithstanding the provisions of section 92, the Queensland Government had acted legally and within its constitutional rights. All the talk about , t.he action of the Queensland Government being a violation of the Constitution is disproved by the High Court's decision. </para>

                            <para>- That does not matter. The business of a Government is to get cheap food for the people. The argument is put forward that that policy may be all right for the people of Queensland or Brisbane who are able to get cheap meat, but it affects adversely the people of other States. That brings me to the point that the Government's third responsibility was to secure- a suitable supply of meat at a reasonable price to the people of the other States. We are told that the Queensland Government placed such an embargo on the export of meat to other States as to prevent the rest of Australia from getting cheap meat. That statement is not in accordance with facts. As a matter of fact the Queensland Government made an offer of meat alive or dressed to the Government of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The conditions are immaterial. The offer was rejected for reasons which may be excellent from a South Australian point of view. A similar offer was made to the Government of Victoria, and was again refused. Neither of those States had any reason, therefore, for saying that the Queensland embargo on the export of cattle affected their people. It is said that the Queensland Government imposed such a prohibitive condition in regard to the price as to make it practically impossible for Victoria or South Australia to accept the offer. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Ryan</inline> was in Melbourne last week I asked him on what terms he had made the offer, and he told me that the offer is open to-day to the Governments of Victoria and South Australia, and any other State, to get meat from Queensland at the same price, plus handling and;' transport charges, as the Queensland Government is paying for the meat. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I believe that there were some negotiations with the State of Victoria in regard to special lines of meat, but so far as South Australia is concerned the original offer - and it remains - was that it could have meat at the same price as the Queensland Government is paying for it, plus ordinary handling and transport charges. It is clearly evident that the Queensland Government is not out to aggrandize itself at the expense of the other States. It has realized its duty not only to its own people but also to the people of other States, and it is impossible for anybody to say justly that the Queensland Government exercised any prohibitive conditions in regard to the export of meat ito other portions of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I believe there was such a condition in regard to one shipment. I will tell honorable members the cause of the whole trouble. There was a scarcity of stock in New South Wales and Victoria and a surplus of feed. Owing to most beneficial rains the country was in splendid condition, but the herds had been depleted, and what raised the ire of those interested in the stock business was that they were unable to get cattle at their own prices for fattening in order to sell at a profit. They were seeking personal pecuniary advantages. Their only consideration was as to how they could, make money out of the people. Those are the great patriots who refused an offer of a 35 per cent, increase in the price for their wool, and insisted on an increase of 50 per cent. They are the same people ; their concern for the people of Australia is secondary to their own selfish considerations : but I can point out what the trouble is. Some months ago, when the right honorable member for Parramatta was Leader of the Opposition, he said, " We will have to stop these Socialistic enterprises. This buying of cattle stations in Queensland Has to stop." That is the secret of the whole trouble.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corser.</inline> - It would be a good thing for the whole State if it were stopped. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt it would be a good thing from the honorable member's point of view. It is remarkable that while the Prime Minister had behind him a majority of the Labour party in sympathy with the actions of the Queensland Labour Government in their endeavour to secure cheap meat for the people, he was adamant to any requests that came from the right honorable member for Parramatta, and he would not listen to the demand for stopping the action of the Queensland Government; but immediately he lost his majority in this House and in the Senate, and it became necessary for him to come to a friendly arrangement with the right honorable member for Parramatta, he became kindly disposed to the requests made from the Liberal party that action should be taken against the Queensland Government. </para>

                            <para>- I object most strongly to the misuse of the War Precautions Act in this regard. This measure was passed to enable the Governor-General to make regulations and orders for the safety of the Commonwealth during the present state of war, but no one can contend that the regulation dealing with the meat embargo affects the safety, of the realm during the war to the slightest extent. In fact, it is a misuse of the Government's power. On their own volition, the Ministry, without the consent of Parliament then in session or consideration of "the matter by Parliament, have brought' a regulation into force which practically wipes out Parliament and parliamentary authority, abrogates the Constitution, flouts the decision of the High Court, and nullifies everything that may be done by Parliament in connexion with this particular matter. Government by regulation is always dangerous, but it is particularly so during a time of war. There is no time in our parliamentary history when we should be more careful about the protection of our rights and privileges than during war time, especially when there is in force a measure such as the War Precautions Act, which was never intended for any such purpose as that to which it has been applied in this connexion. </para>

                            <para>- The Queensland Government, which has been carrying on this business for the purpose of supplying meat for Imperial purposes and for the purpose of supplying the people of the State with cheap meat, and affording the people of Australia the opportunity of- getting cheap meat, is in danger of having all its efforts nullified. The issue of such a regulation while Parliament is in session is particularly obnoxious. Had Parliament not been in session, the Government would have been perfectly justified, if they thought it fit to do so, in issuing such a regulation; but, apart altogether from the merits of the matter, I ask honorable members to consider the condition of responsible government with which we are faced when, during the sitting of Parliament, and when honorable members are in the House prepared to consider important matters of this kind, and to deal with affaire in a constitutional way, they are simply ignored, and their ideas on such important matters are considered of no account. The relationship between a State Government and the Commonwealth should be a matter for the consideration of honorable members in this House; but the Government have taken upon themselves the whole responsibility of abrogating the Constitution. The High Court has said that the Queensland' Government were right. The Prime Minister says that they were wrong.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corser.</inline> - Under what Act were they right? </para>

I protest most earnestly against this deliberate, regrettable misuse of the powers of responsible government, so far-reaching in its effects. Quite apart from the merits of the case to which I have previously referred, the action of the Commonwealth Government in this regard has been most reprehensible. Why have they so acted ? They claim that they have issued this regulation in order to meet the reasonable requirements of the people of the Commonwealth, and so that the matter of the disposal of live stock and meat may be exercisable by the Federal Parliament It may be news to honorable members, but it. is an actual fact, that the Queensland Government have repeatedly made the offer, and are making it now, that the embargo can be removed, and an arrangement come to in regard to the supply of meat for the Commonwealth, if the Commonwealth Government will only do what they say they wish to do, and that is, fix the price of meat for Australia. But the Federal Government have no such intention. They dare not do it. Honorable members of the Liberal party, who are now supporting them and keeping them in office, are opposed to the fixation of prices. </para>

                            <para>- I use the term " alleged Fusion," as honorable members opposite use the expression as a term of opprobrium. The honorable member for Brisbane knows quite well that the objection to the course of action taken by the Queensland Government was not confined to honorable members of the Liberal party. Several honorable members of the Official Labour party, also objected to it. </para>

                            <para>- I think it will be found that the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs and the honorable member for Maranoa objected to it. I believe that they are not in harmony with the honorable member, bub at any rate the matter was not looked upon in any party aspect. Speaking personally, and not officially, the matter came under my notice first in this way: When the Queensland drought was raging in its greatest severity large numbers of stock-holders - and the number of stock-holders in Queensland is something like 30,000, they are not a few beef barons as has been alleged : many of them are poor farmers stock dying, and they were anxious to get their herds removed across the border in order to get relief, but the Queensland Government issued a regulation preventing stock from crossing the border into another State unless the stock-owner entered into an agreement to pav down in cash 10s. per head for every head of cattle he took across the border, and signed an undertaking that he would return each animal or forfeit the sum deposited by him. The same conditions applied .to sheep. The absurdity of the position was that men had stock starving on the Queensland side of the border on one holding, and had ample grass on another holding on the other side of the border which they could not utilize. The Queensland Government attempted to collect what was in reality an export tax from them before they could get the necessary relief for their cattle. On. the understanding tha there would be Inter-State Free Trade pastoralists bought property on both sides of the border of Queensland and New South Wales, believing that they would be free to go from one holding to the other, but the Queensland Government prevented them from doing so. One man, a small proprietor in the western district of Queensland, who at a very heavy cost had carried his sheep through the drought, had an opportunity of selling so many head across the border, but the Queensland Government intervened, and would not allow him to take his sheep into New South Wales except under certain conditions, and the consequence was that after preserving these sheep all through the drought, he was not able to earn on them a profit of £2,000 which he might have otherwise secured. </para>

                    <para class="block">Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, who was also a member of the Federal Convention, said that the interpretation sought to be put upon it - obviously leaves section 92 a mere husk, a vain and empty form of words, the sport of each and every State. The States have it in their clear power under this decision to make themselves as they were before Federation, watertight compartments for the purposes of trade. They may, it is held, forbid holders of stock to sell to any one but a single individual named ; that individual need not be resident in Queensland; it happens in this case to be the Imperial Government; it might as well, for all legal effect, be the American Government, or a Queensland meat exporter. If the State can, then, forbid the export from Queensland of the commodity absolutely, it can do so conditionally, and that condition may be the payment of a sum of money - which in pre-Federation days was called a tax. There is scarcely any limit to the State power of overcoming the fine-sounding words of section 92. Never was there a clearer instance of keeping the word of promise to the ear and breaking it to the hope. </para>
                    <para class="block">Those are the opinions of the Judges who delivered the minority judgment. Undoubtedly the decision of the High Court was most unfortunate for Australia, because it throws us back almost to the position in which we were in pre-Federation days. The honorable member for Brisbane has not supported his attack upon the regulations with very strong reasons. He says that the Queensland Government has established State butchers' shops. But it is putting into operation the Meat for Imperial Uses Act; and it says to the meat owners, "We will make a contract with you. You can charge a certain price for meat for Imperial uses, but you must give us cheaper meat for our State shops." </para>

                            <para>- Possibly. No one on this side desires that advantage shall be taken of war conditions to extort unfair prices, but the Queensland Government, by its restrictions upon the exportation of stock, has forced up the price of meat throughout the eastern States. That is an injustice to the citizens of the Commonwealth at large. The intention of the regulations is to use the powers of the Constitution to regulate exports, and to deal with Inter-State Free Trade and the defence powers so that justice may be done to the whole people in the time of war. The only persons who benefit from the action of the Queensland Government in starting butchers' shops are those living in Brisbane and Rockhampton and in a small area surrounding those cities. The stock-owners of the State and the residents of the country towns and districts, as well as the people of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, are being injured. The Government has tried, therefore, to restore the balance of justice. The original intention of the Meat' for Imperial Uses Act commands sympathy, and not one stock-owner in Queensland, nor one consumer there, has protested against the measure, all being desirous to place the resources of Australia at the disposal of the Imperial Government for the successful prosecution of the war. It was not contemplated by the Queensland Parliament, nor by the Imperial Government, that the Act would be used for any other purpose than to obtain meat for Imperial uses, and the Act was not administered by the Liberal </para>

Does the honorable member for Brisbane desire to go back to the old conditions, and make it impossible for a stock-owner, when his stock are starving in Queensland, to remove them to good country in New South Wales, or to take store cattle from Queensland to be fattened in the other States! The object of section 92 of the Constitution was to remove the barriers between the States. It was never anticipated that a State Government would try to set up those barriers again. Yet that is what the Queensland Government has done. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Heavy inspection fees were charged by the Government of Western Australia to keep out fruit and potatoes exported from other States, and as Minister I had to take action in each instance. The object of the Commonwealth Parliament 'has been to make Australia one country, so far as trade and commerce are concerned. The honorable member for Brisbane spoke of the generous action of the Government of Queensland, as evidenced by its . willingness to supply meat to New South Wales and  Victoria. But I am informed it is only a limited quantity that it was willing to supply, and that on its own terms. It acquires stock from the stock-owners on its own terms, and seeks to impose its terms on the Governments of the other States. The regulations will not be administered so as to interfere with the supply of meat for Imperial uses, nor is it intended to enable persons to take advantage of the war conditions and to corner stock or meat, and thus to interfere with prices. But, as it is a necessity arising; out of the war that the people of Australia should be properly fed, and obtain food at reasonable rates, and as the High' Court has held that the Commonwealth Government has powers of action in this regard, it has determined to restore freedom of trade, as far as is legally possible, and thus enable more strenuous efforts to be made for the carrying on of the war to the hoped-for successful end. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister, has covered the ground so well that I have not much to add ; but, as I was a member of the Queensland Parliament when the Meat for Imperial Uses Act was passed, I wish to say that it was never contemplated that the power given to the State Government to deal with stock would be used to show undue preference to a section of the community. During the late drought very many country butchers of Queensland were not able to get meat through the ordinary channels, and were forced to obtain supplies largely from the meat works at Redbank; but the Labour Government, when it started its State butcher shops in Brisbane, commandeered the whole of that meat, and would not allow the butchers in many other parts of the State to get any of it. Butchers in my own electorate, as well as other butchers who- had been accustomed to obtain their supplies of meat in casks from the Redbank meat works for the needs of farmers, selectors, timber getters, miners, . and others, found themselves suddenly cut off from that source of supply. When a protest was made, the reply was given that the meat was required for the State . butchers' shops in Brisbane. Although the Labour Government now in power in Queensland has been in office since May twelve months - one year and ten months - I know of only one State butcher's shop outside Brisbane itself. Does ' the honorable member for Brisbane claim that the supplying of cheap meat to the people of Brisbane is the supplying of cheap meat to the people of Queensland? The people of Queensland are absolutely against what has been done, and at the first opportunity, which probably will be afforded before very long, will show their objection to it in no unmistakable way. What justification has the honorable member for Brisbane for saying that persons who hold properties in the two States should be debarred from moving their stock from Queensland to New South Wales without depositing 10s. per head, guaranteeing to bring them back to Queensland, so that they may not be used to satisfy the requirements of other parts of Australia ? I do not know how any one can say that we have Inter-State Free Trade under the restrictions imposed by the Queensland Government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member would have a very hot time were he to advocate Unification in some parts of the Commonwealth. The people of the' Commonwealth should be protected against actions like that of the Government of Queensland. The Liberal Government of the State made arrangements to supply the Imperial Government with meat for war purposes at 4½d. per lb., but when the Labour Government came into power it proposed to charge 47/8d. per lb. for meat, for Imperial uses, taking 12,000 tons at 3¾d. per lb. for the State butchers' shops in Brisbane. Was that playing the game? Those engaged in fighting for the defence of the country, and the people of the country towns and districts of Queensland, were to be charged a higher price for their meat than the slackers in Brisbane who would not fight. That is the kind of thing people cry out against, and it is time this Government took a hand. </para>

                        <para>.- I am very anxious to know from the Minister representing the Attorney-General why the Government seek to interfere with the Queensland Government in carrying out public ownership and control. For the life of me I cannot understand why the Government have found it necessary to issue a war regulation to prevent the State purchasing cattle or meat and selling it to the people of their State. What is the reason for that part of the regulation? However, I understand that the Leader of the Opposition desires to raise a matter of privilege affecting the honour of the House, and I shall avail myself of a further opportunity to refer to the subject now before us. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a question of privilege, and I shall conclude with a motion. A most important statement has been made in another place this morning reflecting on the honour and integrity of several members of Parliament, and the name of, at least, one member of this House was brought into the discussion. It is alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> that about three weeks ago he was sent for by the  President  of the Senate, and that in the ensuing conversation it was suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> that he was not in the right company at present - that a way might be found for him to get out, or rather for him to vote for the Government proposal to extend the life of Parliament. Subsequently - I am giving, as nearly as I can, the honorable. senator's statement - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> asserts that he was seen by the Minister for Defence - whom he was interviewing on public matters - and that statements were made similar to those made in the conversation with the  President  of the Senate. On his return to Newcastle, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Watson</inline> received two telegrams from the Minister for Defence, one asking him to see the Prime Minister in Sydney, and the other cancelling the first, the Prime Minister not having gone to Sydney that week. When he returned to Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> had occasion to again see the Minister for Defence on military matters, and the Minister for Defence observed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> had probably got confused by the two wires sent to him. To this <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> replied in the negative, observing that the telegrams explained themselves, and he asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> what it was that the Prime Minister desired to see him about. " Oh," said the Minister for Defence, " it is a most important matter, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> could see you now." To this <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> replied, "As I am here, I can see him." An appointment was made by telephone, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> saw the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> alleges, in the statement he made this morning in the Senate, that, at that interview, the Prime Minister asked him to leave the party of which he was a member, and promised, practically, that he would make it "worth while" to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> if he retired from the Senate. </para>

                                further says that the Prime Minister told him that, if he found it difficult to live in Newcastle, where he had been brought up, a place for him could be found elsewhere. In his interview with the  President  of the Senate,
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline>
                                had told that gentleman that he would not be able to face the men at Newcastle if he " ratted " on them in the way suggested, and the  President,  in reply, had made a remark similar to that used by the Prime Minister. That portion of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson's</inline>
                                statement, in my opinion, is sufficient, in itself, to demand inquiry. Honorable members opposite- are as much interested in the honour and integrity of this Parliament as are the honorable members on this side ; and I repeat that that one statement, in itself, is strong enough to demand inquiry. But with that statement by
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline>
                                we have coupled the resignation of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready;</inline>
                                and I say distinctly that some action must be taken by this Parliament in order to clear its name. We have the events in chronological order, and the facts following each other like marbles into a hole, may be read as clearly as can the notice-paper of the House. We read that last week the Premier of- Tasmania was hurriedly called to meet the Prime Minister in Sydney, or somewhere else in New South Wales, and that he left the east coast of Tasmania, where he was staying, for Hobart to catch a boat to Sydney. I repeat that it is for some competent tribunal to ascertain the whole of the facts in connexion with this resignation of a senator. The  President  told the Senate last night that the resignation did not take place until one minute past 6 o'clock; and the new senator has been sworn in this morning. It has been my privilege to be a member of a Ministry for five years or. more, and I cannot call to mind on any occasion an Executive Council held at night. There are honorable members opposite who have had experience in both State and Federal Ministries, and I doubt whether, any could call to mind an instance of the kind. Yet we learn from the newspapers this morning that, following on the resignation of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline>
                                an Executive Council was held. The resignation was wired to the Governor of the State by the  President,  and rightly so; and everything was found to be convenient, and
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline>
                                is now here to take his place in the Senate as
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready's</inline>
                                successor. As I have said, both the  President  of the Senate and the Minister for Defence are concerned in this matter of
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline>
                                This morning I heard the  President  speak in reply to
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline>
                                and the  President  did not deny one single word that was used by the honorable senator. The  President  did say that he considered that everything that took place in his room was private and confidential. But there are things which cease to be private and confidential when they affect the honour of the country. We may be asked to take no notice of these statements because they are uncorroborated ; but it is quite possible that there may be corroborative evidence if a tribunal is appointed. I have no desire to deal with this matter at any great length ; and I never made a speech in this House with more reluctance. But when we see even the slightest taint of bribery and corruption entering into public life, it is the duty of every honorable member, no matter on which side he sits, to " scotch " it - at the outset. I am anxious that we should not indulge in any vituperative  statements, and I am keeping as closely as possible to the matter before the Chair. I move -

                        <para>.- The honorable gentleman has made what, in effect, are charges against myself, the Government, and the members of our party, charges which, in their nature, are grave, the gravest possibly that could be made against public men. I am called upon, on the -spur of the moment, to deal with those charges, and I can only deal with them on the statement as put forward by my honorable friend. I have not had an opportunity to read the speech of the gentleman in another place ; but I shall recount the facts, and leave honorable members to draw their own conclusions. Honorable members know perfectly well that, in order to understand the position, they must immerse themselves in the atmosphere - in the political and party environment - out of which, and in which, these charges have been generated. The Leader of the Opposition has said that an attempt has been made to bribe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> - in so many words, that is what the charge amounts to. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> say that an attempt has been made - several attempts have been made - to persuade <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> to vote the way in which his conscience and his convictions would lead him. Let me now state my own part in this matter, and state it clearly. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> these twenty-five years; he is a man with whom I have worked, and with whom I am, or was, on the terms of close personal friendship ; but I have spoken to him only once since that afternoon when I vacated the chair in the party room of the Official Labour party. On that occasion, because I had been told from a dozen sources what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> wished to do - as I knew him perfectly well, knew the kind of man he was, knew his convictions and his opinions, knew which way he wanted to go - I expressed a wish- that he should see me. He saw me. I said to him, " I want to ask you what you propose to do in regard to supporting our Government." After some little conversation he said to me, " You are right and we are wrong. I wish I had the courages to do what you have done." I said, " Unless you do what I have done you.  will never have an easy moment in. your life. You are a man born and bred in. an environment which makes your present company intolerable to you, and you. know it. You know the kind of men by whom you are surrounded. You know the kind of men who lead the Labour movement in New South Wales to-day;, you know that type of men, and you know that every breath you draw in their company is an agony to you." He said, ' I do." I then said to him, " I ask you to throw in your lot with us - to vote as your convictions and your conscience guide you." He said again, " I wish that I were able to do it." I said, "Why cannot you do it?" He said, "I cannot, I dare not." He spoke about the coming elections. He spoke about, the men with whom he was going, to stand. He spoke about his co-delegates, the selected men who are going to stand with him, and whom he despises and detests. He said so much. He said, " I know we shall be beaten out of sight." I said, " Have you not the courage to do what conscience and commonsense alike tell you is right." He said, " No, I have not." He went on to say, " How could I live in .Newcastle." I said, "Why don't you do as I do ? I represent West Sydney; but I live in Melbourne. Why cannot you live in Sydney anyhow." He said, " No, I cannot do it. I cannot manage it. I wish 'to God I could." There the matter ended. I utterly deny that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> was; approached in any other way than by an appeal to his conscience and his convictions. I utterly deny it, and what is said by the other side to the contrary isa miserable and contemptible lie. The predilections of this man Watson are perfectly well-known to every member of the Labour party. There is not a man in the Australian Labour party who does not know that what I say is right: that between the convictions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> his opinions about the war, about the Empire, about Britain, and the kind of" men who are running the political Labourmachine in New South Wales there is a chasm as wide as hell. Every one knows that. These men opposite know the circumstances under which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> first came into public life - under whose* auspices he stood - and they know who today is running the political machine in New South Wales. They know what I say is right; they know that had he been free to do so he would have advocated strongly the cause for which this Government stands. They know that perfectly well. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> has been interviewed by the  President  of the Senate, it appears; he has been interviewed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;</inline> he has been interviewed by me. On each occasion it would now appear from the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra, he professes profound ignorance of their intention to discuss the political situation in the Senate; he cannot understand what it is these men want to see him about. He sees the Minister three times - each time about military matters. That is the explanation of this gentleman whose probity is such that it is proof against a series of attempts to sap it. He goes again and again into temptation. Why? Why does he do this thing? Why does he come to see Minister after Minister? He does not deny that he did so. He does not deny what, according to the honorable member for Yarra, the Minister for Defence said as to what took place; that he was asked to come over and stand by us. What is there wrong in asking a member of the Opposition to do that? There are in the Official Labour party to-day half-a-dozen men who, since I left the chamber upstairs, have come to me and have said, " Why did you not tell us that you were going to leave the chamber and we would have gone with you "- </para>

                            <para>- Fortunately for me, the evidence does not rest on my bare word. Honorable members of the Opposition now present do not represent the whole of the Official Labour party. There are others who are not here this morning; there are others in another place. However, I pass that matter by. We have as much right to approach honorable members of our old party, and to appeal to them to do that which we believe to be right, as have those leagues of theirs, who tyrannize over them, who have compelled them to abandon their convictions and their conscience, and to vote strictly as they demand. Why are they where they are to-day ? They are there because they have not the courage to stand up for what they know to be right. What are they now? What is the thumbscrew that is now turned upon them ? It is that if they dare to vote as they believe they should, their leagues will strike them off the ticket. If that is not bribery and corruption, what is it? Honorable members opposite know very well what it is. Did not every one of them appeal to me - was there not a resolution asking me - to go to the Labour organizations throughout Australia, and beg them to give the party a free hand in this matter ? </para>

The Prime Minister is charged with the gravest offence with which any man could be charged. He is making his reply in his own way, and is entitled to be heard. If honorable members feel aggrieved by reason of any statement made by him, they may reply, but certainly not while the Prime Minister is answering the charge made against him. </para>

The members of the Official Labour party all know it to be so. The facts speak for themselves. I went at the request of honorable members of the Official Labour party. I went with the object of endeavouring to get the executives to give these members a free hand so that they could vote and speak as their conscience guided them. There are on this side of the House honorable members of the Labour party - members who have followed me - who can bear out what I say. An honorable member who was prominent in asking me to do so - in exacting from me, on the floor of the Caucus, the promise that I would - is in this chamber now. He knows that I visited these organizations. I went to Adelaide, I went to Sydney; I addressed them here in Melbourne. I endeavoured to carry out my part of the pact to induce the. Labour organizations to give them a free hand in this matter. What was that for? If a free hand left them where they were, for what did they ask a free hand ? I went, as I have said, to try to get honorable members permission to vote as they felt they ought to do. It was necessary to cut the bonds which prevented expression being given to their convictions. But I failed. The organizations held over every honorable member the threat of expulsion, of losing the nomination, and of losing their seats. These organizations used every means - and still use them - to induce men to vote against their conscience.

                            <para>- The honorable member for Maribyrnong happened to come out of the room upstairs at the same time as I did, but for quite another purpose. Because he did so, he was arraigned before these men, and asked to explain why he dared to leave the room at the same time that I did. Does the honorable member deny that? There is a reign of terror abroad. No man in the Official Labour party dare move or speak except as the gentlemen of their organization dictate! I have been the victim of the vilest charges ever since I dared to advocate that in which I believe. And this is the culminating point: I speak to a man, whom I have known for twenty-five years, who I know absolutely detests the course he is compelled to pursue, and is pursuing it only because it is bringing in £600 a year. I say to him, " Come over with us. Take your fortune with us. </para>

                    <para class="block">Join this party, which contains twenty-five or twenty-six of the men you have been working with for years." What is wrong with that? Does any one deny that I have the right to offer such an invitation? Does any one deny that honorable members opposite have' used every means at their disposal to detach men from my party ? There are means at the disposal of those men, and the organizations behind them, which they use without scruple. And now, when one man finds himself suspect, and rightly suspect, because his associates know how he feels, and he knows how he feels, compelled, as he is, to remain in company which he detests, he endeavours, by abusing me, as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports did last night, to make himself right with the men who will wipe him out. The Jacobins found that the only way to secure immunity from the guillotine was to be more extreme, more bloodthirsty, and more unscrupulous than those who sought to terrorize them. Honorable members opposite bring this charge against me. I have been, their friend, supporter, leader, since the day the Labour movement came into being. Where the fight for the cause of Labour has been thickest I have been always found. Say what they will of me, they can never say that I shirked a fight. But how have they treated me, their old comrade, their friend, their leader? Ever since I dared to apply - for the first time in the history of the world - that fundamental plank of Democracy, the referendum, to enable the voice of the people to be heard on peace and war, voluntary or compulsory service, they have never ceased to hurl at' me every vile epithet of abuse. What have I done, except to insist that when the greatest of great questions - compulsory military service - was to be determined, the people should have an opportunity of expressing their views ? What other crime have I committed ? My accusers cannot put a name to it. These honorable gentlemen feel their position very keenly. They realize that their masters are, in effect, their rivals; they serve men whom not even the most servile obedience will placate, because their masters covet that which they have. I do not tar all of the honorable members opposite with the same brush. There are men sitting in Opposition who passed through that bitter referendum campaign without saying a word against me, and I never said a word against any honorable member, except the honorable member for Bourke, because of his association with the Industrial Workers of the World. But I said everything about that organization; I said everything about the pernicious influence that is now working in and directing the Official Labour party; and there is not a member of the party who does not know that every word I said is absolutely true. I leave that matter, I have recounted the substance of the conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> I ask any man to consider the circumstances as a whole, to remember that the man who makes this statement is one who notoriously is not sympathetic with the policy of that section of the Labour party which sits in Opposition to-day ; that he is suspect because of that lack of sympathy. The  President,  the Minister for Defence, and I, all say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> stated that his convictions and his conscience led him in our direction. There are honorable members on the Opposition side who know that to be a fact. I asked him to vote as his conscience and convictions dictated. Is that a crime? I told him - and he cannot deny it - " You will never have an easy moment in your life if you turn your conscience down." Is that a crime? I appealed to his conscience, his convictions, and his courage. He did not lack conviction, he did not lack conscience; but he did lack courage. Beyond asking him to throw in his lot with the party that supports me, and to accept its fortunes, good or bad, I absolutely deny that there is a word of truth in what the honorable member for Yarra has stated. I come now to what the honorable member has alleged about the resignation that took place in the Senate yesterday. The honorable member is unable to say more than that the circumstantial evidence supports the charge at which he has hinted. All I have to say on that point is this: Because, in my opinion, it is vitally important that Australia should be represented at the Imperial Conference, because it is absolutely impossible that Australia can be represented effectively unless the delegates leave next week, and because I will never leave Australia unless one of two things happens - either that there is an election or a postponement of the election - I hold that I am perfectly justified in taking every opportunity, when a resignation is rumoured, or likely to be made, to make all arrangements so that, if possible, a majority for the Government may be secured. I absolutely deny having done anything beyond that. I heard that there was a. probability of a senator resigning. I did not know at the time who that senator was, but I was told that it would probably be a senator representing a certain State. On that information I acted. There the matter stands. I absolutely deny having had anything further to do with the resignation. If honorable members require a Royal Commission, or any other inquiry, into the matter, in God's name let them have it. I have related the facts as I know them. There has been sworn in in the Senate to-day a man who was leader of the Tasmanian Labour party, and who is as good a Labour man as sits on either side of this House. A senator has resigned. Of the circumstances that led up to his resignation, other than those which are set out in the newspapers in regard to his ill-health, I know nothing. I positively deny any knowledge, good, bad, or indifferent, of the whole matter. If the honorable member for Yarra makes a definite charge, let it be met, as I have met the one in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Watson,</inline> in a definite manner. But of this accusation, and every other of a like kind, I say that the Government and I have done nothing except to appeal to men's convictions and courage, to endeavour to persuade the&amp;- to stand up for that which they believe to be right, and to tear themselves from an organization that is bent on destroying them, that has declared its purposes clearly, and is proceeding every day to effect them. I have appealed to men on those grounds, and I will appeal to them again. Honorable members opposite know perfectly well the kind of. man I am. I will always fight for what I believe to be right, come what may. I have fought always for my convictions with all my heart, soul, and strength. But honorable members opposite, after having, in the party meeting, resolved by a majority that the course I advocated, namely, the taking of a referendum, was right, have since pursued me with a malignity born, not of honest motives, but of the knowledge that there was no way by which they could live except by denouncing me, whom the organizations, their masters, had ordered them to denounce. It is an infamous thing that I, who have stood with them for years, against whom they can bring no charge, should be singled out by these men for bitter personal attack, and I feel it keenly. But if they want a fight, they can have it. I, personally, have never been strongly in favour of either holding the elections for the two Chambers separately, or of postponing the elections. If honorable members opposite say they want an election, and they mean what they say, then, by God ! they can have it. </para>

                            <para>.- The scene we have just witnessed must be to most honorable members very distressing. I am very pleased that, generally speaking, the Prime Minister was heard in silence.^ A very grave charge has been made against him, and he was entitled to be heard in silence. I gleaned from the latter portion of his remarks that he was agreeable to the appointment of a Royal Commission. He said, " If they want a Royal Commission they may have it." The Minister for the Navy, the Treasurer, the honorable member for Flinders, the honorable member for Kooyong, and a number of other honorable members whom I need not name, cannot rest until ' the whole of this matter is cleared up, not only the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> but also the circumstances attending the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline></para>

                    <para>We cannot blind ourselves to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was the Whip of the Labour party in the Senate. He was a trusted member of our party; in the absence of the secretary he frequently took the minutes at our meetings ; he was a member of the executive of our party; yet, from what I learn, he never even hinted to the honorable member for Yarra, the Leader of the Official Labour party in this House, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the Leader of the party in the Senate, that he proposed to resign his position in the Senate. I hope that the Minister for the Navy will make some reply to the observations that I am about to make. He impressed upon us the necessity for dealing with the motion for the prolongation of the life of this Parliament as soon as possible, and the Prime Minister said that it was imperatively necessary that the delegates should go to London as soon as possible, and that it was necessary to get a decision in the House. What has happened? As the motion must be moved in both Houses, it was given notice of in both Houses, and it was moved in this House, but it was delayed in the Senate. As a matter of fact, it was not moved in the Senate on the same day that it was moved in this House, and other business - the consideration of the statement by the Vice-President of the Executive Council - was brought on for discussion, .and that discussion was kept on from day to day? Why? If the Government wanted a decision as to their fate, why did they not bring on the matter at once in the Senate, and allow honorable members an opportunity of discussing it? </para>

                    <para>Do the honorable member for Flinders or the Treasurer feel that they can go to London before this matter is cleared u,p? The Prime Minister may please himself as to what he does, but they cannot. But I am not prepared at this stage to say a word against the Prime Minister on this matter. Things have reached such a stage that no honorable member should say a single word against a man who is on his trial. The gravest charge that has ever been made against a public man in any Parliament of the Commonwealth, or of the world, has been made against him, and I shall not utter one word against him, for he is on his trial. When the verdict of the Royal Commission is given it will be time enough for us to offer any criticism against him. I am dealing with the Government, and I say that some explanation is due from them as to why they did not bring on that motion in the Senate. We are informed by the press that there was a trial of strength in the Senate yesterday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the Leader of the Government in the Senate, moved to postpone the consideration of the motion for the prolongation of the life of this Parliament, which, we were informed, it was .imperatively necessary to have discussed as soon as possible. </para>

                            <para>- That may be true; but it only supports my statement that the Government were evidently delaying the consideration of the motion for some reason. What was that reason ? Yesterday, a vote wag taken in the other Chamber, and the Senate was equally divided. As we are aware, all members of the Senate have an equal vote, and consequently, the question was decided in the negative. What happened? According to the press report, the  President  of the Senate looked to the Leader of the Government in that Chamber to move the motion having reference to the extension of the life of this Parliament, and the sending of delegates to the Imperial Conference; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> allowed it to fall off the business-paper. He declined to rise and move it, and naturally the motion lapsed, and it was necessary for him to again give notice this morning of his intention to move it. Let me say - and I do not say it in the way of flattery ;. but there are occasions in which one must express these views - I have been opposed to the honorable member for Parramatta, and other honorable members in thisHouse, strongly opposed to them politically, and I do not suppose we shall ever agree on political matters, because we seem to take different views; but I believe the country can expect an honorable deal from those honorable members with whom I am in opposition. I regard them as honorable men, and I put it to these honorable men whether the circumstances in the Senate, in dealing with the motion for the prolongation of the life of this Parliament, do not lend colour to the assertions which have been made that underhand work has been going on in connexion: with the voting in the Senate ? As I waa saying, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was a trusted member of our party. </para>

What would happen ordinarily in a similar case? Would not the Government of Tasmania be notified of the resignation of a senator in ample time to enable them to call together Parliament, or the members of the Ministry, in order that they might consider who should be appointed to fill the position ? Was it possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> to have been informed in the afternoon ? First of all, was it possible for the Tasmanian Government to have held a Cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon, and decide to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> who, it appears, was in Melbourne for some days before, and in consultation with the Prime Minister ? </para>

                            <para>- The Royal Commission should ascertain at what time exactly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready's</inline> resignation was handed to the  President  of the Senate, and by whom. The  President  was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Gardiner</inline> whether he was 'in receipt of the resignation, and received the reply that he could rely upon the  President  to make a statement at the. proper time. The  President  is quite aware of the terms of the Constitution governing this matter, because he quoted section 19, which declares that when a senator resigns his seat by notice in writing, and communicates the resignation to the  President  of the Senate or to the Governor-General, his seat shall thereupon become vacant. It appears to me that the  President  should have acquainted the Senate with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready's</inline> resignation immediately he received it. The Royal Commission should also ascertain when the Governor of Tasmania received, by cablegram, . or otherwise, information concerning the resignation. I understand that the  President  of the Senate says that the resignation was put into his hands at 6 p.m. last night. The Prime Minister, replying this morning to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition on the subject, said that he was aware that the resignation of a Tasmanian senator was contemplated, and that, as was his custom, he took action immediately. It will be news to all of us that it is customary for a Government to take action with a view to filling the place of a senator who has resigned before it knows the name of that senator. Is it not moreover extraordinary that the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready</inline> should have been placed in the hands of the  President  of the Senate at 6 p.m. last night, and that at 11 a.m. this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> should present himself in the Senate to be sworn in as a representative of Tasmania ? We wish to know before this debate closes whether it is the intention of the Government to appoint a Royal Commission. </para>

So, also, the acceptance of a bribe by a member has ever, by the law of Parliament, been a grave offence, which has been visited by the severest punishments. </para>

I said, " What would the men of Newcastle think of me were I to do anything contrary to the wishes of the party to which I belong?" He said, "If you don't like to live in Newcastle, we can find you another place." I knew then that Givens had told Hughes what I said. I replied, " Oh, I could not think of that."

I hope that none will follow his example. Allowance will be made for the fact that the right honorable gentlemen was smarting under the charge brought against him. I hope, as he did not say that the Government would agree to the motion, that the Minister for the Navy will tell us that, in view of the gravity of the charge made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> the Government has decided to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate it.

                        <para>.- The Prime Minister, in his speech this morning, indicated that he was agreeable to the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> and the circumstances surrounding the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready,</inline> and that if a general election were required he would be agreeable to that too. </para>

                    <para>Members oh this side desire both the appointment of a Royal Commission and the holding of a general election, and are prepared to accept both offers. The circumstances surrounding the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready</inline> must be thoroughly investigated by the Royal Commission. </para>
                    <para>When the members of the party to which I belong met last Wednesday, at 2 p.m., I stated that there was talk generally in the Ministerial offices that efforts were 'being made, and inducements offered to some members of the Senate to desert their party, and to go over to the Government. At that meeting on Wednesday a discussion took place amongst the members of the party, before any of the later developments had transpired. It was then decided that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> although ill, was not totally disabled, an effort should be made to have a vote on the motion of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> had given notice, before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> became any more seriously indisposed. </para>
                    <para>Following on that, the matter was again considered yesterday (Thursday). After the adjournment of the party meeting at midday on Thursday it was arranged that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should go and see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> to ascertain whether he was well enough to come to the House and vote during the afternoon. </para>

                        resignation had been received. The  President  would not admit whether or not he had received the resignation, but said that when the proper time came he would make the necessary announcement, or words to that effect.

                            <para>- I think we ought to ask the Prime Minister. The Premier of Tasmania saw the Prime Minister in Sydney on the Monday, and then the Prime Minister came straight back to Melbourne, evidently accompanied, on th© same train,  by the Premier of Tasmania. The Prime Minister could have consulted the Premier of Tasmania in Melbourne without taking him all the way to Sydney, and there is the suspicion attached to the interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline> As I say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> had been pressed as to the mystery surrounding his visit, and then he came out with the statement about the wheat and fruit crops, for the purpose of deceiving the people as to the real nature of his visit. It was not the fruit crop or the wheat crop - it was the Senate crop or the Senate coup ! </para>

The resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> according to the  President,  was received at one minute past 6 o'clock last night. The  President  telegraphed to the State Governor of Tasmania, and, apparently, there was an Executive Council waiting for the telegram to arrive.

                        <para>At a meeting of the Australian Labour party, held on 1st March, 1917, SenatorReady's action was reported. Statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> - I have been unwittingly drawn into the unfortunate circumstances surrounding the happenings reported to us. While temptations were placed in my way to do wrong, I could resist them. I had confided in my New South Wales senator colleagues, as well as the Leader of the party, but did not feel called upon to make any public statement. I am no lover of sensationalism. But the same thing has apparently been tried on a promising young man and brought him to ruin. It now appears to be my imperative public duty to expose what has taken place in regard to myself. </para>

                            <para>- It is not for me to explain. The honorable senator himself said that he could withstand temptation of this kind; that it had no effect upon him, but as, apparently, judging by circumstantial evidence, the same thing had been tried on a young senator, and had brought him to ruin, he felt it his duty to make public the facts. As to whether he followed the correct procedure or not it is not for me to say. </para>

                    <para>I have followed up this matter very closely in the party. It had been publicly rumoured for some time that efforts were being made to " get at" some of the senators, but none of us felt that we could doubt any of our party. Apparently, however, these rumours, which came from a source that lent a certain degree of credence to them, had had a considerable amount of justification. The strongest possible case has been made out for a searching inquiry. </para>

                            <para>- The circumstantial evidence which has been put before the House in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> resignation fits in with the probability that the tactics employed in dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> were applied to him. There is no . need to formulate a charge which would be, in effect, a judgment upon the man concerned. We cannot say absolutely that there has been bribery and corruption, but we can say that there are suspicious circumstances, pointing very much to it, which ought to be investigated. IE is for the Royal Commission to say whether there has been bribery and corruption. </para>

                    <para>As it is, the honorable member for Flinders wishes us to pass judgment before" there has been any inquiry, whereas we have purposely refrained from giving any verdict before the case has been heard. I hope no statement has been made from this side of the House which definitely seeks to convict the Prime Minister of bribery and corruption; but what we do say is that a <inline font-style="italic">prime facie</inline> case has been made out for a thorough and searching inquiry. </para>
                    <para>Towards the close of his speech the Prime Minister said, "You can have a Royal Commission, and also an election."

If there is nothing surrounding this case that will be any detriment to himself or his Government - I will not say the Government; I will not say that mem.Dere of the Liberal party are associated with it - then so much the better for him and his party. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> with the Prime Minister, know something about the matter. I will not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows anything about it.

                    <para>I hope this will be done. I feel confident that the good judgment of members of the Liberal party will lead them to determine that there must be a thorough and searching inquiry into this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- Every honorable member of the House recognises the importance and seriousness of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> in another place to-day, and also the seriousness of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in this House. The urgency of the business to be transacted in Parliament during this week was. appreciated by, not only members of both Houses, but also by the press of Australia. Members of the Labour party regarded the carrying of the motion in reference to the prolongation of the life of Parliament as a foregone conclusion, so far as this House was concerned; but we believed that we had the numbers in the Senate to defeat the proposal there, and so bring about an appeal to the people, which we regarded as the wisest course to follow in order to find a way out of the difficult position in which the Parliament finds itself to-day. As was stated by the honorable member for Cook, strange rumours have been in circulation for a week past. Those rumours were heard by members of the Labour party, and probably reached the ears of several honorable members on the Government side. Naturally, we were anxious to ascertain if they had any foundation in truth. On the meeting of the Senate yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition asked whether the  President  had received the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> and the  President  replied that any announcement in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> resignation would be made at the proper time. We have heard of the inquiries that were then made by Senators Gardiner and O'Keefe, and of the interview between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> After the tea adjournment, the  President  announced that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> resignation had been received by him at exactly one minute past 6 o'clock. In this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> appears this telegram - </para>

                        <para>Hobart (Tas.), Thursday.- The Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lee),</inline> on his return from the mainland tonight, received a communication from the State Governor <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Ellison-Macartney)</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> had resigned his seat in the Senate. As it waa desirable that the vacancy should be filled as soon as possible, an Executive Council meeting was held at Government House to-night, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Earle, M.H.A., formerly Leader of the Tasmanian Labour party, was appointed to represent Tasmania in place of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ready.</inline></para>
                        <para>Prior to his appointment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> handed in his resignation as the member for Franklin in the House of Assembly. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">All those proceedings took place last night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was a responsible officer of the Labour party, being the Opposition Whip in the Senate, as well as occasionally acting as Minute Secretary to the party. He was regular in his attendance at party meetings, and I ask honorable members on the Government side, if a member of their party contemplated resigning his seat, would they not consider it at least decent on his part to inform his fellow members of the party, or his leader, of his intentions? We are told that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> is indisposed; but is it within the recollection of any honorable member present that a member of Parliament resigned immediately upon becoming ill? Such an action might be understood if taken by a man of independent means, but it is difficult to explain when taken by a man who depends on his parliamentary salary for his livelihood. That resignation will require a good deal of explanation to members of this House and to the people. There was another remarkable spectacle in connexion with, the nomination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> by the State Government. There are parties in the Tasmanian Parliament, just as there are in this Parliament; and if our system were to nil extraordinary vacancies in the Senate by this House appointing a successor, is it likely that the Prime Minister, or the right honorable member for Parramatta, would take the responsibility of making an appointment without first consulting his party ? The Liberal Government in Tasmania had this matter under consideration for days, and had decided upon the nomination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle.</inline> Who informed the State Government that this vacancy would occur? The Prime Minister admitted that some days ago he anticipated that this extraordinary vacancy would occur in the Senate, and acting upon the information he possessed, he communicated with certain authorities. The result was that this morning honorable members had the humiliation of seeing the creature of bribery and corruption walking the Queen's Hall, im,patiently waiting to be called to the Senate to take his oath of allegiance. If ever there was anything in the history of any Australian Parliament that called for inquiry by a Royal Commission, it is the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> and the inducement in the form of bribery held out by the Prime Minister to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I am alluding to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> as to the inducements held out to him, first by the  President,  later by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and finally by the Prime Minister. If I ask a man whether monetary considerations are deterring - him from taking a certain course of action, what does my action amount to? Bribery may be an ugly word, but I should certainly be offering that man a monetary inducement. The Prime Minister referred to-day to the previous honorable character of <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Watson.</inline> It was the honorable nature of the man that stood by him in the moment of temptation. If he had not been an honorable man, he could have been induced to sell his party and his country, and this motion would not have been before the House, because, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> extraordinary resignation might have evoked a certain amount of comment, it was only the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> that provided tangible evidence that some one was trying to pollute our system of government. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition is justified in moving this motion, and that his action will be approved by the people. The Prime Minister, in defending himself against the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition endeavoured to justify his actions because of the attacks which are being constantly made upon him by members on this side, and those connected with the Labour movement outside of Parliament. He referred to the good work he has done in the Labour movement in the past, and urged that, because of that work, he should be free of criticism by the members who now sit in Opposition. I shall not deal with the right honorable gentleman's past. My disagreement from him dates from the time he returned from the Old World, and resolved to take a certain course of action. Men have had honest differences in this Parliament, and feeling between them has run high, as it is doing to-day. Our opposition to the Prime Minister is not because of the policy he enunciated on a certain matter, but because we believe that a dishonest attempt has been made to interfere with the rights of the representatives of the people in this Parliament, and to bring about a certain result in the interests of a party, and particularly in the interests of an individual. We cannot get away from the possibility that an adverse vote in the Senate means an election, and probably the postponement of the visit of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the honorable member for Flinders to the Mother Country, and because of the importance of these things one can- readily understand the great incentive there was for this form of corruption to be displayed by certain individuals who were not desirous that their future policy should be interrupted. When a young man 'in ill health to a certain degree and not possessed of a strong will, was suddenly brought into contact with a person of strong individuality and dominating personality, he gave way to temptation, and has passed out of public life, and another person prepared to act at the behest of the same individual has taken his place in the Senate. All this has been brought to light because one man at least has proved himself strong enough and honest enough to resist the offers of the tempter. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard no statement from the Prime Minister or any member of the Government that Ministers propose to agree to our request. If I am assured that a Royal Commission is to be appointed, and that the matter will be carefully investigated, I am prepared not to utter another word, but at the same time I am determined that certain influential gentlemen shall not leave Australia while the people remain in ignorance of what has transpired during the last week or two. I do not wish to prejudge those who are likely to be concerned in the Royal Commission, but honorable members are justified in bringing forward certain facts with a view to pressing honorable members who follow the Government to support the motion moved by the honorable member for Yarra. There are honorable members sitting on the Government side of the House who are as wide apart from members on this side of the House on political questions as the poles, and though I have fought them, and will continue to fight them on the public platform on political differences, I have never accused them of dishonesty or of stooping to corrupt practices. While they are prepared to support the Prime Minister and his Government in legislation that may appeal to them politically or in legislation that may be considered necessary for, the prosecution of the war, the majority of those who support the Prime Minister would not be parties to anything having the taint of suspicious practices about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> resignation, following on the information we have received, is more than suspicious; the negotiations with the Tasmanian Premier and the members of the Tasmanian Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle's</inline> attendance here this morning to step into the vacancy created by a man whose resignation was only handed in last night are more than suspicious; but the interview between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> and the Prime Minister following his interviews with the  President  of the Senate and the Minister for Defence is still more suspicious. This Parliament and the public should insist upon an inquiry. Whatever the faults of this Parliament may have been in the past, it can claim, at least, that it has never permitted anything in the nature of bribery. or corruption to be spoken of without challenging it; and while there may have been considerable opposition to men who have been Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth, and have passed out of public life, it can be said of them that not one person in the community ever held the slightest suspicion against them in so far as dishonest practices are concerned. For the good name and honour and dignity of this Parliament I trust that a Royal Commission will be appointed. Parliament demands it, and the people demand it. In the circumstances I hope that the motion will be carried. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not yield to the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, or to any other honorable member, in the importance that I attribute to any attack upon the integrity of parliamentary government. I have lived enough in public life both in the State and in the Federal spheres to recognise that parties may come and parties may go, and that public and political differences are continually changing colour, but that there is one thing which is the basis of all parties, and nil public life in Australia, and that is the maintenance of the parliamentary integrity of honorable members and of the institution itself. Therefore when we find ourselves suddenly plunged into the consideration of an attack on the Government of the day, which, however it is framed, I cannot take as anything but a direct attack upon its integrity, honorable members on both sides should be extremely careful that the consideration of the matter is gone into in a way that is likely, not only to get at the truth, but also to maintain the honour and dignity of the House. The motion which the honorable member for Yarra has put before the House is a singularly ill-advised one, no matter whether the allegations have any foundation or not. It is one which under no circumstances ought this House to pass. If we did pass it, we should, to get rid of an alleged evil, strike at the very basis of responsible government. No Administration could remain on the Treasury bench for a single day after consenting to the appointment of a Royal Commission such as this now moved for. </para>

                            <para>- The appointment of a Royal Commission is the act of the Governor-General in Council, and is taken on the advice of Ministers. Imagine the absurdity of the position were Ministers to say, " At the request of Parliament, we advise your  Excellency  to appoint a Commission to determine whether we are or are not guilty of corrupt practices 1 " Such a thing has not been heard of. Whether this House desired it or not, no Government could ask the Governor-General to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into its political integrity. Its form is such that under no circumstances should the motion obtain the support of honorable members on either side. When the honorable member for Cook was speaking, I asked him, by interjection, what were the charges, and he replied that I was endeavouring to make him the judge: I was not endeavouring to do so. When an accusation is brought against a man, in either a high or a low position, it is the right of the accused person to know exactly what is the charge that is brought against him. </para>

                            <para>- A Government could not continue to meet the Mouse, to bring forward Bills, and ito perform the ordinary work of administration, while a Royal Commission was inquiring whether its members were rogues and vagabonds, guilty of corrupt practices, and of the worst offences that could be laid to the charge of public men. In one way only can allegations such as have been made be met by a Government. It is for the House to determine whether such allegations have foundation. 1 have said so much on the assumption that these so-called charges have some basis. They are not charges, however. The honorable member for Yarra has shrunk from the responsibility which lies on him as Leader of the Opposition. He made no charge. He is afraid to do so. if </para>

                            <para>- What the Leader of the Opposition has said is that, because some statements have been made in another place, of which we are not in possession except so far that he has told us what they are, he will not take the responsibility of making any direct charge against the Government, but asks the Government to adopt what, having himself been a Minister of the Crown, he knows to be a ridiculous and impossible course. No Government for a moment could take it. The Leader of the Opposition shelters himself from the responsibility of making a downright, clear-cut case for the House to consider. I shall not take up much time, because we have nothing to deal with, nothing that we can catch hold of, nothing but suspicion and insinuation, with a cloud of noxious gas thrown out in an endeavour, apparently, to destroy the man who now leads the Government. When we come to inquire into the real basis of the allegations there are one or two circumstances of rather peculiar suspicion connected with the gentlemen who make them. When did this mysterious conversation, alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> take place between himself and the Prime Minister? How long ago? </para>

Why should he wait until this other matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> resignation seemed to afford an opportunity to fortify a case that he desires to make against the Prime Minister ? Gentlemen opposite are so keen to find a weapon of any kind poisoned with any poison to use against the Prime Minister that they grasp this statement, absolutely contradicted as it is, as if it were gospel truth from end to end. I did not rise to make a speech, for the matter is not in a condition at present in which it is possible for the House to deal with any definite charges. Honorable members opposite do not make any charge. They do not know what the charge is. </para>

Every member, no matter from what part of the House he is speaking, should be heard in absolute silence. I have made an appeal for silence on two or three occasions, and on more than one occasion I have warned honorable members that if they did not obey the Chair, I should be forced to take some action. The honorable member for Bendigo persisted, and I intimated to him that if he did not desist, I should name him. Then the honorable member for Maribyrnong defied the Chair, and said, " Go on, and name all." </para>

                            <para>- In rising to this motion, I do not intend to be drawn into any consideration of the grounds which induced honorable members opposite to make the charges, because these charges are so vague, so indefinite, and without point, that I feel incapable of doing so. I rose specially, to point out that whatever grounds they may have had, or may think they have, for such charges, the position can only be met, not by a request for a Royal Commission, to which in no circumstances could this House consent, but by a charge in direct form with which the House, and the House only, could deal. For ray part I say that, so vast and important is the matter raised now, that the House ought not to rise until it is disposed of. No matter how long we are kept here, we ought to sit continuously until we dispose of the charges. I invite the Leader of the Opposition now to place in concrete form a definite charge of corruption - which he impliedly makes, but not expressly - in order to enable the House to deal with it. </para>

                        <para>. - I understood, when the Prime Minister was answering the honorable member for Yarra in reference to the charge, particularly levelled against himself, that if we desired we could have a Royal Commission. Indeed, the Prime Minister went further and said dramatically, " By God ! if you want an election, you can have it." Instead of the Government standing up to the declaration that they are willing to have a Royal Commission, we have the special pleader, the honorable member for Flinders, giving all sorts of excuses why that course should not be taken. That honorable member said that the proper way is not to have some independent tribunal to sift the evidence and bring in a verdict. I suppose that because three gentlemen are going to an Imperial Conference, and berths for them and eight attendants are booked by the <inline font-style="italic">Euripides</inline> on Wednesday next, it is very inconvenient </para>

It is nothing of the kind; it is a serious charge against the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. The honorable member for Flinders asked for a specific and. definite charge in reference to the offering or an inducement to one of our members to go on the other side and thus place the Labour party in a minority in the Senate. But the honorable member for Flinders had a copy of the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> in his hand. It did not suit that honorable gentleman's purpose, however, to quote that statement and therefore I shall take the liberty of drawing attention to where there is a definite charge made therein. </para>

He knows that if we were to deal with this motion as a charge against the Government there would be a majority of two to one against us, because we should have a purely party vote.

                        <para>.- Yesterday, when walking along Elizabeth-street in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prendergast,</inline> I was stopped by an important gentleman in the city, who said : " Doctor, I hear that two of your Tasmanian members' are ill." I said : " Yes ; but possibly we will be able to get pairs." He said : "I am told that the Government have two other members in the bag." I replied : " It is a damned lie; I do not believe it." Later in the day we discovered that one senator had resigned. Loving that young man as I do, and looking upon him as one of the brightest men in our young brigade, I say I would rather see him dead and in his coffin than occupying the dishonorable position which he is in to-day. I wish to say a word in defence of the doctor concerned in this matter. No medical man will say that a man who is troubled with his heart cannot stay quietly resting on a sofa in this House if he is able to walk about the streets of the city. Some have said that the doctor was bribed. I have not heard that the doctor has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> is not fit to retain his position as a member of another place. I do not believe for a moment that that has been said. I do not know any doctor who will say that a man able to walk about the streets of Melbourne, with trams and motor cars passing by every moment, is not able to lie comfortably on a sofa. There have been men in this Parliament who have died in harness. I allude particularly to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> A. Roberts, who fell dead at the foot of the statue in the Queen's Hall. Some malign influence is at work. Last night after I left this building a member of the press said to me: "We knew over a week ago that this would happen, but we did not know that it would be the man who has now resigned. There is another man concerned, and we wish to know who he <inline font-style="italic">is."</inline> How do these rumours arise if there is nothing in them? We know the record of the honorable member for Flinders in the State Parliament, and that in his profession he is willing to take the part of any trust or combine against the country of his birth. He spoke to-day as he speaks in the Court - for whichever side employs him. He is going to England; but not by the vote of the people, and he will do anything to prevent that vote being given. When I listened to those splendid words which left his lips at the commencement of his remarks, I though I was to hear a speech such as I have heard . from members of the old Victorian Liberal party, of which the honorable member for Gippsland is the sole remaining member. The honorable member for Flinders asks us to formulate an exact charge as if this matter were being dealt with in a criminal Court. Let the honorable member call a meeting in the city, and I will meet him on the platform, and then we shall see where he is. The Prime Minister to-day accused six of us of a dishonorable and disgraceful action. He invited those who could deny it to stand up. There were seventeen members of the Opposition present, and every one stood up. Four were absent, two are at the front, and one is ill in bed . As the allegation was denied by those present, it could only apply to those who are absent, and he dare not mention one of them. Then the right honorable gentleman spoke of his conscience. May the Lord love me. I think of Justice Hodges and his decision, and of the use to which the Moratorium Act is being put, and I conclude that his conscience must be of the most elastic kind, when a man who dined at his table and waits for money which is due to him cannot get payment from the Prime Minister, and the Courts will not order payment to be made. I leave him to his conscience. He seems to be almost a case of paranoia, and I tell honorable members on the Government side that he will use them as long as he can, and when they are of no further use he will throw them aside like a squeezed lemon. </para>

The honorable member for Flinders says that the action we propose is wrong - that satisfies me that it is right, because he is the last man to whom 1 would go for advice as to what the Labour party 'should do. The honorable member said that no charge had been made. I did not read to the House <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson's</inline> statement, but I believe it, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> will be willing to repeat it on oath. Let the Government grant an inquiry. I warn them that this matter will not terminate with the vote this afternoon. This is not the last the House will hear of the bribery and corruption which is absolutely rampant. I say that advisedly. </para>

                            <para>- I make the charge that the Government approached <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> and offered him money to either retire or vote with them. The Prime Minister does not deny that he sent for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> and in his room tried to persuade him to support the Government. He asked those honorable members to stand up who had not said to him that they would have stood by him had they known that he intended to leave the caucus chair. I did not stand up. Everybody knows what my position was on this question. I want an election as soon as possible. The Prime Minister knows that I was one of the first to see him on his return from England, and I made my attitude perfectly plain. Now that the Prime Minister has returned to the chamber, I ask him if he did not say that he was willing to grant a Royal Commission to inquire into this matter. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing that that should be determined by an outside, tribunal. I welcome the Prime Minister's offer of a Royal Commission to deal with this charge and to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> If the Government prefer to follow up their statement of this, morning, their willingness to grant a Royal Commission, and hold a general election also, we are prepared to accept both offers right away . There will be a sickly smile on the face of honorable members opposite if an election is fought on this issue. Whether it is defeated this afternoon by a party vote or not it will, not be the last that is heard of it. Honorable members may be anxious to have the vote on the motion for the prolongation of the life of Parliament taken so that the delegates to the Imperial Conference may get away before the general public have an opportunity through the press of judging as to the gravity of these charges that have been levelled, but I warn them that when the public do learn of what has transpired its future action will not be in the interests of the Ministry, or of those who oppose the motion that I have submitted. </para>

                        way of personal explanation, I wish to say, in regard to statements and dates made and given by me last night, that I inadvertently fell into error, for which I now apologize to you,

                        was expelled on the 15th of September, the date upon which I signed the joint protest. Our meeting was the day before, not, as I wrongly stated, the day after, that event. I confused in my mind the fact of the State executives and councils turning down
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline>
                        referendum proposals with the final act of hostility shown in his expulsion by the Political Labour League executive on 15th September.

                <para>The acceptance or rejection of the proposals by the Political Labour League and councils was a vital matter to the majority of the party. My error, though regretted very much, does not in the slightest degree destroy the point my speech aimed at, namely, that the great Australian Labour party resented the attempt of State conferences to at any time interpose and control its actions, and to punish its members, and that the party made joint and emphatic protest. </para>

                    <para>Whereas, by reason of the existence of a state of war, and by reason of the immediate meeting of an Imperial Conference for the discussion of questions of paramount importance to the Commonwealth and to the British Empire, it is imperatively necessary that the forthcoming elections for both Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth should be postponed: And whereas, in the existing circumstances, this can only be effected by an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: Now therefore this House resolves: That the Imperial Government be requested to provide by legislation for the extension of the duration of the present House of Representatives until the expiration of six months after the final declaration of peace, or until the 8th day of October, 1918, whichever is the shorter period, and for such provision in relation to the terms of senators and the holding of Senate elections as will enable the next elections for the Senate to be held at the same time as the next general  election for the House of Representatives, and consequential adjustments to be mode regarding subsequent elections. </para>

                <para>Dr.MALONEY (Melbourne) [4.32].- I desire to protest while I can that diseased meat is being sold throughout Australia, and is being supplied to soldiers in our camps. It was supplied to transports, and was only refused because it was first examined. Several thousand pounds weight of liver, which was covered with hydatids and fluke, was condemned. When I asked the Minister for the names of the scoundrels who were responsible, I got no satisfaction. Up to the present I have not succeeded in getting a reply to my inquiry, and I intend to announce in the biggest town hall that Victoria possesses that this Government are supporting the infamy of . diseased meat being supplied to the community. I accuse the Government, if they do not take some action, of possibly causing the death of many of those who are operated on in our hospitals for the disease of hydatids on the liver, heart, and lungs. If the Government do not take some steps to check this wrong a terrible curse will be upon them, individually and collectively, as long as they live. </para>
