                        <para>- Yesterday the honorable member for Nepean  asked  me  a  question about the closing of the refreshment room  at  Seymour. I have inquired into the matter, and have ascertained that there was no need to close the room; the public could have been allowed the usual facilities for obtaining refreshment. But the Minister has power to order the closing of the bars of refreshment rooms when troops are passing through a town, and a regulation has been issued requiring that to be done. A justification for this regulation s that, after an inquiry into the death of a soldier, the coroner who presided spoke strongly against the former practice. The closing of the liquor bars is necessary in the interests not only of soldiers, but also of civilians. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the paragraph referred to, and, in the absence of official confirmation, am disinclined to accept it. In any case, such control would be limited in two respects. Great Britain has requisitioned practically all the shipping which flies her flag, and while British legislation governs British shipping everywhere, it does not. interfere with our jurisdiction over shipping in Australian ports. Furthermore, it does not interfere with ships interned here or with the vessels of the Commonwealth Government line. </para>

Every effort has been made since the outbreak of the present unfortunate trouble to maintain a service for mails, passengers, and cargo between Australia and Tasmania, and the extent to which we have succeeded has been made public in the newspapers. On Monday I saw the Premier of Tasmania, and made arrangements with him for the despatch of another steamer to carry cargo and passengers. It is hoped that the whole trouble will come to an end in the immediate future, when the present difficulty will cease. </para>

                        <para>- That is one of those questions easier asked than answered. 1 wish I could say that the silos will be ready, but there has been considerable initial difficulty, both in this and other States. While I believe that many of the country silos will be ready, the (terminal silos most certainly will not. The question of foundations and other considerations make it impracticable to have these silos ready for the harvest. </para>

                        <para>- My attention has been called to a number of combinations which restrict the freedom of action of other citizens in one way or another. I have been told, and I verily believe, that a number of citizens, desirous and anxious to carry on the work of the country, have been threatened that, if they do so, something rather serious will happen. The common rule which ought to be applied to all sorts and conditions of men is that everyman's freedom of action shall be limited only by those restrictions necessary for the welfare of the general community. Just precisely how far a man can be allowed to sell bread at a price less than does another who employs labour, and has to pay Wages Board rates, and who buys flour at a price fixed by the Government, is a question for argument. All I have to say is that, on the one hand, we cannot have sweated labour; and, on the other, we cannot have bakers exploiting the people; and we have to steer between the two. I am not going to say that a baker, if he does not employ labour, cannot produce bread cheaper than one who has to pay for labour. Everybody knows that he can. I do not propose to say that legally a baker or a combine has any right to boycott any person or firm. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot compel people to sell things if they do not wish to do so. I am a little astonished at the honorable member putting this question to me, because he knows perfectly well what the law is. The law says that a person must not charge more than such-and-such a price, but it does not say that he must sell to Jones, Smith, or Robinson; he may sell to Jones, or he may refuse to sell to him. Do not members of unions exercise the same right? Is there not now a spirited controversy in the Courts as to what constitutes a strike - whether it is a mere cessation of work, or whether it is the right of any free man to decline to " turn to " ? These are very interesting psychological discussions, and they fall into the same class as the honorable gentleman's question relating to flour. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to direct my remarks principally to division F of the resolution. The Treasurer informed us that, whilst this special tax is the policy of the Government, he personally is keenly in favour of it, and that though at times a Minister may disagree from a proposal which has been adopted by Cabinet, he, in this instance, is a strong advocate of the policy which the Government have submitted to the Committee. It is very interesting to compare the Treasurer's enthusiasm in regard to this tax with his wobbly attitude in regard to the war-time profits tax, and I judge that, in connexion with the latter impost, he, as Treasurer, was advocating something agreed to by the Government, but not favoured by him personally. In connexion with the war-time profits tax, the Treasurer did. not know where he was until the Caucus met upstairs to decide what the Government should do. </para>

                        <para>- I am comparing the attitude of the Treasurer in regard to this new tax with his attitude on another measure. The right honorable gentleman informed the Committee that the tax  is  to apply to everyman who was unmarried on the 1st July of this year, and to every widower without children . Presumably, a Bill will be introduced to legalize this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- The effect of the Government's proposal is that, even if a man has married since the 1st July, he will still be liable to pay this tax in years to come. I know of no tax that will be more difficult to collect. The earnings of many men in the community have not averaged 30s. per week throughout the year, and they are to be asked to pay about 4s. per week in taxation. No more iniquitous proposal was ever submitted to Parliament. The Treasurer quoted a passage in which the Prime Minister said that the Government intended to accept the verdict of the people on the 28th October last, and appealed to the patriotism of the people to uphold the honour of Australia by maintaining the Australian Divisions at their full fighting strength by voluntary enlistment. If the Government had this taxation in mind when they discussed the points of the Prime Minister's policy speech, why did they not candidly tell the people that it was proposed to impose a special tax of 10 per cent., with a minimum of £10, on every unmarried man between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five? The Treasurer states that the Government are carrying out their election pledges, but we know that if the Government had announced this tax as portion of their policy, many honorable members who are now on the Government side would not have been elected. Not one Nationalist candidate advocated this tax on the election platforms. </para>

We are called upon to deal with this proposal, the Defence Bill, the Repatriation Bill, and the Senate's amendment in the Railway Bill by Friday next. This is one of the most important taxation proposals ever submitted to this House providing, as it does, for a system of taxation such as does not exist, so far as I am aware, in any other civilized country. </para>

                        <para>- Did any question of equity affect Ministerial supporters when they were dealing with the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill ? The estimated revenue of £500,000 to be derived from this tax is to be ear-marked, we are told, for repatriation purposes, and, that being so, we' may reasonably assume that it is the intention of the Government to continue it for more than one year. Does anyone say that it will be fair to tax, for as long as the repatriation fund may be in existence, every man who happened to be unmarried and between the. ages of twenty-one and forty-five on the 1st July last'? What will repatriation cost the Commonwealth ? An estimate of £22,000,000 has been made. How far will the £500,000 that is to be got from this tax go to provide that amount? Every one knows that the repatriation schemes will cost more than £22,000,000; they will cost countless millions. Honorable members cannot justify their action in voting for this proposal by saying that they did so because the tax was intended to provide for repatriation. They know that the intention is to get at some of those whom they think did not vote for them at the last election. This is a vindictive proposal, intended to punish certain persons for not doing as the party opposite thinks they should- have done. When conscription was proposed last October, only sons, among others, were exempt from service. Why are they not exempt from the proposed tax ? Certain persons engaged in farming and shearing were also exempted. Why are they not exempt now? Persons likely to suffer serious hardships owing to domestic find financial obligations, sole remaining sons the sole support of aged parents or of a widowed mother, or of orphan brothers and sisters, the sons of a family of which half the members had enlisted, ministers of religion, and others were exempted under the conscription proposals, but they are not exempted from this tax. The only persons who are exempted now are the sole remaining sons of families of which all the other brothers have been on active service outside Australia. This proposal goes back on the Bendigo policy speech and on the conscription proposal. Every honorable member must know of cases in which sons have been compelled to stay in Australia to support their parents. I know of men who are single and are supporting younger brothers and sisters or parents. In some ,cases the parents are entitled to apply for old-age pensions, but the sons prefer to support them. Why should we tax such men in the way proposed ? </para>

                        <para>- It has never been proposed to compel married men to go to the war, although many have volunteered. As many married men have gone to the war from my electorate as from that of the honorable member. Within a hundred yards of where I live is the home of a married man with eleven children, eight of whom are under sixteen years of age. who, with one of his sons, has gone to the war. I do not say that that is right. </para>

                <para>This is a class tax. It is proposed in defiance of the decision of the people, and it will be difficult to collect. I cannot conceive of any that would be more difficult to collect. Many single men move frequently from place to place. Had the Treasurer proposed to tax all single men of every age, the proposal would be different. By confining the tax to those eligible for active service, he shows that his sole purpose is to force men to enlist. </para>

I trust that the proposal will be defeated, and, failing its defeat, that it will be amended in such a way as .to exempt all who were exempted under the conscription proposals. Anything else would be unfair. The Government, not. content with breaking its pledges in regard to war profits taxation, is again breaking its election promises by imposing a class tax of a vindictive character in order to punish individuals for not having done something which Ministers think they should have done. </para>

                    <para>-[11.58].- I think that the country will be greatly surprised by the proposal of the Government, in view of the fact that during the recent electoral campaign no word was said about it on the public platform. To my mind, the effect of this proposal will be disastrous, and it will nob yield the revenue which is estimated. Once it is put into operation, the public will quickly show its resentment against what is obviously class legislation. Some honorable members may think that to tax single men between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years, and widowers between those ages who are without dependants, may induce young fellows to enlist, but I assert that the effect will be to make the public antagonistic to recruiting. You cannot drive young Australians, though you may lead them. Do the fair thing by them, and they will respond; but endeavour to bludgeon them, and they will resent it and their parents will resent it. A large number of those who voted for Ministerial candidates will resent this proposal as keenly as any other electors. None of them anticipated such legislation. Honorable members should take into' consideration some of the effects of this uncalled for and ill-considered proposal. </para>

                        <para>- No one can justify it. In Australia there are hundreds of young men who are articled to some profession. Probably many of them will enlist when they have served their articles. There are young men serving articles in every town in the Commonwealth. They do not enlist when in articles because no allowance is made for the time they are absent, and because of the difficulty of adapting themselves to study oh return. In many instances these young men are the sons of fathers who, though poor, are careful, and are doing what they can to give boys who have shown marked ability the chance to enter professions. The fathers have paid the necessary premiums, and are keeping their sons going while they are serving their articles. The sons are not earning more than 10s. or 15s. a week, and many of them will not be out of their articles until they are twenty-five years of" age." They know that if they went to the war before they were through their articles their fathers would not be able to do anything for them later. Therefore, they wish to get out of their articles before enlisting. The Government proposes to tax young fellows like this £10 a year. Is that fair? </para>

                <para>Then we have to consider that there are many callings in Australia in which the work is irregular, providing employment for, perhaps, only three or four days a week. In coal mining, for instance, there are men, such as wheelers, whose earnings are 10s. a day, and, with four days available, this means £104 per annum. Is it likely that these men will continue to earn up to £100 if they are to be called upon to pay this tax ? The chances are that instead of speeding up and helping the work of production, we shall bring about a system under which men will determine to earn only a certain amount, and thus avoid this imposition. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, it would be very difficult to get £10 from a man who does not possess it; and we know that a young fellow with £100 a year, who has to pay, perhaps, 25s. a week for his board and lodging, and has to provide clothing and so forth, cannot save £10 in a year. What are the Government going to do with such a man? </para>

                        <para>- The Bill specially applies to men between twenty-one and forty-five who have not enlisted, and who, according to the Treasurer, ought to go to the Front. Why apply this tax only to eligible men if it is not for the purpose of economic conscription ? We cannot escape the logic of facts. The Treasurer himself tells us that the Bill is to stimulate recruiting; and if recruiting is to be stimulated by enforcing enlistment, what does it mean but economic conscription? The right honorable gentleman never at any time during the election campaign told the people that if he were returned he intended to introduce a tax of this kind. No leader or any person of authority amongst honorable members opposite foreshadowed such a measure to the electors, and I venture to say that had they done so they would not be where they are today in this House. This one measure is sufficient to damn the Government in the eyes of the people for having broken faith. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but I believe that the future will prove the assertion to be correct. I feel sure that there are many of the Government supporters who do not approve of legislation of this kind, and on the simple ground that it is unfair. If it is necessary to repatriate our soldiers, and to impose taxation for that purpose, why does the Treasurer not take the wealth of those people who can afford to give it? </para>

                        <para>- If that is the position of the right honorable gentleman, I point out to him that he can tax incomes to an extent sufficient to raise the necessary money, and, therefore, there will be no confiscation. The Treasurer is the very man who has said that, so far as he is concerned, he does not believe in imposing any more direct taxation on the wealthy people of this country. Now, however, he proposes to tax the poorest class in the community, who are struggling  for their livelihood; and all for the purpose of bringing in conscription without referring the question to the people. The Government and their supporters, when before the country, promised that conscription would not be introduced unless the people were consulted ; and the people accepted the assurance. \ </para>

                        <para>- I say that eventually the great masses of the people of Australia will have to carry the whole load in connexion with the war. A Government capable of rising to the occasion, and especially a Government which has advocated conscription, should realize that it is necessary to call upon the wealthy of the country to pay for the war. If they conscript manhood, they ought to conscript wealth, instead of piling up a huge national debt. I have said previously, both here and elsewhere, that this war is a national crisis, and at such a time we not only ought to call upon men to sacrifice their lives, but ought to see that the wealth and property of the country, for the protection of which the men are fighting, pays its proper share of the cost. But when I put that position, the Treasurer is the first to resent it. </para>

                <para>The Commonwealth Parliament have declared lotteries illegal, and have denied the use of the Post Office in their promotion. Yet the Government propose now to ask those who have benefited by something that is illegal to pay in taxation 10 per cent, of their gains for the purpose of assisting the repatriation scheme. I venture to say that a big section of the community will resent any attempt on the part of the Government to get money from lotteries for repatriation or any other purpose connected with the war. It means, if we once enter on this plan, that in the near future we may expect to find Government lotteries instituted. While the Government profess to be very desirous to put down the spirit of gambling, they do not mind gambling going on so long as they get their 10 per cent.; they do not mind Adams getting his 10 per cent, so long as they are similarly benefited. </para>

This is a placard to inform the public that the Government have done something towards winning the war. I am anxious to do everything possible, short of conscription, to help the Government to win the war; but what have the Government done ? What measure have they proposed in this Chamber to help in winning the war? </para>

                        <para>- So it is, but there is a difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Government think that this Bill will help to win the war, though it was never placed before the people, and they do not know that the people approve of it. On the other hand, I say that it will be detrimental to winning the war. There are certain young men who are articled in the legal profession, and are desirous of enlisting immediately they pass their examinations. If we tax them to the extent of £10 per annum, shall we get them to enlist when they have finished their articles? That is only one of many difficulties which will be encountered in applying this tax. </para>

                <para>I oppose the Bill because I realize that it. will not help to win the war.

                        <para>- At any rate, by a large working majority. If the Government had submitted this proposal to the people, they would be justified in bringing down a Bill to carry iti into effect, but the people knew nothing about it ; it has been- brought forward unexpectedly, and it will have the opposite effect to what the Government announced as their policy when they were before the electors. 1 consider that Ministers should give the matter further consideration. I am not in a position to claim that they have not given it mature consideration, but there are times in the history of Cabinets, as well as individuals, when hasty conclusions are arrived at, and certain measures are put forward in order to secure a direct cut to the object sought after. Possibly the Government, seeing that certain young men have not enlisted or done their duty to the country, have come to the conclusion that a tax will compel them to do so. On the surface of it the proposition may be all right from the point of view of the Government, but there is another side to the question. Consideration must be given to the effect that such a tax will have in practice. In my opinion, it will work no good for Australia. In fact, I think iti will be bad for Australia. We are all desirous of seeing these young men volunteer to go to the Front if they can possibly get away, but the effect of this Bill will be to sour them. We can hardly find any man in an industrial centre with £10 to spare at the end of a year. The young fellow who earns £100 in a year has to spend the whole of his earnings in order to keep himself decently. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear the honorable member say that. I have always found that he is one to stand up to his opinions. If other honorable members take the same view and apply their thoughts to the Bill and give consideration to its possible effect, the Government will not carry the measure. Most of the arguments we have heard are strongly against the Bill. The only point in favour of it is the sentimental one of endeavouring to force young men to go to the Front. I hold that the Bill will have the opposite effect, and if we cannot force men to go by this method, there is nothing to be gained by passing the Bill. I have had some dealings with the industrial section of our community - and I think what applies to them applies to all sections. My experience is that if we are reasonable with them and put forward fair proposals, we can get them to respond, but that they resent any endeavour to bring pressure to bear on them. Not only will the young fellows resent this tax; parents also will resent it. If the Government would undertake to refer this </para>

                <para class="block">Bill to the people on a referendum it would be turned down by as big a majority as Ministers received at the recent elections. Thousands of people in Australia who opposed conscription voted for the Government, believing that they would not attempt to enforce it in any shape or form. If those people were given the opportunity of dealing with a measure of this description and the Government which brings it forward, they would reject the proposal and deprive the Government of the support given to it at the recent election. In the Hunter district conscription was turned down by a majority of two to one, yet the Nationalist candidates for the Senate scored a majority, showing that there were thousands of votes against conscription which were afterwards given to the Nationalist Government on the assurance that if the Nationalists were returned to power they would not introduce conscription without referring the matter to the people again. For that reason I venture to say that if this Bill were placed before the people they would interpret it as an effort on the part of the Government to bring in economic conscription or as an effort to bring pressure to bear for the purpose of forcing young men to enlist. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret exceedingly that on the first occasion on which I have summoned up enough courage to address the House I am in a position in which I feel forced to oppose the proposals of the Government as set forth in this Bill. I was exceedingly pleased to hear the Minister for the Navy interject that this is not regarded as a party question. It leaves honorable members on this side of the House absolutely free to exercise their own judgment, and in exercising my best judgment in regard to subdivision F I am compelled to vote against it. </para>

                        <para>- Whether it is a party question or not, the fact does not influence my judgment one iota. If it is a party question, then I regret that I have to oppose my party on the matter. I gave no pledge to my constituents that would necessitate my voting for a measure of this kind. The first thing that excites my suspicion is the fact that the Bill starts by announcing that it is a tax upon incomes, whereas subdivision F proposes that certain classes of men are to be taxed whether they have incomes or not.

                <para>Outstanding fact that colours all my views on any taxation proposals coming from the Government is the fact that over 300,000 men have gone from Australia to the Front, giving up all that they hold dear here, leaving their country and their friends and going to the seat of war and risking death for the sake of their country. From my point of .view every man who does not go to the Front, for whatever reason, should pay instead. My point in regard to this Bill is that it cannot be contended that it is a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> measure for raising funds for the purpose of repatriation or anything else. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care where it comes from. I am expressing my own views, and my reading of the Bill leads me to the conclusion that it proposes a penal » tax pure and simple. It is a tax for the purpose of punishing men who, in the opinion of the Government, should have gone to the Front, but have stayed at home. We have only to read the exemptions to be sure that the tax is penal in intent and effect. Of course those men who have gone to the Front or who are preparing to go are exempt. But the Government then propose that those who since the 1st of January of this year have endeavoured to enlist but have been rejected purely on the ground of physical unfitness shall not be called upon to pay this tax. Why should such men be exempt? If the object of the Government is merely to raise money for the purpose of repatriating our soldiers, why should those who are anxious to go to the war, but because of physical unfitness cannot do so, be allowed to go scot-free? I see no justification for such an exemption. On the contrary, I should say that a man who had testified his willingness to go to the Front, but was not accepted, would be only too glad to make a financial contribution instead. </para>

                        <para>- My view is that there should be no age limit at all. If our object is to raise money for repatriation purposes it does not matter what the age of a man is, or whether or not he is physically incapable of active service. A man who is physically incapable of serving at the Front may be physically capable of making a very' handsome income. He may be a bachelor earning a large income, but simply because he has offered for active service abroad he is to be exempt. Compare the cases of two bachelors, aged 45 and 46 years respectively, and both without dependants. The man who is only 45 is to be compelled to pay at least £10 in taxation, whilst the man of 46 who may be entirely opposed to the war and using all his influence to prevent men from going to the Front, is to pay nothing. If our object is to raise funds and lay the burden of taxation on those best able to bear it, let us wipe out the age limit altogether and make every man who has not gone to the Front liable to the tax. </para>

                        <para>- I will. The next man exempted is one who, notwithstanding that he has not endeavoured to enlist, is obviously unfit for any naval or military service. Why should the Government absolve such a man of the responsibility of contributing to a fund for the repatriation of men who have gone to the Front? There are in the community many men occupying splendid positions and making handsome incomes, and who are physically unfit to fight. Their very unfitness for active service affords a greater reason why they should pay this tax, unless, of course, the Government admit this to be a penal tax. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer said that the tax is not to force eligible persons to go to the war, but to compel those who have not gone to assist in the repatriation of the men at the Front. This tax will not do that. It will compel only some of those who have not gone to pay, and I object to selecting a certain section of the people to make this special contribution. In view of the fact that when the people of Australia were appealed to by referendum they refused to sanction the principle of compulsion, a man who declines to go to the war is acting quite within his right, and we ought not to punish him for exercising that right. </para>

                        <para>- That provision makes this tax obviously a penal one. I am. an out-and-out conscriptionist, and I advocated the cause of conscription on the public platform, but I abide by the decision of the people. I shall not be a party to the introduction of conscription by a side wind, and taking a course which is equivalent to endeavouring to force men to go to the Front, or, alternatively, to pay for remaining at home. I agree with the honorable members who have argued that if we desire to enlist more men this is not the way to do it. There is still some sense of honour in the men who have remained in Australia, and I believe there is a method of appeal that will secure a response if it is only applied in the right way. We promised the last man and the last shilling, and I am afraid there will be a good deal of competition for the distinction of being the last man to go to the war. </para>

                <para>Another equally absurd provision is the exemption of the man all of whose brothers have gone to the Front. Why should a man whose brothers are fighting be exempt from paying a contribution to the repatriation of those brothers and other men. In one house there may be two sons, one of whom has gone to the Front, while the other remains at home and makes a handsome income. He will pay no tax. </para>

                <para>Mr.MAXWELL.- To some extent that may be true, but the principle is not fair. 1 In another family there is only one son; he remains at home, and he has to pay this special tax whether he has an income or not. I know of a young man who is doing his University course. He is over twenty-one years of age, but he is not earning a penny; in fact, his father and mother have been scraping and saving for years in order to pay for his University education. But because he has not volunteered for active service he must pay £10. </para>

                        <para>- When we speak of eligibility we must remember that Parliament itself has imposed upon volunteering for active service the restrictions in regard to physical fitness and age. A man who is not within the military age, and does not reach the physical standard which has been arbitrarily fixed, is entitled to go free of any obligation to render military service; yet the Government now propose to penalize that man. I am unable to understand why policemen are to be exempt. </para>

                        <para>- Poetry is all very well in its place, but when we have to deal with the practical things of life, the mere spinning of phrases will not help us. In October last the people were invited to adopt the principle of compulsory military service beyond the seas. That proposal they turned down. The electors said that Australia was prepared to do her best by voluntary methods to assist in bringing the war to a successful conclusion ; that she was prepared to assist with her man power, on a voluntary basis, and financially, to the best of her ability. The implication was that the Government' should not by any side wind attempt to introduce compulsion, or impose conditions which the people had thus decided should not be imposed. Under this proposal, however, the Government say that every eligible who has not enlisted or attempted to do so shall pay a penalty of £10, irrespective of whether he has earned that amount or not during the year. On the other hand, they say to those who have a fair banking account, "You can buy yourselves out of military service." If the Treasurer will look closely at this proposition- </para>

Under this proposal a single man without income - a man who has been merely scratching along, but is eligible for military service - must either get . into khaki or go to. gaol. </para>

                </continue><para>The Treasurer has said that this is not a measure to force men into khaki or to introduce conscription by a side wind, but merely a means of raising revenue for repatriation purposes. He has said that those who have not gone to. the Front should be prepared to pay  this tax to assist in the repatriation of those who have. I believe that all who have not gone to the Front must be prepared to pay, according to their means, their share of the cost of repatriation. We should not, however, heap the burden upon the backs of those least able to bear it. Those who, have the money, and can best afford to carry the burden, should be required to bear their proper share. A week or two ago we had. the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill before us, and Ministerial supporters advanced all sorts of arguments in opposition to it. Many of its provisions were declared by them to be iniquitous, and calculated to hamper the development of new businesses. Honorable members opposite were practically tumbling over each other in their anxiety to provide for further exemptions, and, in the end, it was provided that a man should be allowed to make excess profits to the extent of £1,000 per annum before being called upon under that Bill to pay a penny towards repatriation. Their attitude reminds me very forcibly of the story of the Yankee who, when told that he was unpatriotic, and had no love of country, replied, " Why, my bosom is swelling with patriotic fervour! I am prepared at any time to sacrifice all my wife's relations upon the altar of my country!" Ministerial supporters are taking up very much the same attitude towards repatriation. They are prepared to sacrifice all their poor relations - all the working classes - but are not prepared to call for any sacrifice on the part of those best able to make sacrifices. I hope the Treasurer will see his way to withdraw this proposal altogether. </para><interjection>

I am confident that he will see his way to withdraw this measure, and to allow the Parliament to impose legitimate taxation upon those who can afford to bear it. </para>

                        <para>- I notice that the resolution provides that the Governor-General may grant exemptions. Who is the Governor General but the Minister? This is really a power to be taken by the Government to institute a system of favoritism, so that any person whom the Government do not desire to be penalized may be granted an exemption. It is time that our motions and legislation were so drawn that people can understand them. Outside it is thought that these motions represent something that the Governor-General does as the representative of  His  Majesty the King, whereas they mean nothing but the exercise of the whims and fancies of the Government for the time being. This, in my opinion, is one of the most obnoxious features of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- As you object to the remark, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I withdraw it. The Treasurer stated that there are only three classes of people who will be affected, namely - 1, those who favour military and naval service in time of war; 2, those who favour compulsory military and naval service in time of war; and 3, those who have gone to the war, or who have offered to do so. How are persons who favour compulsory service to be exempted ? Do the Government propose that their supporters who are in favour of compulsion shall be exempted ? Is that how the power of the Government is to be used, through the medium of the Governor-General ? There are any number of people who are nominally in favour of compulsion, and vote for it, but who themselves do not go to the war. How, then, are the Government going to discriminate through the Governor-General in the matter of exemptions? </para>

                        <para>- The second reason was that it would make a contribution towards the repatriation of the soldiers. This is the only tax introduced by the Government to deal with repatriation'; there is not another penny piece of that taxation with that object. The policy of the Government is to find the money for the repatriation of our soldiers from two sources, one of which is the single men who refuse to enlist, and the other is posterity, who find both principal and interest on loans. Babes yet unborn are to find the interest on the loan money, the only other class to contribute being the single men who refuse to enlist, and who, presumably, are opponents of this Government. </para>

                <para>We over here have waited for some time to hear the apologists for the Government explain the reason for this policy. The Treasurer thinks that because he has sugar-coated the pill with a reference to repatriation, the country will swallow it. He evidently thinks that the reference to the soldiers will operate as a kind of threat, so that, if any opposition is raised to the proposition, those who raise it will be pointed out as being opposed to finding money for repatriation. However, both the House and the country can see through that transparent device. </para>
                <para>The Bill provides a minimum tax of £10 a year on every single man of military age, and every widower without children. It has been pointed out that some men are in such a poor position that they are unable to save £10 with which to pay the tax. What will the Government do ? All that the Government can do is to gaol these men. </para>

                        <para>- But what can the Government do to give effect to the measure ? Is the Bill to be merely a pious expression of opinion, that may be obeyed or disobeyed according to the caprice of the individual? The honorable member knows that there must be a penalty. If a man refuses to pay the £10, the Government, if in earnest, must send him to gaol. Of course, if that does occur, then, I suppose, the Government will do what has been done in other cases - the man will be let out of gaol on condition that he goes to the Front. By this means will be brought about that form of conscription which the Government and their supporters pledged themselves would not be introduced. </para>

                        <para>- Evidently the honorable member thinks that my supporters voted against conscription, whereas his voted in favour of it, and, therefore, my supporters should be penalized. The Treasurer, in introducing the Bill, said that those in favour of compulsory service for duty oversea should be exempt from the operation of the tax. This Bill proposes a tax of 10 per cent., or 2s. in the £1, as a minimum, and this is equal to the income tax on an income from personal exertion of £4,000. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the details, but I give the result as it has been worked out. At the £4,000 level of income from personal exertion the tax is equal to 2s. in the £1. This Bill will operate in the case of young men who are just starting in life, and whose incomes are small; and we are told by the Treasurer that if a man marries after 1st July he will still be compelled to pay the tax. This special tax, I may point out, does not exempt any young man from ordinary taxation on all the commodities he uses. </para>

So far from stimulating recruiting, I believe that this Bill will have the very opposite effect.

                    <para>.- The principal abjection voiced on both sides of the House is that this Bill is a form of economic conscription ; tut that argument is defeated when it is also claimed that it will conscript no one. If the argument of honorable members that the Bill will not force one person to join the ranks of the Army be correct, the Government cannot be said to have been false to any pledge given at the recent; election. But if this is economic conscription, if the liability to pay a tax of £10 will force men into the ranks of the Army, I am glad of it. By saying that men are willing to risk their lives and limbs in order to avoid the payment of £10, which they can earn very easily in this country, honorable members opposite set a value of £10 upon a mam's life and limbs. During the election campaign I said that I would endeavour to place the inevitable taxation that would have to be imposed on the shoulders of those best able to beaT it, and when speaking on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply I advocated this same tax long before the Government foreshadowed it. I knew that, while very many families were doing their share in the wax, other families, many of them of German extraction, and some of them sympathizers entirely with our enemies,, were getting rich at the expense of those Who were fighting at the Front, and were not paying Id. towards repatriation, or helping in any way. I have seen in my electorate - .what is typical of many districts throughout Australia - a family with half-a-dozen 30ns, all of them at home, making hay while the sun shines, taking advantage of the fight that is being put up by others, and not subscribing Id. towards any patriotic fund, while next to them is a family in which all the sons have gone to the Front, while the old people remain at home to-run the farm. I want to place taxation on the shoulders of those best able to bear it and who are better able to bear it than single men Without dependants, possessed- of their full strength and manhood? </para>

                        <para>- Those who object to this tax abject to helping those men who are making a great " strike " for Australia at the Front. The honorable member is a great example of the " starvers." Instead of the "poor widow," he is taking up the case of the poor, strong, healthy, rich bachelor, who it is said cannot afford to pay £10 towards repatriating the boya who are fighting for him at the Front. It is claimed that there are many single men, between twenty-one and forty-five years of age, without dependants, who are not earning £2 a week. I am very sorry for them. But they can earn that wage at any time, and especially now, if they will only work. Thousands can get work at the present time, but they will not work. </para>

                <para>Oases of men who will be penalized because they have dependants have been brought f forward ; but I am sure that the Treasurer will be willing to amend the Bill so that those who have dependants absolutely depending on them may be exempted, lt would he quite in accord with the principle of the Bill to do so. It is also said that it will be hard to collect the tax. Honorable members have talked about nomads, the men who are drifting about, who are here to-day and in another place to-morrow, earning wages wherever they can find work, but that is just the type of man who is the very first one to enlist, and who, if rejected by a medical officer, will apply again and again until he comes to be regarded as a nuisance. The man who is stopping at home is the man who is in a comfortable billet, usually a Government billet, and can well afford to pay the tax, and should be made to pay it. </para>
                <para>It is also said that this is class taxation. So far the interpretation bestowed by honorable members upon class legislation is legislation that discriminates between working men and capitalists, or between the well-to-do classes and those not so well off ; but) this Bill makes no such distinction. Each man will pay according to his income. The rich man will pay, perhaps, twenty or even forty times as much as the poor man will pay. Can any one tell me that the young single eligible man,  with all his health and strength, should not be called upon to pay something to. help the men at the Front 1 </para>

                        <para>- They will drop some of their profits under "this taxation. They will lose 10 per cent, of their income. It is said that there are members of families who are earning nothing. In the country many farmers' sons receive no wages. It is one of the worst features of Australian life, and I would like to see it remedied. There are cases where the sons are anxious to go to the Front, but they are threatened by their parents that if they enlist they will receive no benefits from them now or hereafter. As these young men receive no wages, if the parents are anxious to keep them here, they will have to pay the tax proposed in this Bill. As I have already said, there are families in which not one son is doing his duty to the country, while in the case of neighbouring families the parents have given up all their sons, and everything they hold dear, have subscribed liberally to patriotic funds, and worked past the allotted span of life ,in order to keep the farms going until the boys come back from the Front. When I think of these things, I question the sincerity of men who claim that this is a class tax, that it is inequitable, and that it is economic conscription. If the Bill will force one&gt;man into the ranks of the Army I welcome it. Honorable members are asking for consideration for the' poor strong healthy bachelor, who does not deserve any consideration whatever if he has not gone to the war. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that; but I will go before any tribunal that the honorable member chooses to name and offer myself again. I have my rejection certificate in my pocket. I have done everything that I possibly could to enlist. However, I do not wish to be led aside by that argument, and I have no desire to glorify my patriotism at the expense of my physical unfitness. Not only as a member of this House, but also as the  Chairman  of the Recruiting Committee in Victoria, I have, in justice to the men whom I have induced to enlist, said that no matter what the cost to Australia would be, they would receive fair treatment. Even if it costs the last shilling the men who have gone to the Front are deserving of it. I do not see that this paltry taxation of £10 per annum is inequitable, or an injustice, because those who are in the full enjoyment of their health and strength arte the very men who can afford to pay the tax. Therefore,* this Bill meets with my hearty and earnest approval. </para>

                    <para>. -  In placing this Bill before us, the Treasurer, in his usual nice manner, tried to make us believe that it was an innocent little measure that would hurt no one, but during the last three-quarters of an hour he has been in solemn conclave with those honorable members who have expressed their opposition to it. I hope that they have been able to comfort him a little. Somewhat like the War-time Profits Tax Bill, this measure is a supreme farce. We were told by the Government that they were going to do certain things to win the war. We were told, among other things, that those who made money out of the war would be compelled to pay for the cost of- the war, but the exemptions put into the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Bill made the War-time Profits Tax a farce. The Bill before us, in seeking to penalize those who do not come under . the provisions of the W'ar-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill, is also a farce. I smiled when I heard the honorable member for Indi expressing his desire to got at the stalwart bachelors, and when I thought of how the married men talk about doing one's duty to his country. One would think that men married for their poor dear bleeding country's sake. Why did these men get married? Be-' cause they saw a " little bit of cuddle" they liked. They spruced themselves up, wore a nice tie and tight boots, acquired a sickly look, and said they could not sleep at night. They tell us all this was done for their bleeding country. The truth is that they did it for some " tarts." We are justified in ridiculing the whole of this proposal. Some men are to be fined £10 because they will not go to the war, whilst other men are making hundreds of thousands of pounds in war profits. How can honorable members opposite know the financial position of bachelors? Many of them have responsibilities as great as married men, and are we to force them to marry? Suppose those men are women-haters. The women are far better off single than they would be if married to some of the men who will be liable to this tax. I cannot approach this Bill in a serious spirit. We are supposed to be logical, and to give the people legislation which has been duly considered in all its aspects. Every form of taxation bears hardly on somebody. I know thousands of men who are unmarried, and if the Treasurer knows how to get £10 out of them he is wiser than anybody else. Many men who offered to enlist, and were rejected, have since made arrangements to get married. Now they are told that because they were not married before 1st July they will be penalized to the extent of at least £10. </para>

                        <para>-That is not so. If they are fit. for military service to-day they will be required to pay this tax. We know that thousands of men married in order to evade this taxation, because its introduction was anticipated. And a lot of them would have been better unmarried. The Treasurer and the Government know that this taxation will not be worth collecting if exemptions are to be allowed to anything like the extent proposed in connexion with the war-time profits tax; and surely if the men who have made a lot of money out of the war are to get exemptions for reasons, a man who is earning only £100 per annum ought also to get exemption for reasons. The Government are not candid in saying that this is merely a measure of taxation to raise funds for repatriation purposes. It is intended to be a form of economic conscription. The Government hope that men who cannot pay the £10 will be forced into the ranks. </para>

                        <para>- Most men who reach the age of thirty-eight years without getting married are not necessarily waiting for the girl they want; they have found the girl, but their wages will not permit them to maintain a wife as they think she should be maintained. Men earning £126 a year have not saved enough money to pay this tax. Lots of men do not earn anything like that amount, and for that reason they will not marry. Now the Treasurer says to them, " As you will not marry and' drag some poor girl into misery, we shall make you pay £10 per annum." If that is not economic conscription, I am a Dutchman. 1 hope the Government will succeed in carrying this Bill, because it will help, with their other actions, to so discredit them that their chance of getting a renewal of their term of office will be very small. </para>

                    <para>.- This proposal is one which finds me without very much enthusiasm. In fact, I might describe my attitude as one of absolute indifference. To my mind, the measure is defective in two respects: it goes too far, and yet it does not go far enough. If this-Bill is intended to produce revenue for a very worthy object, namely, the repatriation of our soldiers, and if it is intended to apply to a certain section of the community that has failed in certain respects in its duty to the soldiers, I cannot see why it should stop at persons of the age of forty-five years. If we are to raise revenue by a bachelor tax, there are many men in this country over the age of forty-five years who have not yet done a great deal in regard to war matters. I may be wrong, but my impression is that in this community there is a remarkably large percentage of bachelors of middle and elderly age, many of whom are  rolling in wealth. They have declined all the responsibilities of marriage, they have lived selfish, miserable lives, and rarely subscribe a pound or a solitary half-crown to any charitable or philanthropic object. I know a good many individuals of that kind, and. judging from the applause in the chamber, I am inclined to think that other honorable members know many of the same variety. Why should such persons escape a tax in regard to their lack of national service as men? If there is one public duty of more importance than another in a country like Australia, it is marriage. Australia requires population, and if these men have refused a duty and responsibility in this regard, the Treasurer is failing in his duty to the country in introducing a proposal of this kind which stops short at men of the age of forty-five years. </para>

                <para>I have explained how, in my opinion, the Bill does not go far enough. I shall now explain how, in my judgment, the measure goes too far. If, as the Treasurer says, the tax is intended to stimulate recruiting, this is an indirect and wholly insincere method of achieving a worthy object. I wish to say here and . now that, so far as I am concerned, the Government will have to introduce soon some proposal more thorough and straightforward than any measure of this kind for reinforcing our men at the Front. One honorable member on this side waxed very earnest over the fact that the measure will penalize certain individuals who have refrained from doing their duty by enlisting. There are far too many such men in Australia. We hear of families with four or five men, not one of whom has gone to the Front, and near 'by are other families in which every son has offered himself, and some have paid the supreme sacrifice. Does any honorable member pretend that the payment of £10 or a little more per annum is an adequate sacrifice on the part of those who have refrained from going to the Front? lt is the merest mockery to suggest that a tax of this kind is anything in the nature of a levelling up of the obligation of those who have so deplorably failed to do their duty. There is only one method by which that can be done, and I say now, in all earnestness, that it is time the Government seriously considered the necessity for adopting that method, and giving the country something more effective than this miserable and hypocritical proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - The attitude taken up by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> is understandable, and quite consistent with the ideals he has advocated. I find myself in considerable agreement with him, especially in regard to the last point he made - that the suggestion that a tax of £ 10 per annum is the equivalent of enlistment is one of the greatest insults that could be offered to men who do enlist. To say that the payment of a £10 tax is to be accepted as a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> for enlistment is a proposition that one cannot understand, having regard to the policy promulgated by this Government. The young men of the country have had before them two alternatives in connexion with the war. They have had the opportunity either to enlist or to decline to do so. I am not going to inquire into the reasons that have actuated those who have refused to enlist. They have been insulted and abused by my honorable friends opposite, and their supporters, from every platform. Even the recruiting platforms have been used to insult them. I do not think a mistake oan* be more easily made than in trying to determine the reasons that actuate men in doing, or failing to do, certain things. </para>

                        <para>- The principle of compulsion for military service overseas is foreign to our form of government, and to all our ideals. The conscription referendum proved, if proof were wanted, that the people of this country considered that there should be no compulsion for military service overseas. The point with which I am immediately concerned, however, is that for some reason or other - and the reasons are immaterial to my argument - there are in Australia a number of young men who have not enlisted. That they have the right to refuse cannot be successfully refuted, and the country itself has supported them by its refusal to adopt the principle of compulsory military service overseas. In this proposal, however, the Government are giving these young men a third alternative. Previously it was open to. them to enlist or not to enlist. The Government now say to them, " If you do not enlist you must pay up." Thus the payment of a tax df £10 may now be accepted by the young men of Australia as a justification for nonenlistment. </para>

                    <para class="block">The first is that we believe it will stimulate and increase recruiting, not so much, we hope, by the fear of having to pay the tax, as by bringing prominently before those who have not yet volunteered for service what is not only their duty to their country, but their paramount duty to themselves. The second reason is to provide funds towards the repatriation of those who have returned from the war after having served their country. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say it is the best reason; I say it is the first reason. The Treasurer says he wishes to stimulate recruiting. He can stimulate it under this Bill only by making the tax payable such  a hardship that, to escape it men will think it worth while to enlist. The argument advanced by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fowler)</inline> is unanswerable. I refer to his contention that ' to compare the risk to life and the hardship involved by active service, on the one hand, with the payment of a tax of £10 and the right on payment of that amount to remain in Australia, is to insult those who have enlisted. This will not help recruiting. </para>

                        <para>- That is the weakness of the Bill. Australia has said that there shall be no conscription for service oversea; and the Government have said in this House as they said during the campaign, that they will honour their pledge to the electors not to introduce conscription  during the lifetime of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- The point I wish to make here is that this Bill is designed to operate as a form of conscription, so that the Government are in spirit violating the pledge they gave to the constituencies. Although they can honestly say that they are not introducing con.scriptive military service for overseas, and that they are not going to re-submit the question to a referendum, it cannot be denied that this is part of an effort to force into the ranks men who; for some reason or other, have so far refrained from enlisting. As I said before, 1 am not concerned with the reasons that have led men not to enlist. I confess I find it difficult to understand why a number do not. What their reasons are, I do not know, nor do I think it any part of my duty to inquire. After all, the question of service to one's country is above either statute law or personal opinion. It depends entirely on a man's conscientious recognition of what he conceives to be his duty. </para>

                <para>The second reason given for this Bill is that it is to raise revenue for repatriation purposes. The single men remaining in Australia are now to be taxed to raise money for the repatriation of soldiers. This is open to two objections. I do not think it fair to select any individual section of the community upon whose financial support the repatriation of our soldiers should to any extent depend. , The repatriation of our soldiers is a duty devolving upon the whole country. We have no right to select any particular class of the community to carry the burden, or to bear any special share of it. How much does the Treasurer hope to gain from this tax ? </para>

                        <para>- The- Treasurer has tried to protect himself from criticism by saying that only £500,000 is to be obtained from this tax, and that therefore the number of men affected is too small to be worthy of consideration. So far as I can see, no allowance is to be made for single men - fit or unfit - whose income is not sufficient to enable them to pay a fine of £10 without suffering serious hardship. The Treasurer says that the Commissioner will have authority to discriminate in: this matter. There should be a special clause in the Bill to protect those who cannot pay the tax. If the Treasurer would exempt young men who are not earning a certain amount, he would avoid a considerable amount of hostile criticism. </para>

                        <para>- No; he says that this tax is imposed for repatriation purposes. That is a sprat to catch a mackerel. No one believes that the real purpose of the tax is to provide revenue for repatriation, but it is a convenient argument to say that the money should be raised from those who have not enlisted, to be used for the benefit of those who have enlisted. The yield from this tax will be as a drop in a bucket to what is required for repatriation. When it is said that the repatriation scheme should be dependent on the yield from this tax one wonders whether 'honorable members opposite are in earnest. </para>

Another objection I have to the tax is that which I had to the War-time Profits Assessment tax, namely, -that it introduces a new method of taxation, requiring reports, returns, and much additional machinery and expense. We irritate and harass the electors by continually opening new' sores and tapping them in fresh places. It. would be better to say to them straight out, ' ' We require a certain amount o'f money, of which you must contribute so much." Instead of doing that, we get at them in one way, grab at them in another, poke at them in a third, and draw at them in a fourth. </para>

                        <para>- That is not a reason why there should be a multiplicity of taxes here. 'If this tax be imposed, new officers must be appointed, and new methods adopted, which will stir up opposition. The people are prepared to contribute all that is necessary for the war and repatriation. Every section of the community is willing to do that. . But it is irritating to have taxation imposed in. so many different ways, and to find that those who are most able to pay are not adequately taxed. The honorable member for Indi expressed the view that taxation should be imposed on those most able to bear it. Honorable members admit the fairness of that, but evidently fear to put it into practice. </para>

                        <para>- I have the opinion that the shirkers in regard to marriage are not the men only. Many women in Australia are shirkers, and they are not all single girls. The honorable member for Perth said that we needed population. So we do. The biggest shirkers in this respect are the married women, who dishonour their obligations by refusing the duties and responsibilities of motherhood." We now make certain allowances in respect of income taxation to married men with families. That, in itself, is a sufficient penalizing of the single men, who, of course, do" not get such allowances. Apart from the financial and moral objections to the proposed tax, there is the objection that, in the minds of the people,  it is proposed as a conscription measure. The Government is keeping its election pledge in this matter to the letter, but violating it in spirit. I would rather see a straightforward proposal for conscription, so that, as the honorable member for Perth says, we may know where we are. This measure cannot commend itself to honorable members opposite. It is not honest or consistent. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members seem to lose sight of the fact that the motion is in the main one to reimpose taxation, to add a supertax, and, in addition, to bring within the taxable area a class of people who, although they have all along enjoyed the freedom and privileges of citizenship, have never yet been called upon to pay taxation. The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> spoke of the fairness of income taxation ; and I think it is a sound principle that in war time all who enjoy the protection of the Government should pay according to their means. I think, however, that in preparing the necessary machinery the Government should draw a line between those who have offered their services in the field and those who have remained at home. I entered Parliament as an advocate of income taxation, and I was an advocate of the principle years before it was thought of in connexion with the Commonwealth. Hitherto honorable members opposite have forgotten to describe an income tax as a class tax, but on the present occasion they so describe it; but seeing that the whole discussion has ranged around paragraph /, it may be taken that the Committee, as a whole, are agreed on the soundness of the principle. This Bill proposes, as I have said, to bring in a great new body of taxpayers; but I regard it as merely an instalment, and a small instalment, of what is due to the men who are fighting our battles abroad - as the first instalment contributed by those who are equally capable of serving, but who have elected to remain in Australia. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>There is one objection, and a strong one, that I have to the Bill in its present form. No distinction is drawn between families which have contributed one or more sons to the Forces, and families all the sons of which have remained at home. There may be families of five sons and two aged parents, and three of these sons, after a family council, may have gone to the Front; yet the sons who remain at home will" be called upon to pay this taxation equally with, perhaps, a neighbouring family of five sons, none of whom have offered their services in the Forces. There is a provision in which exemption from the liability to pay is limited to one remaining son, but my contention is that where the majority of a family of sons have gone to the Front, the rest of the family ought to be immune from this taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so; but if the honorable member can show any means, consistent with the principle of this measure, of raising the money required, J shall support him. As I have said, I accept this Bill merely as an instalment of justice to those at the Front, and I think it will be welcomed by thousands who. are unable to serve abroad, but who recognise their financial obligations. It has been said by honorable members opposite that the payment of this tax will have the effect of enabling a man, by means of a payment, to escape his duty. That may be argued; but it cannot satisfy his conscience. </para>

                        <para>- I do not look upon this as a punitive measure, but as securing the fulfilment bf part of the obligation which every citizen owes his country. The obligation to find the necessary money for repatriation rests on the whole community, and this Bill, as I say, brings in a class of taxpayers who hitherto have escaped, although they have "bossed" the country politically, and had tribunals created for the regulation of their wages and conditions. </para>

                <para>I say frankly that I should vote against this measure if I thought that the direct taxation proposals of the Government were going no farther. I do not advocate raising all the money that is necessary for repatriation by means of loans, for I do not wish the soldiers to return here and find themselves faced with heavy financial burdens. I am prepared to so widen our policy of taxation as to embrace the- whole community. The argument as to this being a form of economic conscription is not worth the time it - has taken to advance; indeed, the Leader of the Opposition has expressed the opinion that it will not induce one man to enlist. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, if honorable members opposite impute to the Government the motive of imposing penal taxation, their argument is quite logical ; but they must recognise that the responsibility of finding the money for repatriation is the duty of every non-combatant. It is for this reason that I suggest a strong line of demarcation between the participants and non-participants in the war. The settlement of the repatriation question has been too long delayed ; it has not been properly handled, and I can only hope that a well-thought-out financial scheme will be placed before the country, so that when our soldiers return they will not find themselves called upon to bear taxation in common with non-belligerents. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that 'any honorable member in this House possesses as much knowledge of repatriation matters as the honorable member for Wannon possesses, and I commend him for what he has done in the matter of repatriating our soldiers, but he is all at sea in regard to this tax. I was very much struck by the fairness of the remarks of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> this morning, especially when he spoke of the penal effect of the Bill. I do not believe that there is a single man or widower, or, in fact, any man in Australia who would seek to avoid taxation which is imposed with the object of securing the repatriation of our soldiers. The Treasurer has told us that the money to be raised by this tax will be used for that laudable purpose; but what a mean,' contemptible lot we should be if we called upon our soldiers on their return to help to pay interest and repay principal on the money that we borrow for repatriation ? Many men who have gone left positions in which they were earning over £3,000 per annum, and after all their deeds, about which we ^ are so proud to express our admiration, are we to ask them, and their children, and their children's children, to pay back the money that we borrow for repatriating them ? I hold that every one who stays at home should put his hands into his pockets as deeply as possible in order to provide funds for repatriation. It is shameful that any Government should introduce a proposal to borrow money for the purpose. If we can raise £100,000,000 in Australia for war purposes, surely we can raise £30,000,000 for repatriation purposes. </para>

                <para>Notwithstanding what the honorable member for.

In the electorate which I have the honour to represent there are from 12,000 to 15,000 single men, and they are principally nomads. The Treasurer will have the opportunity of a life-time in trying to collect the tax from those men. </para>

He growls for a few days, .but after a while it comes to him like mother's milk. In Queensland, a few years ago, every single man who earned £1 per week and over had to pay,, at least, 10s. per annum as a poll tax; but when I had a conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Philp, who was 'Premier of the State, and asked him how he got on with the men out West, he said that it cost £5 to collect every 10s. the Treasury received from those fellows. That is the position in which, our Treasurer will be placed in regard to .the collection of this tax in the outlying portions of the different States, where the population is nomadic. </para>

                <para>The Treasurer's speech was so poetical, and contained so much flowery language, that it -should have been set to music. The right honorable* gentleman said that the Government were under the impression that this form of taxation would stimulate recruiting. If there is one thing more than another that will not stimulate recruiting, it will be the passing of this Bill. The only persons from whom the tax will be recovered will be those who are in permanent jobs and those who are living in towns. There will be no chance of collecting it in the country. When an endeavour was made to collect the poll tax in Queensland, as soon as the men in a shearing shed saw a policeman's blue coat, or got the whisper that something was being done, they hung up their shears or became sick and were paid off, and cleared out before a garnishee could be put in. ; </para>

                        <para>- What may be done in older countries cannot be done in this new and 'beautiful country of ,ours. Perhaps the honorable member for Wannon does, not know that the Maranoa electorate is as large as the whole of New South Wales. Just imagine .the tax collector roaming from creek to creek, and hill to hill, over that vast extent of country;, in order to collect the £10 from men who know every inch of it. What a merry dance he would be led. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer said that the Government hoped it would have the -effect of stimulating recruiting, and that remark was no slip of the tongue, because the right honorable gentleman was speaking from prepared notes. If this is to be a class tax, it is wrong. In regard to raising money for repatriation, any direct taxation is preferable to- borrowing money on the London market for that purpose. I agree with the honorable member for Fawkner that if we are to pass taxation of this character, it should not be a penal tax on the single men and widowers between the ages of twenty-one and fortyfive,' but should apply to all men. </para>

                        <para>- How could we expect a man receiving a pension of 12s. 6d. per week to pay £10 per annum in taxation? There must be some exemptions, and the Treasurer is proposing to remove from the scope of the tax a number of people. Where there are two sons in a family, both unmarried, and one has gone to the war, the one who remains at home is to escape taxation. But another family may have only one son and five or six daughters, and that son is to be compelled to pay at least £10 per annum. Is that fair? Some families have given all their sons, and also the father, to their country; and yet the Treasurer would give exemption to the stay-at-home brother of3 &amp; man serving at the Front. On the other hand, a son who is maintaining his widowed mother and several young sisters must pay this special tax in addition to ordinary income ta.x. That is a most unjust proposal. If we cannot defeat this Bill, we should, at any rate, insist upon some modification of its provisions. All should pay this tax or none should pay it. I again entreat the Government to set their face against the flotation of loans for repatriation purposes. This country can find the money with which to do a fair thing to our soldiers, and every man who can afford to pay should pay. For that purpose, the Government may have every shilling of which I am possessed, because I realize that if it had not been for the action of our men in going abroad to fight for this country, my worldly possessions would be no good to me or anybody else. </para>

                    <para>.- I cordially agree with the concluding remark of the last  speaker  that the cost of repatriation ought not to be debited to Loan Fund. I believe, also, that it is possible to make a workable measure of the proposal which the Government have submitted. It is no new phase in Commonwealth legislation to recognise that the single man has not the same' obligations as the married man. Laws already on the statute-book make a distinction' between married men with dependants and single men without dependants, but I have a decided objection to the Government's proposal in its present form. The first fault in it is that it proposes to take £10 from a man who has no taxable income. That' penalty, which is equivalent to 4s.' a week, is entirely disproportionate to the man's proper liability. We should  reduce  the minimum tax payable by those who have no taxable income, and then the impost should increase on a graduated scale. I also favour the abolition of the age limit in regard to this tax. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> very pertinently asked why a man 'over forty-five years of age should be freed of any obligation to contribute towards the fund3 required for the repatriation of our soldiers. Why should a single man of sixty-five years, without dependants, be exempt? Many men of sixty years of age are in an infinitely better position to pay taxation than is a youngs fellow of twenty-one years- of age. Whilst I believe that young men ought to pay some taxation for this purpose, I do not believe in making the tax penal. We might very well abolish all the exemptions. I see no reason for exempting the man who has remained at home, and has the pleasure of enjoying a good billet, because of his physical unfitness for active service. Although this tax will not force men to enlist, it has the appearance of economic conscription, and I am certainly opposed to any legislation of that kind. I have no doubt that greatly increased revenue will be earned by the tax if we remove the age limit and the exemptions, even if we also reduce the minimum amount payable. Even the <inline font-style="italic">men</inline> out back, on whose behalf the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> spoke, would not object to pay a tax based on equitable principles, if they knew that everybody was making a contribution, and that the money was to be earmarked for repatriation purposes. The difficulties of collection mentioned by the honorable member could be overcome by a system of stamps, which the employer would cancel when paying off his men. In that way the tax could be collected from men who are in irregular employment. There would not be the same difficulty in collecting from men who are regularly employed. I ask honorable members not to reject the Bill, but to try to mould it into a fair and equitable measure. What honorable member will say that a single man, whether young or old, has anything like the same obligations as a married man ? Even a special bachelor tax of £10 would not nearly equalize the obligations of the bachelor and the benedict. </para>

                        <para>- Such circumstances can be provided for. In connexion with the income tax, we allow a deduction from income of £26 for every child under sixteen years of age. I do not say that the waiving qf the tax payable on that £26 is a sufficient concession for the increased responsibility borne by the married man; but, at any rate, Parliament does recognise the principle of granting assistance to a man who has  others dependent upon him. We could make the tax apply in a general way, and so remove from the Bill the suggestion that this is a penal provision. Some young men might be foolish enough to think that because they had paid the tax of £10 there was no obligation upon them to serve their country. No man could seriously contend, however, that the payment of such a tax is the equivalent of active service, where a man takes his life in his hands. If this tax were applied on broad, general lines I have sufficient faith in the young people of this country to believe that they would cheerfully pay it. On the other hand, if we select a section of the community, and say, in effect, to them, " Because you have not gone to the Front you shall pay this tax," we shall only raise their ire. </para>

                <para>The Bill as it stands is not in accordance with our distinct and emphatic pledges to the people. No one can say that I am opposed to conscription ; I think I was the first in this House to speak in favour of the principle. But while I am a conscriptionist to the backbone, I am not in favour of the introduction of conscription by a side wind, nor shall I support anything savouring of economic conscription. If necessary, I would vote tomorrow for conscription, but I am not prepared to bring it in by means of a side wind. This proposal will not induce any man to enlist, but, on the contrary, will do much damage to voluntary recruiting. I have Indicated the way in which I think the Bill can be so amended as to make it a useful means of raising revenue for repatriation while removing from it the sting that it at present contains. </para>

                    <para>I wish to inform the House and the country that the compulsion proposed in this measure is not to force eligible persons to go to the war, but to compel those who have not gone to specially assist in repatriating those who have done so, on their return to Australia. That is the only compulsion which we seek to exercise. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Any proposal for the assistance of our men and their dependants on their return from the Front will find in me a strong supporter, since I recognise that the Labour party more especially owes a duty to those men who, because of their representations, were induced to enlist for service oversea. For that, if not for any other reason, it is the duty of the Labour party to stand by these men, and to look after their interests when they return. I would strongly support the imposition of a graduated income tax upon those who are benefiting, as the result of the war, or who have made profit out of the war, in order to raise funds for the repatriation of our soldiers. </para>
                <para>The one redeeming feature of this obnoxious measure is that under it parliamentarians are not exempt. The Treasurer mentioned last -night that several exemptions from the Defence Act had been introduced into this Bill, but that he had not included the exemption of members of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. If the honorable member is a supporter of the Bill he will be put! to a great deal of trouble in justifying it. I am surprised that so much heat should have been engendered by the contemplation of the number of eligibles in Australia who have taken advantage of the decision of the people that compulsory military service for oversea shall not be brought into operation, that no compulsion shall be applied, and that the right of individual conscience shall be safeguarded. Apart from those who share my views on this question, there are many who, on conscientious religious grounds, object to active service. The Quakers and others believe that it is contrary to Biblical teaching to take part in the shedding of human blood, even in self defence. I may not agree with such a ground of objection to compulsory service, but) I can well understand a man being true to his conscientious convictions and being prepared, as I am, to suffer, if necessary, for them. I respect and honour those whose opinions differ from my own. Even those who, on religious grounds, object to the taking of human life are to be unfairly dealt with under this Bill, notwithstanding that the people have said they shall not be penalized or coerced. This is an attempt to go behind the verdict of the people. It is a vindictive and cowardly attack on certain citizens. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Leckie)</inline> stated that those who have gone abroad deserve Australia, because they have fought for it ; but how much of Australia will fall to their share? The wealth census, taken a year or two ago shows that about2,750,000. persons are entitled to vote, and that of these 2,000,000 do not own an inch of land. Of the remaining 750,000, only about 400,000 own £200 worth of property. Those who owai Australia are the people who are making huge profits out of the rest of the community, who are fighting for Australia,and making the products which keep Australia going. There is no attempt to make the profiteers shoulder the burden of those who have gone to fight for what honorable members opposite say is liberty and freedom. Personally, if you also taxed fully  those who have made profits out of the war, who own the mines, factories, and workshops, and enjoy all that is worth enjoying in life, I should be prepared to give up all that I have. But no such thing has been proposed.We hear about the shirkers. Those who do not volunteer to go to the Front are called shirkers by the loudmouthed advocates of leaving well alone, and taxing "the other fellow. ' ' What have the 2,000,000 landless persons in Australia' to lose but their lives ? The proposal of the Treasurer is the good old bushranging demand, " Your money or your life." " Go to the Front, or pay £10." I admit that no one should be forced by this tax to go to the Front. The Treasurer waxed poetical when making his speech. He said, " We do not want to be ungenerous; we do not want to ignore any real or valid reasons for not going." Will he say that those who conscientiously object to military service have no real or valid reasons for not going to fight? He said, further - </para>

                        <para>- What I said was that we had got past the stage, when the aristocrats led their forces. I do nob accuse the aristocrats by birth of having made the war. It is the international financiers, whose interest it is to make wars that I accuse of that ; those who are interested in armament trusts and similar corporations in every country in the world, who benefit by war, and whose business it is to make profits without regard to the flag under which they live. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe in being forced to go to the Front, nor do I believe in putting pressure on other men to go. As the workers understand  more and more the causes of war; as they secure more and more control, and share in the government of the country, they will alter conditions so that every man shall have his share of the wealth produced.. There will then be no need for compulsion. Every man will be prepared to defend the country when it belongs to him. But while it is being used by a handful of people to exploit the rest of the community, and to add big profits to swollen fortunes, I shall oppose any attempt, no matter how made, to penalize those who are trying to obey the dictates of their consciences. </para>

There is a considerable difference of opinion among members as to the age limits which should be fixed in subdivisionf, and I wish to have an opportunity to consider the proposal further. Every member who has not spoken in regard to this matter will have an opportunity to do so when the decision of the Government in regard to it has been announced. </para>

                    <para>- That is not a point of order, but a question for the Chair. The Treasurer did say something about, reporting progress, but it was impossible for me to clearly understand what was meant owing to the buzz of conversation. I asked the Treasurer whether he proposed that subdivisions  a, b,  a,  d,  and  b  should be passed, and that progress should be reported, and he intimated to me that he desired those subdivisions only to be submitted from the Chair; the question now before us is that those subdivisions be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- It has been discussed for the last twelve months, and the Commonwealth and the States mutually blame each other for the fact that nothing is done. The present system, or want of system, entails much expense 0on taxpayers; indeed, there are scores in my district who pay more for making up their returns than they do in taxation. My own opinion is that, there ought to be only one income tax collected by the Commonwealth, who should hand over so much of the revenue to the States, instead of two staffs, and duplication of returns. </para>

                    <para>. -  It appears to me there is little probability of making much progress to-day in connexion -with this proposal, though I should have liked to see the Committee put it through, considering that, after all, it is only a motion binding the House in no way in regard to the Bill. The only effect of discussing the motion in detail-though that is quite proper from the point of view of parliamentary procedure - is that it will duplicate the debate on the Bill. Frequently a motion like this is accepted, and a Bill founded on it introduced, when the whole measure is open for detailed consideration, and honorable members lose not one jot or tittle of their rights. If honorable members will agree to the suggestion of the Treasurer, we could at once report progress, and come down with matured proposals. </para>

                        <para>- It is always better to be frank with honorable members; and I wish to say that the Government will reconsider one or two aspects of this matter. As I have already said many times over, these measures which have to do with the war, and with taxation consequent on the war, ought in no sense to be regarded as extreme party measures. The Government, in this case, do not take up the attitude that any proposals they bring down must have every " t " crossed and every "i" dotted by the Committee. I suggest that honorable members allow tie motion to pass, when the Government, before submitting matured proposals, will consider the differences that have been revealed in Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- Instead of defining " active service," as having a meaning corresponding to that of the same words as used in sub-section 1 of section 189 of the Army Act defining the expression " on active service," we should incorporate in our Defence Act the actual definition in the Army Act. It will save a great deal of trouble. Honorable members know the difficulty that there is in searching for anything in the Army Act. By the process of incorporating amendments as they are made with the principal Act, we have reduced the size of our volumes of Statutes very considerably, and have rendered the task of studying the Commonwealth Act a comparatively easy one. In the same way it would be much better to have the actual definition of " active service" in our Defence Act, where it can easily be found. It would probably not occupy any more space than will be taken up by the proposed new definition in the Bill before us, which refers us ' to the definition in the Army Act, and at the same time it will be an advantage to have everything in the one Statute. </para>

                    <para>. - I appreciate the spirit in which the honorable member is making his suggestion, but I can assure him that the Parliamentary Draftsman, after having considered the point that he has raised, has decided that the course adopted in the Bill is the best one to follow. The Army Act applies to Australian Forces who are on active service, and the definition of " active service " is easily ascertained by a perusal of the Statute under which our Forces are working. Furthermore, it is desired, by  adopting the proposed new definition to avoid the necessity for legislating every time the definition of " active service " in the Imperial Act is amended. If the Imperial authorities alter their definition, the alteration is adopted immediately by the wording of the definition in the clause. Those who work every day under our Defence Act under peace conditions are not called upon to consult the Imperial definition of " active service." That is only necessary where our Forces are working under the Army Act when they are on active service,, and the definition is then easily ascertained from the Statute under which the Forces are working. </para>

                    <para>.- I object to the proposition of the Government on principle and on constitutional grounds. In this clause, " active service'* has a meaning corresponding to that of the same words as used in sub-section 1 of section 189 of the Army Act defining the expression "on active service." In section 4 of the Act, "Army Act" is defined as meaning the Imperial  Act called  the Army Act. Clause 12 of the Bill proposes to amend section 47 of the Act by rendering the Citizen Forces liable to be employed on " war service," instead of " active service." " War service " is defined in the Bill as meaning " active service." Thus we have this position: The Citizen Forces of Australia are liable to be employed on war service; war service means active service; " active service " means what the Army Act says; and the Army Act is an Imperial Act; therefore, the Citizen Forces of Australia are liable to be employed as the Imperial Government may decide' under their Act. </para>

                        <para>- I am complaining of the Army Act's application to section 47, and I am contending that our Citizen Forces should be controlled only and absolutely by laws made in Australia by Australian representatives, and not in any way should they be under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Act, so far as their control within the Commonwealth is concerned. I do not think that the Minister would be so unpatriotic as to desire to hand over the Citizen Forces to the control of some outside authority. But he must see that the actual effect of the amendment now proposed is to make the Citizen Forces in Australia subject to any amendment of the Army Act which the Imperial Government may consider necessary in connexion with the Imperial Forces. I object to handing over the Government of Australia, either in part, or in whole, to the Imperial authorities. That is not expected of us. I am sure that this amendment has not been suggested by the Imperial authorities. It can only have been suggested by some sort of slavish desire to manifest a jingoistic patriotism. We have had several rather severe experiences lately of the foolishness of following the Imperial lead in legislation. The necessities of Great Britain demand an entirely different outlook and application from those demanded in Australia. Simply because the Imperial authorities adopted daylight saving, the Australian Government thought it necessary to do the same thing. That Act proved unworkable in the Common-, wealth. We have had an even worse experience in connexion with the War </para>

                <para class="block">Precautions Act, which was simply a slavish copy of the Imperial Defence of the Realm Act. If members had had any suspicion that that Act was to be used as it has been used, it would never have been agreed to. In that and other ways we are simply abandoning our rights of self-government, and placing our feet in the footprints of the Imperial Government. To that principle I 'am entirely opposed, not because of any lack of regard for the Imperial Parliament. The mother of Parliaments is a very safe and salutary institution for us to take cognisance of, but to do things simply because the Imperial Parliament does them seems to be an abrogation of every constitutional privilege we enjoy. I refuse to hand over the control of the Citizen Forces or the defence of Australia to any authority but the Australian Parliament. The Imperial Parliament may at any time alter the definition of " active service" or "war service," and the Government are asking us to say that whatever amendment is made in the Army Act shall automatically become part of the Australian Defence Act. In effect the Australian Defence Force will become an integral part of the Forces controlled by the Imperial Government. Already we have gone a very long way in that direction. We have said that, in time of war, our Fleet shall pass automatically under the control of the Admiralty. We have provided, also, that when Australian Expeditionary Forces are outside of Australia they shall pass under the control of the. Imperial authorities. In that direction we have gone further than the Imperial Government asked us to go, and I am sure the British Government is not asking us to provide that alterations of the Army Act shall necessarily and automatically become part of the Act controlling the Defence Forces in Australia. I object most strenuously to giving the Imperial Government the right to amend our Defence Act, and say what shall be done in peace time with our Defence Forces. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member seems to be under the impression that we propose to hand over to the Imperial Government the control of the Citizen Forces of Australia. The principle of Australian control of Australian soldiers is not being violated in the slightest degree by this clause. Section 47 provides that Citizen Forces shall be liable to be employed on active service, and section 49 says distinctly that members of the Defence Forces shall not be required, unless they voluntarily agree, to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, and any territory under the authority of the Commonwealth. Therefore all we are concerned with is that our Citizen Forces may be called upon to be employed under the existing law on active service in Australia. Does the honorable member object to that? </para>

                        <para>- Our men are fighting oversea side by side with Forces from other parts of the Empire, and it is necessary that all there should be under the one Act. The object of adopting this definition is to secure for our Military Forces, when they are operating outside Australia, the same definition of active service as applies to troops from other parts of the Empire. The Imperial Government is not seeking to interfere with our rights of self-government in any way. We are simply adopting an Imperial definition of " active service," providing, that, for the purposes of our Act, it shall have the same meaning as under the Army Act. </para>

                    <para>.- I join with the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Finlayson)</inline> in offering the most strenuous opposition to the principle embodied in this clause. The Minister said that we are not, at the request of the Imperial Authorities, sacrificing any of our rights of self-government. The trouble in Australia is that the Imperial Authorities are more considerate for the self-governing rights of the Commonwealth than are many people in Australia. Unfortunately, many of our people seem to kow-tow to the British authorities by continuously surrendering Australia's right of self-government. I am quite sure that the Imperial Authorities charged with the administration of the oversea Dominions would not have attained the success that has marked their policy in dealing with different parts of the Empire if they had followed the system which a number of persons in Australia wish adopted. The Minister says that the same principle of reliance upon an Imperial Statute is operating in many other Acts. That admission shows that, although we have full self-governing powers conferred upon us by the Imperial Authorities, we are not prepared to live up to the lull measure of our rights and privileges. The Government seek to commit us to something indefinite and unforeseen. Not only do they wish us to adopt the definition of active service at present contained in the Army Act, although they have not got that definition, but. they ask us to agree . to be bound by every twist or turn that may take place in the Army Act in the future. But the most tyrannical Government that ever existed in Great Britain might come into power and introduce into the Army Act provisions for disciplining its troops abroad, to which our men fighting side by side with them would be amenable. I absolutely object to that. I have spent some time in the Library endeavouring to ascertain, by reference to the Imperial Army Act, what these various alterations mean. Even with the assistance of our experienced Library officials, however, it is almost impossible to trace the many amendments of the British Army Act, and so to discover the true purport of these alterations. We have provided for the consolidation of our Statutes, but that system does not obtain in Great Britain, and in order to find out what is the meaning of these references in the Bill to the British Army Act, one would probably have to look through fifty different amending laws. A skilled lawyer alone could trace them. </para>

If the Honorary Minister endeavours to follow up the various amendments of the Army Act in order to trace the references in this Bill to the Imperial law, it will not be long before he finds himself in an inextricable maze. </para>

Because of that fact would the honorable member have us insert in this Bill words to the effect that the French Army Act shall apply to those of our troops who are under the control of a French General ? I do not think any honorable member would be prepared to agree to any such provision. It is absurd to say that because our men are fighting side by side with the British Forces they should be subjected to the same conditions. In one of the most vital respects our men are not fighting under similar conditions to them. The Imperial soldier receives 1s. a day, whereas the Australian soldier draws 6s. per day. The conditions of service in that respect are altogether dissimilar. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I repeat that there is a difference between the pay of our men and that of the British troops, and there should also be dissimilarity in the administrative conditions. I assert, with some knowledge of what I am speaking, that some of the administrative conditions of the British Army are positively injuring recruiting in Australia. I have seen letters from Australian soldiers at the Front dealing with the way in which they are treated by some of the British Generals. Some of the British Army conditions to which they are subjected are totally foreign to Australian ideas, and must have a detrimental effect upon recruiting. </para>

                <para>The Government are here proposing to expand the ' principle of declaring that such-and-such a provision in the British Army Act shall apply to our Forces. The Imperial Act may be amended from time to time, and we shall not have an opportunity to review the amendments so made and applying to our troops at the Front. Such a principle is absolutely bad, and I most emphatically protest against it. I would strongly urge the Government to embody in the Bill itself any provision of the Army Act which they desire to apply to our Forces. / Whenever any alterations in the conditions of service are to be made, let this Parliament have an opportunity of considering them. Whilst the war exists, we are continuously in session, so that, if at any time the British Government wish to amend the Army Act, it is open to them to cable to us the alterations they propose, and we can simultaneously amend our Act. There is no difficulty in the way of so amending our law, but the principle of committing Australian soldiers to alterations made in the Imperial Act after they have enlisted in Australia - amendments the effect of which even the Honorary Minister cannot foresee - is a vicious one. This principle was strongly objected to in another place, and it should be reconsidered. This is not a mere matter for the Parliamentary Draftsman. Draftsmen do not govern the policy of this country. It may be easier for a draftsman to simply provide in a Bill of this character that such-and-such a provision of the Army Act shall apply to our Forces, but it is infinitely better that there should be direct legislation by this Parliament. </para>
                <para>This principle, as I have said, was strongly opposed in another place, and it is strongly objected to here. If the Government persist in following it in respect of this and other clauses of the Bill, I can only say that the measure will have a very rough passage. </para>

                        <para>- Because it would be impracticable to have our soldiers working under one set of conditions side by side with the Imperial Forces controlled by quite a different set. When they are fighting side by side against a common enemy, it is essential that they should all be under the same law. Discipline demands that they should be. This is a fundamental principle which we have acknowledged from the very inception of our Defence legislation, and it is rather late in the day to suggest a departure from it. I can appreciate the view of my honorable friend that we should embody in the Bill itself the actual governing provisions of the Army Act that we desire shall apply to our Forces while oversea. That undoubtedly is desirable, but there are many difficulties in the way.  His  object might be achieved by attaching to every copy of the Bill a copy of the provisions of the Imperial Act applying, under it, to our Forces. The trouble is that if, during the war, amendments of an urgent character were made in that Act by the Imperial Parliament while we were not in session, an undesirable state of affairs might arise. Proposed new section 54a makes evident the outstanding object of the contemplated alteration, and that is that the British Army Act shall be applicable to our soldiers while they are serving . overseas, and also whilst they are going to the Front and returning to Australia. The honorable member for Brisbane drew attention to proposed new clause 55, which provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">That was the deliberate determination of this Parliament when it framed the Defence Act, which says that the Military Forces shall at all times, while on active service, whether within or without the limits of the Commonwealth, be subject to the Army Act, save so far as it is inconsistent with this Act. We are not altering the law in this respect, but are protecting ourselves by getting power to modify these provisions by regulation. As an honorable member has pointed out, it is necessary that we should have this power. If we had not this power our men might be required to accept the rate of pay given to the British Forces. As' to the definition of active service, about which the honorable member for Yarra spoke, it is to be provided that the term shall have a meaning - corresponding to that of the same words as used in sub-section 1 of section 189 of the Army Act defining the expression " on active service." </para>
                <para class="block">This binds us to the definition now contained in that Act. It is true that the Bill defines the Army Act as the Imperial Act called by that title, and any Act amending, or in substitution for it, and for the time being in force.

I have no wish that necessary discipline shall be lessened, but some of us have suspicions of the Army Act, and are afraid of what may be done under it. Our Defence Act is couched in very differentterms. </para>

                        <para>- Officers who have inflicted heavy fines or sentenced men to long terms of imprisonment, claim to have been acting in consonance with the provisions of the Army Act. No doubt, when our men are transferred to the control of British officers in Great Britain, Egypt, Mesopotamia, or elsewhere, they must come under the Army Act; but they should be kept under our Defence Act as long as possible. I see no reason why those on board Australian transports, under the control of Australian officers, trained under the Defence Act, should not remain under our Act until handed over to the control of British officers. And why should men on their way back to Australia be under the Army Act? </para>

                    <para>.- What the Minister says is quite correct. When the compulsory service proclamation was issued the men who were called up found, after the training was over, that others had been engaged in their places in private employment. I understand that this clause will prevent any recurrence of that in the future. </para>

Last night I asked the Minister why the same provision was not made for all our citizen soldiers up to the age of twenty-one, and the reply was. that these soldiers were paid. I should like to hear from the Minister the exact difference there is between cadets under eighteen years of age, who, I understand, do seventy-two hours' drill per annum- </para>

                    <para>.- Provision should be made so that cadets in the employment of the Commonwealth shall have the same protection as is extended by this Bill to those who are employed by private individuals. In the case of a telegraph messenger in the General Post Office, Brisbane, who was prosecuted for failing to attend the drills, the .only way in which he could make up his time was by attending at his work early in the day, though he did not reach his home from his employment in the post-office until close on midnight. The magistrate, on hearing the circumstances, refused to record a conviction against him. Reasonable discretion should be given to meet such cases, and I hope that the Minister will take the matter into consideration. In Richmond, Victoria, a boy was convicted for having failed to put in the required number of drills.  His  defence and that of his parents was a conscientious objection to military training. I do not wish to raise the whole question of how far conscientious objectors may go in refusing to undertake military service, though the matter might properly be discussed, but the Minister will not disagree with the fact that there are people who have honest, conscientious objections on this score. . The fact that the Act does not allow the magistrate to exercise any discretion is an atrocity in a country like Australia. Conscientious objection to military training does not appeal to me, but I know that there are people who are intensely in earnest in regard to the matter. </para>

                        <para>- The remark of the honorable member is open to two objections. Such a state of things is not likely to arise in Australia, and in the second place people who have conscientious objections to " military training are just as good citizens as those whose consciences do not trouble them in that respect. In fact, the higher the conscientious scruples of a community are the better the community is. *I notice that no effort is being made in this Bill to alter the hours during which cadets' are drilled. I commend to the notice of the Minister a motion which I have on the business-paper urging the abolition of night drills. I hope that the Government are giving the matter consideration. </para>

                <para>For some years I have been urging that compulsory, training should not be confined to boys, but that girls should be trained in nursing, hospital, and Red Cross work. The war has shown what many of us were quite well aware of, that we had latent in Australia an enormous source of valuable assistance to our Military Forces in the shape of the girls of the community whose adaptability to nursing and hospital work is remarkable. Unfortunately nothing has been done to recognise the Red Cross system in Australia. The Army Medical Corps is recognised by the Defence Act, but after all the magnificent service rendered by the Australian nurses during this war, they are still left outside the pale of the measure. Sooner or later we must provide, not only men fit to fight, but also girls who are ready to nurse our wounded. I am sure that the Minister sufficiently appreciates the value of the work done by the nurses at the Front to insure that a 'nursing corps will be made a permanent feature of our Defence system. It is just as necessary to have nurses to. nurse the wounded as it is to have men to do' the fighting. The fact that we have been spared serious losses of men through sickness has been mostly due to the thoroughly well-organized nursing corps which is attached to the Australian Imperial Force. But it had to be scraped together at the last moment, with the result that every capable nurse who went to the Front left  behind her a vacancy, mostly in the hospitals, which could not easily be filled. i hope that something will be done to insure that the Australian girls will be trained in nursing just as the boys are trained for the defence of the country. </para>

                    <para>. - In regard" to the question of cadets employed in the Commonwealth Service, my view is that if the Commonwealth requires' private employers to allow their employees to be trained in the employers' time, the Commonwealth should endeavour to arrange its services so that its employees can do their military training in the Commonwealth's time. I do not know what the Minister's view is, but I shall submit the matter to him. Sections 61 and 143 of the Act exempt, to some extent, conscientious! objectors from duties of a combatant nature, but that exemption does not extend to the training of junior cadets. </para>

                        <para>- It does not say so. At present the boys must be trained outside their hours of work, and the regulations have to be framed to meet .that condition of affairs. We are now amending the Act in order to enable the Department to have the hours of drill either at night or during hours when the boys are required to be at work. The scheme has not yet been worked out, but we are asking for the power to do what the honorable member suggests - that is, to have the drills during such time as the boys are ordinarily employed at work, and to meet the objections that have been raised by parents to night drills. It is about the only objection that parents have raised to compulsory training. They do not raise any objection to Saturday afternoon drills. The boys themselves have raised that objection. I quite agree with the honorable member in regard to the fourth point that he has raised. After the war is over, we should do all we possibly can to form Red Cross branches in Australia as was done in the United Kingdom before the war broke out. In the United Kingdom, a large number of societies have been formed to carry out this work, and fortunately those societies were in operation, and were able to do much valuable work in connexion with the war. I agree with the honorable member for Brisbane that after the war. something on the lines he has suggested must be done. It is a matter of very great importance, and ought not to be lost sight of. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause provides that a senior cadet shall be paid by his employer for any time he is absent from his employment for the purpose of training, but that the employer shall not be liable to pay for any time when, the employee is absent from his . employment for the purpose of training in the Citizen Forces. There is a risk of the whole training being done either at night or on Saturday afternoons. The Minister admits that the Department has not yet worked out a scheme for training the boys on. other than Saturday afternoons. I know the boys have felt keenly the loss of their ordinary recreation on that afternoon. In many cases, the officers have done their best 'to meet the wishes of the boys by avoiding, as far as possible, training on Saturdays. ' The boys are required to parade at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and very often it is impossible for those living m my electorate, and working in the city, to get home from their occupations, have their meals and change into their uniform in time for the parade. No doubt, the same disadvantages are experienced in other electorates to a greater or less extent. Boys -living at Brighton or Sandringham, and working in Melbourne, would find it impossible to be back in. their suburbs much before the time for starting drill. Often on the days appointed for whole-day training boys can be seen going  to work in. their uniforms, so as. to be able to go straight from, their place- of employment to the drill-hall. Often they have been obliged to go to drill without lunch. That system is not good, and I ask the Minister to see if it is not possible to amend the law so that all drills may be done during the day- time, and without depriving boys of their only afternoon for recreation. I am reminded that the large public schools have companies of their own, and boys attending those institutions are allowed to drill on an afternoon to suit themselves. That concession is the cause of much heart-burning amongst other boys who have to leave their employment on Saturday at midday, and give up the afternoon to their drills. I have no very great objection to the night drills, although in some cases it may be difficult for the boys to attend their drills and return to their homes at a reasonably early hour. But I ask the Minister to see that, as far as possible, the drills are carried out in the day-time,  and without entrenching on the Saturday afternoon recreation of the boys. </para>

                    <para>.- I have pleasure in congratulating the Government on amending the law so as to prevent boys from losing their wages for the time which they have to devote to drill. I know that boys employed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and receiving only 7s. 6d. per week, have to suffer deductions of. as low an amount as one penny on account of the loss of working' time caused by their military training. One would think that a large company which has so much property to defend would not be so mean as to make such deductions from the wages of cadets on account of the time given to fitting themselves for the defence of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- The Defence Department has abolished distinctive national uniforms and insisted on all cadets and members of the Citizen Forces wearing khaki, and. we should be careful that there are no differences in the treatment of the boys in connexion with their training. Many of my constituents strongly object that whilst their boys, who work in factories to earn something towards the up-keep of the home, are obliged to devote their Saturday afternoons to drill, young lads of the same age in the various colleges are offered facilities by the Defence Department to do their training at times convenient to them. Military training of our boys is a national undertaking, and I hope that the Government will insist that in the metropolitan areas, at any rate, all boys, whether they are the sons of workers or the sons of swells,  shall be trained on the same days. I desire to eliminate every cause of friction between the boys of different classes. -Honorable members will agree that each college is entitled to have a company of its own, but let the training throughout the community be uniform, and let all the boys in the big centres of population be trained as far as possible together. On Saturday afternoons the thoughts of boys in peace time turn naturally to football and cricket, and it is very hard on working-class boys that on those days they should be required to drill. </para>

The honorable member seems to be determined to come into conflict with the Chair, and seeks to avail himself of every opportunity to .do so. He has just said that this is practically the third time he has been deprived of his privileges. On several occasions, with the object of facilitating debate, I have allowed a little latitude to honorable members, and advantage has been taken of it.  When I interrupted him, the % honorable member for Melbourne was proceeding to deal with the whole position of ' nurses, his remarks being based upon an incidental reference to the subject by the honorable member for -Brisbane, which,  perhaps, I ought not to have allowed. If I were to confine honorable members strictly within the bounds of debate, as laid down by the Standing Orders, it would give rise to irritation, and that I desire, as far as possible, to avoid, The honorable member's reflection on the Chair - his suggestion that I extend to him treatment different from that given to any other honorable member - is most objectionable and I ask him not to persist in such observations. </para>

Cadets living in some of the more remote suburbs of Melbourne are required to travel to given centres to attend .drill, and, although the parade <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> over soon after 9 o'clock, in some cases, the railway- service being poor, it is1 10.30 p.m. before they can catch a train, with the result that .they do .not reach home until 1L30, .and sometimes nearly midnight. 'Many of these boys are apprentices, and if they are late in getting to work next morning they are likely- to be reprimanded. </para>

I wish to put in a plea for boys living in country districts who have to walk 4 and 5 miles along muddy roads in winter time in order to attend drill.

We should do everything possible to popularize the work of training our youths in the defence of their country. I have only to add that I was pleased to hear the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> say that the kilts which have been so long taken away from Scottish soldiers in our Forces should, in his opinion, be restored. </para>

It appears to be an anomaly that men who have gained their commissions on the field have no opportunity to secure appointment as officers in the Permanent Forces. I notice that, under this proposed amendment of the principal Act, power is given to appoint such officers to positions in the non-combatant branches of the Permanent Forces. Why should they not be eligible for appointment in the combatant forces, since they have gained their commissions in the most practical way 1 </para>

                    <para>. - Section 148 of the principal Act was inserted on the recommendation of Lord Kitchener, for reasons which still prevail. It really relates to staff appointments, -and it is the staff officers who deal with the whole science of warfare. It is not the fighting forces alone with which they are concerned. A man might be a first class regimental leader, and yet, by reason of not having the requisite technical training, would not be suitable for a staff appointment. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. In cases where officers of the Citizen Forces have been appointed to the command of regiments or battalions, they have asked that their adjutant should be a member of the Permanent Staff. One of the objects of the Act is that our own boys who have been trained at the Military College, and who, from their school days, devote themselves to a military career, shall be appointed to permanent positions on the Instructional Staff, the duties attached to which necessarily 'involve training and study over a long period. The record by the officers from the Duntroon Military College made in this war is one. of which Australians should be very proud. About 140 lads graduated, and went from there to the war; thirty-one of them have fallen, while forty-two others have been wounded or are missing, fifteen have gained military crosses, as many moi a have been mentioned in despatches, and generally, they have been praised in the highest terms by Commanding Officers at the Front. Their training has stood them in good stead; they have shown individual bravery, skill, and ability under the actual conditions of war fare, and thus the value of the College training has been proved by the hardest of tests. Some of the lads went away to the war before they had completed their courses. Staff officers have functions and duties entirely different from those of other officers. </para>

                <para>The Government has at heart the wel fare of those who have won promotion on the field, and their rank will be preserved when they come back to Australia. Particular inquiries which I have made into this subject confirm everything i said regarding it last night. The official list published on the 1st July last gives the record of all our officers, with the ranks they have gained, and honorary rank is retained when they cease to belong to the Military Forces. While men are under training they cannot assume the rank which they may have won abroad, but directly their training is finished that rank is confirmed to them. We have provided that service across the seas may be taken as equivalent, in the case of trainees, to training in Australia, and we have also provided that privates who have won distinctions may be promoted and made officers in the permanent service of the Commonwealth. Then we have amended section 63 to give preferential treatment in defence appointments to our military, and naval men. Now we are dealing with staff appointments. The necessities of the case require that these should be filled by trained men. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the Committee should pass the clause as it stands. For staff positions educated and highly-trained men are necessary, to control the technical work of the Army. However brave a man may be, or however good a leader in the field, he may be Al at sea in regard to the technical business of the army. The clause, however, gives the Government power to appoint men who have served with a satisfactory record, but are not graduates of the Military College, to be officers of the non-combatant branches of the Permanent Forces, including the medical, veterinary, ordnance, survey, and clerical branches. It also provides that warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Permanent Forces may be appointed to the commissioned rank for the ' position of quartermaster to units of the Australian Military Forces. That is a wise provision. The Minister has told us that if a man has to put in drills as a trainee he will, after his return, still have a chance to be promoted as high as a warrant officer or quartermaster. In regard to the Duntroon officers, all I have to say is that when the College was established we were told that it would turn out men possessed of great technical ability. As one of those who framed the original Defence Act, I venture to say that the College has done even better than we hoped that it would do. As the Minister has said, the boys from Duntroon have made a name in this war which will be ever memorable in the history of Australia. If in the future the College turns out officers as good as these have proved themselves to be, wo need not fear for our military prestige, nor dread that our officers may not possess sufficient technical ability. </para>

                    <para>.- I indorse what has been said by the Minister and the honorable member for Maranoa regarding the Duntroon officers. General Sir Ian Hamilton declared at Gallipoli that every one of them was worth his weight in gold. In every Department they have made good on the battle field. Some of the lads practically went on strike because they were not permitted to go to the Front, and I believe that the regulations were altered slightly so that they might leave after a three years' instead of a four years' course. The students at the College are instructed in every branch of military science. They learn strategy and tactics, and are thoroughly drilled. The training at the College is, I believe, equal to that in any college in Europe or America, and compares favorably with that at Sandhurst., The Minister is right in saying that the graduates of the College should be the future officers of our Permanent Forces. </para>

                    <para>.- I did not speak on the second reading, or in Committee, and I desire to say a few words now in regard to the proposed new section 73c, which provides that any contractor, purveyor, or other person, or any employee, who fraudulently supplies to the Commonwealth, or any officer of the Commonwealth, for the use of the Defence Forces, inferior food, or food less in quality than that specified in the contract, shall be guilty of an offence. Then proposed new section 73d provides that the punishment for any such offence, if the proceedings are taken summarily, shall be a fine not exceeding £20, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months ; and if the prosecution is upon indictment, the punishment shall be imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for any term not exceeding three years. I welcome these provisions, even if they do not go so far as I would wish. Under the Code Napoleon, the punishment for such offences is not fine or imprisonment, but fine and imprisonment, thus preventing the escape of wealthy offenders. When the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> was Minister for the Navy, he informed me, in reply to questions, that bullocks' livers, supplied for the transports, had been found to be infected with hydatids. Luckily, an officer of the. Department found that this meat was diseased, or there is every likelihood that our men, who were going abroad to offer the supreme sacrifice of their lives in defence pf their country, might have been infected with the disease. </para>

                <para>As I am speaking, there is possibly a riot outside on the question of cheap food. The people are meeting in the street ; and I am sorry to say that possibly the gaols to-night may be filled with men who are as earnest as are members of this House in their desire to right the wrongs which, unfortunately, prevail in our midst. </para>
                <para>On the 15th February I asked the then Minister for the Navy whether he could inform me who the men were who had supplied this diseased meat, and the reply was, " I shall tell the honorable member next week."" Week after week I could not get the information, owing to the fact that the then Minister for the Navy had been transferred to the office of Minister, for Trade and Customs. Ultimately, in March last, I asked the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joseph Cook)</inline> whether he would state the names of the contractors who had supplied the meat and bullocks' liver for transports from 1st January, 1916, to 31st December, 1916, and the names supplied to me, in reply, were those of W. Angliss and Company Proprietary Limited, T. K&lt; Bennet and Woolcock Proprietary Limited, and F. Watkins Proprietary Limited. It was then my duty to find out who were the guilty ones, and when I referred to. the matter in the House I quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Graphic</inline> newspaper, which I compliment for having exposed this infamy. What  came out in the press was a mere bagatelle compared to what was done, and if there were a commission of inquiry, it would be found that diseased meat has repeatedly been supplied; and yet the offenders go free. Angliss and Company, if there had been such a law as is now proposed, might possibly have been fined a paltry £20. When speaking on Supply on 7th March last, I quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Graphic</inline> showing that, on 2nd March, 1916, 6th March, 8th May, and 26th May, livers infected with hydatid cysts and fluke had been rejected by the inspectors, and, to the credit of the then Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen),</inline> he insisted that no more livers should be supplied to the Naval Department. I point out to honorable members that if Messrs.' Angliss and Company sent out such meat for . general consumption, the public would not have the benefit of a second examination by a departmental officer. On the 8th March, 1917, I put further questions in the House regarding the supply of diseased meat for the troopships, and I was informed that Messrs. Watkins Proprietary Limited had not supplied any of these livers, but that - </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to the proposed new sections 73c and 73d, in order to show that nothing short of imprisonment ought to be inflicted when offences of this kind are repeated. The Melbourne Municipal Council denied that they ever sent out from their abattoirs any livers except for pigs' food and dogs' food ; so that, if the livers in question did come from the municipal abattoirs, their destination must have been changed to the troopships. W. Angliss and Company Proprietary Limited have their own abattoirs, and they have repeatedly been found guilty of .breaking the Factories Act. I cannot accuse the company of having supplied this diseased meat designedly, but when it happens repeatedly in .the case of our soldiers, I ask what chance the general public have of escaping? Under the Bill .as it stands, the wealthy offender may escape on the payment of a fine, and even if a wealthy purveyor gives £500 to a patriotic fund, the public ought to know that it is possible to realize thousands of pounds by the supply of inferior and diseased meat. </para>

                        <para>- A wealthy offender can always escape if the penalty is fine or imprisonment, whereas he cannot escape if it be fine and imprisonment, as under the Code Napoleon. However, the provision for proceeding by way of indictment may meet such cases as I have cited. It is always difficult to sheet home a charge of the kind to the wealthy proprietor of a large factory, but when we find diseased meat supplied two or three times, it ought to be regarded as <inline font-style="italic">primâ facie</inline> evidence of guilt. </para>

                    <para>.- I would like the Minister to explain what is meant by the word " detention," which occurs in several clauses. It seems to me that it opens up the possibility of discrimination. If a court martial finds any one guilty of an offence there should be no difference in the punishment meted out. One man should not be subjected to detention while another is subjected to imprisonment. </para>

                    <para>. - The word " detention " is used not with the object of assisting any one to escape punishment or for the purpose of giving preference to any one, but because it is thought desirable that military offenders should be subjected to military detention rather than be confined in gaols, where ordinary offenders against the civil law are undergoing imprisonment. </para>

                    <para>. - Many of the amendments made by the Senate are mechanical, and do not involve matters of material substance, but one or two may be regarded by some honorable members as debatable. The first amendment deals with clause 12. As the clause left this House the Commissioner of Railways could be removed from office by the Minister on an address praying for his removal being presented to the Governor-General by the Senate and the House of Representatives in any one session, or by the House of Representatives alone in two consecutive sessions. The effect of the Senate's amendment is that an address for the removal of the Commissioner must be passed by both Houses in one session. It is the practice that is adopted in most of the States, and I propose to accept the view taken by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>Act is to apply to the Railway Service in 'like manner as it applies to the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Some honorable members may consider that we should not give the railway employees the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court of the Commonwealth. I have never hidden my view that it is a point of doubtful expediency and wisdom to give employees of the Commonwealth generally the right to appeal to an Arbitration Court, but the law of the Commonwealth makes that right perfectly explicit and beyond any doubt, and as it is the established policy of the Commonwealth, there is no reason why officers  of the Commonwealth Rail way Service should be denied a right which, is extended to officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. Until the Commonwealth revises the whole procedure, .there is no legitimate reason for making fish of one set of employees and flesh of another set. In that spirit, I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Government on adhering to the principle of arbitration. In view of the attacks made recently on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins and on arbitration work generally, it is pleasing to hear that the principle of arbitration is not yet to be jettisoned, so far as the Commonwealth public servants are concerned, but the attitude of the Government is rather a peculiar commentary on the action of the New South Wales Government, which brought about the present industrial trouble in Australia.' It is well known that the refusal of that Government to employ the arbitration laws of the State to settle an industrial dispute brought about the present regrettable disturbance of which we have had evidence in the streets of Melbourne tonight. </para>

Rightly or wrongly, but in my opinion rightly, the Commonwealth has adopted conciliation and arbitration as a means of preventing and settling industrial disputes, bub the system has largely failed, not because the principle of arbitration is wrong, but because the machinery of the Arbitration Court is unable to deal with cases quickly enough to prevent a dispute taking place. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of what the records show. The Arbitration Court has always had more difficulty with employers than with employees. I believe in the system of conciliation and arbitration, and I congratulate the Minister who, in spite of his personal predilections in the matter, bows to the will of Parliament, and evidently, to the will of the Government, that, in the matter of approaching the Arbitration Court, the railway servants of the Commonwealth shall be given equal facilities to those already' extended to officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. This is a step that will commend itself to the railway employees, and will also have another effect of considerable value; it will offer a guarantee tol the employees now in the Commonwealth service that there is no immediate intention of taking from them their right to approach the Arbitration Court. One can only hope that this principle may be extended until we can have an effective arbitration system to deal with industrial troubles, and I offer a suggestion to the Government, believing that both parties in the House, and the community at large, are anxious to arrive at some system whereby we can avoid the ever-recurring industrial disputes. Would it not be possible to appoint competent men, especially those who have had experience in the Arbitration Courts of the State and the Commonwealth, to prepare a- comprehensive arbitration scheme that will enable us to deal quickly .and effectively with industrial troubles 1 Once <inline font-style="italic">-we</inline> have overcome the war nervousness, which makes everybody unsettled, .we shall. desire to settle down to some system which will prevent these interferences, come from whatever source they may, with the continuance of our industrial activities. The system of arbitration, which we here recognise should be applied to every section of the Commonwealth Service, without restriction and distinction, should be extended generally throughout Australia,' and would, I believe, commend itself to the great majority of the people. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very strongly opposed to this amendment. The Minister has mentioned, as the particular reason why the Senate's wishes' should be conceded, the fact that the Commonwealth Public Service generally has the Arbitration Court available to it. I do not believe in that principle. The alteration in the administration of the Public Service was resisted very strenuously by a considerable number of members now sitting on this side of the House, but was carried by an overwhelming force of numbers, at a time when a good many vicious principles were introduced into the legislation of this. Parliament. In my opinion this amendment does not stand on all fours with the privileges enjoyed to-day by the Public Service, because a Railway ''Department is distinct from every other Department. It is supposed to be removed from political control. In the States there are Railways Commissioners whose business it is to administer the railways on commercial principles, and they are charged with the responsibility of making the systems pay. It is a well-known fact that whoever deals with the payment of employees, and fixes their wages and conditions in any business,- controls that business to a large extent. The purpose of appointing . Railways Commissioners is to insure that the railways shall be managed free of political control. Unfortunately, that object is not always attained, but a Railways Commissioner cannot be made responsible for the successful management of .his Department if he does not control it. </para>

                        <para>- It cannot be made to pay in any case, whether the employees have the right to approach the Arbitration Court, or not, and we cannot have more industrial unrest in connexion with the Commonwealth .Railways than we have had up to the present' time. Therefore, in those respects, the intervention of the Arbitration Court cannot make the position any worse. But I wish to say broadly that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act has not operated in the direction of 'promoting industrial peace. That fact has been demonstrated abundantly during the last three months. The Court has become the storm-centre of industrial unrest. It has promoted a condition of affairs in the industrial life of the community which has been most disastrous. It has been a curse to Australian industries, which can never be built up, so long as we have a continuance of the conditions which have 'obtained in Australia since we have had the present arbitration influence in the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>I maintain that there is a distinction between the railway services and the ordinary services of a Government. , The Railway Service under the Commissioners has special privileges which no other Department of the Public Service enjoys. It has an Appeal Board, for instance, to which men may resort if they are dissatis ' fied with the dictum of the Commissioner. In the interests of the Railway Service, and ultimately in the interests of the men, it would be better for them to continue as they have done in Victoria and South Australia without the right of appeal to the Arbitration Court. In the South Australian Railways there has never 'been a strike, and there is more satisfaction in' that service than.' in . any other Railway Service in the Commonwealth. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> doubt this amendment will be agreed to, but I express the hope- that before long there will be considerable revision of the conciliation and arbitration legislation of the Commonwealth. </para>

Two-thirds of the suburban traffic of Melbourne, however - the Brighton, Caulfield, Camberwell, Kew, and Heidelberg railway services - have to pass through park lands. In some cases, it might be quite impossible to obtain the consent of Parliament to a, railway running through a park, and, in that event, it would be necessary either to tunnel it or. to forego the projected line. This provision, however, would not apply to-day, so far as our big cities are concerned. </para>

                    <para>It is the usual practice for a Government, unless its Treasury is overflowing, to provide in each year for the expenditure of that year. I referred to that fact in my Budget Speech, and also informed honorable members that under the financial arrangement for this year it was proposed to transfer £825,355 from the London Liabilities Account to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, that transfer being necessary if further taxation was to he avoided during the financial year. </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, it is only in respect of moneys belonging to the Consolidated Revenue that the Treasurer is to have any control under this Bill. The balance of moneys lying to the credit of the London Liabilities Account on 30th March last was £4,591,776. Of that amount £2,925,291 belonged to the Consolidated Revenue and the balance of £1,666,485 was derived almost entirely from the Loan Fund, and therefore, will not be interfered with in any way under this Bill. Part of the £1,666,485 which was not derived from the Loan Fund consists of small amounts such as deposits for the completion of contracts. We propose this year to take from the London Liabilities Account £825,355 of the moneys rightly belonging to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. We think it better to do that than to impose fresh taxation this year. </para>

                            <para>- That relates to quite another matter to which I am about to refer. Clause 2 involves no question of policy. It relates only to bookkeeping. Under the law as it stands, moneys received in respect of the hire and earnings of any vessel used as a transport should be credited to revenue if the expenses are charged to revenue; but as the cost of transports is charged to the Loan Fund, clearly such a procedure would be wrong. The Treasury has been crediting to the Loan Fund moneys earned by transports, since transports are paid for out of Loan Account. It is desired now to legalize that process. It would be wrong to credit to revenue moneys received in respect of the hire and earnings of a vessel used as a transport, seeing that the cost of that vessel is being paid for out of Loan Fund. Such earnings should be credited to the fund from which the cost of the vessel is provided. This is merely the legalization of a bookkeeping practice which the Treasury has followed, and which is clearly the correct course to adopt. </para>

                        <para>.- When I held office as Treasurer, the amount to the credit of the London Liabilities Account varied from £900,000 to £2,000,000, or more. I should like to ask the Treasurer whether it is not a fact that the bulk of the money standing to the credit of that account is not operated upon by the Commonwealth Bank, which lends it out on short-dated loans, with the result that it earns something like4¾ per cent. Is not the Treasurer proposing to borrow from that fund, and will he not have to replace it later on? </para>

                            <para>- This money is earning interest, being out on short-dated loans. There is more money now available for taxation than there has' been at any other .period, and taxation is expected. The Treasurer is only postponing the evil day by filling up a gap for this particular year. Next year he may have to make good what he is now taking. By using this £800,000, by gaining £700,000 by a reduction of the sinking fund, with the amount carried forward by way of surplus, and with the £2,000,000 saving on works, the Government has avoided taxation this year to the amount of £6,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- Proposed new section 58a provides that the Treasurer may take various receipts in reduction of expenditure charged to the Loan Fund. I suppose that the chief of these will be the moneys received in respect of the hire and earnings of vessels used for the transport of Expeditionary Forces. When the Treasurer was in opposition, he questioned the present Prime Minister regarding the purchase of ships for the Government, and wished to know when a Bill would be introduced to legalize this transaction. May I ask him his own question? When will such a Bill be introduced ? </para>

                            <para>- It has been stated in this House that every penny of Government expenditure is shown in the Estimates. A former member for Gippsland used to declare, whenever the Estimates came up, that millions were expended on contingencies of which Parliament had no knowledge. Ministers know that a voucher has to be signed for every departmental expenditure over 5s., but over £2,000,000 was spent on the purchase of these ships without reference to Parliament. </para>

                    <para>As to the Bill, the Treasurer says that it is necessary, and certainly money, should not be allowed to lie idle in London when a use can be found for it. Like the honorable member for Grey, I regret that a more comprehensive scheme of taxation is not being brought forward. </para>

                        <para>.- Whether there are any serious amendments to be proposed by the Government in the measure to impose a tax on eligibles - or, as some member has suggested, on bachelors - I do not know; but I presume it will depend largely on the suggestions made by the Government whether the Bill has an easy or a rough passage. The Minister for the Navy has spoken of the amendments from the Senate in the War-time Profits Assessment Bill, but what about the Repatriation Bill? Shall we deal with that tomorrow ? </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to protest against the way in which the censorship is being manipulated at the present time to prevent the publication in Labour journals of articles which deal with industrial matters, and have no relation whatever to the war. I have here an article that has been refused publication in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Socialist.</inline> It is extracted from an American publication, <inline font-style="italic">The International Socialist Review,</inline> and deals with the matter of shop and factory control.

                    <para>The war has precipitated a new discussion in the British Labour circles. This time it is the part that Labour is to play in the management of industry. The syndicalist movement, which had made many gains prior to the war, finds a partial expression in this new development, which will, no doubt, increase in force as time goes by, and the necessity for the reorganization of industry at the close of the war becomes more pressing. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George went to the Clyde last year to deal with the trouble in the work-shops, he returned with the conviction that the controversy, in its essence, was not between the Government and the workers, but was the evidence of friction between fractions in the trade unions. </para>

There is, without doubt, much fermentation in the British unions at the present time. The new spirit will manifest itself more fully at the close of the war.
