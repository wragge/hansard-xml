                            <para>- According to to-day newspapers, it was stated yesterday in evidence taken by the Inter-State Commission that nearly all the millers and about 80 per cent, of the bakers have entered into an agreement not to sell bread below certain fixed prices. Bakers who sell below these prices are not to be supplied by the millers. I ask the Prime Minister if he intends to establish a sub-branch of the National Bureau to give - protection to bakers who desire to sell bread at such prices as they can afford to sell at, independently of the ring to which I have referred? </para>

                                <para>- I do not know his name. All I know is that a witness examined yesterday said that he was engaged in the business of making bread and pastry, ' and that in estimating the cost of' his bread he did not allow for the value of the work done In his shop by his wife and daughter. That man is undercutting other bakers who employ assistance at union rates of wages. How can those who have to pay union rates meet such competition? </para>

This is a free country, in which a man may refuse to offer his services or to sell his goods.

This conflict, which is engendering great bitterness among all sorts of people, will, in the end, work out its own salvation.

I believe that the information in the press is substantially correct, but I have not the full information as yet. I have approved of the issue of the loan, and it is being issued through the Commonwealth Bank. The terms under which' it is being issued have been approved by the Commonwealth Bank and its advisers, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Nivison and Company, and also by the High Commissioner and the British Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- From funds provided under similar appropriations to this one. I ask the honorable member to have a little patience. I shall explain the position. The Trust Fund was also established for other reasons, with which honorable members who were in Parliament at the time are well acquainted.  Any  balance of revenue over expenditure at the end of a financial year is paid into the fund, because there was some doubt as to whether the balance should go back to the States under section 94 of the Constitution. Under a decision of the High Court, any balance remaining at the end of the year can be paid into a trust fund. This is the fund into which balances are paid. </para>

                        <para>- From the consolidated revenue, of course. This measure will authorize us to pay into it from time to time balances up to £10,000,000. Of course, we do not pay anything like that sum in old-age pensions in any  one  year, but when we have any balance at the end of a financial year we pay it into this fund and draw upon it for old-age pensions. There is a safeguard in the fact that the money cannot be withdrawn, except for this purpose, no matter how much money is in the fund. </para>

                        <para>- I have told the honorable member. We are asked year after year to explain these matters to honorable members who have been in the House for years. The same practice as I am proposing has been followed ever since old-age pensions were established, and it is necessary to have large appropriations. When the last financial year closed we had a surplus of about £2,000,000, and we might have had some difficulty, because we had almost exhausted the appropriation, and we could not pay the money into the trust fund unless we had an appropriation for the purpose. </para>

                        <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> originated this fund in order to utilize surplus revenue so that it need not be paid back to the States in addition to the 25s. per head, but I do not think the fund was started with an appropriation of £3,000,000. I cannot understand why the Treasurer wishes to appropriate £10,000,000, because we are not likely to have that amount of surplus revenue. On the contrary we are more likely to have a deficit. </para>

                        <para>- Do we not appropriate a sum of money for old-age pensions every year, apart from this trust fund ? I think we should take as much as possible of the money required for pensions from revenue, and take only the balance required from this fund. I do not know whether it is pertinent to this Bill to ask whether the Treasurer is making provision that old-age pensioners who are in receipt of military pensions, as a result of the death of their sons, shall receive the full pension under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions. Act ? In some cases old people have lost their old-age pensions, because they are obtaining other pensions through, the death of their sons. </para>

                        <para>- At page 2 of the Estimates there appears the line " Balance brought forward from previous year for payment of invalid and old-age pensions, £2,102,177."  That is the estimate for 1917-18. "We passed a measure similar to this to provide for a Trust Fund of £3,000,000 for old-age pensions; but we did not use the whole of that amount, as we drew upon the Consolidated Revenue for portion of our requirements, and  consequently  this balance of £2,102,177 waa brought forward. When we had surplus revenues such a measure as this was necessary in order to prevent their going to the States. We did not, of course, tell the States in those days what was our object in creating this fund. Had we done so the critics of the Federation no doubt would have drawn attention to the ' fact that we had surplus revenue which ought to be distributed amongst the States, and that we had smothered up the fact by passing a Bill, under which we appropriated it for the creation of an Invalid and Old-age Pension Trust Fund. The position to-day, however, is quite different, and I contend that this Bill is unnecessary. _ </para>

It will enable him to refrain from showing the true position of the finances of the Commonwealth. It is really designed to meet his exigencies, and to enable him to juggle with the revenue. He has no £10,000,000 available to be taken out of revenue, and paid into this Trust Fund. If he has he should not be borrowing. The Treasurer will have his own way, since he has a majority behind him, but we have no right to make a needless addition to our statute-book, and to incur the expense of printing a Bill merely to suit the right honorable gentleman, and to lead the public to believe that he is cleverer than he really is. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - I am informed by the Treasury that in previous years as much as £5,500,000 has been paid into the Invalid and Old-age Pension Trust Fund. This is technically an appropriation to provide for the payment of old-age pensions. A Trust Fund is created, and the requisite sum is paid into it. At the beginning of the present financial year there was standing to the credit of this Trust Fund a sum of £1,700,000, but that amount has been reduced by subsequent demands made upon it. When this Bill is passed, money will again be paid out of revenue into the fund. At the end of each financial year, in order to preserve to the Commonwealth the balance existing, the surplus is paid into this Trust Fund to save distribution amongst the States under the Surplus Revenue Act. We have to preserve our right to any surplus revenue because provision has already been made for what was agreed to be an adequate distribution among the States. </para>

What I desire to find out is whether this money can be used as a kind of. shifting quantity, so that when the finances are likely to show a deficit, the Treasurer may lay his hand on the accumulated funds, and, by transferring them to genera] revenue, <inline font-style="italic">come</inline> out with a credit. That is what the Treasurer did with the £3,000,000; and we have a right to ask whether a repetition of this procedure is likely. The Treasurer has asserted that he does not intend to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I heard the Assistant Minister's address on the subject, and I do not think that it was at all conclusive. The nominal object as disclosed by. the Bill itself has to do with the trusts set out in the Audit Act. What are those trusts ? It is theatrical on . the part of the Minister for the Navy to say that we are opposing invalid and old-age pensions. It is perfectly obvious that this money is not to be used for that purpose, and will not be required for it. </para>

It is not contended for a moment that this money is to be used this year or next year. The Bill provides that there shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, for the purposes of the Trust Account established under the ' Audit Act, known as the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Fund - a mere technical description of the fund- the sum of £10,000,000 for invalid and old-age pensions. </para>

I wish to record my protest against the attitude of the Minister for the Navy. It is a reasonable request to be informed for what purposes this money is being appropriated, seeing that it is perfectly clear it cannot be used for . pensions. The payment of pensions does not depend on the passage of the Bill, and, therefore, we ought to know the object of themeasure. </para>

                    <para>. - It is not my intention to take up time on a formal measure of this kind. It appeals to me as one similar to that introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> whom  I sat behind <inline font-style="italic">in.</inline> 1914, for the purpose of  obtaining money for invalid and old-age pensions. It  is a sad reflection to me to find honorable members, with whom I was associated so long, and who were the means of introducing old-age pensions, now taking such a course as may compel the Treasurer to withdraw the Bill, and thus deprive the pensioners of their rights. The attitude assumed by honorable members opposite is purely for party purposes. I should like to know if it is not a fact that not long ago we had the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> telling the people of Darwin that, if the present Government were returned to power, old-age pensions would be abolished ; that was the fulcrum on which honorable members opposite placed their lever in their efforts to defeat their opponents. </para>

I hope the Treasurer will not go to the extreme suggested, and withdraw the Bill, though the course taken by honorable gentlemen opposite would warrant such a step, and the responsibility would be theirs. As one who was a member of the Ministry that increased the old-age pension by, half-a-crown a week, I hope that nothing will be done to injure the administration of the Act. </para>

                        <para>- That is the intention. The Treasurer has not given the information that was asked for, and I have already pointed out that members know too little regarding the financial proposals that are put before them. We ascertained this morning that there  i3  on the Estimates an item providing for the expenditure of £600 that should not be there. Cases like that create suspicion. Members are the watchdogs of the public interest, and when the Bill is before us 1 shall have something more to say about these matters. </para>

                <para class="block">Every one should know that money put into this Trust Fund cannot be spent except for the purposes of the fund. This year we carried to the fund £2,000,000 from a surplus which we did not anticipate. We do not know what may happen in the future; we may again have a surplus ; but it is wise to make this provision. Money is placed to the credit of the fund only as it" is needed. If we placed to the credit of the fund more money than was needed to pay old-age and invalid pensions, we should not be able to get it out without the authority of an Act of Parliament. The plan adopted is to estimate the sum that will be needed for invalid and old-age pensions, and to place on the Estimates an amount sufficient, in addition to that to the credit of the Trust Fund, to pay the commitments for the year. If there were enough in the fund to do that, no amount would be put on the Estimates. We live from year to year in our financial arrangements. We do not need to maintain a nest egg for invalid and old-age pensions. We simply want enough to meet the requirements of the year and a little over. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable members opposite wish to reduce the £10,000,000, let them do it, but if Parliament is unanimous in making provision for the future it will show that it has no idea of abolishing invalid and old-age pensions. If it were not for section 94 of the Constitution, we might very well deal with old-age pensions in the same way as we provide for the maternity allowance - vote the money each year for the purpose. However, we do not know what balances we may have, and this Trust Fund provides a method of disposing of them. There is really nothing in the whole thing. If it does last for more than two years, all the better. It will not be necessary to come to Parliament again for some time. </para>

Honorable members were asked on the platforms what their policy was, and they said, " To win the war, and nothing else." Yet the Treasurer comes forward and takes up valuable time with this Bill, though he says there is nothing in it, and that he thought of doing away with the necessity for it. When the right honorable gentleman holds such a poor opinion in regard to the Bill, he might have met our friendly criticism this morning less heatedly. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer has told us that there is nothing in the Bill. The Acting Prime Minister said that if we debate it he will withdraw it. Therefore my original contention that we should not encumber the statute-book with Bills that are not necessary holds good. The so-called National Win-the-war Government has pledged itself to economize, and not to spend public money unnecessarily, but when the Treasurer brings forward a Bill which he describes as superfluous, it is a waste of public money. He is taking up the time of the House, and wasting your time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in the reading of messages from the Governor-General, and he is wasting public money by having these messages and so many copies of the Bill printed, and by .having so many copies of the measure afterwards bound in calf. Every pound of revenue we waste will involve the borrowing of more money in London or elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- As I have just entered r!\e chamber, I do not know very much about what has occurred, and, therefore, 1 suppose I am best fitted to deal with the situation. Although I have been in the House about sixteen .years, I have not known the suspension of an honorable member to take place more than two or three times. I know that on one occasion I was nearly suspended, but the broadminded view taken by the  Speaker  of the day made that course quite unnecessary. The honorable member for Capricornia has had ample time to realize that he must pay to the Chair that respect which our position as members of a deliberative body makes necessary. I am the last man in  the world to criticise others for making heated and unpleasant remarks, and I do not propose to -criticise the honorable member on this occasion. But, having offended, the honorable member is now asked to withdraw his remark and apologize to the Chair, and I hope he will do that. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the Minister for the Navy deferred to the Prime Minister without having actually moved any motion. The Prime Minister has now appealed to the honorable member to obey the rules of the House,  and to do what is customary in- these circumstances. We all must make allowances, one for the other, for words uttered -in the heat of the moment, but we must likewise realize that the rules of Parliament must be observed .if we are to study the dignity of the House and have regard to what is due to our own self-respect. I, too, appeal, to the honorable member, because it would be very unpleasant for me to put to the House a motion for his suspension. I should prefer not to have to perform so distasteful a duty. </para>

I should, how ever, like- the Treasurer to explain why, having regard to our present financial difficulties, he asks for the appropriation of so huge a sum as £10,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- The fund was created as a sort of reservoir into which would flow the. surplus moneys of. the Commonwealth, and it was determined that out of that reservoir would be drawn the amounts necessary to pay invalid and old-age pensions. According to the Budget papers, the expenditure on these pensions last 'year amounted to £3,518,987, and the estimated expenditure for the current year is £3,830,000, so that, allowing for the balance carried forward, £2,139,039, the Government will need £1,700,961 to meet its estimated liability in respect of the fund for the current year. That being so, and taking the Treasurer's own statement, with which' I cordially agree, that we should finance ourselves from year to year, and should not unnecessarily mortgage ourselves in respect of future expenditure, why does the right honorable gentleman ask for authority to pay £10,000,000 into this fund. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to do that. During this debate the statement has repeatedly been made, by honorable members opposite that any attempt to reduce it would be used as an argument that we were opposed to the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. If I were so to move, the Treasurer would not hesitate to charge me with being opposed to them. I suggest that the right honorable gentleman, who is the responsible financial authority, should tell us why he wants this £10,000,000. Obviously he is looking three years ahead. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. It will be time enough next year, when we estimate our liability under this heading, to make the appropriation necessary to meet that liability. To meet a prospective liability, three years ahead, seems to me to be a system of finance entirely opposed to the generally careful financing of the Treasurer. </para>

It is not a cogent argument to suggest that the amount paid into the Trust Fund cannot be used for anything else. The point that appeals to me is that if for this purpose the Government appropriate £10,000,000 out of revenue they must necessarily have £10,000,000 less revenue to use on something else. </para>

                    <para>.^-1 found it difficult to appreciate the object which the Treasurer had in view in asking us this morn ing -to agree to an appropriation of £10,000,000 for the purposes of this Bill. As one of those who have done everything possible to secure the payment of old-age pensions, I had some doubt as to the intentions of the Government and their supporters; and feared that there might be an attempt on their part to make some alteration in the existing Act, or to reduce the pensions. I do not think this Bill is going to do much to help us to win the war, but since he introduced the proposal the Treasurer has given some information which has certainly relieved my mind. It is only reasonable to assume that no proposal to reduce or interfere with the payment of old-age pensions would come from the Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- I shall never vote for any measure until I am satisfied as to the object it is intended to serve.  In moving for the appropriation in Committee this morning the Treasurer told us practically nothing as to the object he had in view, and it was almost as difficult to extract information from him as it is to draw a tooth. The right honorable gentleman said that he did not care whether we passed this Bill or not. The Treasurer will not deny that when he asked us to accept this Bill he said he did not care whether or not the amount was reduced. </para>

I feel sure that if the measure were relegated to the waste-paper basket it would not interfere in the slightest with the provision for old-age pensions. However, I am not going to  vote  against the Bill, being satisfied, after hearing the Treasurer, that it will do no harm, while affording us an opportunity of informing the honorable gentleman that when he desires to have Appropriation Bills accepted he should give us the information to which we are entitled.

                    <para>.- I do not desire to take up much time, but merely to press on the notice of the Government many cases in which I feel assistance is needed. There are people who, by absence in England for more than two years, have rendered themselves ineligible for old-age pensions. There are also cases of destitution, more of which, perhaps, come under my notice than under the notice of other members. However, I suppose that all of us have met with instances that are nob covered by the present Act and amending Acts. There is an amendment I should like to move in the Bill before us, which, if accepted, might mean a little more expense, but would be of great value. It provides for pensions for those who are destitute, and who sign the statutory declaration that they are absolutely in need of food and shelter. The persons before whom such a declaration would be made can be named by the Government, and a certain period set aside for inquiry. In the present stage of society it is recognised that every human being who is unable to earn a living must be supported, and that support must be provided either by the Government or by private charity. In Victoria, at one time, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner decided that no one should be imprisoned because he was poor - " without visible means  of support " - and while that gentleman had power no such person was imprisoned. I am sure no one would accuse Australians, by birth or adoption,  of being ready to commit perjury for the sake of 10s. a week. </para>

                <para class="block">This is a somewhat technical Bill. Under section 2 of the Freight Arrangements Act 1915, the Treasurer was authorized to charge cost and freight received in respect of Australian produce only. These transactions were to pass through the banking account- entitled, " Commonwealth Treasurer - Freight Arrangements Account." However, in order to make the best use of the vessels, particularly i those on voyages to Australia, it has been found essential to utilize them for carrying cargo other than Australian produce; and this Bill gives the necessary authority to enable the cost and freight on such business to pass through the banking account named. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the Bill will apply to the fifteen steamers purchased by the Prime Minister for the Commonwealth, and also to other steamers. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> on a previous occasion drew attention to the fact that the Commonwealth at the present time is compelling all freight to be chartered through Government charterers. He and others have found fault with the present arrangement whereby all the freight business has to go through the hands of the two firms that act as agents for the Government. These two firms may be the most honorable in the world, but it may, nevertheless, not be advisable for us to concentrate the whole of the freight business in the way in which it is now concentrated. I have no objection to the systematizing of shipping by giving the control of it wholly to the Government, with a view to making the best of what freight is offering. We all hope that the time may soon come when freight will be looking for tonnage instead of tonnage looking for freight, which is the present state of affairs. </para>

                    <para>. - The Governor-General's message recommends an appropriation for the purposes of a Bill to amend section 2 of the Freight Arrangements Act of 1915. That section empowers the Treasurer to borrow from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia " moneys for the payment of moneys in respect of arrangements for freight on  Australian  produce," and the Treasurer is required to pay into the Commonwealth Bank all moneys " received by the Commonwealth in respect of freight, or arrangements for freight, on Australian produce." The amendment is merely a technical one to sanction arrangements for freight on other than Australian produce. </para>

Was that statement correct? If so, is the agent acting on commission or is he paid a salary? </para>

I do not censure the Government for what is being done, because I think that Ministers have been justified by the circumstances of the case. .The honorable member for Melbourne Ports, although he did not say so, seems to think that if the vessels purchased by the Prime Minister do not confine their voyages to Australian and British ports, they will not do what they were bought to do. Those who know anything about shipping know that it would not pay to send vessels here in ballast. That would not help our producers. To make shipping pay, it is necessary to get cargoes both ways, and, therefore, these vessels have sometimes to be sent from the Old Country to America to get cargo for Australia. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Boyd)</inline> appears to think that it is not wise that the Government should have the whole control of freight arrangements of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what the position of the Australian producer or merchant would be if the arrangement of shipping had been left entirely in the hands of private individuals. The fa*ct that the British authorities have practically all vessels sailing under the British flag under control has compelled us to follow suit, but I do not know that any great harm would 'happen if the Government should assist or take cognisance of any person who could get freight on his own account. No doubt the powers of monopoly that the Government are exercising do impinge upon our preconceived notions of the individual's rights, but we have Hobson's choice in- the matter. The logic of facts, as Napoleon III. said, has been the guiding principle. The situation to-day is such that we have to exercise this monopoly, even to the extent of preventing any merchant from chartering a vessel on his own. Therefore, I do not see that any harm will follow our agreeing to the motion. It is but a logical conclusion of the Act that we have already passed. </para>

                    (Melbourne) r3.3].This is the first opportunity we have had since 1915 of discussing the question of freights and shipping. I agree with honorable members that we have very little, information with regard to the vessels that were bought, except the scant paragraphs that one occasionally sees in the newspapers. I do not suppose that any honorable member knows how many .of these ships have visited Australia, or how many have been here on a second trip. No one will argue that the vessels should be permitted to come out here in ballast.
                </para>
                <para>People connected with shipping are very anxious to know if any commission has been paid on the purchase of these steamers. Under a previous Government various commissions were sought from the Navy Department, but, to the honour of the Department, it must be said that these were checked, and not allowed to be paid. There is a State Act which prevents the payment of secret commissions. I would make it a criminal offence punishable, not by a fine, but by imprisonment, to take a secret commission. In regard to the matter of freights, the only shipowners who did not raise their freights at the outbreak of the war were the Western Australian Government. </para>

                    <para>- The latest returns show that a profit was made, but the matter must be regarded, not from the point of view of making a profit from the vessels, but from the point of view of the saving to the public. Ask any one on the western coast of Australia whether he will agree to giving up these vessels. The Western Australian Government dare not shut down on this venture. I believe that the Prime Minister is the. only person who knows whether any commission was paid on the purchase of  the  Commonwealth vessels. I do not believe that he has told any member of his Cabinet or any honorable member opposite. </para>

As the' Pacific is free from submarines and other enemy vessels, it is practically safe so far as human beings can make it. Another benefit accruing to Australia by carrying out my suggestion would be the large employment that would be afforded to people in every State The mills would be working full time. We should be able .to make an arrangement with America to ship one bag of flour from her east coast to England for every two bags that we land on her west coast. While we have more wheat on our hands than we need, America has less than she needs. If necessary, our troops could also be carried in the vessels taking our flour to America. We know that mines have been laid as far south, in the Atlantic as the Cape of Good Hope, that the Suez Canal route is dangerous, that the Mediterranean Sea is full of danger, that  the  Gibraltar passage is precarious, and that the Channel cannot be protected as we would wish. Therefore, let us grist our wheat, and send it across the- Pacific to America, and save one ship in every three. </para>

Yet the Government regulations have so tied up the freight question that no person can bring vessels to Australia to load wheat unless those vessels are chartered to the Government agents. Naturally, a firm says, " We are not going to transfer our charter to the Wheat Board, because, if we do that, the Wheat Board may put the vessel into competition with the business of the owner." The owner of the vessel in question is one of the biggest millers on the Pacific coast, and he desires to get Australian wheat for milling "at San Francisco. </para>

Sydney or Melbourne (at the Government's option), and the result thereof. </para><para>Our firm are representing one of the biggest milling concerns on the Pacific coast of the United States of America. About two weeks ago they cabled us for a quotation for 6.000 tons of milling wheat f.o.b. Sydney or Melbourne, one port of loading, the buyers to supply the steamer. We applied to the Australian Wheat Board for a quotation, and we were refused. We asked' for the reason of the refusal, which they also refused to give. We herewith hand you copies of letters that have passed between the Australian Wheat Board and ourselves. We also  give  you herewith copy of the cable received from America. </para><para>The following are the details of the situation as it apparently affects the Government, and as it does affect ourselves and the community generally: - </para><para>Government policy. - It seems that the Government's policy is to control all freight for the carriage of wheat to the United States of </para><para class="block">America or elsewhere, through their chartering agents, Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Company and Elder, Smith, and Company Limited, also that the sale of all wheat carried by the Government shall be sold through the sole agents of the Government appointed in San  Franciso  (Balfour, Guthrie, and Company). To show you the fallacy of this, the Government chartering agents cannot rule all freight between Australia and America for the carriage of wheat, for the reason that our American clients will not transfer the vessel to the Government chartering agents, and they are right in refusing to do so, because if they agreed to transfer the vessel which they hold at present to the Government chartering agents there is no guarantee - and the Government will not guarantee - that the cargo of such vessel would be sold solely to them. Therefore, what is the use of their transferring the vessel? It would be absolute folly on their part to transfer freight which they command to the Government, who might possibly sell the wheat by such vessel to their competitors in America. This is absolute proof in itself of one very great weakness in the Government scheme. It is just possible that our clients are the owners of the vessel, although we cannot vouch for it, or, on the other hand, they may have it on time  charter </para><para>This will, therefore, show you clearly that we even could, not recommend to  out  clients to transfer such vessel to the Government chartering agents. </para><para>On the other hand, we contend that so long as wo can prove to the Government that the wheat is for a company composed wholly of American citizens, who are now citizens of a country allied with Great Britain, that there should be no objection to quoting us f.o.b. Sydney or Melbourne, as requested by our clients. It would be of the greatest benefit to the Commonwealth generally. </para><para>If we could get an outlet for wheat, which is at present rotting in Australia, and we are not making this latter statement without absolute knowledge, we would be very pleased to take some members of the Government to some of the stacks lying in New South Wales, and let them see the deplorable condition of same. It is heart-breaking to see the wheat lying here being riddled with weevil while we have the means of shifting it at a very attractive figure to America, and at the same time such outlet is blocked simply through, we think, the stubbornness of the Government chartering agents in endeavouring to hold to a policy which is impracticable. </para><para>If you can possibly shift the Prime Minister from his determination to stick to the present scheme, and induce him to allow us, or any other firm that has the freight, to receive a quotation for wheat f.o.b. Sydney or Melbourne, or whatever loading point the Government desire, we are confident you would earn the  everlasting thanks  of the Commonwealth and of the wheat shippers generally, and we make this remark knowing that we are backed up here by some of the biggest exporting houses. </para><para>From our stand-point,, there is only one man who can alter this at the present time, and that is the Prime Minister. We would like to have your views on the matter. </para><interjection>

                    <para>- I spoke to the Prime Minister about it, and he said that if this man could send the ship here, he wag quite entitled to a commission, and that the Government were prepared to make the  necessary  arrangements. That, however, is not the point.  The point is that if he transfers his vessel to the Government chartering agents, they may load her up for some other firm. This merchant requires the wheat to mill in his own mill in San Francisco. He will benefit us by -buying our wheat and sending his own steamer for it, and, that being so, what is in the way of the Government giving him a charter and allowing him to bring as many vessels as he can to remove our wheat? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; the distance is shorter. This, however, is not an 'Australian ship. The main point I wish to urge is that we should avail ourselves of every means of removing our wheat and putting it into .consumption before the next crop is harvested. Anything that will help in that direction ought to be encouraged. We should not stand rigidly by the law passed some two years ago, and which created a monopoly, as if it were a law of the Medes and Persians: </para>

He told me that under the agreement they received 4d. a ton on all freight shipped, so that it did not matter to his firm whether this vessel was brought here <inline font-style="italic">car</inline> not.  His  only point of difference with me was that he did not think the vessel would materialize. He said he had heard of other vessels that were coming here, but which had never arrived. That might possibly happen in this case. I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibbs</inline> to say, however, that his firm had no objection to any vessels coming here. </para>

The firm to which I have referred are quite satisfied to buy the wheat through the Wheat Board. According to their letter they applied to the Board for a cargo, f,o.b. Melbourne or Sydney, and were refused. They were told that the owner of this vessel would have to re-charter it to the Government chartering agents </para>

I do not want to abolish Government control over the shipping, but, at the same time, I should so amend the regulations that any man may be at liberty to bring a ship here secure , in the knowledge that he can obtain a cargo of wheat and carry it away to his own mills, whether they be in San Francisco or in any part of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Prior to that no wheat was paid for f.o.b. This Parliament has a right to know what is the cost of the carriage of our wheat oversea. It must not be forgotten that, in addition to the 3,500,000 tons to which reference has just been made, a further 2,500,000 tons will be available when the present crop is harvested some four' or five months hence. The rates paid for the carriage of wheat oversea prior to the war are well known to honorable members. Wheat was then carried oversea for 5d., 6d., or 7d. per bushel. The rates ranged from about 13s. to £1 per ton. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see that that applies. If the British Government are going to find the freight in the future, it does not matter to them what has been paid in 'the past. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs, we got freight through the Department for about 90s. a ton from Australia, when 150s. a ton was being paid from the Argentine. What I complain about! is the enormous rise that has been charged in freights by the British ship-owner. I agree with the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald)</inline> that had the British Government taken over the whole of the shipping at the outbreak of the war, they would have served the British Empire well. In not doing so, they made one of the biggest blunders possible. At the outbreak of the war, steel steam-ships could be launched at a cost of £8 per ton. To-day they could not be bought, even with the two or three years of age upon them, at less than from £60 to £70 per ton, and ship-owners to-day say they expect the cost to increase up to £100 per ton. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law stated in t'he House of Commons that where he had invested a sum of about £8.000 in fifteen shipping companies, it had returned to him £7,352 in two years, after paying war profits taxation and insurance to replace sub-marined vessels. These are the people who have been robbing the farmers at this end of the world, and the consumers at the other. </para>

Where you could buy a brand-new ship at £8 per ton, they were getting £20 a ton for the round trip from Great Britain to Puget Sound. Producers here have a right to know what has been paid for the freight on the article they produce, when it is taken overseas. </para>

                    <para>That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to amend the Sugar Purchase Act 1915. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">This is a very small matter. The Act of 1915 authorized the Treasurer to borrow money from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the purchase of sugar and the payment of Customs duty on sugar imported. The money was to be kept in an account called the " Commonwealth Treasurer's Sugar Account," in the Bank, and the net amount to be borrowed by the Treasurer, after crediting to the account receipts in respect of the sale of sugar, was to be limited to 6£500,000. The Act mentioned empowers the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to charge interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per -annum when the debit balance of the account exceeds the amount at credit of the Commonwealth Public Account and the Commonwealth Departmental Accounts. The Bank has charged interest on the  overdraft  without regard to the amount at the credit of the Commonwealth Public Account and the Departmental Advance Accounts, but such interest was immediately paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The present Bill legalizes this course.The result is 'that the sugar business is charged with interest, which goes into. the Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Treasury found the money, and, of course, is entitled to the interest. The Bank, therefore, charges the sugar business with the interest, which goes into the Consolidated Revenue. That is the sole object of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that when the sugar was sold to the public at  3 1/2 d.  per lb., there was a neb  profit  of £500,000. The growers of Queensland took exception to the Dickson award, with which they said they could not comply unless they were paid an extra amount. The adjournment of the House was moved by the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> for the purpose of ascertaining how the matter stood, and the Prime Minister announced that it was intended to make available to the farmers the £500,000 profit which had been made on the sale of the sugar. I took exception to this action at  the time; indeed, honorable members on both sides took exception to it; and I wish to know whether, under this Bill, the Treasurer will be empowered to charge the people of Australia more for their sugar than they ought to pay, and to hand over to the growers another £500,000, or a similar sum ? </para>

                        <para>- We knew that there would be a slight, profit, and were of opinion that the Consolidated Revenue was entitled to it. However, in the last hours of a dying 'Parliament, the Prime Minister announced that this money was to be handed over to the growers; and honorable members behind the Government were as keenly opposed to this as were honorable members on this side. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 cannot understand the attack made by the Leader of the Opposition on this industry. In the first place, the statement that the Government handed £500,000 back to the growers is not in accordance with fact; it  Went  into the Consolidated </para>

                <para class="block">Revenue. Nothing was handed back, but at the eleventh hour the present Government have contrived to rectify an injustice, done by the late Government to the sugar industry. Because there  was  more political influence at the back of those interested in wheat, minerals, fruit, and wool, they were allowed to sell at  a  higher price than ever before, and not one fraction of the profit went into the Consolidated Revenue. Queensland has not very many representatives, and, unfortunately, honorable members generally know very little about the sugar industry, although it is their duty to study it; and the result is that the late Government have robbed that industry of over £1,000,000- not £500,000. Why should any distinction be made between one  class  of producers and another ? If it was just to take £1,000,000 from the producers of sugar in Queensland, iti would be equally just to take something from the producers in the southern States of wheat, minerals, fruit, wool, meat, and other products. I never could understand why this Parliament should make fish of one and flesh of another. The action taken was very nearly, the means of closing practically the only industry which can be carried on on the great north-eastern seaboard of Queensland in such a way as to justify the Commonwealth and the Empire holding that part of Australia against other nations who might desire to occupy that territory for their surplus population. Instead of criticising the Government, for trying even at the eleventh hour to do justice to the sugar industry, which, for many reasons, is vital to the defence of the Commonwealth, honorable members should applaud them. The action taken by the previous Government very nearly resulted in half the sugar-growers of Queensland going out of the industry. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable members do not heed it they will go on in the same direction until they have ruined the sugar industry.- When, by following that course of action, they find the north of Queensland occupied by a coloured population, they will begin to understand who were really the friends of the White Australia policy. The action of the late Government was not in the interests of that policy, but quite the reverse. The only  way in which the policy can be maintained is to keep the sugar industry alive as a white man's industry. I should like to remind honorable members that in one district of Queensland to-day 50 per cent: of the sugar-growers are Italians.- </para>

It is as well, I think, that honorable members should know that Britishers are being forced out of the sugar industry in Queensland, and their places are being taken by Italians, who work upon a co-operative basis, and are not bound by the decisions of any Wages Board. </para>

                        <para>- We have information that firms purchasing as much as from £80,000 up to £100,000 worth of sugar per annum are allowed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company but a very - limited rebate, whilst other firms purchasing not nearly so much are allowed a rebate of 6 per cent., because they happen to be old customers of the company. I have received complaints on this matter from firms in a very large way of business. When the Government undertake to fix the price of an article they should see that these iniquitous trade customs are not used to prevent all purchasers being placed on the same footing. </para>

I repeat that when the Government attempt to fix the price of any commodity they should see that all trading in it are treated in the same way. The whole of the details connected with the sugar' deal should be made known to honorable members, and I was hoping that, as we are now considering a measure dealing with sugar, they -would be fully explained, 'and we should be told what has become of the' £500,000. Are the growers getting the  whole  of this money, or are some of the rich millers, including the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, getting some of it. </para>

                <para class="block">The Bill is purely formal. What is asked to be done is already being done, but not in a legal manner. The War Loan Act of 1914 authorized a loan of £18,000,000, and the War Loan Act No. 2 a loan of £6,500,000, in the United King-, dom for war purposes. All such moneys were to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The money borrowed from the Imperial Government prior to the 30th . June, 1915- £14,100,000- was so paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Later it was decided that it would be better to pay what remained into the Loan Fund, and the War Loan Act (United Kingdom) No. 1, 1916,' directed that the  balance, namely, £10*400,000, should be  paid into the Loan Fund. The amount paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund - £14,100,000  -  was appropriated by Parliament in the ordinary revenue Estimates, and the necessity for providing that the £10,400,000 should be paid into the Loan Fund was overlooked at the time, but no* by me. The Bill, therefore, makes the necessary appropriation from <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Loan Fund. The purpose of the Bill is' merely to put the transaction on a proper footing. </para>

            </quote>
            <para>The Bill gives a concession to persons receiving military pensions and allowances who are also the holders of old-age pensions. The definition of "income," in section 4 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act necessitates allotments of soldiers' and sailors' pay being regarded in some cases as income, and this affects the rate of the old-age pensions. The Bill provides that these allotments shall not in any way interfere with the rates of old-age and invalid pensions. It is proposed to amend the clause so that pensions granted <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> dependants of soldiers shall not affect the old-age or invalid pensions held by them. If the dependant of  a soldier  has or applies for an old-age or invalid pension, any war pension that he or she may be in receipt of will not interfere in any way with the amount of that pension. Under the Act, parents who are adequately maintained by sons at the war are not entitled to invalid pensions, but the Bill removes this bar to the granting of such pensions. </para>

                    <para>.- I . have studied the Bill in consultation with the honorable member for Batman, and it seems to me to give effect to the intention which the Treasurer has stated. Those <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> live in districts from which' large numbers of soldiers have gone know the hardships which have been occasioned by the existing law. A dozen or more cases have come within my notice during the last month in which old-age pensioners have had their pensions reduced upon the death of their sons killed on active service abroad. This is a scandal, and I am glad that the Treasurer is putting an end to it. I think it would have been righted by any man occupying his position. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Treasurer on proposing these very necessary amendments of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. I think that I was the first to draw attention to the disabilities which the Bill is designed to remove. One or two cases came before me, and when I mentioned them last March, the Treasurer promised to have them rectified. Honorable members generally recognise that it is a serious defect of the existing law that a widow, supported by an only son, has her old-age pension reduced by the amount of the war pension she gets should he be killed on active service. I am glad that this disability has been removed. </para>

                    <para>.- I, too, compliment the Treasurer on having brought forward the Bill, which is probably the most humane piece of legislation that we shall pass this session, and the sooner it becomes law the better. One or two honorable members on this side have taken a keen interest in the matter, and as they are not now present, it is only fair to mention their names. As the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> would say, a small "meed of praise " should be given to the honorable members for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> and Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> for what they have done in this matter. I am sure that every Honorable member is pleased that the law is to be amended in the manner proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I know of no agreement. Clause 12 provides that the Minister may remove any Commissioner from office on an address praying for his removal being presented to the Governor-General by the Senate and the House of Representatives in any one session, or by the House of Representatives alone in two consecutive sessions. TheSenate has deleted the words " or by the House of Representatives alone in two consecutive sessions thereof" and the following words. The effect of their amendment is that an address for the removal of the Commissioner must foe passed by both Houses.. The Government propose to accept that view. I move - </para>

                    <para>.- At 4.10 I informed the Treasurer that the Opposition  were  willing to allow the Government to dispose of the Sugar Purchase Bill, the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill, and the Commonwealth Public Service Bill, so that the House could adjourn by 4.30. I did not understand that we were to deal with the Railways Bill. There are certainly one or two things in the Senate's amendments to this Bill that cannot be disposed of in the time agreed upon. I suggest that the Minister should report progress. </para>

                <para>When we were dealing with the Bill in Committee, honorable members brought forward the  case  of men who were serving on ships of war on our coasts, and were ordered out on active service. The first amendment has been made so that the men who are serving in the Navy shall be in the same position as those who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and did not  go  to the Front. The next amendment deals with the question of accepting the certificate of  a  university, or other examining body. The Senate has added the words " in  any  part of the British Dominions." The third amendment deals with the question of temporary employment. The provision was criticized, and I promised to reconsider it; and, as a result, an amendment has been made in another place, the effect of which is that, if  a  report is given by the permanent head of  a  Department in which a returned soldier has been employed for six months on temporary work, stating that he has performed his duties satisfactorily, the period of his employment may be extended from time . to time by tha Commissioner for such periods as ha thinks fit. </para>
