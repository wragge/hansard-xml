I promised to make an inquiry, and I am now informed that no transfers &#38;&#62; the artillery have been authorized since the 31st May last, the date on which recruiting for the artillery stopped.

                            Is he aware that it is reported that the reason for their absence is the fact that the unions .have declared the coal used for the trains running between Sydney and Melbourne to be black? Is the Government providing free &#62; steamer fares for the travelling of these members? Is it the intention of those who refuse for the reason mentioned to travel by train-to attend the sittings of this Parliament to refund their Parliamentary remuneration for the period of their absence ?

                        <para>- I have noticed the absence of some members of the Opposition, and can quite believe in  some of their cases that the cause is that communication between Sydney and Melbourne has been somewhat interfered with by the industrial disturbance in New South Wales. I have road that the unions have declared coal to be &#34; black,&#34; though, so far as I know, that! declaration has had no effect on the colour of coal. I am not aware that the Government is providing free steamer fares for members, &#39; nor &#34; do I know that members who may refuse to travel by train at the present time have any intention of foregoing any portion of their Parliamentary remuneration. I should be very much sur- . prised to learn of such an intention. It would indicate such an amazing departure from what my long experience of members of Parliament has taught! me to expect that I would begin to believe that the millennium was at bland.

                            was brought under my notice by the committee of management of the Waterside Workers Federation, which attached considerable importance to it as an indication that the prices of meat here. are much higher, than they ought to be. I was not aware that the Queensland Government had commandeered the beef sold in the Queensland State shops at 3&#189;d. -per lb., and that the price paid by the British Government for similar meat is 4d. per lb., or that the prices quoted are for cash only. The House and the country is obliged to the honorable member for making these facts known, because statements which have appeared in the press have had the effect of greatly misleading the people both as to the prices of meat, and the reason for the increases.

                        <para>- I have not seen in the press the statement to which the honorable member refers. I would point out to him, however, that the importation of coal is not now a feasible project. As far as I know, we could not import coal, even if we desired to do so. in sufficient quantities to have the slightest effect upon the industrial position of Australia in the near future. It is not to be deduced from my remarks that I for one moment, agree with the position said to have been taken up by the coal miners, but we cannot obtain the shipping to bring coal in sufficient quantities to this country. </para>

                            - I desire to make a statement in regard to shipping and the cost of living. Yesterday I was asked a question as to the attitude of the Government in relation to the refusal of the waterside workers to load wheat and flour for foreign countries. I said then that the Government would take an early opportunity of declaring its policy in regard to this matter. It is understood that the situation arose out of a belief which is held, not only by the wharf labourers, but by other unionists, that prices are unduly high, and that the refusal to load wheat and flour for export would have the effect of reducing them.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Government, of course, is charged with, the conduct of the industrial and general affairs of this country, and its business is to see that the products for export get away in order that the industrial as well as the general welfare of the Commonwealth may be conserved. This morning I had an interview with the committee of management of the Waterside Workers Federation, at which I pointed out the position which would be created by the refusal to load vessels with wheat and flour. I am glad to be able to announce that the committee gave me an assurance that, so far from desiring to hamper the Government in its war policy, the waterside workers would, without hesitation or delay, proceed to work any vessels that were engaged&#39; in war work or in what might be termed war work. In pursuance of that assurance, instructions were issued, and the men are now standing by ready to load, or, perhaps by this time are actually loading, the two vessels to carry British and French wheat. </para>
                    <para>There is another steamer about which something was said yesterday, but so far as its immediate relation to the war is concerned, it falls within a different class. I put the matter clearly, and I wish to repeat what I said this morning to my friends the waterside workers. I told them that the business of the country must be carried on, and that it was not for them to say what ships they . would or would not load, otherwise they would usurp the functions of the Government of the country, and our position would be farcical. </para>
                    <para>I desire now to static the position of the Government with regard to the alleged exploitation of the public through the excessive cost of living. The Government has considered the matter, and has decided to remit it forthwith to the InterState Commissioa, with a request that inquiries be made immediately in regard to the prices of the main staple commodities of daily life, the prices in relation to the cost of production, and the effect, if any, of the exportation of foodstuffs or any other products upon the local prices. </para>
                    <para>The Commission will enter upon its labours immediately. Later it can extend its inquiry, but I apprehend that this community is more concerned about the prices of the staple commodities of daily life than with any other. The Commission will proceed at once to deal with the question,, and as it . makes, its report on each. commodity the. Government will take such action from time to time, as the circumstances demand. . . </para>

                            <para>- (By <inline font-style="italic">leave).-</inline> The Prime Minister says that he received this morning from- the representatives of . the waterside workers an assurance that they were prepared to go on with what- is known- as war work. I wish to point out that the waterside workers have not at any time objected to load . vessels engaged . in that class of work. The resolution which, it is stated, they passed, and to which exception has been taken by certain persons, concerned the loading of the <inline font-style="italic">Houtmann</inline> and certain other vessels going to the East. The Melbourne wharf labourers have an understanding to the effect&#39; that they would not load vessels with foodstuffs that were not required in connexion with war work, but, they say, no resolution was carried. In order to substantiate my statement as to the position they take up regarding war work, that is, the loading of foodstuffs or other goods for defence requirements, I need only refer to what was done last week in connexion with a shipment of 50 tons of onions to New ZeaIand. As soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manson,</inline> the New Zealand Government agent here, reported that he had received a cablegram from the New Zealand Government that 25 tons of these onions were required for defence purposes, the wharf labourers withdrew their objection to&#39; the loading of that portion of the consignment. What they objected to&#39; was the exploitation of the market by the action of certain men in exporting a sufficient quantity to enable local prices to be increased. As a matter of fact, the price of onions had been more than doubled within a month. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what is the cost of production per acre or per ton, but I have always said that no, exception can be taken to any legitimate increase in prices due to an increase &#39;in the wages of those producing the commodities or foodstuffs involved: I made &#39;that statement in the Melbourne Town Hall last week when&#39; speaking -on the&#39; cost of living, but the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> did not publish it. I said then that I would do- my best to see that, producers secured any legitimate increase to which they were entitled by reason of an increase in the cost of production. What I object, to is the practice, when there is Id. increase in wages, of adding ls. to the price of tine commodity produced, <inline font-style="italic">r</inline></para>

                    <para>I should now like to deal with the matter of remitting such questions as the cost of living to the Inter-State Commission. In the last Parliament; about the beginning of March, the honorable member for Maribyrnong and others drew attention to the proposed prohibition of the importation of luxuries, and I myself threw across the table to the Prime Minister a note upon the subject. That question of the importation of luxuries waa remitted tlo the Inter state Commission, ,but, although five months have elapsed, not a single report has been presented to Parliament. Shall we have to wait as long for a report on the prices of commodities? I do not say one word about the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Comi mission, the members of which have done good work, and one, I know, is busily engaged at the Treasury. </para>

I have not yet been able to go through the list of proposed works. Some of the proposals on the Estimates are a continuation of &#39; old works ; indeed, there are very few new works, and in regard to the latter it would be necessary, even in order to anticipate parliamentary authority, to obtain Treasury consent. Speaking broadly, if I can facilitate the early embarkation, on; those works,&#39; I shall do&#39; so with pleasure. </para>

I am just about to take over control of the Murray Waters Commission, and I have not yet had a chance to consult with the existing members. I do not think the site of the Upper Murray storage dam has been definitely determined, but some 30 or 40 borings have taken place, which have more or less proved the capacity of certain ground to hold the stream when dammed. I shall take an early  opportunity to ascertain the exact facts up to. date, and confer with the honorable member later. </para>

                            <para>.- The matter with which I wish to deal was referred to by me and other honorable members during the debate on the Supply Bill on the 11th, July last. Since that date I have secured such further information as justifies me in making&#39; a special feature of this question because of the contradictory statements that are in circulation. When I made my remarks on the 11th July I asked the .  Deputy  Leader of the Government and the Treasurer if any offer for the purchase of the Northern Territory had been made as reported to any member of the Government or to the Government! as a whole, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J</inline> ohn Forrest replied, &#34; I have never heard of it;&#34; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook said, &#34; None whatever; absolutely none.&#34; I am quite willing to believe that those honorable gentlemen were stating what) they believed to be true, and what, so far as they were concerned, was true. But that there was something .in the statement is borne out by the following paragraph which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 6th July -  the  Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn),</inline> to whom it was alleged the offer of purchase had been made, &#39;admitted yesterday that the Administrator had made some&#39;&#39;&#39; reference, to a purchase of the Territory, but he did not regard the matter seriously. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> said that when last he was in office as </para>

                        <para class="block">Minister for External Affairs, three years ago, when going into the position of the Territory with the Administrator, he remembered <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> casually mentioning that he thought a chartered company would take the Territory up, pay off the debt, and develop the country. He <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> replied in effect that such a proposal did not commend itself to him. No such offer as mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford</inline> was&#39; ever made to the Government, nor did he regard <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth&#39;s</inline> observation as more than a casual remark, strengthening his belief in the possibilities of the country.

                            <para>On the afternoon of the 12th February, 1917, I was visiting the  Hon.  F. &#34;W. Bamford, M.P., in the Ministers room at the Department of Home and Territories, Melbourne. As I was leaving the room I met a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rigby,</inline> who told me he wanted to introduce me &#34; to somebody.&#34; I, with him, entered a room near the Minister&#39;s room, and . was introduced to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> Administrator of the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> complainedthat I had been attacking his &#39;administration, and I told him that I had not yet finished the attack, . and that the administration seemed to dislike Australians. </para>
                            <para>In the conversation ensuing, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> said that the Territory was difficult to administer, and that, on behalf of a syndicate, he had offered the Commonwealth &#163;5,000,000 for the purchase of the Territory, and to spend &#163;10,000,000 within two years of the purchase. I asked him how he proposed to govern the Territory in such event, and he . said it would be administered by a company on the lines of the British Chartered Company of South Africa. 1 said that that was no good to White Australia, and that I would do my best against any sale of a Territory four times the size of France at any price. &#39; He then hurriedly told me that the information, unsought by me, was not for publication, and a few minutes later I left for the Sydney express. </para>

For those reasons the confidence forced upon me I now break with much pleasure, so that Australians can demand full particulars of &#34;the offer, and pronounce against its repetition. </para>

It was true that he had mentioned the matter lightly to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford</inline> in the course of a conversation. He had also asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford</inline> to publish nothing, on the subject. There was no warrant for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford&#39;s</inline> statement beyond the fact that he <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Gilruth)</inline> had informed him that he had asked the Minister, in the course of a general conversation, whether he thought the Government would sell the Territory. The statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> is, in spirit and essence, untrue. . . . He did not mention the matter &#34; lightly,&#34; he &#34; said it forcibly, seriously, and as if disgusted, at the refusal of the offer, and rather pitying the intelligence of the refusers. He used the words &#34; offer&#34; and &#34; syndicate,&#34; and that his intention was serious and not &#34; light &#34; is proved by the details he had already thought out and had given me. . . . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> admits the offer was made, but says he didn&#39;t take it &#34; seriously.&#34; I don&#39;t care whether he took it badly or standing up, or with his hands full of ripe bananas.

This statement is borne- out by the fact that when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> was returning to the Northern Territory, the residents gave an exhibition of their feelings in regard to his re-appointment.

The- Mayor presided, and &#34;&#39; numerous speakers .-referred specifically to various acts of alleged maladministration, particularly in the Mines Department, the jensen inquiry, and the Batchelor and&#39; Daly River farm experiments, the limited Knowledge of the Administrator, his excision of. experts, &#39;the suppression of &#39;facts, and misleading statements Handed to the Southern press, and the continuous misrepresentation of the various industries. ... The meeting vigorously protested against the mock reception to be tendered the Administrator,, as engineered  by an official clique of puppets. . . . Some severe criticisms of inquiries as to the method of eliminating some of the troublesome officials&#39;, not subservient to the Administrator, were passed, notably, the, cases of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Beckett.</inline></para>

                                <para>- The division between the two sections is much more closely marked in the Northern Territory than it is in this House, because, while we have respect for each other&#39;s opinions, and admit the right of each man to hold his own views on political matters, it seems that only one view can be held or admitted in the Northern Territory, and that is the view of those who are willing to bow the knee to -Baal in the person of the Administrator. For others there is neither use  nor room.,  At any rate, we have the statement of these newspapers of Melbourne and Brisbane showing what the feeling of the majority of the citizens of Darwin is, at any rate of those who are looked upon as the working section of the community. </para>

Whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen</inline> means by the statement that the best parts of the land&#39; have been given to a certain monopoly, there is, at any rate, a suspicion in the minds of many people that when <inline font-weight="bold">.Dr. Gilruth</inline> made that offer of &#163;5,000,000 for the Northern Territory under the conditions specified, the company behind him was the same company that has established meat works at Darwin, and which has secured a very large control over the lands of the Northern . Territory for grazing purposes. It is only reasonable that this company should have behind it reasonable facilities for growing cattle, and keeping its meat works fully employed, and I do not object, so long as the conditions under which it secured control of that land do not preclude other settlers who are anxious to do the same class of work from having an equal opportunity with it; but if there is any connexion between <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> and Vestey Bros., then at once we have an Illuminating comment in regard to the offer that is said to have been made. </para>

I have my own ideas regarding the development of the Northern Territory, which I may state during the Budget debate. It seems to me that not only does <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> find ways and means for tine development of the Territory along the lines not likely to lead to success, but that he has a penchant for irritating those who are desirous of developing it. Whether he is seeking to help Messrs. Vestey Brothers, as perhaps, the only means of developing the Territory, may be open to argument, but that has been the effect of his administration. Not even the building of railway lines or other developmental work seems to him to offer like opportunities for development. I think that the mining industry should be encouraged equally with the pastoral industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth&#39;s</inline> conduct generally is well set&#39; out in a letter which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Standard</inline> on the 19th July.

                            <para>The administration of the Northern Territory during the term the Federal Government has controlled it has been on the lines of the German Crown Colony. There&#39; has been in the Territory an absolute autocracy, no. popular representation of any kind whatever, no means for the people to voice their grievances (as there is in a subdued way in the Legislative Councils of British Crown colonies) ; there has been a system of espionage, accompanied by victimization .of every official or private individual, worker, or business man who ventured to express his disapproval of the brutal  Hunnish  ways of the administration. &#34; Black listing &#34; of workers who were not potential scabs was openly practised by the Administration, and instructions sent to the Departments not to employ those who were black-listed. Men who scabbed on the unions were shown favours and given preference. In every way Hunnish methods were followed. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister told me some time ago that he was preparing a memorandum, and I hope that this discussion may induce him to give attention to matters which might otherwise be overlooked. As only a minute or two of the time allowed to me under the Standing Orders remains, I must pass over a good many matters that I had intended to mention regarding the detrimental effects of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth&#39;s</inline> administration. I submit that the remedy for the present position can be stated under four headings. The first thing to be done is to immediately recall <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> Every one was disappointed that the Government, when it had an opportunity to get away from the experience of the pas* few years, did not appoint to the Administratorship some one with better qualifications for the position. Very few in the Territory wanted <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> back, and people generally down here did not expect that he would be re-appointed. As I said on the 11th July, the only comfort we have is that the re-appointment ia for a short term, and I suggest <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth&#39;s</inline> immediate recall. I suggest, too, the combination of the administrative and judicial offices. I do not know why the Administrator should not also be the judicial officer. The population is so small that, with proper administration, there would not be- too much work for one man if the two offices were combined. Then all the Northern Territory Departments &#39; should be reorganized. I am informed that these Departments are notoriously over-staffed, and exist more for the sake of the officers than for their use to the State. Lastly, I suggest the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into- tine administration of the Territory, and to advise Parliament as. to the possibility of reform. One of our most important - and most humane - obligations in the Northern Territory relates bo the aboriginals. It is one of the worst features of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth&#39;s</inline> administration that the treatment of the aboriginals of the Territory has been rather a duplication of some of the .worst previous experiences of Australian history, and not on the lines that modern humanity would desire, or that this House would wish to be followed. </para>

                            <para>.- In adding a word or two to what the honorable member for Brisbane has said, I shall begin by referring to the matter with which he was dealing when the Standing Orders compelled him to finish his speech, that is, the treatment of the aboriginals in &#39;the Northern Territory. One of the saddest things in Australian history is the fact that the aboriginals of this country have been degraded and debauched by their association with civilization. </para>

He had &#187;had a long and intimate acquaintance with them .as the result of his travels and observations from the north to the south of Australia. This is a delicate matter, and if there are any within hearing whose, duty does not. compel them to -remain while I mention what I conceive to be certain facts in connexion with the aboriginals and their relations - with the white men of the Territory, they should take this opportunity to retire. I wish to put it on record that it is one of the very gravest things in connexion with, our responsibility to a subject race that it is stated by the Chief Inspector himself that there have been men in the employment of the Commonwealth termed protectors of aborigines who have openly carried <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> on immoral intercourse with them. </para>

                                <para>- It is a charge which may be made outside as well as inside&#39; Parliament, because the facts have been admitted by the departmental head, and are capable of conclusive proof by the Chief Inspector. It is a known fact&#39; that there are children being reared and looked, after by the Northern Territory Missions, and others, who owe their shameful origin to officials paid by the Commonwealth. If honorable members wish to challenge serious statements, I will make them, and proof of them can be easily obtained. There is an- acknowledged traffic of this disgraceful and disgusting character going on between a regrettably large number of white people and the blacks in the Northern Territory. It is within the knowledge of every self-respecting resident of the Territory that male blacks in and about Darwin are selling their females to white men. I would be quite prepared to support a Bill providing for the penalty of imprisonment, or such a substantial fine, for immoral intercourse of that kind, as would remove so disgraceful a stain from this country. Proof of all these statements is forthcoming if an opportunity be offered for producing it in greater detail. It can be easily understood that, in the. short time at my disposal; it is impossible to deal adequately with it. </para>

                        <para>Let me turn how to another subject. One of the Ordinances&#34; of the Northern Territory provides that no Chinese may employ aboriginals. Notwithstanding that fact, I have very strong evidence - into which I wish the Minister to make inquiries - that the Government Secretary put his signature, or, at all events, officially consented in some way, to the employment of aboriginals by Chinese. I have the very strongest evidence that, as the result of that consent, given in contravention of an Ordinance of this Parliament, four Australian blacks were employed by a Chinese on a lugger, or like vessel, and that while so employed they were drowned. </para>

                                <para>- I have no* time to refer to the correspondence, but it is quite recent history. I come now to another matter. We have in the Northern Territory a Supreme Court Judge - Judge Bevan - a gentleman whom I know well, and have always respected. It is on record that Judge Bevan quite openly - and apparently, he believes, and would have us believe, with propriety - entered into a contract with one <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hope</inline> for the purchase of a copper mine in the Northern Territory from the Government. Such an action on the part of the&#39; Judge of the Northern Territory ought to be deprecated; I certainly deprecate the highest judicial officer in the Territory entering into big commercial contracts with the Government that he is serving in a judicial capacity. In this contract there was a condition, so I am  informed, that only white labour - and no Chinese - should be (employed. As a matter of fact, however, . Chinese labour was employed on the mine. A little later, when the matter became public, it was urged in defence of the action of the owners of the mine in employing Chinese labour, that there had been a variation of the solemn agreement entered into when the mine was sold to these gentlemen. The file was then turned up, and a short document, signed by Judge Bevan and another, was discovered. It was in the form of a letter, and that letter is also on record. I have a photo of it, and, speaking from memory, its terms were somewhat as follows: - </para>

In dismissing the matter for the present, I submit that it was most improper to purport to vary such an agreement.

I am viewing the matter, however, <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> from that stand-point, but from the point of view as to whether or not a considered agreement should be dealt with in that way by any person, and  particularly by a gentleman of the eminence and the reputation - which I am glad to acknowledge - of the Judge of the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>On the general question of the reappointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr, Gilruth,</inline> I think that  a  very reasonable protest was addressed to this House some little time back by the honorable member for Wakefield when he urged that that re-appointment might well have awaited consideration by Parliament, especially in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> at the time it was made, had been in Melbourne on full pay for some eight or nine months. I think it was almost an affront to this House to make a re-appointment in those circumstances and at that time, in view of the general knowledge that it would receive far from the unanimous approval df this House, and would be the subject of very grave criticism from both sides. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> however, was re-appointed, and in war time,&#39; at a salary of &#163;1^700  a  year. I deliberately assert - and I am not attempting to make any party capital out of this - that it was an affront to the people of this country to re-appoint that officer, however excellent he may be, at such a salary, and to add to it an entertainment allowance of &#163;500 per annum. </para>

I can only say that no such offer was ever made to me or to any other member of the Government. </para>

I also raised some questions about the position of the farms, and as to whether agriculture could profitably be carried on up there. As he rose from his chair at the end of the interview on that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> remarked, &#34;Well, would you hand over the Territory to a chartered company? &#34; He, at all events, used words to that effect, but I shut down the matter at once, and there was no further reference to it. I do not think our conversation on the matter extended over more than half a minute, and certainly the remarks as to handing over the Territory did not extend over more than a few seconds. </para>

When I heard of this newspaper criticism, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> what it all meant.

                                    from his occasional proximity to politicians, perhaps, was rather sensitive to criticism, and he told
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford</inline>
                                    that he thought he had reason to complain of his continual attacks on the Territory. He disapproved of this destructive criticism, and thought that there should be, on
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford&#39;s</inline>
                                    part, a better recognition of the difficulties in the way of the development of the Territory. That conversation led up to some statement by
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline>
                                    to
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford,</inline>
                                    to the effect that he  had  some two years previously told .the then Minister for External Affairs that the Territory could be managed by a chartered company.&#34; I believe he mentioned to him that some such company as that which managed a part of the British Empire in South Africa - the Rhodesian Company - could be formed, but he assured me that he had no particular company in his mind at the time. He made no offer to me, and I placed not the slightest significance on his passing remark about the possibility. What, probably, was unconsciously in his mind was the financial position when we took over the Territory. When the Territory was taken over on the 1st January. 1911, by the Commonwealth, I had myself to go into the facts a good deal, and I- also took occasion, when settling the terms of the measure, to examine the finances. I found that an offer had been made to
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline>
                                    Holder, who was then Premier of South Australia; by a company, or a number of capitalists prepared to form &#39; a company, to take over the Territory for about &#163;10,250,000, on the condition - this is the point - &#39;that they &#39; were allowed to introduce coloured labour. At the, time of the transfer the indebtedness of the Territory was about &#163;6,000,000, including the Port Augusta railway and all other works. Further, we entered into an obligation, not yet carried out,, with South Australia to continue&#39; the transcontinental line up from Oodnadatta and down from Pine Creek. To do this would have cost an additional sum, bringing up the total to about &#163;10,250,000. The figures that have been referred to to-day principally have to do with the payment of interest and redemption from year to year. South Australia&#39;s plan was not to redeem loans as they fell due, but to add them to the debt and consolidate them. In our case we acted from a much better point of view, and when we have money it is just as well to spend it in one way than, perhaps, squander it in another. In other words, we paid off our debts as they fell due, and in one year no less than &#163;500,000 was liquidated. When honorable members talk about the figures being increased, their statements may be qualified by the fact that when I was in office about 1914, the deficit in the annual accounts on ordinary expenditure and works - which is the test, and not the redemption fund and interest - was &#163;202,000, and the expenditure &#163;274,000. I reduced the expenditure to about &#163;208,000 at one stroke, and the deficit  to &#163;135,000 during my term of office; and I can show that there has not been an increase of &#163;60,000 since the Territory was taken over. It is the redemption that causes the trouble; and, as the honorable member for Franklin has asked for a statement on the point. I shall to-morrow, if ready, read one that has been prepared.

                        <para>No offer was made to me, nor would I at any time entertain one, to barter away to any company our obligations. Only about three weeks ago a capitalist came to me in Adelaide, who was prepared to construct the transcontinental line. He asked me, &#34; Is there any chance of any offer to construct that Une being considered ?&#34; and I replied, *&#39; There is none, if you mean on such terms as were embodied in the South&#39; Australian Act.&#34;  These are the facts in regard to the offer. The honorable member has referred to a number of grievances ; and in this connexion I wish I could remember the words of a missionary writer in a very neat periodical called <inline font-style="italic">The Inlander,</inline> issued, I believe, by- the Methodists, or one of the religious, bodies, which are doing such good work amongst the blacks in Central Australia. That missionary said he regretted to have to express an opinion at all, because he was sure that there would be immediately three or four other opinions expressed to controvert his; and that is the case with the Northern Territory. The honorable member for Brisbane referred to two cases, and, apparently, the honorable member&#39; for Batman has recently been given a political brief in the&#39; matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beckett.</inline> It is rather significant that I should have met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beckett,</inline> and I then asked him to reduce to writing the complaints - some of the very complaints we have heard here to-day. I felt that in justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beckett,</inline> and those whom he impugned, the charges ought to be made in black and white, and I was expecting such a document, with a view to making inquiry. I do not wish to go into <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beckett&#39;s</inline> case, or to say one word against that officer. I spent many nights going through the files of papers - which, by the way, have gone to Darwin - and with the scrutiny of a lawyer and a Minister, who ought to keep his mind unbiased, I made a complete analysis of the evidence and the judgment of the Judge, almost acting as a defender in case of any possible injustice. I made a minute on the matter, which was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> at the time, that the vacancy created in his&#39; office was not at all affected by that case. Nor do I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beckett,</inline> or any one else, has come badly out of it. </para>

I do not think that&#39; it is quite fair, nor in accord with the finest sense of members of the House, that, when allegations are made on &#39; one side, and the Minister is waiting for definite evidence, the matter should be raised in the House. All&#39; we have as yet is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beckett&#39;s</inline> version; and, as I told him, I hoped he would not expect me to assume a thing proved against another officer, considering that I would not accept anything against him until I had heard what he had to say. </para>

                        <para>I read both sides of the correspondence. I do not believe there is very much in the statement of the aboriginal position at the present time. Unfortunately, contact with whites has to some extent a degrading effect on aboriginals, and they present a very difficult problem. I have considered the matter with Professor Spencer and others; but, do what we may, the trouble seems almost insuperable. I read the charges about the aboriginals and made inquiries; but I do not think that the House is the place in which to discuss them. Only a few cases are mentioned; and nearly always, when a man leaves office, some disputes of the kind arise. </para>

                                <para>-  I was not in office, and I. do not know. I myself gave <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen&#39;</inline> a certificate of competency as a man who had done good work in the mining branch in the Territory. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen</inline> did not leave his appointment when I was in office, but I thought that, in justice to him, he was entitled&#39; to the certificate. In these matters you can never get absolute accuracy, for opinions will differ. The charges made were inquired into by a Sydney magistrate, who found every one of them disproved. What is a Minister to do ? Is he to listen night, after night to reiterated charges? If so, how can he be expected to carry on the administration? I really do not know whether it is worth while referring to any other point. The Aboriginal Department has been presided over for a time by Professor Spencer. </para>

                                <para>- Nearly all the information is supplied from outside, and five-sixths of it is destructive criticism. I very much regret that a little more optimism is i not displayed in reference to this <inline font-style="italic">damnosa</inline><inline font-style="italic">her edi tas</inline> of ours. When a lease is put up for sale in the Territory in country adjoining Queensland, at a lower &#39;rental for equally good land, some fatality prevents it being taken up; and that, I suppose, is the fault of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth.</inline> He may be 800 miles away, but stall his second person is there all the time. An objection has been raised that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> is paying too much attention to pastoral matters; but, really, the last complaint was that he was not attending to them at all. We are told, to speak colloquially, that this is a pastoral proposition altogether. I do not think it ie an agricultural proposition. </para>

                            <para>.- I am surprised  that  the Minister did not tell us that the people up in the Territory are&#39; much like helots, without votes or citizen rights. There is no0 Judge so dominant or &#39;powerful as the Judge at present up there; and if &#34;the recall were in operation, as in some of the States in America, he would be dragged from the Bench if they considered him unworthy. </para>

                                <para>- I know that in the treatment of those terrible diseases known as the &#34; red plague &#34; proper&#39; assistance was not given. I make that statement on the authority of his lordship the Bishop of Carpentaria - <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. White.</inline> When I was on Thursday Island, I found there was the greatest difficulty in getting drugs. Although in Victoria men, women, and doctors are being penalized in fines of from &#163;10 to &#163;100 if they do not give proper attention to the treatment of these diseases, yet in the Territory, where the missionaries were willing to give their services free to cure suffering humanity, obstacles were thrown in their way. I can hardly say that I should like a Royal Commission  appointed to investigate Northern Territory affairs, for any  one conversant with the history- of the Territory knows - that the reports of Commissions are filed yards high. But, in God&#39;s name, what is the use of paying a man &#163;44 per week to administer the Northern Territory and keeping him in Melbourne for nine months! Some honorable member, interjected that the only industry in the Territory was pastoral. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> assured me that rice is being cultivated there, and for the first time in the history of the world is being reaped by machinery. </para>

                                <para>- It &#39;is paddy rice. In countries where I have seen rice growing, the land is terraced, and the use of machinery is impossible. But in the Territory, owing to the climate &#39;and the quick drying of the soil, the ground is hard enough ,for machinery to be used. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> was certain that if future experiments in rice growing proved successful, they would be able to reap it by machinery and employ white labour at- white man&#39;s wages. But why does not this man, who draws a salary of&#34; &#163;1,750 and an allowance of &#163;500, set an example to other residents of the Territory by employing white people in his own house ? It may be said that if white girls are sent to the Territory they marry. Do we not want them to marry, and rear children to populate the Territory? I urge the Minister to see that any girls who are sent to the Territory travel first class, and not in the steerage. I have been an officer on the boats trading to the Orient, and I would not put&#39; a Newfoundland dog in the steerage. It is a scandal that a man with an income of &#163;44 per week will not employ white labour in his house. </para>

                                <para>- Give them a chance. It is infamous that when an Australian citizen goes to the Northern Territory he &#39; has no citizen rights as a voter. When  the Territory was controlled by South Australia, residents of the Territory had the right to vote, but their franchise has been taken from them. Another urgent reform is the institution of trial by jury, and neither this Government nor any succeeding Government will be acting justly unless they give to all men and women in the Territory the right of trial by a panel of their fellow citizens.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn.</inline> - Trial by jury exists there. </para>

                                <para>- In answer to an. honorable member who made a sneering reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bedford,</inline> I say that, al- . though that gentleman has his faults, as we all have, there is no better&#39; Australian than he. He stands- for Australia first and always, and after Australia for the Homeland. I will back his opinion on the Northern Territory against that of any member of the House. If the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> will only give its attention to the Northern Territory, the present Government may be compelled to do something for its development. Until the citizens have trial by jury, and the same right to vote as other Australians have, I shall, continue to protest. When it suited the present Government, the people in the Territory, and also in Papua and the Federal Territory, were allowed to vote. I speak as one who advocated the cause against which the people of the Territory voted in connexion with the last referendum, and I say that they should be al- &#39; lowed the franchise on all occasions. Of the personal honesty of the Minister for Home and Territories no man has a greater Opinion than I have, and even with his legal training I would trust him in every way as head of his Department. But I ask him to put aside his legal training in dealing with the demand of these people for justice. </para>

                        <para>When I am speaking on the Budget I shall show how the Territory can be kept as a meat reserve to supply the whole of the, Australian people. It is the last great Territory that the Commonwealth has in its possession untrammelled by State rights. We. can manage that Territory in our own way, and it is the duty&#34; of the Government to the future millions of people to reserve that vast tract of country, so that it may become the meat emporium of the Commonwealth, insuring the Australian people meat at 1 a fair price .for all time. Buffalo meat, thousands of carcasses of which have been destroyed, is appreciated by many people after their palates have become accustomed to it, and is sometimes preferred to the meat of the domestic ox, but in the past the buffalo has been killed only for its hide. Why should not that meat be preserved and sent south to help to feed the people in times of scarcity? Next to water conservation, the Minister has to handle, in the development of the Northern Territory, the greatest Australian problem with which we are con-  fronted. </para>

                            <para>.- I ;do not intend to discuss the treatment of the aborigines of the Northern Territory from the stand-point of the honorable member for Batman, but I do believe that the time is long overdue when this Parliament should take some action to found a broad policy for dealing with the natives. I have had an opportunity of visiting the Territory, and I am convinced that the treatment of the aborigines has been too long neglected. It has never been taken in hand in a way calculated to do justice to them. I believe that if the Minister were to call for special reports from his medical  offi.cers  and the administrative staff in the Territory it would be possible to found without great expense a policy that would deal out greater justice to the thousands of aborigines, large numbers of whom are coming into contact with the white population to their serious detriment. </para>

                        <para>The charges made by the honorable member for Brisbane against the Administrator are chiefly founded on statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen,</inline> who was at one time an official in the Territory, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Randolph</inline> Bedford. My observation, when I was in the Territory, was that a big contest is in progress between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson,</inline> the head of the labour organizations at Darwin, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> and, as the leader of the labour organizations has a majority of people behind him, necessarily he can make things very hot for the Administrator. I &#39;do not wish to defend all <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth&#39;s</inline> acts of administration. Like every human &#39; being, lie has made mistakes, but the failure of the Northern Territory so far has been very largely due to this Parliament. An Administrator was &#39; sent to the Territory to face difficulties that no human individual could overcome, and he has been left without any proper direction from the National Parliament in regard to a continuous policy. Since the Territory has been taken over by the Commonwealth, there has been only one Minister who has made anything like a real attempt to outline a policy for it, and that is the Minister who is now controlling it. He has introduced some good development work. He has put down bores in the interior, thus providing water supplies which help the pastoral industry; and his agreement with Vestey Brothers is the only really substantial development work that has been carried out with a view to increasing the popula  tion, as well as the productivity of that northern country. In fact, these are the only two pieces of work that can be claimed by this Parliament as having anything of a permanent nature about them, or as dealing in a comprehensive way with the development of the Northern Territory. . </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member could ask for nothing more conclusive than the fact that the forty-five charges brought by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen</inline> against the Administrator of the Northern Territory were tried before a police magistrate sent from Sydney for the purpose, and every one of them failed. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen</inline> was certainly put &#34; out of court &#34; as an indicter  of the Administrator. </para>

                        <para>But the honorable member for Brisbane was on sound ground when he&#39; indicated the existence of divided, control. In this great Northern Territory, several thousands of miles away from the Commonwealth Seat of Government, there are all sorts of different authorities in conflict. The Post Office is ruled from one branch, the railways are under another control, the Land Titles Office is under another control, and, on top- of all, the Administrator is supposed to exercise a &#39;general supervision over the Territory. All this division of control necessarily means conflict and warfare, and it has been brought about by the failure of the Commonwealth Government to place some individual or body of men in control of the Territory. I do not care whether the control is exercised by an Administrator, or whether some body which is partly elected and partly nominee exercises control, or whether some Commission is appointed. Whatever authority be constituted, it should- have vested in it general supervision over the whole of the Public Service in the Territory. </para>

                                <para>- Something of the sort should be done. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth&#39;</inline> has not made mistakes. No individual could go into that Territory under the industrial conditions obtaining there during the last four or five years and please all the people with whom he had to come into contact. In fact, as was remarked from these benches a little while ago, a strong man must necessarily come into conflict with the industrial organizations in the Northern Territory. Here is an example of what the industrial conditions obtaining there have meant. The estimated cost of building the meat works was &#163;250,000, and when allowance was made for certain increases of material because of the outbreak of the war, the estimate was increased to &#163;300,000, but it is well to know that be- . fore the works are completed the cost will considerably exceed &#163;500,000. </para>

                                <para>- I do not say that labour troubles have been responsible for the whole of the increased cost of these works, but I know that one&#39; season has already been lost owing to them, and that they have increased the expenditure to an enormous extent. I do not say that every workman in the Territory is prepared to go out on strike, or is not prepared to do his duty; but I know that the industrial organizations there have had the same kind of leadership as has been in evidence in the southern parts of  the  Commonwealth, with results well known to the community in the shape of industrial loss to Australia as a whole, as well as loss of wages and comforts to&#39; the workers themselves. I know that it is impossible for the Minister to lay before this House anything like a broad, comprehensive policy, owing to the heavy expenditure incurred by the war, but I hope that it will be possible for him to give special attention to the matter of dealing with the aborigines. I hope that he will obtain reports from his officers, and see whether some improvement in that , branch of the administration cannot be . carried out without any further delay. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to make one or two observations with regard to criticisms that have been levelled against the Bill. By section 26a of the Act, which was assented to on the 13th September, 1915, it was provided that preference should be given in appointments to members of the Expeditionary Forces. The paragraph reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">During the debate objection has been taken to the Bill on the ground that it deals  only with  the Clerical <inline font-style="italic">Division</inline> of the Public Service. The Bill refers particularly to that division because it is necessary to provide for preference in regard to it. But the measure must be read in conjunction with .the existing legislation. There is at present no limit to the age at which persons may enter the Professional Division of the Public Service, and any person may enter the General Division whose age on his last birthday was not less than sixteen nor more than fifty. Therefore it is not necessary to mention the Professional and General Divisions in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and we have therefore extended the age limit applicable to the Clerical Division to pro? vide for preference to returned soldiers. It has been questioned whether Army nurses will be able to take advantage of the proposed preference., Consideration was given to that matter before it was mentioned in the debate, and an instruction was issued for the preparation of an amendment which would make it clear that nurses may take &#39; advantage of the proposed preference. Then, again, the BiU &#39; refers only to the Expeditionary Force raised under the Defence Act, and &#34;we therefore propose to move an amendment which will make it clear that the men serving in the Navy, who are entitled to as much, consideration as those serving on land, shall be treated in the same way. </para>

I shall have circulated the amendments to which I have referred, so that honorable members may see how far they carry out the expressed intention of the Government. I have no desire to discuss the general question of temporary employment which has been raised during the debate. I think it will be acknowledged that the amendments will give effect to the intentions of the Government, and the desire of the House to provide effective preference for returned soldiers and sailors. </para>

Our soldiers have been prepared to sacrifice everything for the country, and we should do what we can to show our gratitude for this sacrifice. Unfortunately ;&#62; it is beyond human possibility to fully repay them. At the same time, we must guard against any action which may be to the detriment of the public interest. I was called out of the chamber during the Minister&#39;s explanation, and therefore I ask him whether the Bill limits the preference that is to be given to the Clerical Division of the Service! </para>

                            <para>- My desire is that there shall be preference in regard to all the divisions of the* Service. As to clause 3, it seems to me that without an amendment, it may do some harm to the public interest. I am sure that no returned, soldier wishes to be taken on as a casual employee, and retained permanently, but as the clause stands, soldiers temporarily  employed may become . virtually permanent employees. At the present time,  temporary employees are appointed for six months, when they are supposed to make room &#39;for others, and at the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s office there are long lists of the names of those waiting for such employment. But. returned soldiers appointed as temporary employees will not be affected by any limitation of time, and this may work public injury. It may happen that some thousands of temporary employees will be replaced with returned  soldiers,  who, instead of being kept on merely for six months, may be retained much longer, to the detriment of the public interest. </para>

                            <para>- I was not alluding to that matter. No doubt there will be s hard cases, but as it is the policy of the Government to give preference to returned men, every effort should be made to remove single men before married men when displacements are necessary to find positions for returned men. This has not always been done. I do not blame the Minister or those in high authority for what has occurred ; it is generally the result of the stupidity of some lower placed official who has carried out his instructions in a thick-headed way. I am satisfied that some public servants - some of the men in the Defence Department more particularly - are responsible for much of the trouble and friction, of which we hear so much in this House. I believe that the failure of a public servant to carry out the instructions of his superior officer is among the occurrences that are detrimental to recruiting. </para>

While it is. reasonable to provide that returned soldiers who obtain temporary employment shall not be affected by the existing time limit, we should, at the same time, make it clear that because of that fact they are not to expect permanent employment. </para>

                            <para>- I have not, and that is the danger I see in clause 3. After these men have remained&#39; in the temporary employment of the Commonwealth for two or three years, it will be much harder to remove them than it would be if at the end of eighteen months&#39; service they were called upon to make room for other returned soldiers. Under the Act as it stands, a man can be employed in the temporary service of the Commonwealth for only six months at a time. . Ait the expiration of that period, however, his employment may be renewed for a further term, and we know that in many cases the period of service is extended. The officers responsible for such extensions cannot be blamed, because these temporary employees have become accustomed to the work required of them, and with the entrance of a hew set of employees the work of training has to be commenced once more. I hope that the Minister will endeavour to limit clause 3 in&#39; some reasonable way.- </para>

A few weeks, after the outbreak of war, an examination was held for linemen, or instrument fitters, in the Electrical Branch of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. The Fisher Government, which was then in power, realizing tha&#39;6 men who volunteered after passing that examination would be placed at a disadvantage, decided that no permanent appointments should be made during the war. I understand that with some exceptions that decision has been rigidly adhered to. </para>

                            <para>- Yea. The examination to which I refer was open to men under the age of forty-five years. I know of one man who was well over forty when he passed it. He came out very high in the list. He had been a temporary employee and made a special effort to qualify. He is now &#34;anxious to know whether the fact that he is forty-five years of age will prevent him at! this stage from entering the permanent Service of the Department. </para>

                    <para> I &#34;should like now to put before the Minister, as I did on the motion for the second&#39; reading of the Bill, the position of married men with families who volunteered for active service but were rejected, and who are in the temporary employment of the Commonwealth. I urge that such men should not be turned adrift, before their six months of service has expired, in order to make room for single men. I yield to no one in my desire that justice shall be done to those who have gone to the Front to fight for our country. But I do not think that these married men-r-&#39; and some of them to my knowledge have as many as three, five, and six children - should be burned adrift until at least their six months pf service has expired, even to make room for a returned soldier who is unmarried. I am not asking for any extension of the period of six months in respect of which a temporary servant may be employed. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If there is no work for them to do, then I do not suggest that they, should be kept on. We know that in some Departments temporary hands are sometimes employed for only three days at a time. &#39; For instance, when steamers come down to Sydney or Melbourne from the East, temporary watchmen are employed by the Customs Department, and the Department takes care to select men on whom it can absolutely rely. These watchmen are employed for only two or three days at a time. Then again, in the Postal Department, there are temporary letter-carriers employed in Melbourne and suburbs to fill the places of men who are away at the Front. I introduced a deputation to the Postmaster-General some little time ago in regard to their position. Some of these temporary hands are married men who have been rejected, and my &#39;contention &#39; is that&#39; if there is work for them to do they should be kept on for six months. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Provided there is&#39; work for them to do, they should not be dismissed before their six months&#39; term has expired  merely  because they were not accepted for service with the Australian Imperial Force. I do not know how many of these men there are, but they cannot be very numerous; and, in view of the greater difficulty there is now in obtaining employment, some consideration should .be extended to them. If an unmarried soldier returns, he finds his pension doubled if he marries. </para>

                        <para>. - According to section 12 of the Act passed in 1915, those who were eligible for appointment when that Act came into force continue to be eligible until nine months after the termination of the present war, whether they go to the Front or not. Instructions were given that no permanent appointments should be made while the men were at the Front ; but, in view of the fact that a number of youths and young men, who have gone to expense in preparing themselves for examination and qualification, would have found their labours wasted if the war continued, say, for eighteen months, that section was passed. As to the nature of the examination for the returned soldiers, I am afraid that will have to be left to the discretion of the Commissioner; and we shall propose a clause to empower him1 to have a special examination. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the Minister, beeping in view the fact that a candidate is to be appointed to perform certain duties. The third point raised by the honorable member for Yarra goes to the very root of the Bill, and raises the question - should returned men have preference or not ? The general principle of the Bill gives preference, and the honorable member agrees as to the principle, but suggests a limitation. He says that if a man is married, has a wife or family, and has offered himself for the Army and been rejected, he shall not be dismissed from his temporary position in preference to the returned soldiers until the period of six months has expired. That, I say, is not necessary to provide in the Bill, for it is action which may, or may not, be taken in administration. </para>

The desire of the Prime Minister was to extend the Act to nurses, and in any measures passed we have found it advisable to specifically mention them; a clause has been drafted for this Bill to carry out that intention. As to the medical examination, the honorable member appears to be afraid that such an examination as is at present insisted on would practically exclude wounded and injured men. I remind the honorable &#39; member, however, that a regulation has been drawn up providing that a candidate may. be appointed though not free from physical, defects, provided it is certified by a proper medical officer that he is free from such defects as would incapacitate him from the efficient discharge of the duties of the position for which he is nominated. </para>

If we are not careful, we shall inflict serious hardships on very deserving men who have made a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> attempt to go to the Front, but, owing to physical defects, have been rejected.! Some of those men are responsible for the upkeep of a family, and a man in that position stands on almost identically the same plane as a single man who has been to the Front, and has not the same family responsibilities. I have here a letter written by a returned soldier who was one of the first to land at Gallipoli. He is a reputable citizen, upon whose word I can thoroughly rely, and he writes as follows on behalf of .another man : - </para>

                        <para>A man who for the past two years has_ been employed as a temporary letter-carrier has just enlisted (after trying to do so three times), and has been accepted. It has been said that the idea of economic conscription is all &#34; bunkum.&#34; This man, as I say, has for over two years been temporary letter-carrier, and who, the officers would report, was an exceptionally good man. Though he had volunteered and had been rejected twice, he was informed that his services would be dispensed with, and he finished up last week. The reason was- that he had to make room for a returned soldier. Since then he has volunteered for the third time and been accepted. If that is not a &#34; fight or starve &#34; policy, I don&#39;t know what is. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that he is. But I do not agree with those who argue that, because a man is single, he has no domestic responsibilities. Every honorable member knows that there are some single men who have a greater load of responsibility for the upkeep of&#39; a home than have many married men. Sometimes the eldest son of a family, the father of which has died, has to maintain his mother and four or five younger children. Their feeding, clothing, and housing are dependent on his earnings; and, in passing, I should like to express the hope that the Government, in framing their taxation proposals, will see that some discretion is allowed in dealing with cases of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- That man was turned out of the service to make room for a returned soldier. He is now in Camp ; but, in recent times, men in Camp have been found, on final medical examination, to be unfitted to go to the Front; and it would not surprise me if this man, having been twice reported unfit, is finally rejected. I trust that any man who is contributing to the support of a family, and taking the part of a father as head of the household, especially when he has been rejected for active service, will not be called upon to give place to an unmarried returned soldier. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member. In this fair land ^ of Australia, life is a battle for thousands of people all the time, even when no war is in progress, and we need to be careful that, in passing ameliorative legislation for returned soldiers, we do not do a distinct harm to men who are acting as gallantly., and playing their part as citizens almost as well as men who are fighting at the Front. I hope we shall have the assurance of the Minister that, although this Bill is passed to open wide the door for the entrance of returned men to the Public Service, we shall not do a grave injustice to other deserving men in the community. </para>

                        <para>.- -This clause brings under notice one of the most important sections in the Public Service Act. In my opinion, the increased cost of running the/ various Departments is largely caused by that section. For many years I was employed in the electrical branch of the Telegraph Department, and I had experience of the inequitable working of the section relating to temporary employment. &#34;We would train a man for six months, three of which would be occupied in getting him to understand the technical names of the instruments he was operating. . Just when he was well trained, and fit to be sent to do work alone, he would be dismissed, because the Act did not permit him to remain in the Service longer than nine months. To overcome the Act, we had to discharge men for a few days, and then re-employ them. I cannot understand why we have so many casual employees in the Public Services of Australia. Is not the Commonwealth to grow, and population to increase? The greater our population, the greater number of civil servants there must be. There are in the mechanical branch of the Postal  Department many temporary- employees who should be in &#39;the permanent Service. </para>

                        SMITH. - I do not agree with the honorable member. The officers in charge have an excellent opportunity of learning the capabilities of casual hands, and if those casual hands are able to pass a certain examination, they should be passed into the permanent Service. Hundreds of electricians-and men of other occupations - throughout Australia are merely casual employees, although they have been trained at - great cost to the Department. How can foremen be expected to maintain the efficiency of the Service if they are continually training new men? No private firm would operate such a system. We have engineers in charge of the technical branches of the Service, but we refuse to give them a permanent staff. Every day changes are taking place in electrical science,. and only in the Service can men receive proper training. Within the last few days we have had demonstrated clearly the advantage of having men trained in the Service from their youth upwards to take responsible positions. Men who are said to have great capabilities have made statements which no trained civil servant would dream of making, because he has been trained on certain lines. These men must be trained if they are to be competent. Otherwise no Minister could run his Department. I am wondering where we are to get our future heads of Departments if this policy of the continuous dismissal of men and the appointing of women proceeds. I do not object to women being employed, but we must have regard to the fact that we must have men to assume the responsible positions that are now being filled by heads of Departments. We have heads of Departments who are responsible for the expenditure of millions of pounds every year, and who are doing invaluable service, and we must train others to take -their positions later on.

                            <para>- They do; but private concerns are more careful of their servants, and do not pass them out. Unless a civil servant has very great capabilities, he cannot go out at the age of forty or forty-five years &#39; and take up positions in competition with men who have been trained outside the service. That is why we should see that the service is properly manned by men who know that their positions are permanent provided they serve the country faithfully and well. It Will pay the Commonwealth to employ men permanently instead of temporarily. If any one is entitled to a place in the Public Service it is the man who has gone away to fight our battles, and., to whom we owe our existence to-day. Not only is he fighting for our very existence; he is also d&#169;imonstrating to the Old World, which never knew it before, that the Australian is capable. His wonderful initiative has . been a surprise to the Old World.

In Australia men who are sound readers and splendid penmen can work for hours on the quadruplex instrument, doing their &#39;forty words a minute. It is due entirely to the &#39; training they receive, and that is why I wish to see this class of men retained in the service. It is a! hardship for them to be only temporarily employed. We should not encourage men to enter the Service for six months, and then  compel them to leave and look for some other work. Men should be encouraged to apply themselves to their work in the knowledge that, they will have a permanency of occupation. </para>

                        <para>.- The clause really deals with returned soldiers, but a wider discussion, which is not strictly relevant, but to which I do not raise objection, seeing that it gives an opportunity of ventilating a certain matter, has taken place in regard to the- whole question &#39;of temporary employment. The intention of. the Public Service Act was to have permanent employment in the professional, clerical, and general divisions under certain clearly defined conditions, but it was realized that it was possible that certain classes might be employed who, strictly speaking, might not come under the regular machinery of the Act, and therefore power was given to declare certain men to be &#34; exempt officers.&#34; There are many men working under the Act who are known as exempt officers. It was also realized that on specific occasions men showing certain adaptability and skill might be employed. Power was given to exempt those  men. Then it was realized that a Department might find occasion to employ from time to time a number of casual men on temporary employment only. At the time the Act was passed, this was regarded as a general class of work, for which no particular qualification or skill was required, and as there were many persons in, the community who would be anxious to get this work, Parliament insisted that it should be divided up by stipulating that persons employed in this way should not serve for more than six months. It was also provided that the period could be ex- &#39; tended for three months on a special report from the head of the Department, in which a casual hand was employed, being supplied. It was never intended that that class of temporary employment should be engaged upon any particular kind of work the Commonwealth required for its service. If any mistake has been made it has been that there has been too much tendency to rely on temporary employment in cases where permanent hands should have been employed. The Public Service Commissioner may have erred on the side of trying to prevent the undue swelling of the Commonwealth Public Service, which in bad times might necessitate severe retrenchment. In this clause we are dealing with that class of temporary work which does not require skill. Returned soldiers are already being given preference for temporary employment, and the object of the amendment is to enable him to be retained in such employment for a longer period than six months. </para>

                            <para>- A temporary employee may be dismissed at any moment. Honorable members are desirous of giving preference to returned soldiers, and are of opinion that the limitation of six months for temporary employment should not extend to them; but, it is said, do not summarily dismiss &#39;existing temporary employees such as have been mentioned - one case was that of a man with five or six children, who had volunteered several times and had been rejected, and another case was that of a father well up in years with several sons at the Front- in order to find positions for returned soldiers. I recognise that cases such as have been mentioned are fit subjects for consideration, but this is a matter not for legislation, but for administration. The right to dismiss must remain with the Minister or the permanent head. </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible at the present time to enumerate the cases which may require consideration. It will not follow that the only position to which a returned soldier can be appointed will be that held by a temporary employee, whose six months&#39; period has hot expired and who has claim for consideration. All that we are doing now is to propose that a returned soldier, who may be appointed temporarily, shall not be limited to a term of six months. The honorable members for Flinders and Wilmot have pointed out that we must be careful lest, in removing this limitation, we convert temporary into permanent employment. They contend that some safeguard against that should be provided. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister, as he represents a large and populous constituency, must from time to time receive complaints of inequitable treatment from men with large family responsibilities, whose services have been dispensed with. What we all desire is that the equities of each case shall be considered, and that men with large domestic&#39; responsibilities shall not be removed merely to provide for returned soldiers who, taking everything into consideration, have not so great a claim to the positions as those who are occupying them. Certainly, men with heavy domestic responsibilities should not be removed until their term of temporary employment has expired. One of the reasons why the Public Service is not the success it should be is that temporary employees have to be dismissed after certain periods of service.&#39; Just as a permanent head has got a temporary man properly trained for the work that he is doing, that man has to make room for another, and then, perhaps, a third follows. No business could be successfully conducted on those lines. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. But it must have occurred to the &#34;Minister that the present system of temporary employment is unsatisfactory. When, as a member of a deputation from the Victorian Public Service, I waited on the late James Munro, then Premier of the State, and informed  him  that there were in the service men who had been temporarily employed for periods ranging from five to ten years, he asked j &#34; If the services of these men have been required for so many years, why have they not been put on the permanent staff?&#34; My reply was that that was what the men themselves claimed should be done for them. The Government Printer puts on one side the restrictions of the Public Service Act relating to temporary employment.  He could not afford to have his office upset by the provision which requires the dismissal of temporary employees after six months&#39; service. There are men in the Printing Office who have been there, as temporary hands for five or six years. </para>

I hail with satisfaction even the introduction of this thin end of the wedge, which will mean in &#39;the long run an alteration of the provision in the Public Service Act with regard to the limitation of temporary service to six or nine months. Under the existing law, a man is employed for six or nine months, and must then go, notwithstanding that he may really be needed in the Department in which he is working, and that it would pay to keep him on. </para>

I am sorry that the Minister cannot give us more than his assurance that men whose responsibilities are great, and whose efforts to enlist entitle them to consideration, are going to be protected. </para>

                        <para>That the following new clause be inserted: - &#34; 1a. Section 2 of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section :  - &#34; (2) References in this Act to persons who have served in any Expeditionary Force raised under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903-1915 shall be deemed to include members of the Army Medical Corps Nursing Service accepted or appointed by the Director-General&#39; of Medical Services for service outside .

                    <para class="block">The proposed new clause, if agreed to, will form part of the definition section of the original Act, and it will practically define the words &#34;those who have served in the Expeditionary Force,&#34; which occur several times in the Bill, as including nurses, and also members of the Naval Forces, who have been on active service. Shortly put, the object is to extend the provisions of this measure to nurses accepted or appointed for active service outside Australia, and to make it perfectly clear that members of the Naval Forces who have been on active service outside Australia are also covered by it. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposed new clause is very satisfactory, except for the last two words, &#34; who have been on active service &#39; outside Australia.&#39; &#34; Quite a number of Naval men have been sent on active service to North Queensland, Thursday Island,&#39; and Papua, and these men, under the clause as it stands, will be excluded from the provisions of the Bill. In short, there will be no recognition of their services. I&#39; do not think it can be the desire of the Minister to exclude them from any of the rights and privileges which are to be enjoyed under this Bill by. men who have served abroad. The fact that these men, who volunteered for active service, have been detailed for service in Australia - a number of them have been detailed for service on garrison duty in Australia - should not exclude them from the benefit of this Bill. </para>

I know of men who have returned from service at Port Moresby and Thursday Island, where they suffered just as much from malaria as any man at the Front has suffered from trench fever.- Are they to receive no consideration ?&#39; One&#39; of the men whom I have in mind was employed as a chauffeur by the State . Commandant in Brisbane on the ground that he was a returned soldier, but under this provision he will be excluded from the benefits of the Bill. He will not be recognised as a returned- soldier. Those who are doing active service in Australia are just as much entitled to consideration as those who are doing active service outside Australia. This war is being won, not only by the men who go to the other side of the world to fight, but by others who have volunteered and who are doing splendid service within the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but the general clause will apply to all those who are sent on active &#39; service outside Australia, as I understand practically all go to the Front. The intention is to put members of both the Naval and Military Forces, as nearly as practicable, on the same footing. This clause was only drafted this morning, and I have just received it from the Government Printer. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. This amendment has been rendered necessary, as a matter of fact, by a defect in the honorable member&#39;s Bill of 1915. The assumption was that it covered everything desired in this direction, but it was found that it did not. I give the honorable member for Brisbane my assurance that I shall ask the Parliamentary Draftsman to examine the clause closely, and see that it provides, as far as practicable, for identical conditions in respect of both the Naval and Military branches of the Australian Imperial Force. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister states that this Bill is to cover an omission, which, apparently, was made in the Act of 1915. But any one who has been connected with Parliament must admit that no Act is perfect, and must be amended from time to time; and no person could then foresee what legislation we should have to deal with in 1917. We provided in the War Pensions Bill that only those persons should benefit who. had volunteered for active service abroad, and who were injured while on service, and this prevented pensions being given to men who were injured or . contracted disease when in camp in Australia. I know the case of a young doctor who enlisted for active service abroad; but he did such good work at the Base Hospital in the meningitis outbreak, that he was kept here by General Fetherston. This young man was extremely anxious to get to the Front, hut he performed the duties allotted to him, with the result that he contracted the disease and died. That young man died as much in the service of the Empire as if he had been killed in Gallipoli or France; but there was great difficulty in obtaining a pension for his mother, simply because he had not gone abroad, although there are letters in the Department winch show that he applied time after time to go on active service. Then, again, there are men who, in the early days of the war, were. brought from South Australia and other States, and sent to Thursday Island and New Guinea, and such men are as much entitled to the benefits of the Act as are those who went overseas. I trust the Minister will consider the point I have raised. </para>

                        <para>. - There are at present about 600 or 700 of our seamen not actually in the Navy, but engaged in war work, inasmuch as they are employed on transports outside Australia. There are some twenty Inter-State boats manned by Australian seamen engaged in this work, and, in addition, some twenty-two interned German vessels, also manned by our own men. I take it that, at the termination of the war, these ships will have to be returned to their original owners, and that these men, as a consequence, . will be unemployed. Their claims, I think, ought also to be considered. </para>

                            <para>- All the same, I submit that the claims of these men ought to be recognised, as the claims of similar men are recognised in Great Britain. The men engaged on the trawlers in the North Sea, looking for mines, are merchant seamen; and what sailors call the &#34;dummy fleet&#34; is also manned by men of the merchant service; and- all these come under the Naval Act of Great Britain. Last week there were men returned to Australia who have been employed for fourteen months running troops over the Channel-; and surely these men must be regarded as &#39;having been engaged in war work, pure and simple. As I say, I suppose these German vessels engaged in transport work will have to be restored to their original owners at the termination of the war. </para>

Some of the vessels which will be returned to their owners were previously manned by lascars, and, with the ship-owners&#39; weakness for cheap labour, it is possible that our men may be replaced. If we had- an assurance that black labour would not be re-employed, the circumstances, would, of course, be different; but, in any case, the men to whom I have referred ought to have preference along with, men who have been actually on active service. </para>

                        <para>. - Repeatedly public servants have represented to me good reasons why the Public Service Commissioner . should not have as much power as he has at present, but the Minister is now proposing to give him greater power. I admit that there might be a returned soldier who is a very able man, and who had occupied a position outside the Service equal to that to which <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Commissioner might appoint him. But the placing of men over the heads of others who have been in the Department for years, and understood fully the routine work, is bound to lead to dissension. No doubt the Commissioner may use discretion in the matter, but I think we should adopt the suggestion made by public servants in the past that before a junior is appointed above his seniors the latter should have an opportunity of objecting. </para>

                            <para>- What is the use of objecting after the appointment is made and gazetted? I have known of dozens of cases of men appointed over the heads of others, and the appointments gazetted before anybody knew anything about them, and by that time the new appointees were fixtures, and could not be moved. Thus men get seniority over others who have been in the Service for a greater number of years. A Judge of the Supreme Court who was overlooked when a Chief Justice was being appointed was heard to say that in future he would do only his bare duty. When so high an official as a Judge felt hurt at being overreached by a junior, and announced such a resolve as that I have mentioned, we can readily understand that the same feeling would result in other walks of the Public Service. If the Commissioner is given the further powers proposed in this Bill a feeling will be created that it is useless to try to make oneself fit for promotion, because the Commissioner may at his own sweet will, advance juniors above their seniors. I have no objection to doing everything possible to make things easier for the returned soldier, but I shall vote against this clause just as I would if it were an amendment dealing with public servants other than soldiers. I suggest that when promotions are intended the intention to promote should be gazetted, and thus allow an opportunity for objection by those officers who have been overlooked. &#39; If the objection were a trivial one in the opinion of somebody considered capable of dealing with the matter, nothing further need be done. We must remember that the Public- Service is a huge machine,- and the less irksome the conditions the. better the result that will be obtained. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable members who &#39;objected to the clause seem not to understand the facts of the case. I am astonished a&#39;b the efforts put, forward in the interests of those who have not made any sacrifice for their country such as has been made by the men who have been on active service. We have stated in Parliament, and  the  country has indorsed our view, that the returned soldiers should be dealt with not only justly, but generously. The Minister is now proposing that if a vacancy occurs the Public Service Commissioner may appoint any returned soldier whom he considers fit for the job. I cannot see that the returned soldier will get much benefit out of this provision, and it seems to me that the objectors are making much ado about, nothing. These desperate efforts in be: half of the cold-footers are rather amusing. The Civil Service is a pretty compact body, and heads of Departments generally are anxious to get through their work as quickly and efficiently as possible. I believe that, &#171;as a body, the Public Service do their work efficiently. Naturally the heads would prefer to have trained men about them. A leading civil servant told me that ten years of training was necessary to render a man any good to the head of his Department. </para>

                            <para>- The head of a Department should not have to instruct his subordinates in every detail of what he requires; they should be sufficiently acquainted with the Department to almost anticipate what the head wishes done. And as a rule, departmental heads will be reluctant to have new trained men introduced into the Service. So, too, an active Minister who is taking a live interest in his Department will naturally desire to have his work done as quickly and smoothly as possible, and if representation is made to him that the influx of  returned  soldiers is in&#39;terfering with the efficiency of the Service his tendency will be not to open the door any wider than he can avoid. The more efficient the Public Service is made the greater will be the handicap of the returned soldier; therefore, the danger honorable members have anticipated seems very remote. On the other hand, we have&#39; a pledged duty to the returned. soldiers. We have talked about what we will do for them, and if, when the opportunity -arises, we close the door against them, we shall brand ourselves as a band of hypocrites. I hope the Minister will adhere to the clause as drafted, because, so far as I can see, only the exceptional men will be admitted to the Service. </para>

                    <para>Returned soldiers ought to be in two classes, the men who have actually fought and those who have merely been abroad, and have been returned invalided without having been actually to the Front. A man may have been to Egypt or France, and because of illness have been sent home without even having heard a shot fired. He has had a trip at the Commonwealth expense, and doubtless when the war medals are issued he will get one. We shall have returning directly a lot of soldiers who have been nothing but drawingroom knights, loafing round Westminster, near head-quarters, and who have been absolutely as safe from shot and shell as any of us in this chamber. We ought to draw a distinction between them and those who have gone to the Front and risked their lives for their country. A classification of that kind should be made before we go any further with the Bill. </para>
                    <para>There, is a great deal in the remark of the honorable member for West Sydney, that the men in our mercantile marine have done yeoman service during the war. I do not say that provision should be made for them in this Bill, but after the war is over they will have a strong claim to any positions going on any shipping owned or controlled by the Commonwealth. However, I am not afraid that&#39; justice will not be done to them by this or succeeding Parliaments. </para>

Many, not only on the permanent staff and at the Defence Department, but also amongst those who enlisted from private life, have been refused permission to go to- the Front. Many of these are rendering excellent service, and doing work equally essential to the carrying on of successful operations as those who are actually in the firing line. </para>

                            <para>- The basis of promotion in the Public Service is that, so far as divisions within classes are concerned, the. officers automatically move forward, and receive their increments accordingly, without any question of seniority or anything else; but before they move from one class to another they have to show merit. The question of seniority also comes in, but merit is the prior consideration. The clause gives the Commissioner power to place returned soldiers in any grade and in any class, which must necessarily mean  the exclusion of men who look upon the vacancies as their only opportunities for* promotion. If the honorable member for Flinders is right, we shall, by this clause, introduce the very danger he pointed out, of having men in the Service without the experience and knowledge of the Service which is essential to enable them to Tender efficient service to the public. There is such a thing in the Service as efficiency, which is attained only by experience. It is a peculiar kind of training, yet, under this clause, the Commissioner has power, because a returned soldier has certain clerical qualifications, to put him in any of the higher positions in the Clerical Division. There is no limit to it, and some limit ought to be imposed to protect* the men in the Service. N &#39; , </para>

I have sufficient confidence in the returned soldiers to think that, if they once get a chance in the lower grades of the .Service, they will soon show their ability, and get the experience to qualify them for promotion to the &#39;higher grades. &#34;But I would not put the whole of the members of the Service who occupy higher positions, and who are looking forward to opportunities for promotion, aside, and allow an outsider, no matter what his qualifications may be, to step in front of them. </para>

The honorable member practically tells the returned soldier that he must begin at the bottom rung of the ladder, no matter&#39; what his age may be. He may have been a lieutenant-colonel, and have discharged the functions of the highest administrative positions in the Military Forces, yet the honorable member would make him start on the lowest stair. </para>

                            <para>- Under the Public Service Act a single man over the age of twenty-one &#39;must receive at least &#163;126 a year, and a married man &#163;156 a year. Is it desired to make the returned soldier begin at that stage? If the proposal of the honorable member were accepted it would,  in effect, negative our attempt to give preference to returned soldiers. Apparently, although the honorable member wishes to give preference to returned men, his concern is rather for the preservation of the rights of those already in the Service. The Bill will enable the Commissioner to appoint men, who become eligible, to such positions as he may think them capable of filling. The Commissioner must be assumed to be fitted for his office, and to have the good of the Public Service at heart. No one &#34;would minimize the work of many of our public servants. During the war the officials in many branches have done most meritoriously, as all who have come into contact with them will admit. One has only to remember what the girl% in the clothing factory have done in giving up spare time to work for Red Cross funds and other organizations for the benefit of the soldiers. The Commissioner will have regard to the efficiency of the men offering, and will appoint to the higher vacancies only such as he is satisfied will capably discharge the duties appertaining to the office. The object of the Bill is not to have inefficient men put into positions in which efficiency is required. The Commissioner, in giving preference, must have regard to efficiency, and to circumstances generally. I think we might leave the matter to his good sense and justice in the application of the provisions of this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I desire that a fair deal shall be given to those in the Service. Those who are likely to be overlooked in regard to an appointment should have an opportunity of protesting beforehand ; it is too late to protest when an appointment has been made. The Minister and those who have expressed themselves as desirous of protecting the soldier should not allow any one to be unfairly promoted over his head by the Public Service Commissioner. The Minister did not refer to that possibility. Like others on his side he is content to wave the flag. He did not deal with the position put by the honorable member for Brisbane, whose contention is that returned soldiers should have preference in the matter of appointment to the Public Service, but, once there, should be required to fit themselves for promotion to higher positions. In my opinion, the provision as it stands may work adversely to many returned soldiers, and to many men who wished to go to the war, but were not allowed to do so. </para>

When a new member, and young and innocent, I interviewed the ex-Public Service Commissioner regarding a case, and was told that the letter of the law must be followed. On the next occasion that I brought a case before him, he said, &#34;Oh, we have to observe the spirit of the law.&#34; Finally, when I had both the letter and the- spirit of the law in my favour, I was told that I wanted too much. We know that appointments have been made unfairly, and I wish to prevent similar unfairness in the future. </para>

                    <para> Surely the Minister, or his draftsman, can frame machinery which would do this.- The honorable member for Hindmarsh, like myself, is one of the &#34; Would-to-God-they-would-take-me &#34; men. He complains of men staying in the artillery so that they may not be sent  to the  Front. Like me, he would, if accepted, be found where the bullets were thickest, that is, in the ammunition van. I am not afraid that the returned soldiers will not trust me. to look after their interests just as much&#39; as they would trust those who are waving the flag. It is not proper, when a member wishes to improve a measure, that he should be accused of want of patriotism by those who support the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the provision will not be diluted in the least. The object of the Bill is that returned soldiers shall have preference in the Public Service. The honorable member for Brisbane said, in effect, &#34; I am willing to allow returned soldiers to have preference in regard to the lowest positions in the Service, if care be taken that they shall never get&#39; any higher.&#34; But the object of the Bill, which gives effect to the desire of the majority of honorable members, and of a still greater majority outside, is that any provision of the Public Service Act which prevents&#39; a fair preference being given to returned soldiers shall be thrust aside. It is our intention that there shall be no position in the Public Service which shall not be open to a returned soldier. Is a man who has spent two or three years at the Front, and has played a man&#39;s part in defending his country, to be compelled to enter into competition with schoolboys to secure a position in the Public Service ? An objection to the system of promotion which prevails in our camps is that it gives an advantage to boys who have just left school, and in consequence find it much more easy to get up textbooks and pass examinations than it is to men who have been away from school for five or ten years, and yet have a much wider knowledge and a better general education. If the proposal of the honorable member for Brisbane, were accepted, the preference offered to a returned .soldier would be like our Tariff preference, nothing but a farce. The wish of the majority of honorable members is that returned men shall have preference in regard to every branch of Government employment; that wherever there is a position for which a returned man is fitted, he shall have preference in regard to it over all comers. He should certainly have preference over men who, by remaining at home, have had time to study subjects of examination. </para>

                    <para>We give the Public Service Commissioner practically unlimited power in the administration of the whole Public Service of the Commonwealth, but in  this one  case we. are told he should not be allowed to exercise his discretion; that he should be bound down by hard and fast rules&#39; which will make it impossible for- returned soldiers entering the Service ever to get very far beyond the lowest grade. </para>
                    <para>Neither the Federal nor State Governments have gone far enough in this direction.. There are many positions, such as those of ticket collectors at railway gates, and -tramway conductors, which might well be filled by maimed men who have returned from the Front. I say deliberately that the eligible who has stayed at home, and has not offered to go to the  Front,  should make way for the man who has volunteered, and has done his bit for the Empire. Instead of weakening this Bill, I would strengthen it very considerably in the direction I have named. If there is one class to whom preference should be given every time, it is that of the men who have gone to the  Front  - in many cases, they have thrown up good positions in order to do so - and who, after fighting there for two or three years, have returned so injured as to be unable to follow their former occupations.&#39; If there is in the Public Service an eligible man who has not volunteered, then, be he married or single, he should make way for such a man. </para>

                        <para>.- There seems to be. a very laudable desire on the part of honorable members to do everything possible for those who have joined the Australian Imperial Force, regardless of how they got there, or why they joined. Every one says to-day, &#34;We cannot do enough for our &#34;heroes!&#34; but  ten years after the war it will be a case of, &#34; You cannot do enough to forget them.&#34; The honorable member for Franklin said that he hoped that preference of employment would be given to returned soldiers in respect of not only the Commonwealth, but the State Public Services. Why not go further, and provide for such preference in private employment? I was going to say, &#34; Preference to unionists,&#34; and even had I done so, I should not have been far out, since the ratio of workers to idlers in the general community is well maintained in our fighting Forces. . When the men come back from the Front, they will still be unionists, and despite all Acts of Parliament the commercial community will take care .that they are bled just as freely as are any other section. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Why should not this preference be extended to private employment? After all, it is the private employer who is reaping the benefit of this war. It may not be a sordid trade war, but it is a very payable war so far as that section of the community is concerned. A few nights ago, I referred to the increase of deposits in the Associated Banks of Australia since the outbreak of war. As a matter of fact I dealt only with the first two years of the war and showed that in that time these bank deposits had increased to the extent of &#163;35,000,000. The latest figures, however, show that since 1914 the bank balances of the commercial community pf Australia have increased by &#163;50,000,000. That increase is the result of the war, and it does not include the amounts which have been subscribed to various patriotic funds designed to carry on, the work that should be done collectively by the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>This preference to returned soldiers and sailors should be extended to private employment for the reasons I have stated. In my camp there are hundreds, of fellows who have left good jobs to which, should they have the misfortune to be injured at the Front, they will never be able to return with any likelihood of earning their former wages. </para>

We hear it said again and again, &#34; Too much cannot be done for the soldier. He should have the best.&#34; But he does not get the best while he is1 soldiering.

But the commercial community can make &#163;50,000,000 in three years out of the war and nothing is said about it. I was told to-day of a returned soldier who has lost an arm, and who, before he volunteered, was earning &#163;6 a week as a glass- blower.

                    <para class="block">Echuca, I shall still hang on to it in the interests of those who have sent me here. Honorable members will see that I am quite frank in regard to the position I take up. I am ,not like some of the Fusionists opposite, who changed their political skins and accepted the vote of Liberals while still calling themselves Labour men,- with the sole object of hanging on to their jobs. I wish to know whether, in the judgment of the Commissioner, such remarks as fell from the honorable member for Hindmarsh are likely to be taken into account? It will be remembered that that honorable member said men had gone into the artillery so that they should not be sent to the Front; and I know that such an idea is resented in the camp where I am placed. In this connexion I wish to make- my own position quite clear to those who are mean and contemptible enough to attribute wrong motives to me, in the hope that some consideration will be shown to others who are similarly placed, and who may have given up their positions in private life. The honorable member for Grey accused me of having made political capital out of my enlistment ; and I should like honorable members to be in possession of the exact circumstances. After an interjection in this House from the honorable member for Grampians, I went straight home, and from there to the recruiting office, without telling even my wife that- 1 intended to enlist. &#34;When I gave my name to the officer&#39; in charge, he asked me if I was the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Yates</inline> who was a member of Parliament, but I said that that had nothing to do with the matter - that I had come there for the purpose of enlisting. I was asked no further questions, and was passed right through. I informed the officials that I would go&#39; into camp on the 30th October, after the referendum, and I was quite prepared to honour my promise, but circumstances intervened, arid it was the 7th November when I got there. I was not asked into which arm&#39; of the Force I would go, but, on the 22nd December, was put into the camp where the men are treated for their teeth. I was placed in some unit, but I applied for a month&#39;s leave of absence on account of my appointment as  chairman  of the Recruiting Committee. </para>

The fact that I am still -in camp at the present time is not any fault of my own, but the fault of the Minister for Defence, and this I must make clear, or I shall be simply using words and words like those used by the &#34;Win-the-war party. I was due in camp again on 12th February, but nothing having, been done in recruiting owing to the absence of the Governor of the State, I applied for another month&#39;s leave. The honorable member for Grey has often asked what I have done for recruiting, and my reply is that in the month of March there was more recruiting in my district than in any other district during the same time. </para>

                            <para>- Seeing that the Minister&#39;, in all probability, knows more than you do - with all respect to your position, sir - he, I think, will advise you that I am quite in order in dealing with the case of a member of the Expeditionary Force who, for good reasons, may not go to the Front. I submit that my own is a case similar to many which may crop up at any time. The Commissioner is left with discretionary power, and, in such a case as I have detailed, he may decide that a man is not entitled to preference, and I wish to know the true position. To that end I desire to place on record the case of a member of the Expeditionary Force, named G. E. Yates, and to show the reasons he has not been sent to the Front. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire to know &#34; anything. My thirst for information has been assuaged by the  Chairman,  and I am satisfied. I suggest that some honorable members opposite look eligible, if they are not, and, as there are many ways of becoming members of the Expeditionary Force, I think they ought to go to the enlisting office. Whatever amendments may be made in the Bill or the Act I hope that the generosity of Parliament will be demonstrated by more than these debates - that when . the measure becomes law the men will have the good time that they were promised. But what has the Commonwealth . given to the men ? The women of Australia have done more for the men than the Government have, inasmuch as they have, at least, provided a shelter on the St.. Kilda-road. There are also huts erected by the Presbyterian body and the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association, but it is only recently that the latter has been able to build a chimney and supply a fire. If there had been a genuine desire on behalf of the Government to assist the men there would have been radiators in that place months before now and, moreover, the men would have been given some vegetables to vary their diet. </para>

                        <para>.- Most honorable members must have read the  unwarrantable  attack made upon the ordinary Public Service examination by Professor Harrison Moore, of Melbourne University. That gentleman stated that, on account of the way in which the examinations were held, the Public Service was a refuge for the uneducated ; that the public servants, both. State and Commonwealth, were absolutely uneducated, und were not fit to hold .their present positions. If the prescribed examination mentioned in this. new clause means anything at all, it means an examination less severe than that which candidates have to pass to-day, because nobody would propose that an examination paper to be set before returned soldiers should be more difficult than &#39;that which is submitted to the ordinary candidates from the State </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Mid public schools, business colleges, and the University. This clause affords a fitting opportunity for somebody representing the Government to defend the existing system of examination, if it is right, or, if it is wrong, to announce their intention to alter it at the earliest possible moment. I know that very often the examination is of greater educational than practical value. So far from the Service being the refuge of the uneducated, we very often find that there are in the Government Departments educated persons who are not able to transact departmental business as well as are many persons who have not had a high education. In my opinion, the men who have entered the Commonwealth Service by competitive examination , will compare more than favorably with those who entered it before there was any public examination at all. r Every man who has held Ministerial office will admit that to be a fact. I hope that the Minister will assure the House . that the present examination, although it may not get! the best possible men, does insure that the recruits to the Service do not lack educational equipment. </para>

                    <para class="block">Several times during the consideration of this Bill, fear has been expressed, that in the administration of this law the Public Service Commissioner will assume that it is right that every man, no matter what his obligations!, should be dismissed to make room for a returned soldier who may, and probably will, be a single man. We are told that we may trust to the administration of the Act, but the Commissioner will probably be guided by the definite language of the law. For that reason I am proposing this clause as a safeguard. Ordinary temporary employees can remain in the Service only six months, but returned soldiers may, according to the provision to which we have already agreed, be kept in the Service for years. The clause is not meant as an instruction to the Public Service Commissioner, so much as an expression of the feeling of the Committee. Otherwise those who have to administer the Act will say, &#34; The whole object of the Act is to give employment to returned soldiers, and these men, because they had not gone to the war, must be put off.&#34; All I ask is that while there is employment for them men who have given satisfaction in the various Departments for one, two, or three months should be allowed to finish their six months&#39; term. </para>

                        <para>.- I . hope the Government will stick to the Bill, and accept no amendment. I cannot understand the opposition to the Bill or the long delay in passing it. I should like to make it a great deal more .stringent than it is so far as regards a large number that have got .into the Service recently. One has only to go round the Departments,, and see a number of those who are there, to recognise how they have got there. The Departments will be all the better for a bit of cleaning up. If I had my way, I would put in the Bill an amendment which would prevent the Government from giving the preference they have been giving in the past to certain people. It is a lasting disgrace to the Government of the day that a very large section of absolutely disloyal people are getting employment from them &#34;at the present time. I want to refer more particularly to the Clerks&#39; Union. This organization almost at the beginning of the war sent a resolution to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the then Prime Minister, pointing out that a great many of those who had gone to the Front had gone there only through empty bellies, to use their own elegant expression - a gross insult to the men who have gone on active service. It is the members of that body who are getting preference. Since then, we have seen resolutions passed by the same organization stating not only that they would do nothing in any shape or form to help recruiting, but that they are going to use all their efforts for a &#34;&#39; just and honorable peace.&#34; I have no time for that section, and am hopeful that the Government will insist on seeing that the men who have gone to the Front, and are willing to make the supreme sacrifice for us, get all the preference that it is possible to give them when they return. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry that I cannot see my way to accept the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition. There may be several reasons why a man in temporary employment ought not to* be dispensed with, but the honorable member is trying to limit his clause to one reason only - that he has not been accepted for service abroad. In any case the Commissioner has no power under the Act to dismiss. The only persons who can dismiss are -the  Minister,  or the permanent head of the Service. It is quite conceivable that the equities of individual cases may be so strong as to entitle them to &#39; earnest consideration. I gave this afternoon two cases mentioned by members on both sides, one of a married man, a reject, with two or three months of service to run, being displaced to make room for a returned soldier who is a single man. I said a case like that was a matter for consideration. </para>

                            <para>- It is not the Commissioner who reads anything into the Bill. The other case that appealed to members on both sides was that of a man well advanced in years, who had&#39; given a few months&#39; service to the Government, and had several sons at the Front, being displaced by a returned Soldier who was a single man. Iu those circumstances, it would be the duty* of the officer to consider the equities of the case, and try to place the returned soldier somewhere else. While carrying out the distinct wish of Parliament that  preference  should be given to returned soldiers, it will be the duty of the officer to consider the equities of individual cases. That is the spirit in which he should approach the administration of this Bill. I ask the honorable member not to press the amendment. </para>

It is better to assume that the Bill will be administered with good sense and discretion, and with full consideration of the equities of each individual case. It has frequently happened, when it has been sought in Acts of Parliament to make exemptions in regard to particular cases, that the result has been to exclude the consideration of other just cases. </para>

                        <para>. - The effect of the new clause will practically disappear before six months at the outside, because the men in the Service, affected by it are entitled to only six months&#39; employment. In 90 per cent, of the cases their employment would <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> be continued beyond the specified six months. The other 10 per cent, would be cases such as the Minister has quoted where special circumstances call for special consideration. Is it fair that the men now in employment should have their work interfered with merely because they have . not been accepted for active service? To many of them the clause is  simply  a polite intimation that they will be displaced at the end of their six months by. returned soldiers.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom.</inline> - The clause refers only to rejects. </para>

They are entitled to this consideration at any rate till the end of their term. Some of us have considerable misgivings that the Commissioner may act in a very drastic manner in order to make room for returned soldiers without considering the interests, commitments,- or domestic responsibilities of those in the &#39;Service. I do not think returned soldiers generally desire men to be put out of employment summarily and without) consideration in order that work may be found for them. </para>

I cannot help feeling that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is intended to do by a side wind what the Opposition have been trying to do all night. I never saw such support in my life as has been offered to this Bill by honorable members opposite/ who asseverate with every breath they draw that they are in favour of preference to returned soldiers ; and yet try by every conceivable means to make the whole measure null and void. This kind of thing is not quite honest and above board. Either they are in favour of preference t&#39;o returned soldiers or they are not. If &#39;they are they should not be trying all the evening, as they have been, to make the Bill of no use. For instance, there is the proposal that the man who is doing something here shall be brought into this matter. We are told that certain men have gone to Rabaul and other places. Everybody has intense sympathy with the men who have done their duty. </para>

                            <para>- So do I. Those men will always be entitled to the generous consideration of the Government; and the Government will do all they can to help them. This Bill, however, sets out to do one thing directly. That is, to give preference to returned soldiers. By &#34;returned soldiers&#34; is meant soldiers who have been participants . in this great world struggle, and have returned from the fighting Fronts. It is felt that they should be given preference over and above those who stay here. Yet the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition is to strike away this preference. If it were agreed to, the only course open to us would be to withdraw the Bill. Reduced to its simplest terms, <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> amendment means that the man&#39; who has not offered for active service, and therefore has not been accepted, shall have as much right to employment as the man who has gone to the war and returned. t </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt of that. I say nothing against this man, but in my judgment he cannot be the worst-off man in the community, and the Government are trying to meet his case. On this one case&#39; honorable members would base a law. Honorable members will find that those now in the Service will be treated as generously as the Government can treat them. It seems to be thought that those concerned in the administration of the Public Service will act like callous fools; but that is absurd. It is my experience that a permanent official is indisposed to part with men who are efficient, even to make way for soldiers. They do not like to have their offices disturbed any more than is possible. Honorable members may rely on that trait of human nature for a sufficiently conservative administration to do justice to those who have stayed at home. I hope that the Leader of the Opp&#39;osition will withdraw the amendment&#39;. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not surprised at the attack on the Leader of the Opposition made by the Minister for the Navy. The returned soldier was to be generously treated by this Win-the-war Government, but the only thing it can do for him is to find him a billet by discharging some unfortunate temporary employee who has not been accepted for active service. In every State returned soldiers are complaining that the Government has not fulfilled its promises. No wonder, then, that the Minister for the Navy is angry- when the Leader of the Opposition proposes to deprive the Win-the-war Government of an opportunity to discharge married men in order to put returned soldiers in their places. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment is designed to prevent the Government from abandoning its promise to respect the vote of the people , on the 28th October last, when conscription was defeated. This Win-the-war Government desires to bring about economic conscription by discharging temporary employees from the Public Service, and giving their places to returned soldiers. Ministers have been talking of spending &#163;22,000,000 in buying land for the soldiers. </para>

                            <para>- I was in the Treasury for twelve months, and should have liked to stay longer, but there are compensations in being out of the position. I do not think that there is a single returned soldier who wishes to get a job by the discharge of some man already in the Service. But the returned men look to the Government to carry out its promise. Has the Minister for the Navy no imagination ? Can he think of no other way of giving effect to the - promises to provide for the returned soldier and his dependants? This Win-the-war Ministry was hailed as a Ministry of. men of talent. Ministers were described as men of great business ability. Yet all they can do for the heroes who have returned from Gallipoli and France is to sack persons now* in the Service to give them a job. I remember the time when the Minister for  the Navy used to say that no man was so unhappy as the unfortunate who could not get employment. </para>

                            <para>- Knowing the honorable . member, as I do, to me it is more like tragedy ! The honorable member would have public servants believe that the Government intend to do something for which this Bill really makes no provision. As a matter of fact, all that we do in this Bill is to provide machinery to give effect, to a section in the Act of 1915, which was inserted by the Government of which he was a member, and which really provided for preference to returned soldiers. I helped the honorable member to put in the Public Service Bill of 1915 a clause in which it was provided that no permanent appointments to the Public Service should be made until after the war. That provision was made by the Govern- . ment to which the honorable member belonged in order to show that we approved of men volunteering, and would do our best to assist them on their return. That being so. why should the honorable member for Capricornia endeavour in this way to throw dust in the eyes of public servants? They are an intelligent body of men, and have been too long associated with politicians not to &#34; have their weight.&#34; A politician may deceive ordinary members of the public, but he cannot deceive public servants. I was for twenty years behind members of Parliament like the honorable member for Capricornia. over whom there has come a great change. When he was in office&#39; he was a most cautious Minister. What a different man he is when he has not upon him the responsibility of a Minister. No more cautious man - no man with a keener intellect - ever sat on the Treasury bench. I hope that new members will not be tempted by the little baits thrown out. by the Opposition. </para>

Then there is a further condition that returned soldiers must pass a prescribed examination. The majority of returned soldiers who are appointed to the Public Service will only be given temporary employment. </para>

                            <para>- It is doing far more than the honorable member would have attempted to do in the direction of giving effect to the clause in the Bill passed while he was in office. Why should there be all this make-believe on the part of the Opposition? During the recent election campaign I received from a constituent a letter, in which he said he had been informed by the Opposition that if our party were returned to power all Public Service increments would be stopped. We have been returned to&#39; power, but nothing of the kind has occurred. Is this another of the red herrings that the Opposition would draw across the trail in order to make public servants believe that their friends are to be found only on that side of the House? I shall never vote for any Bill that would  do an injustice to public servants. For many years I was closely connected with public servants, and trusted by them. Whenever a vote was, taken to select representatives to wait on the Government, I always occupied a leading position on the poll. It was known that I would do my best for them, and I shall still do so. </para>

                            <para>- Such remarks do not hurt me. The honorable member is protected, because I desire to conform to the ruling of the Chair. I did not hear the whole of the speech made by the honorable member, because at the outset of it I was introducing a deputation of unionists to the Postmaster-General. Many of the unionists still have confidence in me, although I am sitting behind the Government. </para>

                    <para>I hold that returned soldiers will not, as some honorable members suggest, rush the Public Service. It is not so attractive as some people would have us believe. The members of it are subject to criticism to the like of which no other body of workmen have to submit, and many public servants would be much better off to-day if they had applied to some outside occupation the energy which they have thrown into their work as Government employees. <inline font-style="italic">Vor</inline> all these reasons I do not believe that returned soldiers will rush for positions in the Service, and we are not likely to have Ministers discharging public servants in a wholesale way in order to find employment for returned soldiers. My experience is that heads of Departments, in most cases, are anxious .to do justice to their fellow servants. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member&#39;s success in the administration of that Department was largely due to the fact that he had well-trained men at his elbow, so to speak, all the time he was there. Untrained men might disclose departmental secrets, just as outside business secrets &#39;are often talked of in various clubs. The success of our public Departments is largely due to the training our men have received, and ito the sacrifices they are willing to make. I have been surprised to learn of the overtime worked by men in various Departments, who cannot be replaced. I have known &#163;39,250 to be saved in a Department in one year as the result of the loyal co-operation of the staff. I also know of another Minister who was able to get &#163;1,400 back into a Department largely because of the ability displayed by those under him. I realize what these men are doing, and what their value is: and I feel sure that no Minister Would prevent a capable man from being promoted with a &#39;view of putting another in his place. I have no fear of the clause, and therefore I support it. </para>

                        <para>.- I am rather intimidated at the start by the grave exposure of the ex-Treasurer by the honorable member for Denison. That honorable member, and also the Minister for the Navy, have accused honorable members on this side of being against the men who went to the Front, and of not having the courage to openly state our opposition to the employment of returned Soldiers. I have no apology to offer for my position, notwithstanding the remarks made by the&#39; ancient warriors opposite. </para>

                            <para>- The time has been so much taken up by the Postmaster-General and others in demonstrating to the House their inherent genius that there has been little opportunity for others so far. The amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition only proposes that the Commissioner shall not dispense with the services of any individual employed at the present time, on the ground that he has not been accepted for active service. It has been said by honorable members opposite that the proposal is really meant to apply to those who did not- volunteer, and personally I should have liked to see it that way. The people of Australia have decided that conscription shall not be enforced; and, in my opinion, unless the amendment is carried, the Government will dispense with the services of men, not because they are incompetent, but because they have not volunteered, thus, getting behind the verdict of the people, and giving a lead to private firms to indulge in what is termed outside &#34; economic conscription.&#34; </para>

At present I am merely pointing out - though, of course, I may be wrong - that the idea behind this Bill is to force men out of employment because they have not volunteered In the face of the decision of the people, it is not competent for this Government or any private firm to so act towards men who have not volunteered, for reasons of their own, -whatever those reasons may be. Private firms will  take  the lead now offered to  them  by the Government; indeed, in Western Australia already private firms have petitioned the State Ministry to refuse employment to men who have not volunteered. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to make a suggestion to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> which, if adopted, will be of advantage to honorable members, and also to people outside Parliament. Many of the general public are not aware of the name of the honorable member for Ballarat, or the honorable member for Balaclava, or of any other honorable member who is referred to in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> by the name of his constituency. I suggest that when the member for a constituency is mentioned, his surname should be printed in brackets, so&#39; that a person may read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with more comfort than is possible at present. . It was at my suggestion that we followed the practice of the Imperial Parliament in providing cards to be sent in to honorable members by visitors to the House, and I suggest that we again follow Imperial precedent in the matter I have just, mentioned. Only last week, in referring to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of seven years ago, I had to turn to the front of the volume repeatedly in order to discover the same of the honorable member referred to in the course of debate. The thought struck me that if I, with my parliamentary experience, found difficulty in identifying honorable members by their constituencies, the general public would have even greater difficulty. </para>
