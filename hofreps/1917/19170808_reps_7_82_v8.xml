                        <para>- The honorable' member for Nepean has asked a similar question. He wishes to know whether the New Zealand scale of rations cannot be adopted. It is true that New Zealanders get butter and condensed milk, but the Australian soldier is  on  the whole better off than the New Zealand soldier. . Both prior to embarkation are paid 5s. a day, but after embarkation the Australian soldier gets 6s. a day, of which1s. is deferred pay, and the New Zealand soldier gets only 5s. per day, of which 3s. are deferred pay. At the present time the Australian dietary is on a liberal scale, and more than is absolutely necessary for the  requirements  of the men. In certain camps soldiers are obtaining condensed milk  as  an " in lieu " ration. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether the steamer has left yet, but I have been informed that the wharf labourers* decline to load her, or, I under - stand, to coal her. In this port the wharf labourers and the stevedores belong to two distinct unions, both of which belong to the same federation. - The stevedores assist in loading on, the ship itself, while the wharf labourers are employed on the wharf. It is the latter who have declined to load tibia vessel. The stevedores are ready to work. I have received a quasi-official report of the circumstances, and I am getting a full report, which I shall  maker  available to- . morrow. I  shall  then state the policy of the Government in regard to the matter. </para>

                            <para>- I am not alluding to the honorable member. The facts show conclusively that 'bread is sold in Australia at a lower .rate than in any one of the belligerent countries - that bread is little, if any, higher in price than it waa in pre-war days - and that there 'is no room for rigging the market in regard to wheat and flour, because this is all, or practically all, vested in the Government of the country. The industry is under the control of the Government, and the whole of the receipts therefrom go through the channel of the Government direct into the pockets of the producers. . As to the second part of the question, the policy of the Government in regard to the cost of living is precisely the same as that of the Government of which the honorable member for Capricornia was a member. The cost of bread is exactly the same now as it was then. </para>

The Government, through its representatives, at the .last Premiers' Conference arranged for the preparation of one roll for State and Commonwealth, and one return for Commonwealth and State income taxes. This alteration is being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and the delay is not to be  attributed either to this or the State Governments. It is purely a question of machinery; and the various Taxation Departments, Commonwealth and State, have the matter in hand. </para>

Probably the honorable member is not aware that maximum prices are fixed for a number of commodities, amongst them being the staple products upon which the people live. Prices are fixed for flour, wheat and its by-products, sugar, butter, and rabbits. Of course, all these things are beneath the honorable gentleman's notice. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman will remember what he did in regard to this matter during the time he was in office. I am sure that you, sir, would, be only too glad to afford the House an opportunity of hearing from the honorable member what he did, so that we might go and <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> likewise. The honorable member knows perfectly well .what has been the position in regard to meat, and he is as well acquainted as any man with the many difficulties in connexion with the regulation of its price. It is practically impossible to regulate the price of meat unless we regulate the price of cattle on the hoof. I know of no way - and in this regard I sit at the feet of the honorable member - of compelling a man to raise stock except at such  prices  as will pay him, nor do I know of any means by which human nature can be so changed as to immolate itself and sell in any market other than the best. The workers will not do so, and honorable members of the Opposition would be the first to blame them if they did. I would, at any rate. The man who grows meat is no less a producer than the man who works on the wharf. What we have to do, if possible, is to hold the scales evenly between all sections of society. I invite honorable members sitting in Opposition, and also those people outside who are seeking to mislead the unfortunate men who are compelled to work on the wharfs for their living, to pull this chestnut out of the  fire, to explain : how the price " of living - meaning thereby the prices of wheat, flour, sugar, butter, rabbits, and so forth - can be reduced below its present level, except by the exploitation of the man who produces those commodities, and who works, at least, as hard as any other person in the community. </para>

On the other hand, I quite agree with him that it should not be made a pretext for other action. However, I shall make inquiries into the matter. </para>

Therefore, the stock and station agents have nothing whatever to do with the increase in prices. </para>

                                <para>- I confess that I know nothing of the manner in which sheep and cattle are sold. I know that in New South Wales they are sold in the yards at Homebush, and I suppose the same conditions prevail in Victoria. I presume that stock are sent down to saleyards in order to suit the interests of the seller.I can hardly conceive that stock and station agents as such, unless they are the owners of the sheep or cattle, can withhold them from the market. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask a question in reference to a case that has just been brought under my notice, viz. : - The wife of ex-Sergeant Wood, with 722 days' service with the Australian Imperial Force, died on the29th April, leaving two children, but no money reached those children from the Pay Office until yesterday, when a sum of £915s. was paid. My question is whether the officer in the Department who was guilty of leaving these orphans without means of support will be punished, and whether steps will be taken to prevent such a thing occurring again? </para>

                    <para>Since the outbreak of war, it has become the practice to present the Estimates to Parliament very late in the financial year. Many disadvantages result from such delay, and successful effort has been made to lay the Estimates for 1917-18 before Parliament at this early date after the close of the financial year. </para>

                    <para>The balance of £2,102,177 brought forward to the year 1917-18 is what remains of the surplus of 1915-16. In 1916-17 the revenue amounted to £34,035,173, and the expenditure was £34,932,996, resulting in a deficit of £897,823 on the transactions of the year. </para>
                    <para>To get a complete view of the Commonwealth finances, it is necessary not only to look at the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which has just been referred to, but also at the expenditure out of Loan Funds. </para>

                    <para>Custom's and Excise Revenue. The Customs and Excise Revenue of the Commonwealth reached its highest in 1915- 16, when the receipts amounted to £16,934,103. During 1916-17 the revenue began to fall, and, in that year, amounted to £15,606,441. In the present financial year it is estimated that only £13,630,000 will be received, even without allowing for any reduction of revenue resulting from the policy of the Government in relation to the prohibition of luxuries. An announcement as to this policy will be made this week. </para>

                    <para>It is the intention of the Government to urge the State Governments to adopt the Federal Income Tax Act as their own, and to authorize the Commonwealth Taxation Department to collect the State taxes at rates fixed by the State Governments. </para>
                    <para>The Conference of officers adopted uniform definitions for "improved value," " value of improvements," and " unimproved value," the definitions agreed upon being those which appear in the Federal Land Tax Assessment Act.

                    <para>Transfer of Part of Unexpended London . Balances. For some years it has been the practice of the Treasury, when goods are ordered in Great Britain, to set aside money in order to pay for the goods when delivered. The money was transferred from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the credit of a Trust Account known as the " London Liabilities Account," The  result is that money is carried forward from year to year, because in some cases many months - and even years - elapse between the time when the money is set aside and the time of payment for the goods. </para>
                    <para>The usual practice is to meet expenditure out of current revenue, and this is followed by the Commonwealth in relation to expenditure within Australia. . Under existing circumstances there is neither reason nor necessity for storing up money to meet payments in London long before it is required. </para>
                    <para>The balance of moneys lying in the "London Liabilities Account" on 31st March, 1917, was £4,591,776, and of this £2,925,291 belonged to the Consolidated Revenue. The proposed transfer to the Consolidated Revenue Fund is £825,355. </para>
                    <para>Expenditure out of Revenue, not Including War. The total expenditure out of Revenue, not including war, is estimated at £24,174,481 in 1917-1918, including £1,257,617 for new works. The actual expenditure last year was £26,526,026, including £4,301,530 for new works. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>Included in the estimate of expenditure out of loan in 1917-18 is an amount of £26,000,000, which is due to the British Government. Most of the expenditure on the Australian Imperial Force is made direct by the Australian Government, but in addition very heavy expenditure is made by the British Government, principally for the maintenance of the troops at the Front, and the supply to them of munitions. The estimated expenditure by the British Government in respect of the Australian Imperial Force, from the commencement up to 30th June, 1917, was £28,500,000, and up to 30th June, 1918, it is estimated that a further amount of £29,750,000 will be required. The Commonwealth had repaid £5,000,000 up to 30th June, 1917, and since that date is paying £3,500,000 more, at the rate of £500,000 a week. The British Government has been generous in this matter, and has not even suggested that payment should be made ; but, of' course, it is in-' tended that, as soon as possible, the indebtedness shall be reduced. </para>
                    <para>The payment to the British Government is dependent upon several contingencies, chiefly relating to the overseas sale of Australian produce, and the raising of  sufficient  amounts of loan in Australia. </para>
                    <para>Included in the estimate of expenditure out of War Loan are an amount of £2,850,000 for advances to the States for the construction and erection of silos for wheat storage, and an amount of £2,000,000 to be advanced to the States for the purpose of settling returned soldiers on the land. This £2,000,000, and the £1,000,000 to be provided for general repatriation purposes out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, make, in all, £3,000,000, which it is estimated will be sufficient to meet the expenditure on repatriation during 1917-18. </para>

                    <para>The items to be placed on loan amount to a proposed expenditure, for the most part during the current year, of £2,742,725, and are properly chargeable to Loan Funds. Not to proceed with these urgently necessary works would mean a large withdrawal of employment, which should, where possible, be continued, as otherwise existing difficulties would be accentuated. By avoiding increased taxation as far as possible, and the curtailment of employment resulting from taxation, wealth production will be encouraged. </para>

The site was purchased in the year 1911-12, and, since then, the building has been steadily proceeded with. The total amount expended up to the 30th June, 1917, including £400,000 for the site, was £738,931, of which £617,690 was provided from loan, and £121,241 from revenue. The estimated expenditure for the current year is £100,000, chargeable to loan. It is hoped that this provision will be sufficient to enable the building to be completed. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made in the Estimates of the current year for £12,800 to cover upkeep and maintenance, including municipal and other taxes. As a set-off to this expenditure, it is estimated that rents, amounting to £10,000, will be received during the year. Amongst the tenancies already arranged for may be mentioned those of the Agent-General for Victoria and the British Government, who "pay rents of £2,200 and £6,275 respectively. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Government is relieved of the payment which it has hitherto made for rent in London. The amount for the year 1915-16 was £2,960. </para>
                    <para>Invalid and Old-age Pensions. At 30th June, 1917, there were in the Commonwealth 93,672 old-age pensioners, and 26,781 invalid pensioners - total 120,453 - equal in all to approximately 4£ per cent, of the adult population. </para>
                    <para>The expenditure for 1916-17 was £3,452,849, being an increase of £593,083 over the preceding financial year. This very large increase is due principally to the amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act in October last, as a result of which all pensions were increased by 5s. per fortnight. In my financial statement of 14th June last, I estimated the cost of this amendment at £800,000 per annum. The expenditure for 1917-18 is estimated at £3,830,000. Here, again, there is a considerable increase, due chiefly to the fact that the increase in the rate of pensions was operative for only nine months in the last financial year. </para>
                    <para>As a result of the amending Act of 1916, all inmates of benevolent asylums for whose maintenance the Commonwealth makes payment, are now receiving pensions of 2s. per week. This amount is paid to them personally, or, in some cases, disbursed for their benefit. </para>
                    <para>The Government proposes to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act so that war pensions, and payments by the Defence Department to persons by reason of their dependence on members of the Forces, will not interfere with pensions under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. </para>
                    <para>Maternity Allowances. During the financial year 1916-17, 132,407 maternity allowances were paid, representing an expenditure of £662,035. This was an increase of 458 allowances compared with the preceding financial year. </para>
                    <para>War Pensions. The war pensions which are payable in Australia numbered 42,815 on the last day of the financial year 1916-17. The expenditure of that year was £1,149,423. At the end of the preceding financial year, war pensions numbered 8,754, and the expenditure for the year was £129,273. The expenditure for 1917-18 is estimated at £2,600,000. </para>
                    <para>Arrangements exist with the Governments of New Zealand and South Africa for payment of Commonwealth war pensions in those countries. In other countries outside the Commonwealth payment is made through the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions in London. </para>

The moneys referred to in the agreement are for ordinary public works, &amp;c.,of the States, and are not for the erection of silos, or for the settlement of returned soldiers on the land or for other repatriation purposes. The amount to be advanced to the States, in 1917-18, for erection of silos for wheat storage is £2,850,000, and the amount to be advanced for purposes of settling returned soldiers on the land is £2,000,000. </para>

The loan is redeemable in 1920-22. In' April, 1917, the Commonwealth raised another loan of £3,500,000 in London for the States. The price of issue was 98, and the rate of interest51/2per cent. per annum. This loan is redeemable in 1922-27. The Imperial Government agreed that the Commonwealth might make further advances to the States, totalling £3,000,000, out of War Funds supplied by the British Government, in anticipation of the issue of a further loan for the States, out of which the advances will be repaid to the War Funds. The States have already been paid their proportions of this £3,000,000. The amount of £3,000,000 was paid to the States as follows: - </para>

The obligation of the States to repay the £18,000,000 is definite, and, as it is desired to vary that obligation, the agreement of 6th, November, 1915, might well be reconsidered as regards payments beyond this calendar year. The Government is anxious to work in the closest harmony with the Governments of the States in this matter, and feels sure mutually satisfactory arrangements will be made. </para>

Several denominations of certificates are issued', and in each case the purchase money is repaid at the end of three years, together with compound interest at the rate of 41/2 per cent. per annum. </para>

Good results are secured under the group system of saving, because of the regularity of the payments expected of the members, and the force of example which every member exerts upon the rest. </para>

Instead of the small surplus of £126,886, the credit balance was £2,102,177. Moreover, the interest payments during 1917-18 will not be so large as expected, because the Treasury hope to raise loan moneys in such a manner that the balances unexpended will be much less than they have been in the past. During the year 1916-17, owing principally to the fact that 'payments due to the British Government were deferred, the cash to the credit of the Treasury, including money lent for short periods in London and Australia, was greatly in excess of immediate requirements, as the followngfigures show: - </para>

No such scheme has been in operation elsewhere, so that there has been no precedent to- guide the Government in formulating one. The Bill has been framed so as to be elastic, and in order that it may be adapted to changed conditions that may arise in the future, and which are not present to our mind to-day. The object in view may be put in a few words: It is an organized effort on behalf of the community to adequately care for those returned soldiers who have come back partly or wholly incapacitated through illness or through wounds received at the Front, and to reestablish in civil life on their return from the Front those men who have taken up arms in defence of their country. Using the phrase which has been employed by the Minister in charge of repatriation, a scheme for repatriation must not be regarded in any sense as a mere money scattering proposition; it must be an organized effort to give real and valuable assistance to our returned soldiers. It will .also have an economic effect, because it will mean restoring our soldiers to their various civil occupations at the earliest possible moment, so that  they  may be in an immediate position to take up their part as citizens in the general production of wealth throughout the community. </para>
                    <para>Under the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Fund Act of 1916 a body of trustees was constituted and empowered to hold certain sums of money, but that scheme was in substance merely a voluntary effort for the collection of funds which were to be held by the trustees, and to be supplemented by Commonwealth grants. Altogether £109,355 was contributed by private effort, and the Commonwealth grant was £250,000. </para>

                            <para>- No. There will be a general uniform policy, and all allowances will be made under the regulations which will be drawn up. With a view to securing uniformity of action and uniformity of grants as far as is possible under one scheme, it is advisable for the Commonwealth to tak© the full responsibility and constitute its own agencies, and to administer the grants which will come from Commonwealth sources. Generally speaking, the object of repatriation is to reestablish the soldier in civil life, and in this regard it is important to consider the date at which repatriation should begin, and that at which the responsibility of the Minister administering this Bill will arise. This matter is decided in clause 8, which provides in effect that repatriation will begin from the moment of the discharge of the Australian soldier from the Australian Imperial Force. There are many funds in Australia to-day which are being applied in various ways for the amelioration of soldiers and their dependants, and with a view to securing a definite line of action and uniformity the Minister in charge of repatriation convened a conference of the promoters of these various funds!. This conference met and reviewed the whole question from the point of view of amelioration. By " amelioration " I mean, providing out of voluntary funds grants to soldiers and their dependants from the moment they enter camps up to the date of their return, and from the date of their return to the date of their discharge from the Australian Imperial Force. As a result of the conference a common agreement was arrived at to secure a uniform practice throughout Australia. Three things were agreed upon - uniformity of grants, a common collective agency in each State, and Commonwealth supervision as regards expenditure upon administration. In coming to an agreement as to what the scale of allowances should be, the conference practically adopted the highest scale existing in any State. There are two periods covered by the scale of allowances. The first period is from the date of enlistment to the date of return. The second period is from the date of return of the soldier to his discharge. I have in detail the scales agreed upon. Honorable members will understand that they represent the amount of income which the persons mentioned will draw, made up by the allotments of pay and grants. The scale for the first period, from the date" of enlistment to the date of return, is as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure, but I believe that the age limit is sixteen years. These are the cases of grants to the dependants of absent soldiers in order to bring the incomes up to the standards that I have detailed. After the soldier's return another scale operates, and that which has been agreed upon is as follows : - Single men, £2 10s. per week; man and wife, £3 5s. per week; for the first two children an additional 5s. each per week, and for children over two in number 2s. 6d. each per week. The object of the conference was to bring about this uniformity and to provide, as far as funds would permit, for generous and liberal treatment. </para>

                    <para>So far, I have dealt only with the position of the men up to the date of discharge. I come now to the point at which amelioration ceases and repatriation begins, and it is here that the responsibility of the Commonwealth commences. It will, perhaps, be found advantageous if, in outlining this scheme, I deal with each class of persons who are likely to come under it. Of these there are several. In the first place, it is proposed that the men, before they actually come under the operation of the scheme, shall be registered. At present the position is that a' soldier is discharged, receives his pay, and then may or may not apply to a Repatriation Committee for assistance. In some instances, returned soldiers first expend their money and then seek aid. It is not for us, however, to criticise such action on the part of the men who have made big sacrifices for their country. Rather should it be our aim to consider this question solely from the point of view of how we can best help them. The intention of the scheme is to secure registration before discharge, and, if possible, while the men are yet oversea, so as to minimize the time between the discharge and the re-establishment of the soldier in some civil calling or occupation. </para>

                            <para>- The payment of war pensions comes under the jurisdiction of the Treasurer. The point with which we are now concerned is that of keeping in touch with the soldier from the day of his return until he finally comes, under the repatriation scheme. An endeavour will be made, at the earliest possible moment, to obtain information as to the men who wish to come under the scheme, the qualifications they possess, and the particular calling which each man desires to follow on his return. That information having  been obtained by the officers and committees concerned, they shall at once be able to apply the scheme to each individual. </para>

                    <para>It is hoped that a vast proportion of our soldiers will return in good health and vigour ready to resume the civil occupations which they followed before the war. Many men so situated will not desire to come under this scheme, but experience teaches us that some of them will. The hope is that those who are in good health will return to the occupations they followed prior to enlistment. In order to assist them in doing so, or in obtaining other employment, it is proposed to provide for a system of registration for employment, or, in other words, for the establishment of a Bureau of Employment in each State. These bureaux will be linked up with local agencies or committees scattered throughout the rural districts of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has displayed great energy in dealing with this question, and has availed himself of every possible source of light and guidance. I may say, in passing, that he submitted the scheme to the Senate in a speech that will rank as being among the most notable made in connexion with the war. He formulated for the first time in history a scheme on behalf of a nation - a scheme framed with the intention that the nation should help those who had fought for it, and Help them in an organized way. To return to the point I was discussing when interrupted, the Central Bureau of employment will be linked up with country districts. There are already in existence, in several of the States, bureaux established for this purpose, and the Minister has been assured of the hearty co-operation of the State </para>

                    <para>The second class to be considered in connexion with repatriation is that of apprentices who enlisted before the completion of their indentures. At the time of their enlistment many young men were serving their apprenticeship to various trades, and those apprenticeships have been broken. Some two or three years may elapse between the date of their enlistment and the time of their return. Meantime, they will have lost their training, and consequently, although they will have advanced in years, their earning capacity will not be what it would have been had they remained at home and completed their indentures. It is not fair that these young men should be compelled to work for the wages they were earning at the time of their enlistment, and this is a responsibility of which the Minister has not lost sight. The object will be to enable them to complete their apprenticeship, the Repatriation Commission supplementing their wages to allow this to be done. Where Government employment can be provided to enable them to complete their apprenticeship it will be given; but where that is not possible, an effort will be made to induce private firms to provide for them. In other words, they will be asked to take over and complete the broken indentures, the Commission subsidizing the wages as far as may be necessary. Where it is impossible for these young men to complete their training under either Government or private employment, there may be on the part of the Commonwealth an obligation to consider the creation of special training establishments. The question of the remuneration of these young men is one of importance. An apprentice may have enlisted at eighteen years of age and may not return until he is twenty-one, with the result that the wage of a man of eighteen is not adequate for the man of twenty-one. The intention of the scheme is not to allow such a loss to fall on the men, but as far as possible, to place them in the position that they would have occupied, so far as the rates of wages are concerned, had they remained at home and completed their indentures. </para>

                    <para>I come now to another phase of this repatriation scheme, and one of the most important. I refer to land settlement. The States, as honorable members are aware, have jurisdiction oven the lands of Australia; and, in order that this aspect of the question might be dealt with, a special conference of representatives of each of the States was called to develop a definite policy. The matter was discussed at length, and five of the six States agreed to a definite plan. Shortly put, the agreement is that the States who own the lands shall provide the lands for this scheme, and that the Commonwealth shall advance to the States the money necessary to enable a grant not exceeding £500 to be made to each settler, for the purpose of improving his holding and providing plant, stock, and other essentials to his success. </para>

The Minister desires .to get into touch with the States, and to secure, as far as possible the establishment of small settlements. The amount to be advanced in each case is not in itself sufficient to enable large areas of land to be dealt with. Where a man already has land, this advance of £500 will be made to him ; but the intention is to establish smaller settlement schemes rather than attempt to deal with large areas. </para>

                    <para>Under this scheme, it is proposed tlo establish training farms, the losses upon which will be borne equally by the Commonwealth and She States. In regard to other occupations which returned soldiers may desire to follow, the regulations will provide for them, but it is obvious that something will have to be done for returned soldiers who have been discharged, and who are awaiting employment, and in this connexion the Minister proposes a scheme of reserve employment. One suggestion which has been made is that forestry should be encouraged in Australia, so that during this period of waiting their services may be utilized in that direction. There has also been under consideration the question of furnishing men with employment on the works to be undertaken by the River Murray Waters. Commission, and the Minister is now communicating with the States concerned with two objects in view - first, the employment of returned soldiers on those works, and, secondly, their settlement upon the lands embraced within that scheme. </para>
                    <para>I have ,now dealt with those men who are in possession of all their faculties, and who are healthy and strong. I wish now to direct attention to two other classes - those who are partially incapacitated and those who are totally incapacitated. Both deserve the most sympathetic treatment that we can extend to them, and this scheme has been framed with that object in view. In this connexion it is intended to establish in our hospitals what are known as' curative workshops - that is to say, workshops in which light employment will be provided for those who are partially incapacitated.' Such work will prove healthful to them, and 'will furnish them with a certain amount of preliminary training. By arrangement with the Minister for Defence, two of these workshops are to be established immediately, one in Sydney and the other in Melbourne, but it is intended to extend them, as circumstances require, throughout Australia. These workshops can be operated even before returned soldiers are discharged, and, as a matter of fact, will be utilized before the men come under the repatriation scheme. </para>

                            <para>- The Ministry is hopeful of being able to .make an arrangement with the unions and employers which will bring about the result I have indicated. I think it will be found that the unions are humane in this matter. We believe  that  they will endeavour to assist their fellow-citizens, who have fought and suffered for them, to obtain some means of supplementing their incomes. In the case of the permanently incapacitated, we are faced with an entirely different problem. These men are to be provided with suitable homes, and where they desire to remain with their own relatives, it is proposed to supplement their pensions so as to enable them to receive nursing attention. </para>

                    <para>In regard to pensions, it is only right that there should be some definite decision given in respect to them, and for obvious reasons. When a returned soldier knows definitely the amount of his pension, he will naturally feel a sense of security, and will endeavour to supplement it to the full extent of his capacity. After he has overcome the defects inseparable from the use of artificial limbs, and gained a victory, he ought not to be deprived of the fruits of that victory. Consequently it is proposed that after the lapse of six months his pension shall be fixed finally, and that it shall not afterwards be liable to any reduction. But should a man subsequently develop further defects from injuries arising out of the war, we intend to allow his pension to be reviewed with the idea of increasing it. But I wish honorable members to understand that there can be no review of it for the purpose of decreasing it. </para>
                    <para>I have now given a general outline of the scheme, and I may add that the Minister has stated that the proposals embodied in this Bill are to be considered of a more or less tentative character. As we have had no experience of repatriation, he will welcome suggestions with a view to improving the measure. </para>

                            <para>- The general principle of the Bill embodies Governmental responsibility for this scheme of repatriation As I have already pointed out, the obligation ought to be a national one, and in order to give effect to it, there should be Ministerial responsibility for the development of the scheme and for its administration throughout the Commonwealth. It follows therefore that there must be a Minister placed in control of it, and accordingly it is intended to introduce a Bill to constitute a Minister for Repatriation. He will be in charge of a Department. He will have under him a chief executive officer of the Commonwealth, and a chief executive officer in each of the States. They, in turn, will have under them the necessary officials to give effect to the scheme. It will be admitted, I think, that throughout Australia during the war, there has been a wonderful exhibition of capable management by persons who have voluntarily given their services to assist our returned soldiers, and who have helped in connexion with the movements on behalf of soldiers and their dependants. In these circumstances, it has been considered advisable to frame a scheme which, while preserving Ministerial responsibility and that official control which will insure uniformity, precision, and exactness, and while insuring adequate supervision in the distribution of the funds, will invite the hearty co-operation of voluntary workers. With this object in view, it is . intended to constitute a Central Commission consisting of seven persons, including the Minister: These persons will be appointed by the Governor-General, and two out of the six members whom he will appoint are to be returned soldiers. The Commission will be a body corporate, capable of holding property of its own. It will have intrusted to it the power of recommending to the Government regulations for giving effect to this scheme. It will consider questions of policy, the nature of the grants which shall be made, the area over which they shall apply, and the conditions governing those grants. . All these matters will be set out in regulations to be submitted to the Governor-General for enactment. The Commission will also be a Board of Appeal. Any soldier who may be dissatisfied with the decision of a State Board may appeal to the Central Commission. </para>

                            <para>- The States have jurisdiction in land matters, but an appeal may be made in regard to any matter coming within the regulations and the jurisdiction of the Central Commission. What we desire is the harmonious cooperation of Governmental agencies, in order that the best possible result may be secured. The determinations of the Commission upon appeals are to be final. The Commission is also to act as a Board of Advice. </para>

The State Boards will consider, among) other things, the granting of money to returned soldiers, and the Local  Committees will see to the proper application of 'the grants within their respective districts. They will thus act as the agents and delegates of the State Boards. They will assist in questions of employment, and will be free to raise funds locally to supplement the grants made in their districts. </para>

                    <para>It is impossible to say at this juncture what repatriation will cost the Commonwealth. We do not know how long the war will last, nor do we know how many v returned soldiers will take advantage of this scheme. But I believe it to be the feeling of the people, that no matter what the cost, within reason, we must foot the bill. Therefore the Treasurer has provided for the advance to the States out of loan money of £2,000,000 to be applied to settling returned soldiers on the. land. </para>

This scheme is an earnest of the desire of the Government to give effect to the wishes of the people of Australia. Many of our soldiers relinquished good positions in civil life when they enlisted, and have made great sacrifices for their country. It is felt that the least the Commonwealth can do is to try to replace them in positions as good at least as those which they left. We hope to re-establish our soldiers in civil life so that they may in the future play their part in Commonwealth affairs as well as they could have done had they not gone to the war. </para>

                <para class="block">The measure does not involve a fundamental alteration of the law of naturalization, and, in order to understand its true import, perhaps I had better make a few observations upon the question of nationality itself. It is rather a delicate subject, and I think that honorable members will be more able then to appreciate what the Imperial position is, and what this Bill for the present contains, if I deal somewhat broadly with the general question. </para>
                <para>British nationality depends upon acquisition in various ways. A man may be a British subject by being born within the King's allegiance, which practically means within the limits of the Empire. It does not necessarily mean the Empire, because originally nationality arose out of personal loyalty to the Sovereign, and the limit of the Sovereign's royalty was not circumscribed by the portion over which he must necessarily rule - that is, the British Empire. I may say that protectorates do not come within the territory of the Crown for the purpose of nationality. It may be acquired also by the fact that a child of a natural-horn British subject born abroad is entitled to the position of a natural-born British subject. Then it may be acquired through a certificate or letters of naturalization, or through what are called letters of denization, which was the only method of acquiring nationality prior to 1844. It was a matter, as I have said, of allegiance to the King, and being a prerogative, the only way of acquiring the rights of a British subject except by birth was by getting an express grant under letters of denization from the Sovereign. But, in 1844, the statutory provisions came in, to which I shall make a short reference, later. Nationality may also come by marriage with a British subject or through parentage. The law as regards parentage is just a little conflicting, but the position at present in Australia is that an infant whose father obtained a certificate of naturalization, or whose mother, being a widow or divorced, obtained a certificate of naturalization, or whose mother was married to a natural-born British subject or to a person who had obtained letters of naturalization, and who during infancy resided in Australia with his parents, under our Naturalization Act of 1903 was regarded as a British subject. An anomaly arose in "connexion with that Act making provision that persons who had obtained certificates of naturalisation under State laws should be regarded as naturalized for the purposes of that Act, which I shall refer to later, and which is one of the matters dealt with in this Bill. Then nationality may be conferred through annexation, "that is, if a territory is effectively taken over during war; most of them at present are effectively taken by  our troops, but they are technically under military occupation. Through annexation, of which one of the chief evidences is a treaty of peace, the persons within that territory change their allegiance and become subjects of the Crown to which the territory is annexed. Then there are in cases some defects. There is the defect of local naturalization. I refer to this matter because an Imperial Act, as I shall show later, was passed in 1914, and an Imperial question as to whether we should not adopt some of its provisions arose, and is still under consideration. The defect of our naturalization is that we can only naturalize within the Commonwealth, so that if a naturalized person leaves the Commonwealth he immediately loses his nationality here ; and if, as in some cases occurs, he has lost the nationality of the place of his origin or birth, then he ceases to have any nationality, which under the circumstances of the war, perhaps,  is a mixed blessing. He becomes, in fact, an alien again. </para>

                    <para>It may be asked what are the privileges conferred by nationality.- There is the right to the protection of the Crown against the action of foreign countries, to be tried by British law in Consular Courts, wherever the provision as regards those Courts still holds ; if single, and desirous of becoming married, to be married in a foreign country under the Foreign Marriages Act of 1892.  There is also the right to hold a share in a British ship, and there are some- other matters to which I need not refer. Certain restrictions on the right to hold property were removed by an Imperial Act of 1870, but some have been restored by the local Legislatures of the States, because some' States, such as New South Wales, and,. I think, to an extent, Victoria, have passed Acts declaring that aliens cannot hold real property. I believe that Victoria does not even allow a transfer from an alien to take place, which- I assure honorable members is rather embarrassing. </para>

                    <para>The responsibilities of a British subject include liability to be tried, in Consular Courts, and if it is of  any interest to honorable members to know, British subjects who commit the offence of treason, murder, or - perhaps I am too  personal-  bigamy, and certain other offences abroad, have the responsibility of being tried when they get back to British Courts. They may also be extradited under treaties which apply to some countries. I mentioned also that nationality confers the right to the protection of the Crown wherever a subject is. We always hear the saying, " <inline font-style="italic">civis</inline><inline font-style="italic">Romanus sum."</inline> I should think that, under the conditions of this war, it has been impressed upon us by the might - developed under extraordinary circumstances, and still in reserve - of the British Empire that to call a person a British citizen has an international significance, which did nob quite attach to the term ' ' <inline font-style="italic">civis Romanus</inline><inline font-style="italic">wm ' '</inline> in the days of  Imperial  Rome. The protection is given, nevertheless, by courtesy. So that a person naturalized here who goes Home, or even to China, though he is not entitled to many of the statutory privileges of a naturalized person, or to any of them, as a fact, does get, as a matter of the beneficence of British rule, protection from the British flag or British diplomacy. </para>

                    <para class="block">Imperial Conferences at Home, and it may have retarded the adoption of the Imperial Act of 1914, or of the principles of that Act, which were mooted in some of the Conferences. Except as in sections of our Act, there is an express declaration made by a Statute, naturalization only creates a qualification, so that a person naturalized does not, apart from Statute, become an elector. He becomes qualified to become an elector in accordance with electoral laws. He does not acquire the right to emigrate to Australia in contravention of immigration laws. An alien has no right to land here, whether we passed an Immigration Act or not. Certain British subjects, as well as' aliens, cannot land in Australia because we make certain conditions as regards the class of immigrants  Who  are to come here, some being dependent upon colour, and some dependent upon character and other things. An alien cannot land so that, as in the case of <inline font-style="italic">A h Toy</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Musgrave,</inline> decided, I think, in 1889, when the Chinese Restriction Acts were found ineffective to stop about 265 Chinese who arrived by the <inline font-style="italic">African,</inline> an act of State stopped the coming in of those men, and the Privy Council, on appeal, decided that an alien had no right to land, and could be stopped without the provisions of an Act of Parliament, and that any remedy afterwards was to be obtained through diplomatic intervention. I said that until 1844 naturalization was conferred by the Crown, not under an Act of Parliament. In 1870 a most important Act was passed, and property restrictions upon aliens were abolished by Imperial law, the intention being ' to affect the United Kingdom only, though that provision was spoken of as being doubtful. An alien, therefore, can hold property unless there is some statutory provision to the contrary. Previously, by common law, he was disqualified from holding it. </para>

                            <para>- No. An alien can hold property under the Act of 1870. The common law provision was that he waa incapable of acquiring or holding property within the Empire, and the Act provided that the disqualification should not attach to aliens for the' future. It, the common law, also provided that a man could never shake off his nationality, or, if it is more comprehensive in another language - <inline font-style="italic">Nemo protest</inline><inline font-style="italic">exuere pasriam.</inline> No man can put off his nationality without the permission of the Crown. That principle was modified in 1870, by making provision for renunciation in certain cases, and also for becoming a British subject, where a person for some reason or other has lost his allegiance to the Crown. There was also a provision that, in order to get the certificate of naturalization, there should be five years' residence within the United Kingdom- That was found to be inconvenient to the colonies, because it meant that a man who emigrated after, say, three or four years' residence, lost 'his residential qualification. He also was obliged to make a declaration when he had been five years in residence, and applied for a certificate, that he intended to remain. I think that some objections were, or might have been, made by the Dominions on the ground that this had a tendency to interfere with immigration or migration within the Empire. That was one of the reasons which led to a modification of the provisions in the Imperial Act of 1914, which now provides that four of the five years' residence may be within the Dominions, and only one within the United Kingdom itself. The question of uniformity under the Act of 1914, to which those generalities lead me, was discussed in 1901 and in 1907, and again in 1917, by the Imperial War Conference. It was further considered by an InterDepartmental Conference in 1908, and I myself helped to shape the memorandum that arose out of it. The result of the last Conference on the subject, apart from the War Conference of 1917, was that after a great deal of discussion it was decided that certain principles should be expressed in an Imperial Bill which could be adopted by the Dominions. In effect, the compromise come to was that the term of residence might be made the same, five years; that a person should be of good character, have some knowledge of the English language - which was not required before - and that he must intend to reside within the Empire, or serve under the Crown. In Part II. of the English measure, which .contains a number of modifications of the law as to nationality, there are provisions which may be adopted by the </para>

                    <para class="block">Dominions, and under which a certificate holding good throughout the Empire may be granted, subject to local laws. That is the reason I mention that naturalization itself does not confer certain rights, bub a qualification for rights; and that principle has been  recognised in Part II. of the Imperial Act of 1914, in various provisions to which I had better refer. The resolution passed by the Imperial War Committee was - </para>
                    <para>The Conference recognises the desirability of securing uniformity of policy and action throughout the Empire with regard to naturalization. </para>
                    <para class="block">There was a memorandum prepared by the Home Office containing a suggestion that legislative changes shall be made only with the assent of all members of the Empire, and by legislative methods similar to those by which the Act of 1914 was carried ; and that separate legislation by any part of the Empire modifying the position in that Act was to be deprecated. </para>
                    <para>The reason I have not introduced a Bill to adopt Part II. of the Imperial Act is that in consequence of recommendations which were made by the Imperial Government, and adopted by the Imperial War Committee, there may be some fairly drastic alterations of that part of the Imperial Act, and these the Dominions will have to adopt in order to create the .power to issue a certificate of naturalization throughout the Empire. I, therefore, thought it better to wait until the communications now passing between the Dominion Governments and the Imperial Government, have been effective in making amendments acceptable to all. Further, it is possible that the matter may be one of the subjects of an Imperial Conference after the war. </para>
                    <para>The Imperial Act gives naturalization ' subject to local laws, and it provides also that there must be a knowledge of English, that children may be included in the certificate. - which was not .the case up to 1914 - that if the husband ceases to be naturalized, nationality may be taken from the wife, or if she is not so deprived of her rights as a subject through some' special circumstances, she may within six months make a declaration of alienage. </para>

Happily, we have not lost some of that primitive idealization which raises a woman to the level to which she is entitled. I speak with much sympathy on "this subject, because I was, I think, tie first man in the Empire elected by the suffrage of women, which shows that there is more in woman than some people think. That was at a by-election in 1896, after the first Women's Suffrage Act had been passed in Australia, and it restored me to political life as the representative of sanity. </para>

Such child, on attaining majority, may apply to resume. It is also provided that a British subject, on naturalization in another country, ceases to be British. At present the law is that a son born abroad of a natural-born British subject is British, and that the son of a naturalized British subject has equal rights. </para>

                        <para>The following considerations suggest  that  naturalization in the United Kingdom has  no  effect outside its borders: - (1) In  a  circular despatch of 10th September, 1874, the  Colonial  Secretary informed the colonial Governments that,  as  he was advised,  "a  certificate of naturalization granted under the authority of the Acts of 1844 or 1870 confers upon  an  alien no rights or privileges in  a  British colony." (2) The Committee of 1899  state  that the authorities are divided in opinion  as  to whether section 7 of the Act of 1870 confers upon an alien naturalized in the United Kingdom the status of  a  British subject outside the United Kingdom, either  in a  foreign country or in  a  British colony. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the point the honorable member referred to. It is an express declaration that our autonomy in this matter is absolutely unimpaired. The quotation is from the Act of 1914, but, as a matter of fact, provisions, implied if not express, to that effect existed in the Act of 1847 and the Act of 1870. Any doubt on the matter, however, was removed, not only by the opinion I have referred to, but by the express terms of the Imperial Act I have just quoted. Other parts of the Imperial Act, however, may apply in these Dominions, and may involve, perhaps unconsciously, a modification of the principle that you can never take away or derogate from  a  grant of self-government; in other words, that you can never, without the request of the particular parts of the Dominions affected, pass legislation to be operative within them, except as purely relating to some Imperial matter or matter affecting only the United Kingdom. </para>

                    <para>There is one inconvenience of the limitation of our power of local naturalization - that there is a disinclination on the part of foreign countries to take action on the question of double nationality ; to make provision such as exists between us and the United States of America, for instance, that one nationality goes as soon as the other is acquired. Foreign Governments may object, because any concession that they would get in return might have only a local application in particular parts of the British Dominions, and some of them, therefore, are not inclined to enter into a treaty such as we have had with other countries.

                        <para>The acquisition of a new nationality carries with it, theoretically, at least, the necessity to abandon the original nationality. But it must be stated that all States have not recognised yet that a subject of a State possesses the so-called innate or primordial right to renounce his allegiance. Germany still maintains the permanent character of nationality, even when her subjects have obtained effective nationalization in a foreign country, unless they have been authorized to change their nationality, and thus break the original bonds of allegiance. Allegiance is claimed by Argentina and Venezuela from their citizens, even when they have been naturalized in foreign countries. </para>

                    <para class="block">This, generally correct, may be affected by German legislation of 1913. The Bill provides, on the question of double nationality, that no certificate is to be issued unless the applicant renounces his other nationality. That may not be thoroughly effective, but in administration there will be additional provisions, including one to get over the difficulty created by the Delbruck (German) Act of 1913. That German nationality law makes the acquisition of a foreign nationality one of the causes of loss of German nationality, but provides, at the same time, that if the person naturalized abroad has, before naturalization, applied for and received the written permission of the competent authorities of his home State to retain his nationality, then his German nationality is not lost. That law' provides that a former German - even if he has not returned to Germany - may be granted direct Imperial nationality. It will be provided in administration - and power to make the provision is taken by this Bill - that we may take certain action in the terms of a recommendation made by the Aliens sub-Committee of the Imperial Reconstruction Committee, that if " every German applicant for naturalization is compelled to include in his memorial a statement that he has nob applied for or received, and does not intend to apply for, the permission of the authorities of his home State to retain his nationality, then the certificate granted to any such person who does in fact obtain that written permission, will have been obtained by false representations, and can at any time be revoked under Section 7 of the Act of 1914." </para>

                            <para>- We are not necessarily giving a right to naturalization. There are very few naturalized now, because naturalization is granted only in special cases that would lead to some difficulty, which, I am sure, honorable members would agree ought to be removed. I am dealing simply with the right to apply for naturalization. No right to get naturalization is conferred. That is a matter absolutely in the discretion of the Governor-General, and whether a certificate is granted or not rests with the Minister administering the Act. The German Act of 1870, I think, made provision - I have not seen it for two or three years - that a German could get his nationality revoked, and certificates are issued to show that he has done so. The reason was that America required a person to have got rid of his nationality of origin before he could become a naturalized American. </para>

                            <para>- I have to consider matters of that kind as Minister administering the law under which people are naturalized. The honorable member for Brisbane asked me just now what objections there are. I think on the whole that it is better to wait until we see what drastic amendments, if any, will be made by the Imperial authorities. They have not dealt even in the Act of 1914 with the question of double nationality, and I am putting in provisions which are .not in the Imperial measure. </para>

We are going to oblige him, by Act of Parliament, to renounce his nationality if he applies. In addition, he will make a declaration in the terms of the recommendation of the Aliens SubCommittee of tile Imperial Reconstruction Committee which I quoted just now. I was trying to point out that the reason I have not gone the full length of declaring that there must be evidence that a man has lost his nationality of origin before he cap acquire ours, was that the Imperial Act does not make that provision, and that communications are now passing between us and the Imperial Government which may lead to out introducing a full and comprehensive measure making provision for Empire naturalization, and making such other amendments as may be agreed upon between the Imperial Government and the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>We shall also oblige all future applicants for naturalization to advertise their" intention to' apply, and that will .afford opportunities to others to make recommendations against naturalization. The applicant must read and write English. In administration more conditions have been attached to naturalization than applied before the -war ; but, as a matter of Statute, only one certificate of character is obligatory, namely, from a justice of ' the peace, a police magistrate, a Stateschool teacher, or a police officer. The Bill provides for three certificates of character by three natural-born British subjects, two of whom must be householders and the other a justice of the peace, police magistrate, State-school teacher, or police officer. In addition, the oath of allegiance must be taken after naturalization is approved. </para>

                            <para>- A person might have a lease for 99 years, which is almost  equivalent  to a freehold. 'Section 3 of the Act of 1903 provides that a person who had, before the passing of that Act, obtained a certificate of naturalization from a State, or a colony which had become a State, shall be deemed to be naturalized. The effect of that provision is that, in some States, persons become naturalized under the Act, and in other States they do not. A person must have become naturalized under a certificate of naturalization, but a person might be a British subject through marriage, or by reason of being an infant of .a parent who became naturalized. Section 3 does not validate such naturalization if conferred under a State Act. That disability is removed by a re-draft of the section. In some States, such as New South Wales, the naturalization of " the parent carries with it the naturalization of the child, but that is not the case in South Australia. The Act provides that an infant whose father or mother, after widowhood or divorce, took out letters of naturalization, shall become naturalized, but if the mother's naturalization was effected through  marriage  the infant would not be naturalized. The Bill remedies, that state of affairs. I may here remark that some amendments on the draft of the Bill are still under consideration. I have not had time to circulate them to-day, but I will do so as soon as possible. There may be a doubt as to whether we should deal with' a measure such as this now, or defer it till a later period. </para>

                            <para>- I introduced the Bill in deference to the opinion, that we should have some provision against dual nationality. We are taking precautions in administrative practice, but I thought it would be better .to have a rule enforced by Act of Parliament. I merely mention that the provision in regard to infants is open for discussion, and if honorable members are opposed to it I shall not press it. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly it would in regard to some of the provisions. As a matter of fact, I could confer the opportunity of renunciation by administrative act, but in deference to Parliament, which has done so much in the way of procedure for naturalization, I thought that any substantial change ought to have the sanction of an Act of Parliament. For instance, here is a matter that requires to be dealt with by Statute. Under the present law we have power to revoke letters of naturalization only when they have been obtained by fraud. The Bill confers a general power of revocation, and in war time that may be very necessary. The Imperial Government are considering amendments in the same direction. But I find that they intend to confer power of revocation only for specific causes. I think the  clause in  the Bill is more effective than the British provision. However, whatever power is to be given in this regard must be conferred by Statute. Grants' of naturalization will be advertised so that 'the public may be aware, from moment to moment, of what is taking place. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not intend to ask the Minister to postpone consideration of this Bill, though I am not sure it is wise ito go on with a measure of this description until we have learned what action the Imperial Government propose to take on the general question of naturalization. Apparently the Government have come down with this as one of their Win-the-war measures, though I fail to see how it will bring the war to a successful termination a moment earlier than if it had not been introduced. It appears to be one of the " stopgap " Bills, brought in to engage the attention of honorable members while the Government are making up their minds with regard to the more ' important and serious matters, such as the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill, on the business paper, and in the discussion of which this House could be very well engaged. I followed the Minister's explanation of the Bill as well as I was able, and I could not help thinking that he was not expounding the principles of the Bill so much as engaged in dealing with the general question of naturalization. _ He did not explain the difference between this measure and the Act on our statute-book, and I regret that the usual memoranda were not prepared to show the effect of amendments proposed in the existing law. </para>

                            <para>- The provision, then, will make the matter of obtaining letters of naturalization rather more difficult than hitherto. When we passed the principal Act in 1903, shortly after the termination of the South African war, we rather prided ourselves, I think, on the fact that we were making naturalization as easy as possible. All honorable members who were in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth will remember how we approached the debate on this subject then. </para>

When I was working in the United States of America some years ago, I know that a large number of people came over from Europe, and' became naturalized. They . thought no more of it than of writing a letter. One day I asked a man, when he came back to work, what happened, and he replied - " An old bloke sat at the other side of the table, and repeated a whole lot of stuff to me, and said ' Queen Victoria ' and '  President  of the United States,' put up your right hand - one dollar." That was his idea of swearing allegiance to the  President  of the United States of America, and for swearing his allegiance to Queen Victoria. I presume that in the </para>

                    <para>In clause 5 I notice a provision that the Governor-General shall not issue the certificate until he has received from the applicant a certificate of a Justice of the High Court or a Judge of a Court of a State, or police, stipendiary, or special magistrate, that the applicant has before him renounced his allegiance to the country of which he was, at the time of his making his application, a subject.  I presume this provision is intended to prevent a repetition of what has been happening under the Delbruck law in regard to Germans seeking naturalization. After obtaining their certificate papers many of them went to their Consuls, and by entering into certain bonds were able to hold citizenship both of the country in which they were naturalized and of Germany. It seems to me that if they had been accustomed to do that in the past they cannot be trusted not to do it in the future. </para>

I am quite willing that the Minister should have the Bill passed, but I regret that we are unable to go on with those other measures which we were told are urgent as part of the Government's programme. It seems to me that this Bill is a commentary on the declaration of the Government that they were prepared to go on with legislation for winning the war. Instead of doing that they have brought down this Bill, the object of which is to set right one or two anomalies in our naturalization legislation. </para>

I gather, from what the Minister said, that for a long time the Imperial Government has discussed with Dominion conferences this question "of a uniform naturalization law throughout the Empire, but with the important reservation that the British authorities did not desire in any way, either directly or indirectly, to interfere with the legislation of the Commonwealth or any other Parliament in the self-governing portions of the Empire. It is sometimes suggested that there is an inclination in London to override our political* institutions, but there never was any ground for such a base and infamous statement. Naturalization in Australia in - pre-war times was as free as the air. I do not know whether both political parties desired to get as many votes as possible, but as far as I can gather, there has never been any  difficulty  in the way of foreigners, including Greeks, getting naturalization papers. That is' a very undesirable state of affairs. It has always been repugnant to me, as an Australian by adoption, that we have been so ready to barter away our political rights as Britishers, and when we are making an alteration in our naturalization laws we ought to bear this in mind. I do not want to speak dogmatically on this subject - I think it is just as well that this matter should be well debated by honorable members before final judgment is passed upon it - but it always struck' me that we made a very great mistake as Australians in allowing any foreigners to become naturalized while they 'still regarded themselves as subjects of the country which they were supposed to renounce.  A man cannot be a Frenchman and an Australian at the same time. I asked the Minister what was the naturalization law of France at the present time, and to my great surprise my honorable and learned friend did not seem to know. </para>

                            <para>- I have always assumed that the honorable and learned gentleman knows nearly everything, and that is why I was so much surprised that he did not appear to know this. My attention was called to this matter not very long ago, and I think that I may say that under the laws of France and Italy, as well as of the other European States, we may naturalize citizens of those countries all day long if we please, but the Governments of those countries will not recognise their naturalization here. The law of France goes, I think, a step further. I know it was stated not long, ago that some eminent military men in the American Army, because they happened to be of French descent, might, under the French naturalization law, be compelled to serve in the French Army if they visited that country. I can mention a case that came under my personal observation to show that the Italian law has some bearing upon the ownership of property. I am acquainted with a young Italian who was  naturalized  here under our free system. Some of his brothers and sisters are native-born Australians. He was himself born in Italy, and some time ago he went back to Italy to join the Italian Navy. He served in that navy for three years and then returned to South Australia, where he now resides. I saw him before he went to Italy and asked him why he did not join the English Navy or the Australian Navy since he belonged to us. He replied that if he did not return to Italy and join the Italian Navy certain property belonging to the family would be forfeited. </para>

                    <para>The Minister' made reference to the stringency of the Russian law, but I doubt if it is any more stringent than those of other European countries. So far as the naturalization of Germans is concerned, I suppose that no Britisher or Australian would in future take the word or the oath of a German who was prepared to swear that he would no longer be a subject of the German Empire. "We can leave the naturalization of Germans and Austrians out of the question, but it is still undesirable to deal with this matter at the present time. I suggest that the Government would do well to withdraw this measure until after the war. No doubt, the question with which it deals will, after the war, come up for consideration at conferences at which Australia will be represented, and some basic law on the subject of naturalization will be laid down. When the Imperial authorities have agreed upon the principles of a basic law dealing with the question, it will be time enough for us to take up the consideration of it. I confess that at this juncture it gives me no pleasure to criticise the provisions of the French law. It serves no good purpose at this time to mark the differences that exist between ourselves and our Allies on the subject of naturalization. I do not wish it to be inferred that I think that the present Government of France would seek to unduly interfere with Frenchmen or persons of French descent who have been naturalized here. The only point I wish to make is that they apparently claim the power to do "so under their own naturalization law. </para>
                    <para>I think that we should refuse to naturalize any foreigner unless the authorities of the nation to which he belongs admit his right to renounce his allegiance to it. I understood the Minister to say that he has already the powers he asks for under this Bill, except that it is proposed that every applicant for naturalization must now find three persons to certify to his character. Under the War Precautions Act the Government are able to prevent the naturalization of any persons whom they think should not be naturalized in the interests of the community. If we were living in normal times, there might be some justification for the . introduction of this measure, but these are not normal times, and as the Government have the extreme powers they require, and which, in my opinion, they have so far used with great judgment and wisdom, I think they may be safely allowed to continue the exercise of those powers and postpone the consideration of this question. If they think that the Bill should be gone on with, I shall give them my support as usual, but I prefer that it should be withdrawn, because the present is not an opportune time to deal with the subject of naturalization. It is admitted that the amendment of  the naturalization law' is held in suspense in the Old Country at present, and we should do no harm to hold it in suspense here until after the war. </para>

                        <para>.- The experience of the last three years has amply demonstrated that the necessity will arise for the revision of our naturalization laws. But I am entirely of the opinion that this is not the time to revise th'em. While the excitement of the war is upon us, and we have, certainly with good reason, a distorted view of the people of enemy countries, we are not in a proper frame of mind to view dispassionately the responsibilities of citizenship as applied to the people of either enemy, allied, or neutral countries. We have an undoubted partiality and friendly feeling towards the people of Russia, France, and Italy at the present time. Conversely we have, and quite naturally and properly, in view of the experience of the last three years, a hateful and unfriendly opinion of our enemies. But a very few years prior to the war our attitude towards our present enemies was just as friendly as it now is towards our Allies. Who will say that not long after the war we shall not be saying of the people of Russia, Italy, and France just what we now. are saying of the Germans? I am anxious that we should be as fair as it is possible for us to be, even in war time, even to those opposed to us. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, and for that reason I suggest that the consideration of this measure should be delayed until normal conditions are resumed. From the Australian point of view, the citizen of one country is as good or as bad as the citizen of another, and if we postpone the consideration of this question until the war is over, we shall be able to approach it with some judicial fairness. I listened most carefully to the second-reading speech of the Minister' for Home and Territories, and it gave me the impression that the Bill deals with a question of a highly technical character, more suitable for discussion by the legal than by the lay mind. One cannot but sympathize with the idea that, as far as possible, the naturalization laws of the various parts of the Empire should follow upon generally similar lines It is satisfactory to know that our local autonomy will not be in the least imperilled by any (Imperial Act which may be passed. </para>

                    <para>The Minister admitted that this Bill covered only a few anomalies, and that he has now a reserve of administrative power that enables him to deal with all these anomalies. In the circumstances I confess that I would much prefer to leave the administration of the naturalization law in the hands of the Minister, with the autocratic powers* which he now possesses, than to pass this Bill at this time to correct a few anomalies. Prior to the war, with very little questioning, we freely granted naturalization to all Europeans, and on the whole I do not think that our liberality in this connexion was greatly abused. The trouble we are in to-day is that the German and Austrian nations, whilst they allow their citizens to secure naturalization in other countries, do not relieve them of their citizen responsibilities to their own countries. It is the double nationality which has thus been brought about that is the cause of much of our trouble. The Russians are no better in that respect than are the Germans, and the honorable member for Hindmarsh has said that the French law is no better than the German law. It is within my own experience that during the present war the Russian Consul has demanded that Russians, naturalized citizens of this country, should go back to Russia to undertake military service there. He even went the length of asking employers of these Russians to dismiss them from their employment, so that he might be able to force them back to Russia to fight for that country. Either the naturalization of a Russian in Australia gives him Australian rights or it does not. </para>
                    <para>The ordinary layman entertains the view  that  once a man becomes naturalized, then, no matter from what country he comes, he is an Australian citizen, with all the rights, privileges, and protection guaranteed to Australian citizens. We have discovered, in an unfortunately lurid way, however, that many of the Germans who have settled in our country are still pledged to allegiance to their mother country, while at the same time they are pledged to give allegiance to Australia and its Government. We have to admit that very many of the Germans settled here have been excellent citizens, although a proportion of them have found the ties of blood-kinship stronger than those of their adopted citizenship in Australia. Obviously, such a position as that created when Germans, pledged to allegiance to this country, are pledged still to owe allegiance to their own country, cannot be tolerated. And to the extent that this Bill provides that men must appear before a Justice to renounce their allegiance to their original Government before they can be naturalized here, it is a necessary and proper safeguard. </para>
                    <para>I am wondering, however, what the future holds out for us in this respect. I want to talk without any special reference to Germans on the one hand or to Russians or French on the other. We have a tremendous tract of country, full of wealth and natural possibilities ; but we have to admit that, while the 5,000,000 people of Australia have done remarkably good work, have shown to the world what a virile, healthy, and vigorous people may do, at the present rate of progress we are a long way from effectively occupying and developing the country. We have to obtain more population, and the sooner we get it the better for the future of Australia. Next to the Australian-born citizen, I think it will be admitted that our own kith and kin from the British Isles are the most acceptable immigrants to this country. It is equally obvious, however, that after the war Great Britain will not have so many men available that she will be willing to part with many of them. Whilst we are told in the press that, after the war, the British Government will place no obstacle in the way of families emigrating to British Dominions, we can well understand that, for the sake of the safety and development of the Home Country, they will not offer them any special facilities. Even if they were prepared to do so, the number of emigrants from the British Isles would not mean very much in the aggregate. It would, of course, be of considerable assistance to Australia, but would not help us very much in the big development schemes that we ought to be undertaking. Where then are we to obtain citizens? We have decided that Africans and Asiatics shall not be allowed to come in. We believe that European peoples are suitable for the settlement of this country. </para>

                            <para>- I think some limitation should be placed on the number of southern Europeans entering Australia. The Germans as a whole, apart from their naturalization ideas, which we think; are entirely wrong, are much better colonists than are people from southern Europe. That I think has been proved. But there seems to be nothing but danger attaching to the admission of the people of any European country to the rights of Australian citizenship, so long as any authority holds over them allegiance to their Mother Country. </para>

                    <para>That brings me to the point that we cannot have two classes of citizens in Australia. The people must either be Australians or aliens. We must either assimilate or reject. At present, however, we have in Australia three classes of citizens. We have the honest, naturalized citizen, who is a genuine Australian - who has renounced his native country and takes no cognizance of what is going on there. Then, unfortunately, we have others - too many of them - who profess allegiance to Australia while in their hearts they hold allegiance to the enemy countries from which they come. Thirdly, we have the unnaturalized citizens, for whom I have no respect. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. In that connexion there is one class that the Minister might favorably consider.We have here a number of people. - mostly elderly - who came from European countries in the early days, and who, while naturalization was dealt with by the State authorities, neglected to take out - or, for some reason, were misled in regard to the securing of - naturalization papers. There are some people who came from Schleswig-Holstein at an historical period. </para>

                            <para>- Some of them entered State Parliaments,- but after naturalization was taken over by  the  Commonwealth they discovered that they had failed tlo take out naturalization papers. Some consideration might well be extended to these people. They were neglectful, no doubt, bub were honestly misled by the fact that they were exercising all the rights and privileges of citizenship, although they were without the piece of paper which guaranteed them naturalization. There is at the back of our minds one fact that we cannot forget. We denounce Germany, and rightly so, for her dishonorable conduct in regard to the Belgium treaty. We denounce her for having treated as a mere " scrap of paper " the sacred promise which she, with other nations, gave to Belgium. We need to be careful, however, that we do not fall into the same error. There is in this country too big a tendency to treat as mere scraps of paper, liable to be torn up at any time, our guarantees to people of enemy birth who have become naturalized. We ought to 'take up an honest attitude. </para>

                    <para>My feeling is that there should be in our Naturalization Act a provision  that,  in the event of war between the British Empire and any other country, then people from that country who have been naturalized here shall automatically lose their citizenship rights, in Australia until the war is over. Here to-day we are differentiating in a way 4han is causing a considerable amount of uneasiness, and which is neither correct nor just. There are in Australia some people who hold, naturalization papers which guarantee to  them  the rights of Australian citizenship, and they are exercising those rights and privileges. There are others, however, who have been deprived of them. Any man. whether he be an alien or a naturalized citizen, who is obviously disloyal, or who can be proved tlo be disloyal to the King or the country at such a time as this, can have no sympathy extended to him. But it should either be a case of "all in" or "all out." It is impossible to be just in your differentiation. It would be a far more understandable position if we declared in our naturalization laws that where, for any unfortunate reason, the British Empire comes into conflict with any other power, then people who have come from that country, and who hold naturalization papers here, shall automatically lose their citizenship rights while the war is on. That would relieve us of much difficulty, such as we have had during the present war. </para>
                    <para>On the occasion of the Military Service Referendum, we deprived of the right to vote thousands of Australian citizens against whose loyalty nothing could be said, bu'b who were under suspicion of disloyalty because they had been born in' enemy countries. During the last election, there was another deprivation of citizenship rights because these people happened to have been born in enemy countries. If that can be justified - and in some instances it can be absolutely justified - iti would be more honest to recognise that, whether these people be responsible or. not, the call of the blood, the call of country, is the strongest in human nature. If we were in an enemy country to-day, our sympathies would still be with our own country. It would be a shameful thing if they were not. How then,- can we complain of 'these people, who were born in an enemy country, because they have some sympathy with their own land ? </para>

The only feature of .this Bill that seems to me to make it worth while passing is  that  it provides that every person who,- in the future, seeks naturalization in Australia must, in a legal, special, and particular manner, renounce his ' allegiance to his native country. </para>

                    <para>I do not suggest that we should close the door too tightly against those who wish to come to Australia. If our naturalization he lightly given it will be just as lightly held. What people ob- - tain easily they value least. I do not suggest that we should slam the door in the face of either Germans on the one hand, or Russians on the other, of either Italians on the one hand or Austrians on the other. But we have every reason to be careful that we do not extend to anybody and everybody in the free and easy fashion of the past, the rights of citizenship. I' think there is some reason for making rather more stringent legislative provisions in regard to naturalization than we have made hitherto. If the people of other nations understood clearly that when they came to Australia they could get citizenship rights only by renouncing their allegiance to their own country, and knew that those citizenship rights would be suspended in time of war, they would know exactly where they were, and we would know exactly where we were. At the present time, however, our Naturalization Act seems to be in a sort of " come easy, go easy " position. Then the Bill provides that in the future a fee shall be charged for naturalization.. </para>

                            <para>- But persons who desire to take out naturalization papers will necessarily be subjected to disabilities which will involve them in a certain amount of expenditure. I do not suggest that we should adopt the American system of granting naturalization to anybody who is prepared to pay one dollar for the privilege. The Minister did not mention what is the purpose of this fee, nor did he specify its amount. In my judgment, the amount of the fee ought not to be prescribed by regulation. It should be embodied in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>I do not think that the anomalies which the measure is intended to correct warrant us in tinkering with such an important question as naturalization. The matter is one which is bound to crop up in the near future. Imperial Conferences that have already been held have realized its importance, and the difficulties surrounding it, and we might well have left it to be dealt with by another Imperial Conference. After all, the Australian view of this matter is practically on all fours with the view that is. entertained by other British Dominions. We are all practically in the same boat, and what will appeal to one will largely influence the others. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the Minister has some inside information on this matter. But I do not think there will be the slightest objection to a mutual recognition between Australia and New Zealand of their naturalization papers and rights. That is one of the things which will tend to draw New Zealand and Australia closer together. Our interests in the Pacific are so mutually advantageous that it seems to me it would be wise for us to cultivate every kind of reciprocal arrangement that is possible with New Zealand, conserving at the same time our own particular interests. I hope that when this matter again comes under review the Minister will consider how far we may meet the other parts of the Empire in a mutual arrangement under which naturalization rights will be uniform throughout. </para>

                            <para>- Nobody would regard the honorable member as a foreigner. He would be branded as a Hottentot. I agree with the honorable member for Brisbane that the mere act of naturalization will never remove from the man who naturalized his love of his country or the allegiance which he feels he owes to that country. Now, of all countries in the world, Germany has the most up-to-date and the best naturalization law of its kind, because it says to its citizens, "Before you leave Germany, if you wish to naturalize in another country, you have the opportunity of denaturalizing here." It is about the only country in the world which has a denaturalization law. But when a man has once denaturalized, he is regarded as a foreigner if he returns to Germany. </para>

                            <para>- The generally accepted law of the nations of Europe is that they own the citizens who leave their country for three generations. The Germans hold that, the French hold it, and the British hold it. As an illustration, let me relate an incident which occurred during the Franco-Prussian war. The French attempted to conscript a Paris solicitor who had never been out of that city and who could not speak a word of English. To all intents and purposes he was a Frenchman. When the authorities endeavoured to put the conscription law into force against him, he said, "I am a British subject." He said it in French. Their answer was, " Your father was born in Paris." "Yes," he replied, "but my grandfather was an Englishman who was not naturalized in France, and the British naturalization law claims me as a British subject." The matter was referred, through the British ambassador, to the British Government, and it declared the man to be a British subject, and, as such, not liable to the French conscription law. </para>

                            <para>- What does that matter? The fact that some Germans have had the right to vote in this country since the war broke out has been a curse. to it. There should have been no such thing as a " German vote." If Germans wish to exercise the franchise, let them vote in Germany. We might well give foreigners living here the ordinary rights and privileges of citizenship excepting the franchise, allowing them the right to vote only after they have been naturalized, when by the evolution of time, their own country has no longer any claim on them. I have heard it said that Australian-born Germans have acted worse in some cases than naturalized persons born in Germany. </para>

                            <para>- I would not formulate a rule from my small knowledge of Australian Germans, but I know of cases such as I have referred to, and the honorable gentleman has seen reports in the newspapers showing that some of those born in Australia of German parents have displayed greater antipathy to Great Britain than persons born in Germany. I know of Australian-born Germans of the honorable member's own constituency, who are fighting in the German army against us. No doubt they hope to return to this country when the war is over, thinking that their action will not be known, and that they can resume the rights and privileges of Australian citizenship. </para>

                            <para>- When the war is over different ideas will prevail. Our Allies of to-day have been our bitter enemies in the past. No one can foretell the future. But I believe in the good old Scotch precept, " When you are in it, you are in it for all you are worth." The Germans being our enemies to-day, it is our business to get them " down and out " as soon  as we can. We should not allow foreigners to be naturalized too easily. We should fill this country, so far as we can, with people of our own race, so that we may have a homogeneous people. We shall still have our differences, as they have in the home of the race, but our ideals, our standards of life, our hopes and aspirations will be the same. It may take longer to fill the country with our own people than with foreigners, but we shall thereby avoid difficulties such as those with which they are at present beset in America, where you hear of " GermanAmericans," and there is the fear that a. large, force may be raised in the country itself to destroy the State. We shall act unwisely if we fill this country with foreigners, having ideals and manners of life quite different from our own. . </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with a great deal that has fallen from the lips of the honorable member for Henty. I have, perhaps, more knowledge of Australianborn Germans than any other member. I know that a workman's club has sent many of its young men to fight on our side. No objection was raised against them, because they went as privates. I know another German who tried to make his name rhyme with the glorious Scottish name of Bruce.  His  real name is Bruche, and he is a man whose word I would not trust. When examined by a Commission consisting of members of this House, he absolutely sought to deceive us. </para>

                            <para>- He, instead of being dismissed, was sent to the Front. On oath he declared that he could not give the name of the house in which he lived, until a young man, who had the misfortune to bear an Irish name, and who had come under the lash of his cowardly cruelty, reminded him. He left Western Australia and went to Adelaide, being wise enough to take a Scotch name. Within a week he was raised from the rank of private. Later he had to return to Western Australia for a rest. The infamy was so great that the Defence Department held an inquiry into the matter. This Bruche is now an officer at the Front,, although the Commander-in-Chief has been told that he is of German parentage. I, with others, brought a matter under the notice of the Minister for Defence. I was simply asked to' join the body of gentlemen because I belonged to the then Labour Party, and the satisfaction we got was that the man was withdrawn from the West. When Bruche was in the witness box and young O'Donnell asked him if he remembered the name of the house he lived in, he said ''No." "Was it Breslau ?" he was asked, and he said " Yes." When he was faced with a description of his office where the young man interviewed him, and where he said that he never saw him, he admitted everything. O'Donnell asked Bruch e if he could possibly be in that place without the permission of the officer in charge, and Bruche said "No." " Could I have got in there in the daytime or at night-time?" asked O'Donnell, and Bruche said "No." O'Donnell then said, "Do you know anybody else who has never been in your room and who has described the room as I have?" and Bruche said " No." O'Donnell was there. Luckily he got a chance. I believe that he has received a commission, and gone to the Front, in spite of three German men who were officers there. Who were they ? Bruche, Buttner, and Strenke; but, of course, they were officers. Their action recalls that swell German doubledealer who, swearing the oath of naturalization, taking the name of Edwards, and then joining the Automobile Corps, and, I believe, also the Intelligence Department, to learn every road in Victoria in case of need, was allowed to resign from the Army and Navy Club, that club of frills and feathers. He was interned, is allowed £600 a year, and is the "boss cockie," spending the money.  Colonel Monash,  reaching the rank of  Colonel, although  never having volunteered for the Boer War, did not ask for him to be expelled from the Army and Navy Club, but he did ask for the expulsion of a man who had the pluck to go to the Cape and fight, and was honored by the British Government with the disposal of over £9,000,000 of money. Of course, he was not a friend of  Colonel Monash, Colonel Hughes,  nor  Colonel Burston.  These others are men of high rank. One high officer says that if God spares his life, when he and his mates, come over here he will have an inquiry held.  Colonel Monash  earned the name in Gallipoli of being the " Sand-bag General." </para>

He is debarring women of the rights which men have - not wilfully on his part, but, if I may say so, through following too closely the example of England, which has always been brutal in her treatment of the weaker sex. A woman is treated in England as only a chattel belonging to man. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to link up my remarks with the fact that that is how naturalization is not granted there to women in the same way as it is granted to men, and how a woman sacrifices her nationality by marrying a foreigner. I maintain that if an Australian woman honours a foreigner by marrying him, she is a full citizen, and the fact should naturalize him and make him an Australian. Surely if a foreigner is worthy of a good Australian girl's liking and desire, he is good enough to be an Australian, other things being equal? Oh, no! The wife becomes a foreigner, and I resent that fact, as I believe every honest man in our community does. If a woman was unfortunate enough to marry an alien enemy from, say, Germany, she was immediately deprived of her rights and made a German. God never made her a German, but man's law does. This Bill still carries on that infamy. When we reflect that in England only one man out of three is entitled to a vote, we must recognise that the old Roman law making a woman subservient to man is carried down to its utmost limit. </para>

                    </continue><para> Time was in Victoria when we used to charge a sovereign to naturalize a person, and then, if he only went over the Murray to New South Wales, he had to become naturalized again. Further, if he went to Queensland, or to New Zealand, he had to be naturalized again. That absurdity I tried to break down in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and succeeded so far that we reduced the naturalization-fee from £1 to 2s. 6d., but the naturalization was only good within the confines of our little State. That further absurdity, by the wisdom of the Commonwealth . Government, has been abrogated and any foreigner who is naturalized in a State is a full naturalized Australian citizen. I understand that since 1st January, 1915, such persons are entitled to naturalization in Great Britain and Ireland. </para><interjection>

Sons came out to Australia, and with the easier justice which our laws gave to them, they wonder sometimes when they write to England and find that members of their family are still foreigners there through the inability of their parents to afford that sum of money. I wish to use that as an argument against the last clause of this Bill, to which the honorable member for Brisbane drew attention. This clause, paragraph 6, proposes to omit from section 12, sub-section 2. of the original Act, the words, " not be liable to any fee or charge in respect thereof," and to insert in their stead the words, " be charged such fee as is prescribed." Section 12 provides that a person to whom a certificate of naturalization is issued shall not be liable to any fee or charge therefor, and I hope that the Minister will see his way not to press the proposed amendment. </para><interjection>

Further, I hope that we shall hold out the hand of fellowship to New Zealand, and seek for some reciprocity in this matter. I should here like to thank the Minister for, in this connexion, having rendered justice to a man who was placed in a very critical position. In the New Zealand letters of naturalization, the place of birth of the man or woman is not always shown, and difficulties will arise sometimes that are almost insuperable unless one can obtain the sympathetic help of the Minister in charge. Clause 4 of the Bill provides that a person who was, before the passing of the measure, naturalized in a State, or in a Colony which has become a State, shall be deemed to be naturalized, and I suggest that it would be well to here insert the words " including New Zealand." Whether New Zealand will reciprocate is beside the question. The people of the Dominion come from the same four little Kingdoms, which are holding aloft the standard of liberty in the northern seas, and we could well offer them the clasp of friendship. We all recognise that if the dominion of the Pacific should pass away from the United States and Australia, we should certainly go down, unless the flag of New Zealand were kept flying. The small courtesies of life frequently make existence more endurable and pleasurable, and, with all due deference, I suggest the amendment I have indicated. </para><para>The English law is - </para><quote>

                        <para>. -  No doubt a good deal of the Bill might be dealt with by administrative act, but there are some clauses that- remove anomalies. For instance, a woman may be a British subject in New South Wales but not throughout the Commonwealth, owing to the way section 3 of the Act of 1903 is drafted, and I am removing that anomaly. There is no power, except for fraud, to revoke certificates of naturalization in war time. It has been considered expedient by the Imperial Government, although they have not amended their own Act yet, and we ought to consider it expedient also, to take power in special circumstances to revoke letters of naturalization. That power is taken by the Bill. I mentioned the precautions that we have taken as regards grants by compelling advertisement's to appear in the newspapers, and thus giving generally to persons the opportunity to make representations against naturalization, which will be considered by the Minister before any grant is made. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The main point raised during the discussion was as to the laws of other countries, and I might refer honorable members to what the position really is. The honorable member for Hindmarsh spoke about the French law. This, I think, has been amended on some points since the war, but not on any points pertinent to this debate. I remember that at the beginning of the war a proposal was submitted to the French Parliament to 'take power to cancel naturalization, but it had a limited application. It applied practically only to men convicted of disloyalty, or criminals. There was a discussion in the French Chamber on the matter of revocation of certificates of persons of enemy origin who preserved their former nationality, but I am not sure whether a Bill was passed or not. It has also been suggested that in some cases a provision such as we are putting in this Bill might be incorporated as regards German nationality, but generally in France if a French subject goes abroad and gets naturalized he loses his French nationality, and that practically is the Continental system. In the last edition of Wheaton's <inline font-style="italic">International Law</inline> it is stated that a Frenchman may, by the ' law of France, divest himself of his nationality in several ways, amongst which are the following: - (1) By naturalization abroad; (2) by accepting a public office under a foreign- Government without permission of his own Government; (3) by accepting military service under a foreign Government without the authorization of his own Government, but) here he remains subject to penalties to which he may be liable under French law, while emigration, with a view to evading military service, will also subject the emigrant to penalties if he returns to France within  a  certain period. France is therefore now  practically in the British position of declaring that where a French subject has become naturalized .abroad there cannot be double allegiance. He ceases to owe allegiance tb France, but if by leaving and getting naturalized he has evaded the law of military service, he will be liable to military service if they get him within the jurisdiction again. </para>
                    <para>I looked up' the German law three years ago, but the subject includes such a mass of detail that one cannot recall all the little differences. In 1870 Germany passed an Act that a man leaving might get a cancellation of his German nationality. That was the time when there was a recasting of the rules and laws regarding naturalization in some countries of Europe, and it was then that our Imperial Act of 1870 was passed. That German Act provided that a man might cancel his nationality on condition that he must  get naturalized with some other country within six months. This was probably to enable Germans to become citizens of the United States of America. The United States of America practically provide for what I am providing in this Bill - they oblige a man to renounce his nationality. </para>

                    <para>The United States Act of 1906 provides that a man desiring to be naturalized in the United States of America shall " declare an oath, before the clerk of any Court authorized by this Act to naturalize aliens, or his authorized  deputy,  in .the district in which such alien resides,  two years at least prior to his admission, and after he has reached the age of eighteen years, that it is his <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> intention to become a citizen of the United States of America, and to renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign Prince, Potentate, State, or Sovereignty, and particularly by name to the Prince, Potentate, State, or Sovereignty of which the alien may at the time be citizen or subject." I have adopted that in this Bill, because we compel' a man now, before be can be naturalized here, to renounce his allegiance to a foreign State, but you can never completely cancel his allegiance to a foreign State,  except  by a treaty arrangement with that State, and we are not in a position to get those treaties made now. I am endeavouring, however, to go as far as I possibly can, and that is the reason this Bill is introduced. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the renunciation provided by Act, I shall provide by departmental regulation or procedure, that the applicant for naturalization must make a declaration that he is not going to take advantage of such an Act as the  Delbrück  Act' of 1913, under which a German citizen, who may have lost his nationality by dismissal, by absence for ten years from Germany, or by any other reason, may get his nationality restored, and also that he will not attempt to put his name on the consular books to preserve his nationality after he has come here, or before he has left, Germany. I have gone as far as constitutional or international procedure will permit to attain the end we desire - that is, to prevent double allegiance being possible here. </para>

                            <para>- There is a provision in the Germein Act of 1870 which permits "that to  be done. The British Act of 1914 contains a provision that the moment a man becomes naturalized in another country he loses his British nationality. German legislation provides .the same thing, but the Act of 1913 allowed a man to enter his name on the consular books, or in the books of some of the home authorities in Germany, before he felt, to retain his nationality. </para>

The rule in 1870 was that no man could divest himself of his nationality. Once a British subject always a British- subject. Britain has been, the quickest nation to respond to what are considered the more liberal ideas in regard to naturalization. Germany has been slower, but to some extent has followed our lead by allowing in certain the divestment of nationality. According te Wheaton - </para>

The limitation of this Bill' is not a limitation of desire but a limitation of necessity, because of the absence of power. </para>

                    <para>I do not wish to weary honorable members by quoting the laws of Europe, but practically the same position obtains throughout Europe, namely, that by naturalization abroad nationality is lost ; but conscript nations provide that their subjects cannot by naturalization abroad evade the military law. Britain, with a higher ethical perception, has declared that immediately a British citizen becomes naturalized abroad he loses his nationality and has no further obligation to the British flag. We are not going to hold on to men who are traitors by action,, whatever class of men they may be. The British Empire has. shown its capacity to fight under the most extreme difficulties for a noble ideal, and with the most effective application of moral force. That redounds to our credit. Realizing our position in the Empire, I am proposing to go as far as our legislative power will permit to remedy the defects of foreign law. The second reading of this Bill was brought on sooner than I expected, and I have not had time to circulate the modifications I shall propose to two of the clauses. </para>

But the provisions in the Bill now before us do not to any extent interfere with what the Imperial Government might do in that regard. They are rather an advance in some directions, and for that reason I thought it better to submit the best amending law that is possible in the circumstances. </para>

                        (Angas- Minister for think it would be wise to make that addition because the Bill aims at correcting anomalies in our own legislation. When we bring in a more elaborate Bill the evil referred to may be cured. Naturalization throughout the Empire will be conferred when we adopt the Imperial Act.. -New Zealand naturalization stops at New Zealand, and I do not think we have power to declare it effective in Australia, though there may be doubt on this point. It will be a pity to insert a provision as suggested, in this clause. Our existing law provides that persons naturalized through certificates of naturalization are naturalized for the purposes of our Act of 1903. That is to say, naturalization effected in any of the States is deemed to be effective, but some people were naturalized not under certificates of ' naturalization, but by marriage, with the result that a woman under the New South Wales naturalization law may be a naturalized British subject in that State, but not in Victoria, unless she became naturalized under our Act. It was to cure that anomaly that this modification was adopted. I ask the honorable member not to introduce any extraneous matter with the object of arranging that naturalization in New Zealand shall be effective here. The conditions in the Dominion are different, and we have no diplomatic arrangements to accomplish the end sought, but as soon as the more comprehensive Bill is brought  in, this may be done.

                            <para>.- The difficulty mentioned by the Minister could be overcome by inserting- a new clause providing that any one holding naturalization papers for New Zealand should be entitled <inline font-style="italic">ito</inline> receive Commonwealth naturalization papers. Prior to the passing of our principal Act there were different naturalization laws in all the States, with the result that while a man might be a British subject in Victoria, he would be regarded as a foreigner in New South Wales. We wiped that ridiculous anomaly out when we passed our principal Act, and I want now to see reciprocal legislation with regard to New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like a statement from the Minister indicating how many newspapers it is proposed that an applicant for naturalization shall advertise in. I have also looked through our Invalid and Old-age Pensions, War Pensions, and Electoral Acts which contain similar provisions concerning officials who may witness certificates to see in what respect this Bill differs from them. When I was Minister for Customs I was permitted to fill up pension forms for people I had known for a number of years, but I was not allowed to witness their signatures, though any officer of the Customs Department was so authorized. An applicant may have no difficulty in obtaining a certificate of character from two householders, but he may not be sufficiently well known to either a justice of the peace, a postmaster, a teacher of a State school, or an officer of the police to expect such a certificate from either of them. </para>

                        <para>. - Under these proposed new sections provision is made for requiring certificates of character in support of an application for naturalization, and these should be supplied by a special class. They will not merely witness a declaration, but will establish identity and certify as to knowledge. I do not think that in the administration of the law any difficulties have arisen as a result of the restriction as to the persons to whom the applicant may appeal in support of his application. I may inform the honorable member for Yarra that, in some cases, men of the highest standing have given certificates of character in the case of a number of applications, which I have still thought it necessary to refuse. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to a provision in the proposed new section 6a, which is only too painfully like some of the provisions that have been inserted in our War Precautions Act. It is a provision by which any person may make representations of a secret character against an applicant for naturalization. The proposed new section expressly says that - </para>

                    <para>So far so good, but there is this sub-clause 3 of the proposed new section - </para>
                    <para>The contents of any statutory declaration filed with the Minister in pursuance of this section shall not be disclosed to any person without the consent of the person making the declaration other than for the purpose of a prosecution for perjury. </para>
                    <para>It will be seen that the person making the declaration is amply protected, whilst no protection whatever is given to the person against whose character that declaration is secretly directed. I have always opposed, and I hope I shall always continue to do so, the recrudescence of the systems of the- middle ages, in regard to these matters under which a person's character may be secretly impugned. He never knows his detractor, nor what is contained in the document by which he may be injured. This document becomes filed as a permanent record in the public offices, and remains there for all time. No matter what precautions may be taken to secure its secrecy, it may injure an innocent person, whilst it always remains on record against him. That, in my opinion, is most unfair. </para>

                    <para>. - I have re-drafted this clause. The clause as it stands provides for children being naturalized through their parents. As I said earlier in the evening, that was the law in some of the States, such as <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South. Wales, but not in others, as, for instance, South Australia. Under it, a man thirty  years of age, whose father took out a certificate of naturalization, would become naturalized because of that fact. I propose so to amend the clause that it will apply to only such persons as are born of parents who became naturalized during the infancy of such persons. It is a slight modification, and will be more consistent with the object of the Bill. I move - </para>

                        <para>- It is an amendment by way of an addition to the clause. As a matter of fact, a somewhat similar provision has been embodied in the Imperial Act. When I saw that honorable members were inclined to favour a more extensive measure, I thought it advisable to insert this amendment. Its effect is to provide that if a man loses his nationality the Governor-General may declare that his wife also loses it. Rut unless there be reason for taking action, this power will not be exercised. Otherwise, the nationality of the wife will remain unchanged. </para>

                    <para>.- This would have been a convenient place to introduce a very necessary amendment but for the fact that the Minister has informed us of his intention to bring forward a larger and more far-reaching measure dealing with naturalization at an early date. At the same time, I cannot allow this Bill to pass without reprobating the present condition of the law in regard to the rights of married women. As most honorable members are aware, a  woman's nationality is that of her husband, and a very glaring instance of the gross injustice of that arbitrary survival from mediaeval times was afforded the other day, when the Minister himself published the numbers of the persons to whom naturalization papers had recently been granted. One of these individuals was a German, and people were naturally led to inquire under what circumstances we would grant naturalization rights to a German at the present time. The person in- question was a woman who had married a German some twenty years ago, and had thus acquired his nationality although she herself was British born. Her husband has been dead for many years, but the nationality of this British-born lady persists as German. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Minister recognises the absurdity of the existing condition of affairs, and I hope that when the wider measure foreshadowed by him is submitted for our consideration this anomaly will be removed. It certainly will not be satisfactory to me if I am then informed that we cannot proceed in advance of British legislation. Of course, I quite recognise that in this matter we are bound to some extent by British legislation, because' it is an international matter. But I do hope that the Minister will effect this most necessary reform in our naturalization laws, which have long been the subject of protest by thinking women as well as men - even if necessary to the extent of making representations to the Imperial authorities. </para>

                    <para>.- A person desiring letters of naturalization may be required to advertise in perhaps half-a-dozen newspapers, as well as pay a prescribed fee. We prided ourselves, when the Act of 1903 was passed, on having made naturalization free. The trouble in South Africa was caused greatly by the annoyance to Britishers of the Boer restrictions on naturalization. </para>

                <para>My desire is that we should hold out the right hand of friendship to the Dominion of New Zealand. It. is foolish, and almost idiotic, to require a person who has become a British subject by naturalization in New Zealand to reside two years here before he can apply for naturalization under our law. As I pointed out earlier, prior to Federation a person who had been naturalized in Victoria, if he crossed into New South Wales, could not exercise the privileges of citizenship until he had lived there for a certain time, and had been naturalized under the New South Wales law. The pursuit of work might have compelled such a man to go on to Queensland., and there further naturalization would have been required ; and so with the other States. </para>

                        <para>- The interjection reminds me of an incident following a big colliery accident Some were praying and speaking of their sympathy with the women and children who had been bereft of their breadwinners, when a man said, " I do not know much about prayers, but this is my sympathy," and planked down all the money that he had in his pocket. We may have, by-and-by, reciprocity with New Zealand in the matter of old-age pensions. Any one naturalized in the Home Land, in any of its four kingdoms, can exercise the rights of a British subject throughout the British Empire. I do not object to any altering of my phraseology, and I am willing to accept an amendment that will provide for the production of letters of naturalization from New Zealand giving the right to apply for letters of naturalization in Australia without any condition. as to residence.. </para>

                    <para>.- I look upon this proposal as one which is designed for the benefit of the whole of the British Empire. The party to which I belong has always shown a proper spirit in these matters. I ask honorable members opposite to consider what is the intention of the phrase, "one people, one destiny." In my opinion, the Government will be very unwise indeed if they do not accept the amendment. It is within the realm of reason, and in accordance with those democratic ideals which the nations at large are endeavouring to formulate. The real meaning and -object of the present war is. to secure the government of the people by the people. Therefore, I cannot understand the Ministerial opposition to this proposal. I feel satisfied that in time New Zealand will acknowledge naturalization papers issued in Australia. It is our duty, I submit, to enact this proposal, and so teach the people of New, </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Zealand what is the real meaning of democratic government. Honorable members opposite really ought to be falling over each other to .support the. amendment. Certainly the 'hour is late, but no matter how late it .is, the duty of the! House is to legislate in accordance with the spirit and the intention of those who Bent us 'here. It is all very well for tha Minister to tell us that by and by he is going to bring down some great measure. If honorable members understand why they are sent here, they will, seize the first opportunity to legislate in accordance with the desire of the people, and not wait for something to turn up. We were not sent here to adopt a Micawber style of doing business, but to carry proposals of this character. Many of our supporters, of course, do not expect liberal legislation to emanate from the present Government, but we ought to sit here, even if we -should have to sit all- night, to enforce the will of the people and oppose the Conservatives on the other side, who seem to think that they possess all wisdom. We on this side are displaying the broad liberal spirit which is supposed to characterize English legislative bodies.. I ask the Government to assist the honorable member for Melbourne to get this principle enacted. I have been in New Zealand, and I feel confident that if the amendment is adopted, the people of that Dominion will clap their hands, to-morrow morning when they read in the press that the legislators of Australia are so liberal minded. Honorable members who sit on this side are the true leaders of Democracy. It was we who legislated in accordance with those noble principles which  we hope will, as the outcome of the war, become, universal. It is our duty to inculcate into the minds of honorable members opposite the knowledge which we possess. If this amendment is rejected, they will feel sorry that they did not fall iu with the views of the honorable member for Melbourne. However, this is a serious matter about which we should not joke. If these persons are considered worthy of naturalization in New Zealand, it is an insult to the people of New Zealand to refuse naturalization here. </para>
