        <para>Mr.GROOM. - The other day the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Page)</inline> asked some questions regarding the cost of recruiting in the several States. I promised to get the information, and to make it available as soon as possible, and I now lay on the table a statement showing the details of expenditure on recruiting for the period from the 1st January, 1917, to the 30th June, 1917. The figures relating to the 3rd Military District differ slightly from those given in answer to a question by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Heitmann),</inline> but the cost per recruit for each of the States is unaffected. </para>

        <para>I asked for returns, and there was a general impression that full information would be given; but when a question was asked, it was laughed  off  with a statement of the number of sheep, tons of sugar, and bushels  of  wheat in  store...... He (the Prime Minister) said that the returns arrived too late. That is  a  reflection on officers engaged in important duties. . </para>
        <para>I have obtained a report from the Department in which it is stated that - </para>
        <para>At the  beginning  of July,  1915,  a monthly census was  taken  of the food  supplies  in Australia.

        <para class="block">These returns came to hand from month to month until January of this year. The information contained in the replies was tabulated, and was generally available about a month, sometimes longer, after the date up to which the return was prepared. </para>
        <para class="block">In answering the questions of the honorable member for Maribyrnong, I merely stated the facts, and he should have accepted my statement. He may be of opinion that the practice of making these returns should be continued, but that is another matter. I told him that the Government were considering the question. We are doing so. </para>

          <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation, since the Prime Minister has endeavoured, perhaps unintentionally, to show that I have done something which is not quite regular. The questions I have asked in regard to the Colonial Wool Combing and Weaving Company and its list of shareholders are the outcome of a report that a member of the Central Wool Committee is largely interested, financially, in the arrangement by which the Government and the Colonial Wool Combing and Weaving Company share certain profits. I have endeavoured to obtain the list of shareholders. When I asked the Prime Minister for it he replied that the information was not available, but that I could obtain it at the Registrar&#39;s Office, Sydney. Search was made at that office, but the share list was not available. I then drew the. attention of the Prime Minister to a clause in the agreement, which provides that the company shall furnish the Government with a list of shareholders and of the shares held by them; but when I asked him for the list he replied, &#34; It is confidential.&#34; The position is, therefore, that we cannot obtain the share list at the Registrar&#39;s Office, Sydney, and the Government will not supply us with a copy. If they would do so we should then know to what extent the member of the Central Wool Committee to whom I have referred is interested in the agreement. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is not a fact that a member of the Central Wool Committee is largely interested in the agreement ? </para>

The right honorable gentleman said that one reason why these monthly reports were not now forthcoming was that they were often so late in  being furnished as to be of no real value. In referring to that answer on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Friday, I said that it was either a reflection on the officers called upon to make such returns or it proved the inefficiency of the Government. Other returns are provided in a few days, and, that being so, I should like to know why we cannot obtain equally prompt returns in regard  to so important a matter as the supply of foodstuffs. </para>

            <para>The following instructions with regard to special leave for members of the Imperial Forces were recently sent out: - &#34; (1) Cases have come under notice of men in the Australian Imperial Force Camps, whose homes are in the country districts, and who sometimes find that their business or family affairs necessitate their return for a few days. &#34; (2) In such cases, applications will be submitted to the Camp Commandants, who may, if the circumstances justify, grant such special leave, without pay. &#34; (3) Camp Commandants will personally deal with all such applications, and carefully consider the circumstances of each case. &#34;(4) This leave should preferably be given so as to include a week-end, in order that the soldier is absent from his training for as short a period as possible.&#34; </para>
            <para>It was pointed out that it was only intended that additional leave should be granted in cases where it can be shown that business or family affairs necessitate such urgent additional leave, and not to allow men in Camps additional leave in order to visit their homes at week-ends. The training of the troops would seriously suffer if men were allowed such leave indiscriminately. </para>

				<para>1. The suspension of enemy trade marks in favour of individuals was intended merely to assist local manufacturers who satisfied the Government that they could manufacture goods of substantially the same quality as those to which the trade marks had been applied, to place their goods on the market, and thus oust the enemy, article. It was intended that the suspension should not be operative indefinitely, but merely until the local manufacturers had an opportunity to introduce their goods to the public. Sufficient time having, in the view of the Government, been given for this purpose, the suspension was revoked.</para>
				<para>2 and 3. The trade marks in question were avoided in order to abolish the rights given to the proprietors by registration and to permit public use of certain trade names. The suspension of a mark suspends the rights of the proprietor during the period of suspension; but those rights become fully operative on the expiration of that period. In addition, suspension makes the public use of the trade mark an offence.</para>

              <para>- On clause 31, the honorable member for  Wide Ray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> brought forward the request for extended time for payment of the tax. It was pointed out that it would be a heavy burden if the taxpayer was called upon to pay two assessments at the same time. However, I understand from the Treasurer that it is not proposed to collect the two taxes at the one time. On Friday afternoon we recommitted clause 31, and extended, in effect, the period of payment from thirty days to sixty days. As the Bill now stands, after notice of the assessment/ is given, sixty days, instead of thirty days, are allowed for the payment before the liability to pay 10 per cent, extra is incurred. </para>

I recognise that, whatever liberty is granted to me must be accorded to every honorable member; and I wish to know whether, on this motion, I can discuss the principles of the Bill as it now stands, or whether I shall have to wait until the Committee stage is reached. </para>

Full and ample opportunity to discuss the measure should have been afforded honorable members. If I had had opportunity in reasonable  hours, I should have suggested to the Government that clause 26, dealing with the Board of Referees, should be recommitted. No mention is made in the clause of the number of persons who shall constitute the Board. The Treasurer said that in his view the Board should comprise three members.

            <para> - In my opinion, the number of members to constitute the Board of Referees should be stated in the Bill. Although the measure is so liberal that it is doubtful if anybody will be so dissatisfied with the ruling of the Commissioner as to desire to appeal to a Board of Referees, still, in order to do things decently we should specify how many members shall constitute the Board. If we are to have such appeals, there should be a tribunal in every capital city. Are people in Perth to be asked to come to Melbourne if they desire to appeal against the decision of the  Deputy  Commissioner in Western Australia ? If the Board is to consist of only three members, they will, I presume, be resident in Melbourne, and those persons in other States who have reason to find fault with the  Deputy  Commissioner will be greatly disadvantaged in having to come to Melbourne for the purpose of appealing. I would prefer&#39; that there should be referees in each capital city, and that each Board should include at least one chartered accountant. Whilst our system of recruiting the Civil Service is very good, the accountancy methods in the Government employ are quite different from those adopted in commercial circles&#39;. </para>

              <para>- The House evidently is not seised of the importance of this matter, and I, therefore, wish to show as briefly as I can that the Board ought to consist of more than three members. Otherwise, it will probably sit in Melbourne, and persons living in Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, and other distant places, who may have occasion to appeal against the decision of the Commissioner, will have to come to Melbourne to have appeals heard, which would be a hardship. I cannot imagine that there will be such appeals, because the Bill is so liberal, and allows so many exemptions. But I have had complaints from business people who say, without in any way challenging the capacity or ability of the officers of the Taxation Department and the Treasury, that it is not possible, with the training that a man gets who starts in boyhood in the Public Service-- </para>

          <para>.- I ask if the Government will consent to the re consideration of clause 10. Yesterday I introduced to the Treasurer a gentleman interested in an Australian industry which may be injuriously affected by that clause, if it be not amended. That industry is typical of a number of new businesses. It must be the desire of the Government that  Australian industries shall be established before the end of the war to enable Australian manufacturers to compete successfully then with their rivals abroad. An embargo has been placed upon the importation of motor-car bodies, arid a gentleman in Australia has arranged to manufacture 5,000 of these bodies yearly. To do this he has been compelled to ask his bank for an advance of &#163;20,000 to cover the cost of putting down the necessary plant. The bank, however, asks, with some justification, will the security be sufficient if half the profits of the enterprise over and above a certain amount are taken under the war-time profits tax? The American motor manufacturers will not allow their agent&#39;s here to make a contract for a longer term than a year, so that immediately after the war they may be manufacturing their own motor bodies here. It is entirely with a view to assisting Australian manufacturers that I desire to amend clause 10, to give the Commissioner power, where he thinks that the tax would shut up a factory by preventing a manufacturer from successfully competing with outsiders, to make a concession. </para>

It purports, under certain limited circumstances, to give a certain discretion and power to the Commissioner, and I ask that this power be extended.

          <para>. - There appears to be some misapprehension on the part of honorable members as to the promise I made with respect to clause 31. As a matter of fact, I fulfilled my promise by recommitting the Bill and inserting in clause 33 a certain amendment. Several honorable members, however, do not seem to think that that amendment covers all that I promised to do, and, rather than that there should be any misunderstanding, I am prepared to accept the amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I second the amendment. It is of vital importance that the Government should agree to the recommittal of this clause. The policy of the Commonwealth is to discourage the importation of certain articles, and to encourage their local manufacture. There is a possibility of this Bill doing material injury to those who may enter upon the manufacture of certain goods. Our only desire is that theCommissioner should be granted wide discretionary powers, so that no business may be ruined before it has had a chance of, so to speak, getting on its feet. </para>

          <para>.- I should like to ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> whether it would not be possible for the House to be placed in possession of the reasons that actuate this amendment. I am anxious to cast an intelligent vote, but I find the utmost difficulty in coming to an intelligent decision when the reasons can be touched upon only with hesitancy and some fear of transgressing the Standing Orders. The House is put in a false position. I do not desire to traverse your ruling, but I suggest to you that it is hardly fair to ask honorable members to vote upon any issue which is clouded by reason of an interpretation placed upon the &#39;Standing Orders. </para>

            <para> - I would point out that if I were to permit a general discussion on each of these proposals to recommit a clause, the whole Bill could in that way be debated just by the simple process of going through the form of moving an amendment to recommit each clause an honorable member desired to debate. On the motion for the second reading, honorable members were able to discuss the whole principles of the Bill; and in Committee they were at liberty to discuss in detail the whole of the clauses. It would, therefore, be quite irregular at this stage to permit a debate which would include a discussion covering all these various points. &#39; If the House agrees to recommit the clause, there will be a still further opportunity to discuss it in detail. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to further appeal to the Government to consider the whole question of the pre-war standard. The more I look into this measure the more I am convinced of two things, the first of which is that it will not at all affect the majority of those whom it is intended to affect; that many companies, individuals, and firms who have, during the years of the war made considerable profits in excess of those made before the war, will be called upon to pay nothing under this Bill. I shall show in a moment that the measure will not reach the great companies which have made war&#39; profits - that  it  will not touch the shipping companies, which the community desire to tax, nor the big metal companies, nor those companies with huge stocks that have increased in value, and given rise to great profits, but that the people who will really be affected are those in smaller classes of business, whose excess profits have not been made out of the war. Let me point out why this Bill will not tax the excess profits of, let us say, shipping companies or softgoods warehousemen, whose stocks have increased in value, provided they are large companies or firms, or individuals whose profits as shareholders in companies have increased by large sums. The reason is that they are entitled to deduct from their excess profits the whole of the income tax which they pay. Let me give a simple example. A firm which made a net income of &#163;10,000 a year before the war - that is its normal pre-war income - makes a 50 per cent. increase during the taxing year. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">That is a large increase, the sort of increase which it is intended to tax. It&#39;s income during the taxing period is thus &#163;15,000, and every penny of it may be derived directly from the war through the increase in the value of stocks or base metals, or through the increase in shipping freights. Yet, the firm which makes that increase will not pay one penny in taxation under this Bill. It will be in exactly the same position as if the Bill did not exist, because the amount it has to pay under the Federal income tax will be just about &#163;5,000, and that &#163;5,000 represents the excess income over the prewar standard. Thus the man who mad &#163;10,000 before; the war, and is now making &#163;.15,000, will have nothing to pay under this Bill, but the smaller man who has been engaged in developing his business, and made perhaps &#163;1,000 the year before the war, and though he may not be in a business in which the value of his stock has increased owing to the war, has developed from that &#163;1,000 a year to &#163;1,500 a year, will be in quite a different position. He will be entitled to deduct the amount of his income tax, but only at a very much lower rate, and though he has made &#163;500 a year in excess of his prewar standard, he will deduct only &#163;125 for what he is called upon to pay in income tax. He pays income tax at the rate of l0d. in the &#163;1. The man who has increased his profits from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000 pays income tax at the rate of 5s. in the &#163;1. The small man, who earns an excess profit of only &#163;500,. will be called upon to pay war-time profits tax on &#163;375. Is there any sense in this proposal ? </para>

I am as strongly in favour of keeping political pledges as any honorable member is, but it is necessary to have regard to what was the real substance of the pledge said to have been given to the people. As I have said before, in my opinion the real substance of the pledge given to the people was that the Government proposed, either through the War-time Profits Tax Bill, which had already been introduced, or by some necessary alteration to that measure, to tax heavily, if it were possible to do so, profits made by large companies and rich people through the war. </para>

            <para>. - If this Bill were wiped out altogether, we would still derive the same amount of revenue from these companies from the income tax they pay. I do not propose to further reduce their profits. My proposal is totally different ; it is this : If we cannot arrive at what are, in effect, war profits, we should take a percentage of capital, and allow a man 10 per cent. without charging him any tax. If he makes 15 per cent. on his capital we should take, say, 50 per cent. of the profits above that 10 per cent., and so proceed by a graduated scale. It must not be assumed that I am saying that the Bill should be modified by wiping out the exemptions in regard to payment on account of income tax. What I am endeavouring to say is that the Bill, with that exemption, has not the effect which the country expected that this kind of legislation would have. This Bill will take from the great bulk of the big companies and the rich men who have made war profits nothing whatever more than if it were thrown into the wastepaper basket; but it will take away a considerable portion of the profits of smaller businesses. These latter pay income tax at a very much lower rate, and, therefore, will get a very much lower rate of deduction. The only effect of this Bill will be that while it lets off the wealthy companies and firms, whether their excess of profits is derived from the war or not, from any burden of taxation under it, it will greatly increase the taxation upon the lower incomes, which at present, under the income tax, are not called upon to pay an excessive rate. In other words, the whole burden of this form of taxation &#39; will be thrown, not on the big companies or the persons who hold shares in them, but on those people whose incomes as shareholders in companies or as individuals carrying on businesses do not approach those of the shareholders of the big companies. If there was any pledge to the country, if the late election was really fought on this issue, and there were no other issues before the people, or if this was one of the material issues before the people, the substance of it was that we should so frame our legislation -that we should, as nearly as possible, tax under this form of taxation the profits of those metal companies, those shipping companies, those softgoods companies, those chemical businesses, and others whose gains, whose stocks, whose freights, or whose other sources of revenue had, by reason of the war, enabled them to make larger profits. But the Bill lets them off. </para>

            <para>. - It is quite true that some companies whose profits have increased beyond 50 per cent. will be hit by this Bill, but those companies whose excess of profits does not amount to more than 50 per cent, of the pre-war profits will not be hit by it, and the great bulk of those who have made war profits must be included in the latter category, and will not be taxed by the Bill, because the income tax rate is already one-third in the highest grade. The firm whose income was &#163;10,000 before the war, and whose income during the accounting period is &#163;15,000, pays income tax at the rate of 5s. plus 25 per cent., that is, 6s. 3d. in the &#163;1, and&#39; that will just about wipe out the &#163;5,000 excess profit. On the other hand, the smaller men, where the income tax rate is lower, will bear the whole burden of this war-time profits taxation, and that is not what I consider was the intention of the people when they gave sanction, if they did give sanction, to what was then termed the War Profits Bill before the country. Let me give the history of this legislation. Originally there was no exemption of payments on account of income tax in the Bill introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> so that this argument would not have applied to that Bill; but the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> though he did not introduce an amending Bill, made an interim financial statement on the 6th December, 1916, and under the heading of &#34; What constitutes war profits &#34; he said - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Allowance should also be made for the deduction of amounts paid in respect of Commonwealth and State income taxes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That was stated before the election; but can any one say that it is not straining the matter to the utmost to suppose that when the Government said that they intended to proceed with the War-time Profits Tax Bill, and pointed out that certain modifications would have to be made, the people had in their minds, not only the terms of the Bill, which very few knew anything about, but also the statement made by the honorable member for Grey on the 6th December, that certain further alterations should be made ? But, if the people knew that those further alterations, when made, would have the effect of preventing this kind of legislation from touching the large companies and firms which made war profits, would they have sanctioned it? </para>
          <para>I have placed my views as strongly as I could upon this point previously. Like other honorable members, I have received numerous letters from all parts of Australia, but I have not paid much attention to cases of individual hardship, because, with all such legislation, there must be such cases. However, I have become more and more impressed with the fact that this taxation, based on a pre-war standard, will not touch the man we seek to touch, for the most part, but will hit with crushing weight many of those smaller growing industries upon which the future of the Commonwealth depends. </para>

            <para>. - I have already admitted it. In reply to the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts),</inline> I pointed out that my argument covered only those firms whose profits did not exceed 50 per cent. In chemical businesses, and in others, there will be cases where the actual cost of the article sold has gone up by 100 per cent, yet the profits have not gone up more than 50 per cent. Any excess over 50 per cent. will come under this Bill. So far as companies are concerned, it must be remembered that it is the shareholders who will be affected. If a company pays its profits away in dividends, it does not pay income tax on those profits, and therefore would not be entitled to deduct income tax, bub a company is merely an aggregation of shareholders, and all wealthy shareholders whose income exceeds &#163;5,000 are the persons who would get the greatest relief from this tax. If their business does not earn 50 per cent. more than it earned before the war, they would be relieved absolutely. It would be invidious to mention the shipping companies and other large concerns which expected to pay this tax, but which, unless they made more than 50 per cent. excess profit, will not be touched by it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish to say a word or two upon the principle of the pre-war standard. To my mind, it is an essentially unsound principle, and is particularly dangerous at the present juncture in Australia. The 10 per cent. standard which will be adopted in a great many cases ought to be adopted as the standard in every case, but we ought not to require people to pay 75 per cent. of all profits made in excess of that standard. We should have a graduated tax based always on a percentage of capital. It is unfortunate that we should have to debate this extremely important measure without having an opportunity of dealing with the general financial position of the country. We are crippled in respect of that kind of criticism which we, as a Parliament, ought to use in connexion with such a measure. In a very short time, there will be returning to Australia about 300,000 men who must be replaced in industry. Heaven knows that will be a sufficiently heavy burden upon us. But, in addition, we shall have a sudden and great diminution of the amount of borrowed money available for maintaining public works and employment. Those two facts represent our immediate future ; that is the position we have to face. I said the other day that there never was a time in the history of Australia when so urgent a duty lay upon this Parliament to stimulate and encourage every form of production and enterprise, because there  never was in the history of Australia such a difficulty as is right on our threshold to-day. The problem which every country engaged in war will have to face we shall have to face. But in some respects we shall have to tackle it with greater difficulties than confront other countries. Yet at this moment, when every encouragement ought to be given to enterprise, to the starting of new businesses, and to the taking of business risks, we are saying to people, &#34; If you continue developing your business and succeed, if you throw your whole energy into it, and use every gift of knowledge, strength, and enterprise you possess to expand your activities, we shall take 75 per cent. of any profits above the pre-war standard of your business, but if you lose, you yourselves must bear the loss.&#34; Is it conceivable that, under such an embargo, there can be any development in this country ? My criticism of this measure applies with equal force to the Bill introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> But I realize that only when a measure is threshed out in Parliament, and has the light of criticism thrown on its provisions, do we see the full measure of its strength and its weaknesses, and if we are a rational Parliament at all, while avoiding party issues on all sides, we ought to have regard to the immediate industrial and economic problems that confront us. </para>

            <para>.- Members on both sides have been wrong in regard to this class of legislation. We find now that it will not work. At a. time when credit is low and the springs of enterprise are necessarily slackened, when it takes more energy and enterprise to launch out into business and create fresh avenues of employment, to say to people, &#34; We shall bind you to your pre-war standard, and take 75 per cent. of anything you make in excess,&#34; would be to dry up the wells of enterprise, and to cause economic sterility. Once more I appeal to the Government to reconsider this measure. No question of party or political conflict ought to deter us from preventing such injuries as this measure is likely  to  do. </para>

            <para>.- I am not. It is quite true that if the war ends next year this Bill will only hamper and weaken enterprise for one year. If the war does not end next year, the Bill will have that effect for two years, and so on. But this is not the sort of legislation which we can try, and then repeal if  it  does not succeed. Its very nature is  to  place an embargo on industry during the coming year. </para>

            <para>.- I do not think the English precedent ought necessarily to bind us in Australia. I pay the greatest respect to legislation relating to legal and commercial matters, bills of exchange, and so forth, which has received the advantage of the great skill and experience which statesmen of the British Parliament can give. Their experience entitles most measures which they pass  to  the greatest consideration from us, but when we are dealing with a tax which directly touches the present economic position of our country it is our duty to go to the ground level, and study exactly what it means. The suggestion I have made to the Government on previous occasions I venture to make again, and I do not think that the Ministerial party, any more than the party on the other side, will lose any prestige by facing the real question and even jettisoning some of our previously-conceived ideas. I should not have again raised this question unless I felt that we were about to do an irreparable injury. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My original suggestion - and I do not think it is impracticable - was that we should devise some method of scheduling businesses which are supposed to have made war profits, and call upon them to show reason why their excess profits are not derived from the war. I believe the majority of honorable members are opposed to that idea, and therefore I do not  press it. But, instead of having a prewar standard, which will operate as an immovable fetter upon the natural growth of industry, we can adopt the alternative 10 per cent. standard, which is in this Bill, and was, I think, in the previous measure introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia. </para>

            <para>. - I do not care what the percentage is, provided that the burden is graduated. We shall then be taxing war-time profits, not on the false and mischievous theory that we ought to tax a man because he is making more now. than at some other time, but because he is making an abnormal profit on the capital invested in his business. That principle is adopted by the Bill in some cases. Wherever the pre-war standard is less than 10 per cent. on his capital, a man is entitled to take 10 per cent. as his standard. I suggest that we should omit all the provisions relating to the fixing of a pre-war standard, and that we should take a 10 per cent. standard in every case. But we should not commence by taking 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. of all profits above 10 per cent. We should have a graduated scale, the precise range of which will be for tie Committee to determine. I recommend the Canadian principle that if a man is making a 15 per cent. profit he should pay 50 per cent. in taxation, or if he is making 20 per cent. profit he should pay 75 per cent. That would not cripple any man&#39;s industry, because he would know that he could, at any rate, make up to 15 per cent. on his capital before feeling the burden of taxation. Of course, all war taxation must have some crippling effect on industry, but the scheme I suggest would not place an absolute embargo on enterprise. </para>

            <para>. - If we adopted the Canadian system, we should still have our income taxation ; every citizen would still have to pay income taxation at the rates applicable to his income. But where the profits of a business are much in excess of what may be called the normal rate of profits on capital, it is not unjust to impose an additional tax. Such a tax would affect war profits, and would include profits that were not war profits, but were profits due to some cause having no connexion with the war. Some companies have watered their stock, other companies have not done this, but possess very large reserves. Most of the companies whose war profits it is intended to tax have large reserves, in addition to their nominal paid-up capital - reserves sometimes equalling the paid-up capital. The Bill provides, in my opinion very properly, that it is the real capital, not the nominal capital, of a business that is to be taken into consideration. A dividend of 15 per cent. on the nominal capital of a concern may be only 10 per cent: on the real capital. My suggestion is that the percentage principle should be applied to capital. It is applied in many cases, and, I believe, would cover the majority of businesses in which war profits have been made. Although in many cases companies may have declared dividends of more than 10&#39; per cent, prior to the war, the profits on their- real capital may have been less than 10 per cent. </para>

            <para>.- Practically all reserves are business capital. I think that honorable members will agree with me that it is proper to take the assets of a &#39;business as the basis of calculation, and to say,&#34; We shall allow you to- make 10 per cent, without taxing your profits, but over and above that percentage we shall tax on a graduated scale, rising rapidly to large percentages.&#34; I put forward the Canadian method as one the adoption of which would leave a great deal of the machinery of the Bill intact, and would make unnecessary a pre-war standard, with all its difficulties and its unjust and mischievous results. The Bill would then have nothing like such ruinous effects upon industry and enterprise. It is with the greatest reluctance that I have again brought forward this matter. I thought when we last discussed the measure that, with the alterations made in Committee, and the very wide discretion given to the Commissioner, it might be possible to avoid&#39; the most injurious effects; but the more I have read the representations made to me, and the more  I have thought over- the matter, the more convinced have I become that that is not so, and that while the pre-war standard is preserved, nothing will prevent, the measure from having the disastrous consequences to which I have drawn attention. </para>

At this stage the honorable member cannot ask the Government to withdraw the Bill, nor can he expect it to alter its machinery in the way in which he suggests. </para>

I think that I have said as much before when speaking about the measure.

            <para> - As I am going to help the Government, I hope that I shall not be interfered with in replying to the honorable member for Flinders. The public has seen that many companies are making huge profits, and believes that their profits are due to the high, prices charged for commodities. The honorable and learned member says that we should abandon tha idea of taxing war-time profits, and adopt the Canadian system of allowing a dividend of 10 per cent, to be exempt from taxation, and having no pre-war standard. The equity of a pre-war standard is shown by the reference of the honorable member for Flinders to the watering of stock. According to the share list there are companies which pay as much as 15 per cent, and 20 per cent, on their capital. For a number of years the Bank of Western Australia has paid 20 per cent. Its directors have been perfectly honest with the public, and have shown that percentage on their balance-sheets- year after year. Some companies, however, have done differently.. From time to time these companies increase their capital by issuing fresh shares, upon: which their shareholders have the first option. This is allowed by the law. The new shares, though nominally worth &#163;1, may have a  market value of &#163;2, but the shareholders are allowed to take them up at &#163;1, the company thus increasing its capital and appearing to decrease its profits. The proposal of the honorable member for Flinders would penalize the honest company which showed the true profits on its capital, and would allow the company which adopted the more modern method to escape scot free. The Bank of New South Wales has from time to time offered new shares to its shareholders for &#163;20 apiece, although such shares might be worth in the market nearly &#163;40 each. Shares in companies like the West Australian Bank have been turned over and over again, and many present-day holders may not be getting a return of more than 5&#163; or 6 per cent, upon their capital. The proposal now is to tax such shareholders in such a way that the return on their investments will be reduced to, perhaps, only 4 per cent. That is inequitable. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> spoke of the serious position that confronts us. He said that perhaps next year we should have to settle 300,000 returned soldiers ; that our public works expenditure would be reduced, and that there would be difficulty in obtaining the capital necessary to carry on industry. If the general public are afforded an opportunity to read the honorable member&#39;s speech in the newspapers to-morrow, I am afraid that it will cause, on their part, something in the nature of a panic. The honorable member spoke in the most serious tones of the difficulties that would confront us if next year we were called upon to provide for the repatriation of 300,000 soldiers. He must know, however, that even if the war were to end next June we should not be called upon to settle anything like that number within the following twelve months. When we had at the Front only 200,000 men it was said that it would take two years to. return them to Australia. It is probable that it will take us nearly three years to bring back- the whole of our troops after the war. They may be brought back at the rate of 2,000 a week, and whilst the process of returning them to Australia is in operation this Government, which apparently will not attempt to raise by taxation the requisite revenue, will doubtless be borrowing money to provide their pay and to defray the cost of their transport and repatriation. For the first two or three years after the close of the war; therefore, there will be, in my opinion, not a period of depression, as suggested by the honorable member, but something nearly approaching a boom. The honorable member said that because of this depression difficulty would be experienced in obtaining the capital necessary for the development of industry. I take the view that if, following the close of the war, we experience a great depression, it will be possible to obtain, with the greatest ease, capital, at a low rate of interest. If, on the other hand, there is something like a boom, difficulty will be experienced in obtaining capital for the purposes of commercial enterprises. </para>
          <para>The Government must go on with this measure. I do not think that industry will suffer by reason of it, because every business will be allowed to earn 10 per cent., plus a &#163;200 exemption, before any part of its profits is taken. If, as the Treasurer estimates, the tax will yield only &#163;1,000,000, then the taking of that amount from the incomes of Australia will not seriously affect our commerce and industry. Under instructions from the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> who is an impartial statistician, took a census of the wealth and incomes of the people soon after the outbreak of war. We are given to understand by him that the wealth of Australia amounts to something like &#163;1,000,000,000, and the incomes of Australia to about &#163;200,000,000. The taking of &#163;1,000,000, for the purposes of taxation, from incomes amounting to &#163;200,000,000 is not likely to have the serious effect which the honorable member for Flinders has suggested. </para>

          <para>. -  I am largely in agreement with the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> in warning the Committee of the disastrous effects that will follow the passing of the Bill in its present form. Twelve months ago I emphasized very strongly the serious effect it would have on the industries of Australia at a time when we were all most anxious that our industries should be encouraged and that our production should expand. The whole trouble arises from the fact that the Government are endeavouring to graft on to Australia a form of legislation that is applicable only to the conditions which exist in the country where it was originally introduced. There is a fundamental difference between the conditions prevailing here and in the Old Country, and consequently the Bill, in its present form, is calculated to do gross and serious injustice. The New Zealand Act was withdrawn after it had been in operation for only twelve months, because it was found to operate most unjustly, and to be unfair in its treatment of the general community. A still further objection was the cost of collecting the tax. The injustices which must follow the coming into operation of this measure are largely, if not wholely, due to the pre-war standard for which it provides. The effect of that pre-war standard is to select one particular section of the community for taxation, and to relentlessly penalize it. It is not the wealthy section of the community, but the young and struggling manufacturing industries, that are to be so penalized. They are specially picked out for taxation. </para>

              <para>- By reason of the pre-war standard, the Bill deliberately excludes from taxation all those large enterprises which have long been returning by way of income perhaps 10 per cent., 20 per cent., or even 100 per cent. All such enterprises are excluded. Instead of going to the sources of income on which taxation might fairly be levied, and levied with good results, the Government pick out small industries, recent enterprises, which are now struggling and endeavouring to grow and develop. Why should this be done? </para>

            <para>.- Twelve months ago, I strongly pointed out all the objections that have been urged to-day, and I repeated those objections on the motion for the second reading of this Bill. I deeply regret that the Bill has been persisted in, because I think it is grossly unfair that one section should be penalized in this way. It is true that it is to be only a temporary measure, but, while it is in operation, it will inflict on one section of the community injustices from which they are not likely to recover for many a year. </para>

            <para>.- Quite so. One obvious reason why the pre-war standard should not be persisted in is that this is a War-time Profits Bill. If it were possible to bring about the high taxation of all war profits, I should be found cooperating with the Government in such an effort. The fundamental principle of this measure, however, is that it shall be a War-time Profits Bill. That presupposes that all persons who, during the war, have made profits over and above a certain standard should be taxed. The pre-war standard, however, destroys what is fundamentally intended to be the principle of the Bill. It is not too late to withdraw this particular feature of the measure, and so enable the Government to obtain more revenue, while, at the same time, avoiding the taxation of one particular section of industry. </para>

            <para>.- It has not; but I remind the honorable member of clause 11, which deals with the decrease of capital, and also clause 16 and other clauses, which deal with the investment of capital. The position is that where capital is withdrawn from a business, there is a presupposition that it will earn the same amount of profit that, it did in the business, whereas, if it is withdrawn, as thousands have been withdrawn, for investment in war loans, there is an infinitely less return than previously. However, I am glad to hear emphasized objections which I emphasized . a little while ago. </para>

        <para class="block">The Government were pledged to . proceed with a War-time Profits Bill, and the Bill before us is a War-time Profits Bill. It was contended on all sides that if a man engaged in business before the war earned a certain income, and if, during the war period, when our men are falling in the  trenches and on the battlefield, his profits increased, it was a fair thing to subject those profits to taxation. That was clearly stated as the principle which ought to be the basis of&#39; this taxation; and the Bill carries it out, inasmuch as it taxes excess profits which are made in business during war time. Special amendments have been introduced to deal with small businesses, and an exemption is given to the extent of &#163;1,000. Practically the Bill gives a pre-war standard of &#163;1,000. In addition, it is provided that exceptional cases may be dealt with by the Commissioner on their merits, and power is given to make modifications in the pre-war standard itself, in the computation of profits, and in the fixation of what should be a faircapital. </para>

            <para>- At present I am dealing with this Bill and the promise given by the Government to introduce such a measure. This Bill proposes, admittedly, taxation on war-time profits, and the whole of the arguments we have Beard are in favour of the substitution of some other proposal. Of course, we would all like to tax war profits only if war profits could be segregated from other profits. This cannot be done, because the ramifications &#39;of the war run through all our industries, primary and secondary. It is impossible to allocate a portion of profits, and say that it is particularly due to the war, while another portion of the profits is not.  A suggestion has been made th&#39;at we should schedule businesses, and distinguish those which have made war profits as distinguished from war-&#39; time profits. Can we say that pastoralists have made war profits, and war profits only? </para>

              <para>- Could we say that all the shipping companies have made war profits only? It is utterly impossible to say which profits are war profits and war profits only.. If we were to split up, the balance-sheets, and,, after analyzing each individual case, call upon those concerned to show cause why they should not be taxed, the Department would have to hold an inquisitorial examination into the conduct of almost every business in Australia. The worst feature is that Parliament would not lay down the principle of taxation, but simply delegate its taxing power to the Commissioner to be exercised at his discretion. That, of course, is contrary to the elementary principle of taxation measures, which, as a rule, ought to be as certain and .specific as they can be made. Another suggestion is that we should adopt the Canadian measure; but if we did that we would have to drop the whole principle of war-time profits taxation. It might be a good additional form of&#39; taxation, but because it could probably be made to apply, that is no reason for abandoning the Bill before us. We have also to remember that, at the time the Bill was introduced in Canada, there was&#39; no income tax in that Dominion. As a  matter  of fact, each- country, in framing its taxation measures, must have regard for its own conditions. We must take into consideration our existing legislation, our own industries, and the circumstances in which, we live; and we must seek to apply the proposed taxation equitably to all sections of the community. The large companies will not escape this taxation. </para>

            <para> - If these companies -are making huge profits, they would be hit by this Bill. Does any one suggest that we should also hit them with the income tax? It would mean double taxation. We cannot take the tax from .them twice. If the income tax does take from them the whole of the excess profits, we cannot take it again, by an excess profits tax. The House has adopted the principle of the Bill by its decision on the second reading, and if it is sought to depart from the vital points, of the measure, it  will  simply mean asking the Government to withdraw the Bill&#39;.. The Government intend to proceed with, the Bill in the form in which it now  stands. </para>

          <para>.- When we compare the enthusiasm over this taxation proposal with the enthusiasm manifested a few months ago in regard to sending the &#34; last man,&#34; we cannot help noticing the lack of enthusiasm there is on the part of some honorable members in regard to taking a modicum of the &#34;last shilling.&#34; We have had from them almost continuous &#34; stonewalling &#34; tactics towards a measure which is estimated to produce a few hundred thousand pounds in revenue. The measure amply protects the small man. It has been amended to do  so. In fact, it is a very moderate proposal. I feel ashamed at the attitude of some honorable members. We, on this side of the chamber, take up the attitude, in regard to sending men to the Front, that a man must go willy-nilly, and the man who goes to the Front makes the greatest sacrifice of all - he risks his life; but when it is proposed to take a matter of &#163;800,000 from those who remain behind, we have speeches such as we have heard during the progress of this Bill through the House. They do not redound to&#39; the  credit  of the  Win-the-war  party or the people outside the chamber. We told the electors that the money must be found. </para>

              <para>- We will be getting very little, yet some honorable members want the Government to drop the measure. If the Government introduced another measure, we should have similar objections offered. When I introduced the Income Tax Bill last year, similar objections were raised. Because it was proposed to take &#163;16 from a man earning &#163;600 a year, honorable members complained that the proposal was iniquitous. When the Amusements Tax was introduced, honorable members said, &#34;Do not tax women and children who are going to entertainments&#34;; and so they mutilated the Bill.  They  mutilated the Income Tax Bill, more or less, and they seek to mutilate this measure. I urge the Government, to stick to their Bill. If there are any iniquities in it, there will be an opportunity of reconsidering the measure when we meet again; but as the party on this side is pledged to the imposition of a war-time profits tax, and the people outside have a strong feeling in regard to this form of taxation, we cannot throw the Bill on one side. </para>

Does the honorable member suppose that by selecting a very few persons to be lightly and delicately touched by legislation of this kind, we shall be discharging our full measure of obligation to our soldiers, at the Front ? </para>

Therefore, they have come down with this Bill, which is nominally a War-time Profits Tax Bill, because they have said, &#34; We are pledged to the electors to introduce a War-time Profits Tax Bill.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I sympathize with honorable members in their difficulties. They desire, nominally, to fulfil their election pledges; and when some of them say, &#34; But you are going to tax the small businesses and let the huge incomes escape,&#34; the reply from Ministers is, &#34; But we must fulfil our election pledges. What matters it if the large businesses do escape, and the small men who are striving to get their heads above water are hit by the Bill; what matters it if these  small  men have to bear the burden of this taxation so long as we fulfil technically our election pledges, and square the ledger to all appearances, even though morally and really we have grossly failed to discharge those pledges <inline font-style="italic">1 &#39; &#39;</inline> Before getting down to the merits of this question, I find it necessary to remind my friends of where they are in regard to it. These gentlemen of &#34;unlimited sacrifices&#34;; these gentlemen who have advocated again and again the whole sacrifice of the worker&#39;s life, wages, income, capital, interest, and principal; in fact, the worker&#39;s everything, come down here, and say that it is unjust to place discriminating taxation upon the man whose income from his business is only &#163;1,000 per year. Of course, it is unjust by comparison, but how badly the argument comes from those whose policy is what we know it to be ! </para>

          <para>I come now to point out why I consistently  with  my general attitude oppose this Bill - lock, stock, and barrel. We are merely juggling with terms when we say that this is . a War-time Profits Tax Bill, and again, in some respects, say that it  is a War Profits Tax Bill. If an honorable member rises, and addresses himself to the war profits aspect of the measure, and says, &#34; Let us get at the war profits,&#34; the reply is, &#34; We cannot; we cannot find  them;  we do not know where they are and what they are; therefore we&#34; cannot tax them, and, - besides, this is a War-time Profits Tax Bill.&#34; Very well; we call it a War-time Profits Tax Bill, and we say, &#34; Let us apply it justly to those  profits  which are made during a time of war&#34; ; but Ministers say, &#34; No, you quite forget the war aspect of this Bill,&#34; and they hark back to the war profits aspect of the measure. It is a mere juggling with words. If this is a War Profits Tax Bill, let us select war profits, and tax them. If we cannot select the war profits, let us adopt a principle of taxation which will  apply  justly to the whole community. </para>

            <para> - The honorable member does not seem to have taken the trouble to ascertain the basis of our objection to this Bill. Of course, I objected to the taxation of junior lawyers and small businesses. I would be very recreant to my trust if, having secured that small measure of justice to one class of persons. I sat mute while it was proposed to do an injustice to other sections of the community, as the Bill proposes to do. Of course I did my best to have exempted those junior professional men who by personal exertion, and not because of the war, but in spite of the war, happen to be making increased incomes at this time, while those with very large incomes escape altogether. Consistently with that&#39; attitude I now say that the Bill should be withdrawn, because the more that I have listened to arguments such as I have heard this afternoon and previously, the more I have become convinced that it will do nothing less than gross injustice. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts),</inline> who has returned to the chamber after a few days&#39; absence, naturally asked whether the Government had made any attempts to answer the outstanding objections against the injustice that will be done by the Bill, and I interjected that they have succumbed to our arguments in respect to a few special cases. But, as the honorable member for Kooyong said - and I agree with almost every one of his remarks - they leave an i.inlimited list of injustices still unremedied. </para>

              <para>- When I spoke in support of the honorable member for Henty in the early hours of Friday morning, I said I was against the Bill, and would do anything to limit the scope of its mischief. I voted accordingly then, and accordingly I will vote now. I do not know whether it is by the grace of the  Chairman  or the Standing Orders that we are discussing this Bill at such length at this stage. I think that the liberty of discussion arises rather from the growing sense on the part  of Ministerial members of the futility and even wickedness of passing a measure of this kind in its present form. I hope that when the Bill is in transit to another place it will be happily lost or forgotten, and that the Government will come before the House with a measure - I do not care what they call it, a war profits tax or a war-time profits tax - but a measure consistent with their own pledges to tax those people- who are able to bear taxation. If our condition in regard  to this war is anything like what it is said, to be, if it is in the remotest degree approaching what the Prime Minister, on the platform and in the House, has said it is, we should have a measure,, not lightly and unjustly touching a small section of the  communitv.  but, if necessary, cutting to the bone the whole community in proportion to their ability to pay. Let us have such a mea&#39;sure, and let us h.ave this iniquitous proposal forgotten, if possible, after it passes from this Chamber, because I am certain, after what the Honorary Minister has said, that the Government are determined to pass it here, being ashamed, no doubt, to submit further amendments. </para>

          <para>.- I do not propose to follow the honorable member for Batman in the electioneering speech he has delivered to the Committee. I would find it difficult <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> follow the same circle as the honorable member described, for whilst he started with a denunciation of the measure as a ludicrous futility, his mind was suddenly cast back to a very grave crisis only a few days ago, when he spoke with equal fervour and far deeper earnestness in advocating the exclusion of new industries sought to be brought within the comprehension of this measure - unjustly, as I thought - to one of which industries the honorable and learned member belongs. </para>

        <para>I am not concerned with, catch phrases such as &#39;&#39; not because of the war, but in spite of the war.&#34; These&#39; phrases have been coined by interested persons to enable them to escape the compass of this proposal. I take it that  most  businesses in Australia have prospered .because of the enormous sums of money brought into circulation by this war, and placed in the hands of new classes, and because of the fact that those new classes were spending that) war money, yet the businesses which reap the benefit of this wide money circulation say, &#34; We have prospered, not because of the war, but in spit&#169; of the war.&#34;  Almost every business throughout Australia has prospered because of the vast war expenditure. The money paid to the people has filtered back to trade,, yet trade would have the impudence to tell us that it has not benefited because of , the war. </para>
        <para>However, I have risen to deal with one aspect of the debate on the clause rather than&#39; to deal generally with the measure. I refer to the somewhat alarming revolutionary doctrine preached this afternoon by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> and naturally voiced afterwards by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> and others&#39;. If the honorable member for Kooyong was pledged to anything, it was that there should be no tax upon wealth.  His  cry was that a wealth tax was an absurd and antiquated impost, and that the right levy was by means of an income tax. Yet this afternoon we heard him advocating a tax upon wealth by advocating the abolition of the pre-war  standard. Take the case of the majority of  the  large companies which have made most of the big profits in recent years. The vast majority of lie shareholders bought into those companies a year or two before the war started, on a market value given to them by the interest return shown by the dividends, &#39; and to ay that those companies sh&#39;all not continue to make profits representing that rate of interest is to confiscate the capital value of those shares, and to take the wealth of those &#34;who invested in them. The abolition of the pre-war standard would be a direct tax upon wealth, and I submit that it is grossly unjust to tax  that  section &#62;of .wealth in this country, unless we .are going to tax -all wealth throughout the community in the same way. We have heard a lot of nonsense talked about the exemption of large interests. The large interests -are not exempted by -this measure, for everybody &#34;who comes within its compass is taxed according to the same principle,  that  they shall not gain appreciably more from their businesses in time of &#34;war than they gained in time of peace. All big industries stand on the same plane ; the exemptions have been made for the small industries. The only way to make the big businesses pay more taxation is by confiscating the wealth of the shareholders invested in those industries.- </para>

          <para class="block">Maribyrnong suggests a super-income tax, not in respect of the year of plenty thai is passing, but in respect of the years of decreasing income that are before us. I should not have bothered to speak this afternoon but for the claptrap which has been uttered about the large interests escaping. That is the argument advanced by the other interests which wish to escape. We must tax the profits of the year 1915-16 in order to keep the National party&#39;s pledges, and there is no way of taxing that year other than by some such measure as is now before the Committee, because the public was given notice of this measure, and in passing it there is no retrospection. </para>

            <para>Y.- If I tell somebody that I intend to tax him, and that he must make provision for that tax, he makes that provision. <inline font-style="italic">J&#163;</inline> he does not, the fault is his own. About fifteen months&#39; notice of this tax was given by Parliament, and every Government succeeding has reiterated the warning. If people have not taken the warning they have only themselves to blame. If we abolish the pre-war standard, we shall act unfairly, and even foolishly, and cause immense dislocation of share values throughout Australia, and infinite inconvenience to the Treasury. Further, you cannot tax the profits of the year 1915-16, the year of great profits, unless you pass this Rill. It is often urged against those arguing -against a taxation measure that, while burning with a righteous zeal to be taxed, they bitterly- resent being brought within its application.. If you withdrew the Bill, and proposed a super-income tax, we should have the same gentlemen saying, &#34; In  the  name of common sense, why heap this intolerable burden on the taxpayers?&#34; Whatever form the proposal may ,take, it will .create trouble, but I think .that under the Bill there will be less trouble than under any other proposal. Let us see how the measure works. &#39;Should it work inequitably we may trust the Government to reconsider the position. </para>

          <para>- I agree with a great deal .that was said bv the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> and had there been a division would have voted <inline font-style="italic">ica</inline> the second reading of the B2U, not that I think .that the measure goes far enough, but because I am bound to support one having for its object the taxing of war profits in war time. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has justly characterized as. a quibble the contention that we should pass, not a war-time profits tax, but a war profits tax. To do that would be to create more technicalities. I disagree with what was said by the honorable member for Grey regarding the entertainments tax. It was stated that that tax would fall unjustly upon the purveyors of amusement who were already subject to the ordinary income taxation. Certain firms in this city, however - Hoyt&#39;s and two or three others - were willing to pay the tax, and leave their prices of. admission untouched. But the combine immediately insisted that they should make the people pay the tax. In my opinion, the Government should not permit any combine or Trust to interfere between a firm and the public when the firm wishes to pay a tax itself, and does not wish to pass it on to the public. </para>

          <para>One must agree with some of the remarks of the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine),</inline> but I think that he was wrong in saying that those who earn the largest incomes would escape the proposed tax. If that were so, the Government should alter the Bill in order to compel these large profit makers to contribute to the general taxation. In my opinion, the honorable member did not prove his statement. When I asked him to say what was the yield of the Canadian tax, he said, &#34; only &#163;2,500,000.&#34; That seems a very small sum to be contributed by a population of 8,000,000 persons, forming a community that is wealthier than Australia. In my opinion, a super-tax on the ordinary income tax would have been better than the proposal now under consideration. But it must be admitted that the Government was pledged to the introduction of the proposed tax, and Ministers, according to their lights, are honorably fulfilling that pledge, though their lights do not burn as brightly as I could wish. If I understand the measure rightly, everything over the pre-war standard of profit, making allowance for the &#163;1,000 exemption, will pay taxation at the rate of 50 per cent. That is a fair commencement, but I hope that we are not going to stop at that. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> spoke of the Western Australian Bank, the history of which is unique. The honorable member for Flinders spoke about capital being held in reserves. The Western Australian Bank has what, I think, no other bank in the world possesses - a reserve fund equal to nearly 300 per cent, of its paid-up capitaL </para>

              <para>- The capital of the Western Australian Bank consists of 25,000 &#163;10 shares fully paid up which represents &#163;250,000. Its reserve of undivided profits, however, amounts to &#163;713,370, or nearly 300 per cent, on its paid-up capital. Thus, if the suggestion made by the. honorable member for Flinders were adopted, the percentage allowance would be upon practically &#163;1,000,000 instead of the &#163;250,000 actually paid up. Instead of an exemption of 20 per cent, on the actual paid-up capital of .the company, the bank would thus &#39;receive an exemption of 80 per cent. That would be an absolute infamy. </para>

          <para>The Government are offering me, and those who think with me, only a commencement in this form of taxation. If I cannot obtain the full loaf, I am prepared to take a portion of it; but I shall not cease to ask for more.- The Bank of New Zealand has a reserve fund of &#163;2,246,595. That reserve fund really represents profits, but under the honorable member for Flinders&#39; proposal the shareholders would be allowed the percentage deduction in respect of the full amount instead of upon the amount subscribed by the original shareholders. On one occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clapp,</inline> then secretary of the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Limited, was under cross-examination for three successive afternoons in regard to the way in which the capital of the old company had been watered; but it was impossible to clearly ascertain to what extent the watering-down process had been carried on. It was estimated that a dividend of 5 per cent, was really equal to a dividend of 45 per cent., or even 50 per cent., upon the original capital subscribed before the watering of the stock took place. I hope that the proposal made by the honorable member for Flinders will be rejected.- The return prepared for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock in regard to the profits made by firms and individuals, as disclosed by the State income tax returns shows that only thirty-three out of 265 suffered a reduction of income in the year of war, 1916, as compared with the returns for 1914. Of the thirty-three, five in the following year made sufficient to more than &#34;balance the deficit of the previous year. Honorable members opposite talk of an exemption of &#163;1,000, but what is to be said of the position of thousands of working men in Australia to-day who earn only &#163;2, &#163;3, or &#163;4 per week, or that of girls in factories who, if they are lucky, average from 30s. to 40s. per week 1 A man who in pre-war times was earning &#163;1,000 a year will be allowed an exemption of that amount if his profits exceed that amount in later years. There will also be an additional exemption of &#163;1,000. </para>

          <para>I invite honorable members to consider for a moment the profits made on whisky. The output of Australian whisky runs into some thousands of gallons, but who knows where and how that- output is sold? It is reported that Australian whisky is blended with other whiskies, and sold in bottles purporting to contain imported whisky. We cannot put a stop to the crime of burglary, but we can make it awkward for the burglar whom we catch. Why do we not make it awkward for the manufacturer or merchant who sells Australian whisky in bottles purporting to contain the imported article ? Two gentlemen in the trade told me this afternoon that prior to the war a good Scotch whisky, having the requisite certificate of two years&#39; maturity, could be bought here in bond for 2s. 6d. per gallon. At that time the duty was 14s. per gallon; it has -since been increased to 17s. We may make an allowance of 2s. 6d. per gallon for the increase in freight charges, but that will not account for the fact that to-day such whisky cannot be  purchased for  less than 17s. 6d. per gallon, an increase of 600 per cent. </para>

            <para>- Of course, the honorable member for Yarra, as an ex-Minister for Customs, knows much more about this matter than does my informant, and I gladly accept his statement. Coming to Australian whisky, which is manufactured in thousands of gallons, I would point out that very few hotels sell it as Australian whisky. To my mind, that is an infamy. I desire to see our Australian products built up as American products have been built up. Shortly before the outbreak of war Australian whisky cost 4s. 6d. per gallon. It is now being sold at 15s. per gallon: The Treasurer will agree with me that there is a large source of profit hidden there.- I object to firms which are making large profits being permitted to escape taxation. Before the war , the Excise duty upon Australian whisky, distilled wholly from barley malt by a pot- still or similar process, at a strength not exceeding 45 per cent, over proof, was 13s. per gallon, whereas upon blended whisky, distilled partly from barley malt and partly from other grain, containing not less than 25 per cent, of . pure barley malt spirit, which had been separately distilled by a pot-still or similar process at a strength not exceeding 45 per cent, over proof, it was 15s. per gallon. If I had my choice I would prefer a super income tax to a war-time profits tax, because I candidly confess that I do not fully grasp the Canadian system of war profits taxation. Canada has been credited with many good things, but I would have to understand its system more thoroughly before I could accept it. For advanced legislation Australia can more than hold her own with Canada, just as she can more than hold her own from the stand-point of her treatment of the Mother Land. Canada imposes upon Great Britain the cost of every man - as soon as the Canadian lands in England - that she places in the field. We have not done that. To my mind, there should be no exemptions under this Bill. I am satisfied that if the question were put to the people, &#34; Do you approve of persons making huge profits in war time?&#34; they would by an overwhelming majority answer &#34; No.&#34; I know of one man, or firm, who in 1916 made a profit of &#163;100,000 in excess of his profit in 1914. </para>

          <para>Suppose that he made that profit by raising the prices of foodstuffs. If he knew that every penny -of the excess would be confiscated, would not that knowledge tend to prevent the raising of prices? 1 have shown that there has been an increase of 600 per cent, in the price of Australian whisky. But that is nothing compared with the increased prices charged for other commodities. There are in this city two firms which have increased the prices of food to such an extent that under the old code Napoleon they would- not only have been fined . heavily, but would also have been imprisoned. </para>

            <para> - I hope so sincerely. I trust that the Government will not yield to the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders. But the Bill will not produce the revenue that it ought to yield. I maintain that any company which at a time like the present can make pre-war profits ought to be very well content. We are 12,000 miles distant from the danger zone, and consequently are most fortunate. When we reflect upon the countries which have been devastated - countries like Belgium, Servia, Montenegro, Albania, Roumania, and a portion of Russia, including Riga-- </para>

            <para>Y .  - Yes. I ask the Minister for the Navy, who has been very good lately, whether . the merchants and others of the before-mentioned countries, and of Petrograd, would not be exceedingly grateful if . they could carry on their businesses under existing conditions, and make pre-war profits? In these devastated countries what has become of the individuals who were wealthy? They have been swept like chaff before the wind. I regret that the Government have slavishly followed the Bill which was introduced by a former Administration. They ought to recognise that the conditions which then obtained are very different from those which prevail . now. Times have . changed, and whereas we might then have been content with 50 per cent, of the excess war-time profits, we should now stretch out our . hand and take the whole of them. In Victoria alone profits amounting to just upon , &#163;2,000,000 have been made since the war began, in excess of profits amounting to &#163;3,900,000 which were made in peace time. If we include the rest of Australia, it is manifest that &#163;8,000,000 of excess profits . have been made in war time. Yet it is proposed to take only one-half of these profits. </para>

The year 19.13 was . a year of peace, whereas the declaration of war was made in August, 1914; and every one will admit, that trade suffered, and credit was shaken for a few weeks, that) is, until we pulled ourselves together.

            <para>- I think it will be found that there was a decrease in 1914. However, that is a matter for inquiry. I should have liked to see the computation of profits made absolutely on the income tax returns, which are on formal declarations, and any one making a false declaration is liable to a heavy penalty. It is the height of absurdity to have seven different income taxes imposed in Australia; and, in my opinion, there ought to be one income tax and one land tax for the whole of the . country. The . State could be paid a proportion . of the revenue raised by the Commonwealth; and if a scheme to that end were carried out it would prove a means of economy, and more just . than the differential system of bookkeeping. </para>

          <para>.- While appreciating the difficulty that confronts the Treasurer in his endeavour to meet the wishes of the Committee, I cannot help feeling, with the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine),</inline> that we have started on a bad foundation. I find it extremely difficult to bring myself to support the Bill in its entirety. I feel thatImust support the measure; but I wish the Treasurer, and the Minister who is assisting him, would see whether they cannot do something to get over the difficulties that are felt by myself and others. I speak more particularly in relation to certain companies. At the present time, the best of our base metals- are finder the control of the Government, who supervise the sale and purchase of molybdenite, wolfram., and so forth. The Government have fixed prices which, to those who produce these articles, are considerably less than the standard value;, but I have no objection to that, because the prices are fairly good. If these people went into the open market, they could get 100 per cent, more for wolfram and scheelite than they are getting from the Government. They could get for molybdenite 80 per cent, more in the world&#39;s market than they are getting from the Government for this metal. &#34; This should be remembered when we are dealing with this taxation. I am satisfied that honorable members generally desire to be fair in dealing with this question, and I should like some attempt to be made to overcome the difficulty which arises out of the consideration of the pre-war standard to which the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> has directed special attention. Let us assume that there are two companies with a capital of &#163;10,000 each carrying on business to-day. Suppose one was carrying on its business prior to the declaration of war, and one has been established since the declaration of war. I assume that the older business, prior to the war, made a profit of &#163;12,000 a year, and is still making a similar profit. That company would not pay a single sixpence of taxation under this Bill,&#39; because its profit during the accounting period would not be greater than its pre-war standard of profits. The new company, with the same capital, having a good business proposition in selling metals to the Government, is also making a profit of &#163;12,000 a year. It would be entitled under the Bill to take 10 per cent, of its capital of &#163;10,000, and this would give it an exemption of &#163;1,000. Under the provisions dealing with businesses with a wasting asset it would get another exemption of &#163;1,000. </para>

              <para>- I think that the difficulty might be met to some extent by assessing the war-time profits tax on the excess value arising from war conditions of the metals in which the company does its business. The company should be able to declare to the Commissioner of Taxes that, .for instance, the pre-war standard of the value of tin was so much per ton, and that the present price is so much in excess of that, and the company could be called upon to pay the tax on the difference between the value of the tin or of other metals prior to the war, and during the accounting period under this Bill. If that arrangement were made, I believe it would satisfy those, engaged in such businesses as I have referred to, whilst it would not block the formation of mining companies, which I am sure the Government intensely desire to promote. If the Bill is passed as it stands, I am fearful that its effect will be to put an immediate stop to the formation of- these new companies, and so will be very injurious to the Commonwealth. Honorable members are aware that mining is a very speculative business. Those investing in such a business anticipate larger profits than may be expected from any other venture, because mining is the most speculative of all industries. Although I recognise  these difficulties, I am prepared to support the Government in connexion with this part of the Bill in the hope that at a later stage of the measure some effort will be made by the adoption of an amendment on the lines I have suggested to lessen the injury which otherwise will be done to new companies. </para>

          <para>.- If the suggestions of the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> and the honorable member for Dampier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> are to be given effect, we might as well throw this Bill over-board altogether. The honorable members referred to are proposing to remove the very basis of this Bill, which is intended to impose a war-time profits tax. Both political parties, when appealing to the electors, said that they were going to get at the exploiters and profiteers, meaning the men who have been making more money since the declaration of war than they were making before the war. If &#39;we abolish the pre-war standard, only those firms who were making profits equal to more than 10 per cent, of their capital before the war will be brought under this taxation. They may be mulct in very heavy sums indeed. That was never contemplated in any of the Bills introduced by either political party. In a&#39;ll these Bills the pre-war standard of profit has been the basis beyond which the tax proposed was to operate. Any company earning so much before the war could earn that amount after the war commenced without being subjected to this taxation. No such company could be said to be profiteering or getting at the public, and neither party pledged itself to tax such people. The pre-war standard of profits &#39;was the basis on which both parties appealed to the  country. I hope that the Government will not listen to the suggestion to abolish that standard, because it is the basis of the Bill, and if it were, abolished the Bill might just as well be withdrawn, and the suggestion made from half-a-dozen sources - to establish a super-income tax - adopted. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased to hear the Treasurer say so. On this matter I am a solid supporter of his. The Bill is such an intricate problem, that there are very few people who understand it, and, therefore, I make the suggestion that after it passes through the Committee stage it should be reprinted with all the amendments incorporated in it before it is submitted to honorable members for the third reading. It is very necessary, on such an intricate measure, that honorable members should clearly see what they have done. I do not think there is one honorable member except the Treasurer and the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom),</inline> who has been helping him so assiduously, who understands thoroughly its many ramifications. If the Government would consent to have a clean print of the measure made before the third reading comes on, it would facilitate the passage of the Bill. </para>

            <para>R. - Several honorable members opposite have done so, and particularly the honorable member for  Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pigott).</inline> He said across the chamber, &#34;It is your Bill,&#34; meaning the Bill introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia, but no one would recognise this Bill as that which was introduced by that honorable member. It contained no exemption of businesses with a profit of &#163;1,000. There are other exemptions in this Bill which were not in the measure introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia.  His  Bill allowed a pre-war standard of 6 and 7 per cent. only. We do not know what rates the Government will propose in their taxing measure. According to the Treasurer&#39;s admission in his Budget speech, at least &#163;2,000,000 has been taken from the people in the shape of excess profits, which, to my mind, should not have been taken, because he admits that by this process of taxation he is going to raise &#163;1,000,000 or thereabouts. I think that the suggestion is that only 50 per cent, of the profits shall he taxed. The action of the Government reminds me of the case of a man who, when he was robbed of a shilling, said to the thief, &#34; Give me back (&#62;d. and I will let you off.&#34; The Government practically say to the persons who  will be affected by this taxation, &#34; We will allow you to keep the first &#163;1,000 for yourselves.&#34; As the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Boyd)</inline> has said, very few honorable members understand the Bill. It is doubtful whether the &#163;1,000 exemption is not in addition to the 10 per cent, profit which can be allowed. It is also very doubtful whether persons will not be allowed a prewar standard in addition. The Bill has been mangled. I sympathize  with the Treasurer in his indisposition. He is troubled with the sort of throat which most of us have after an election campaign and I trust that he will be better soon. The only vigorous speech he has made on this measure was the one in which he fought for the exemption which the honorable member for Henty had&#39; moved to be struck out. Let honorable members look through the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record for last &#39;week, and they will see that there was not one speech made by a member of the Government in defence of the principles of the Bill. The honorable member for Hindmarsh said at half-past 5 o&#39;clock the other morning, and the honorable member for Grey said this afternoon, &#34; When it was a question of the conscription of life you said that the men had to go, but when it is a question concerning taxation you say, &#39; We will treat these people very gingerly. We will put the hand in a velvet glove. We will let them go. We will allow every one to escape whom ?it is possible to exempt. &#39; &#39; &#39; There is no honorable member on the other side, whether he understands the Bill or not, there is not even a Minister who can state what amount is likely to be received. There has never been a taxation, measure submitted to any Parliament which has been so mangled as has this one. It has been subjected to &#39;very severe criticism even from the supporters of the Government. After it ran the gauntlet of their Caucus meeting upstairs last Thursday; after the definite principles were decided upon, honorable members on the other side came here and twitted us with having supported Bills- </para>

I assure honorable members that -their- privileges are not interfered with when the Chair asks them to confine themselves to the question immediately before the Committee. Clause 3 practically deals with &#34; Parts,&#34; and by, perhaps, the unwisdom i of the Chair too much latitude has been- allowed, and the discussion has developed into a second-reading debate. On clause 4 the definitions will be considered by the Committee. On clause 7 the war-time profits tax will be considered. On clause 8 the businesses to which the tax. applies will be considered. On clause II the pre-war standard will be considered. On clause 14 the computation of profits will be considered. On clause 15 the prewar years will be considered. On clause 16 the definition of capital will be considered. On clause 31 the date for the payment of the tax will be considered, and then the insertion of a new clause is to be proposed. I ask -honorable members to assist . the Chair to get on with the business. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member will have to help it. The Committee decided on the point I submitted to them, and once the Committee have decided on a question it would be improper on the part of the  Chairman  to attempt to go behind their decision. The Committee decided to have the question put forthwith, and I then put the question forthwith. The- dissent of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> therefore does not apply. </para>

When you asked, &#34;Is it the pleasure of the Committee to take the matter forthwith?&#34; I understood that that meant, &#34; Are you prepared to deal with, and, if necessary, to debate, the matter forthwith?&#34; and not by any means that it was to be put without debate. If I am wrong in that view, I ask you, on the other hand, to say that you have the power where there has been a clear mistake on the part of the Committee to put the question again. </para>

            <para>.- That is not a point of order,  but  a question; and being put in a proper way, I shall answer it. The  Chairman  of Committees is the guardian of the rights of all honorable members. Whenever any disorder occurs, it is the Chairman&#39;s duty to intervene immediately to see that order is restored. I did that, as the honorable member knows; and in his own case he made a graceful withdrawal from the position he took up. I endeavoured to do the same with the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> but that honorable member would not comply with my ruling. Now I trust, in the interests of good order, that the matter be dropped&#39; forthwith, and the business of the Committee proceeded with. </para>

            <para>.- That is quite right. The House may censure; but in this case there was no report to the House, and the Committee did  that. The  Chairman  is charged with the preservation of good order. In other States, particularly the State to which I belong, there is a clear and distinct ruling to this effect. In dealing with this matter, I was particularly careful in regard to the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> because, personally, I have always been on the best of terms with him, and I know that he has no desire to defy the Chair; but the  Committee will see at once that if serious disorder arises, and if the  Chairman  were not authorized to preserve order in the intervening time, there could be no report from the Committee to the House except after a lengthened period. This would lead to a very grave position, such as has happened in some of the </para>

At that . time, I was pointing out that the Bill before us, so far from fulfilling the Government&#39;s pledge, is a fraud and a sham; and I say that deliberately. The measure does not fulfil one single word of . the pledge of the Government; and I pointed out that, during the afternoon, the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archibald),</inline> and others behind the Government, had said the same thing. The whole anxiety of honorable members opposite does not seem to be to secure a perfect taxation measure, but to see how many people they can exempt from taxation. </para>

The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest)</inline> has admitted that he does not know how much revenue it will bring in, considering the exemptions that have been made.

		  <para>-I had not intended to speak on the Bill as presented to us today, but I cannot keep silent when I observe the attitude of honorable members opposite, who are supposed to represent the views of&#39; the Government, and who, in the short interval since the election, cannot have forgotten the pledges they gave on the hustings. If it be. permissible,. I shall say that those honorable gentlemen behind the Government are simply a body of tax dodgers. Hardly one of them who has spoken has not shown that there is some section of the community whom he wishes to exempt. Is there one of them, however, who did not tell the people during the elections that, if returned, he would be prepared to tax those who had made profits during the war - who did not impress on the public that while a duty devolved on all young men to goto the Front, there was a needful duty on those who were left behind to support our fighting Forces?</para>

I have called the attention of honorable members on both sides to the clauses of the Bill- that have been recommitted for consideration, and to the fact that if they restrained themselves in debating this clause they would not be deprived of their privilege of discussing the clauses to which they wished to refer when they came on for consideration. The honorable member for East Sydney is discussing a matter quite outside the clause, and, as he is an old and experienced Parliamentarian, I ask him to assist me in the performance of my duties in the chair. </para>

I believe that in this Bill the Government are not carrying out the will of the people. This is a serious moment in our history, and if I have transgressed the rules of debate, it must be due to my earnest determination to carry out the people&#39;s will, and see that legislation is passed in accordance with the views they have expressed. I believe that if we all went home, and asked the Government to reconsider their position, it would be a good thing to do. During this debate one honorable member has told us that he does not understand clause 3. </para>

            <para>T. - I do not think, sir, that there is anything contained in the Bill that you have left out. I am entirely opposed to exemptions. I noticed a paragraph only, in to-day&#39;s newspapers to the effect that a son of the late Right Honorable John Bright, speaking of a measure similar to this passed by the British Parliament, stated that, owing to the exemptions provided for under it, the people of the United Kingdom were robbed of &#163;200,000,000, which, but for those exemptions, would have been contributed in taxation by certain sections of the community. Honorable members opposite are proposing, in the same way, the exemption of certain sections from the payment of the war-time profits tax under this Bill. It is of no use for honorable members to blind themselves to the fact that we need revenue. We require &#163;9,000,000 to pay interest, and yet honorable members are taking advantage of every opportunity to exempt from taxation under this measure persons who should be taxed. The  Chairman  of Committees  (Hon. J. M. Chanter)  has been for many years a politician, and I ask him whether he ever saw such a spectacle as we have seen today, when honorable members opposite have been trying to prevent the payment of taxation by those who are receiving profits upon which taxation should be levied. I hope that honorable members will not treat the principles of this Bill too lightly. They, no doubt, have friends whom they would like to relieve from taxation, but they should put the interests of the country before those of their personal friends. That is what I am doing.  Amongst my personal friends there are some who are perfectly willing to pay this taxation in order to assist the Commonwealth in carrying on the war. This is a quite exceptional time in our history, when . every one of us should be prepared to make sacrifices. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest)</inline> tells us that he requires money, and we are here to provide him with the means of obtaining it. The professional man, the man on the land, and the manufacturer should alike be prepared to assist the Government in this matter. We must submit to taxation in these times, and I ask honorable members opposite, even at this late hour, to assist in obtaining revenue by the imposition of taxation which the Parliament would not ask the people to bear at any other time. If I have done nothing else than impress upon honorable members the seriousness of the position, I Have done good service for Australia. </para>

              <para>- The particular business which it is wanted to establish is, say, the manufacture of motor bodies. That is an industry which is carried on in Australia to-day. Every one knows that motor bodies are being made here. Since the prohibition of the importation of motor bodies new firms are taking up the business. It is the prohibition of a luxury, not under the will of Parliament, but under the will of the Executive. If the amendment is to be applied to any one industry it would be right and proper to apply it to all industries. </para>

              <para>- The object of every Government should be, as far as possible, to help and encourage men to settle in the back-blocks. These men are the outposts of Australia. No matter where we sit in the chamber, we all believe in the principle of closer settlement. So&#39; far as wasting assets are concerned, the people who reside in the central districts of Australia get no consideration whatever. But the men who take up leases of land not very far from a centre of civilization are given big exemptions. </para>

          <para>.- The point raised by the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkiner)</inline> is that, although the intention of the Bill is to segregate war-time profits from the ordinary profits of a business, and to make a definite percentage of those war-time profits, or excess profits, pass to the Crown as a war-time profits tax, that intention is not achieved. As I read this clause, before the war-time profits tax begins to operate at all, the Income Tax Act will have operated, taking the maximum income as an example, to the extent of 6s. 3d. in the &#163;1 - that is, 5s. maximum rate, and ls. 3d. for the 25, per cent, additional income tax. Leaving out the State income tax altogether, and taking a maximum income for the first accounting period, the first levy on the excess profit, but amounts to 6s. 3d. in the &#163;1 under the Income Tax Act, leaving a balance of 13s. 9d. in the &#163;1, of which,&#39; under this Bill, the taxpayer gets 6s. 101/2d., and the Crown gets 6s. 101/2d. The Government are really allowing the Income Tax Commissioner to enter this new sphere of taxation, which this Bill purports to deliver over specially to the Taxing Master to be dealt with under the powers it confers. The country thought that the Government were going to earmark 50 per cent, of the excess profits for the first year, and 75 per cent, for the second accounting period, whereas they are not doing so at all. </para>

            <para>- I suggest that income tax should be levied as at present on the normal profits, and that the Government should be content with 50 per cent, of the excess profits. Take a pre-war income of &#163;10,000, with excess profits of &#163;5,000 in the first accounting period. My proposal is that the income tax should operate on the normal income, and that in respect of the &#163;5,000 excess profits it should not operate, but that 50 per cent, of those excess profits should be taken as a war-time profits tax. </para>

          <para>.- The income tax has already been assessed on the profits to which the war-time profits tax will apply, but when the war-time profits tax has been levied the amount of the tax will be deducted from the taxable income, and the income tax will be reduced accordingly. Let me give some figures in illustration of the position. Suppose a prewar income to be &#163;1,000 and the excess profits to be &#163;600, making the war-time income &#163;1,600. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the income tax levied on that &#163;1,600 was &#163;200. In dealing with the income for the purposes of the wartime profits tax, you deduct the &#163;200 paid as income tax, thus reducing the income to &#163;1,400, and from that the  pre-war income, namely, &#163;1,000, making the excess profit &#163;400. Of that &#163;400 the Government take 50 per cent., or &#163;200. The taxpayer, however, has already paid income tax on &#163;1,600, and an adjustment is made by ascertaining the income tax leviable on &#163;1,400 and deducting that from the income tax actually paid, refunding the difference. </para>

          <para>.- This appears to be the most sweeping exemption in the whole Bill, and one which will allow the larger taxpayers to escape. I quite agree with the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> that relief should only be afforded the taxpayer in cases where, and to the extent, that the income tax would operate on excess profits. It is not fair that the income tax should operate on excess profits to the extent: of 6s. 3d., and war-time profits to 50 per cent, or 75 per cent., as the case may be. Where a taxpayer&#39;s income tax is increased, he should be allowed to set it off against his war-time profits tax, but if he is allowed to recoup himself for the whole of his excess tax the Bill will yield very little revenue. I should like to see the proviso wiped out altogether, or amended in such a manner as to assure . to the Treasury the receipt of some revenue under this Bill. The clause is a very awkward one, and requires a good deal of consideration. </para>

            <para>.- With regard to the case quoted by the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> it seems to me that he misapplied the provisions of this Bill.  His  instance was that of a man whose pre-war standard was &#163;10,000, and whose taxing standard was &#163;15,000. In that case he said he would first of all deduct income tax, which would be 6s. 3d. in the &#163;1, leaving then 13s. 9d. to be divided between the State and the individual. The complete answer to that is that from the &#163;15,000 you take 6s. 3d. to start with, which is &#163;4,800, and you bring down his surplus revenue to &#163;200; then you bake away from that amount the whole of the State income and land tax, and wipe it out absolutely, there then being no excess profits to pay taxation upon. </para>

          <para>.- Earlier in the evening, I spoke of the difficulties which would be encountered under this Bill by mining companies starting prior to the war, or of those companies starting since the war, and with no pre-war standard. I pointed out that a company making, say, &#163;10,000 profit prior to the war, and having that as a pre-war standard, would pay no. taxation under this measure, whereas a new company would have to pay 50 per cent, or 75 per cent., as may be demanded. I do not want to do anything except that which is reasonable and fair, and I would like honorable members to realize that, if we pass this clause, irreparable injury will be . done to new companies. It will be absolutely impossible to get capital -for such ventures. We ought to encourage them as much as possible, and I ask the Minister, therefore, to permit the following paragraph to be added to sub-section 5- </para>

          <para>.- In connexion with sub-clause 10, I wish to know if it is possible to make provision that during the operation of the tax, losses extending over&#39; one year shall be compensated for, and a refund made in a subsequent accounting period ? The position is that men who have made excess profits during this year may, during the next -financial year, sustain big financial losses. In the Bill introduced by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> which was copied from the Imperial Act, and from the New Zealand Act, provision was made to cover such losses. Are the Government prepared to favorably consider a proposal of that kind? &#39; </para>

The provision referred to by the honorable member has not been made either in the Canadian or the New Zealand Acts. Neither is it contained in any of our Income Tax Acts. The Treasurer, it must be remembered, has to assess his revenue beforehand; and if these deductions are allowed, he will never know where he stands. </para>

          <para>.- I should like to move that after the words &#34; borrowed money,&#34; in sub-clause 11a, the words &#34; or capital &#34; be inserted, with the intention of afterwards moving in clause 16&#39; a similar amendment. My object is to include rented land as capital. The Bill set out to give to all capital an exemption of 10 per cent. ; and I cordially agree with the amendment to give the same exemption to capital borrowed for the purpose of creating a business. I cannot distinguish between a man who borrows money at 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, to create a business, and a man who borrows land at 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, in order to create a business which will yield him a profit. It would be a pity, when we have laid down a fine fundamental principle, to depart from that principle on the last occasion presented to us. </para>

        <para class="block">Unless some such amendment is agreed to the operation of this clause will be manifestly unfair. I take the case of an original elector of a piece of land, taking it up forty years ago at ?1 per acre, and that of a man holding the adjoining property, for which he has had to pay ?8 per acre, In these circumstances the original pioneer will be taxed, under this clause, eight times as heavily as his neighbour. A man in Victoria may be induced to go to New South Wales, and there purchase a piece of property at ?4 per acre, whilst the original selector of the adjoining land in New South Wales may have acquired it at ?1 per acre. He will have to value his land at ?1 per acre, whilst the other man will be able to value the adjoining property at ?4 per acre. If we leave the question of the value of land, and take the case qf the value of shares, one investor in bank shares may have paid ?40 for bank shares, the market value of which to-day is ?118 10s. The test should be the present value of the assets, the difference between assets and liabilities. </para>

          <para>.- I do not consider the statement of the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> at all satisfactory. The cost of improvements being allowed by no means compensates the owner of the land for the value added to the land by them. In the case of the ring-barking and clearing of timbered land, more than half the added value is due, not to the cost of the improvements, which&#39; maj be a mere bagatelle, but to the time during which the improvement  has matured. It is the added value of improvements which is allowed for under the Federal land tax. I suggest that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest)</inline> should agree to the insertion after the word &#34; kind &#34; of the words &#34; and the added value of his improvements.&#34; </para>

            <para>m. - The &#39;honorable member proposes that if ?1,000 spent upon improvements has added ?2,000 to the value of land, we should allow for the ?2,000, and not for the cost of the improvements which have been responsible for the added value. The Government could not accept &#34;that.  </para>

          <para>.- The point raised is a very important one. Though it is very difficult to appraise the value of land, we should not penalize the pioneer station-owners by contrast with others who have come in and purchased adjoining land within the last year or two. It is quite possible that this clause will tax very heavily the man who has accumulated large holdings, possibly by buying out other selectors, or by various members of the family taking up originally different blocks in years gone by. If such a person was fortunate enough to dispose of his property twelve months ago and then repurchase it, he would escape this taxation. A greater value attaches to land than is represented by the amount paid to the Crown, or the actual cost of improvements effected. These have been contributed to largely by members of the family at) no cost in the shape of actual cash paid out. Yet there will be no allowance for the value of those improvements so effected. Perhaps it would be going too far to provide that the total improved value of the property shall be regarded as the value of the capital invested in it, yet some amendment should be made to give a fuller measure of justice to the holders of these properties. Otherwise their only protection will be to get in debt as much as possible. This clause will create a monstrous injustice which should not be permitted. </para>

              <para>- I trust that the Treasurer when he hears my proposal will see how reasonable it is. My first suggestion was that firms who had provided for the payment of this tax by depositing their surplus revenue in war bonds should  be entitled to pay the tax with those war bonds. My proposition now is that for the retrospective year of the tax, namely, for the year 1915-16, these bonds may be accepted in payment of the tax. It has been said dozens of times that business people had full notice of the imposition of this tax. But notice was not given until the 18th May, 1916, fully eleven months after the accounting period . began. Many firms, believing that the Bill would be dealt with at once, put their surplus profits into war bonds. </para>

              <para>- I will state the effect of clauses 31 and 33. Under the Bill  a  man was called upon to pay his tax thirty days after he received the notice of assessment. We were told that that period was too short, and so we agreed to amend clause 33 so as to allow thirty days grace without a 10 per cent, penalty, giving the taxpayer, in effect, sixty days for payment. We are not going to collect the two years&#39; tax at once. Time will be allowed between the making of the two payments. Any person can also apply to the Commissioner for an extension beyond the period of sixty days, and the Commissioner can delegate the power to grant an extension to his deputy. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to get from the Minister an assurance that he will consider one point which I spoke to him about, and that is the. fast that the accounting period is to end previous to the 4th August. In the case of a business which balances on the 31st August, the period of eleven months previous to the date of the outbreak of the war will not come into the accounting period. To a new business that will be a great hardship. I should like the Minister to give me a promise that he will go carefully into this matter again, and that if convinced that my contention is fair he will have a small amendment made in the Senate. Otherwise a grave injustice will be done to a rising business. If the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir John Forrest)</inline> will give rae the promise for which T  ask  T will resume my seat at once. </para>
