              <para>- Well, I confess that that is a malapropism. Perhaps I should have said &#39;trusting&#39; rather than &#39;innocent&#39;. The document which has materialised is headed &#39;Strictly Confidential- ALP Campaign Planning&#39;. It purports to be a strategy and tactics document of the Labor Party. It is no such thing. It is a concoction and it has been presented by Ministers of the Government. The Liberal Party is implicated. It is bemusing to note the hilarity extensively in the ranks of the Government when clearly their own party has been involved in criminal behaviour in some way. If this were merely a matter of a leak there would be no room for complaint, although there might be room for feeling aggrieved. But it is not a leak, I repeat. There is clear evidence that this bogus document has been drawn together from illegally, criminally illegally, obtained material. David Combe - </para>

Just let me make one point for the record, however. The bogus document which has been circulated by certain representatives of the Liberal Party is not a Labor Party document. It has not been compiled either by the Labor Party or by any agency working for the Labor Party. It is true that the data which are included in that document draw substantially on a number of separate documents which the Labor Party&#39;s advertising agency, as distinct from the Labor Party, has compiled as working papers to present to the Labor Party. In that respect, the Labor Party is no more committed to what has been prepared and presented than the Liberal Party is committed to documentation which has been prepared by Masius, WynneWilliams and D&#39;Arcy-MacManus (Australia) Pty Ltd, the advertising agency which works for it. </para>

The extract appears on page 1 1 of the document. It is very important to tie in the Prime Minister and the Minister and another office-bearer of the Liberal Party, whom I will identify in a few minutes, with this document and the way in which it has become available publicly. The fact is that it is possible to establish beyond any doubt that there can have been only one source for this document- the advertising agency. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let me give honourable members the summary of the justification on that point. There were several documents which had been drawn upon to compile this spurious documentation which the Liberal Party has put together and which it is seeking to distribute in the community. The summary is: Three of those four documents upon which the compilers of this bogus document have drawn were held by the agency and included material not available in any of the copies of those documents circulated elsewhere. Yet all this additional material appears in the &#39;stolen document&#39; as we will call this bogus document. The fourth document involved in this collection of documents from which information was illegally extracted was a single document held by the agency. It was not circulated. The evidence is compelling that material quoted in Press reports this week, by the Prime Minister last Saturday and by one Minister in Parliament comes from a collection of confidential papers which could have been obtained only by illegal means from the offices of the Labor Party&#39;s advertising agency in Sydney. </para>
          <para>It may be argued, I guess, as a flimsy defence, that this is the product of a leak. That is nonsense. There has been a pattern of illegal and unethical behaviour by some persons unnamed who are clearly associated with the Liberal Party and Liberal Party representatives. For instance, on 26 October, a person was discovered in the office of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Macfie</inline> of our advertising agency, who handles our party&#39;s account, going through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Macfie</inline> &#39;s briefcase. That person was apprehended by the police and I understand that the police are still investigating this matter. On 12 November the offices of our advertising agencies were broken into, forcible entry was made and a safe was drilled and broken into- a safe bust job. The significance of that is that, in the view of the experienced police officers from the breaking squad who investigated this matter, the person who conducted the safebreak was a particularly professional safebreaker, the office of an advertising agency is not the sort of office which carries much in the way of cash and professional safebreakers do not waste their time going to offices that carry only petty cash. </para>
          <para>All that was removed was $200 in petty cash. But what was in the safe- this would probably have been known in some quarters, or at least suspected- was the comprehensive files concerning the Labor Party at both the State level in New South Wales and the Federal level. It would have been an easy matter for those files to have been removed, copies made, the files replaced and then, to give some verisimilitude of illegal activity associated with the removal of money, the petty cash removed. No one who has any experience in this sort of matter believes that a self-respecting professional safebreaker will waste his time breaking into such a safe. I have experience as a former member of the Criminal Investigation Branch in Brisbane. From that experience I recognise the behaviour of so many members of the Liberal Party. </para>
          <para>What pattern of undetected behaviour has there been prior to these two occasions, especially the instance when the person was located on the premises rifling through the briefcase of the executive of our advertising agency who handles all of the detail of our program and the things we are developing in association with our proposed campaigns? That is the Sydney end. It is a matter that is being investigated. The facts are clearly these: The document that the Liberal Party has prepared draws upon several documents which are available only in the agency of the ALP- Mullins, Clarke and Ralph Pty Ltd. There is evidence that there has been illegal entry to that agency, including a safebreaking, and that the safebreaking was undertaken in such a way as to suggest that the theft of money was the purpose of the safebreaking. Clearly, it is the view of experienced police investigators that no professional safebreaker would go to the office of an advertising agency carrying small amounts of money to undertake such a risky venture for such a small return. There was another motivation. One does not use a Rolls Royce to collect cut lunches. Let me come to the Canberra end of the connection. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I would like some protection from you. I think you are notably reticent today. I want some silence. I would love the Liberals to hear this. Let me come to the Canberra end of the connection- the Baudino connection. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baudino</inline> is the national public relations officer of the Liberal Party. On Monday an article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> It was trustingly reported by the journalist who had received the document that the story was based on &#39;a confidential ALP analysis of voting trends in Australia&#39;. On Tuesday an article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian.</inline> It referred to a confidential national campaign strategy&#39; and an ALP document&#39;. In both cases the journalists had trustingly accepted documentation which had been handed to them, dropped to them in the gallery. The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baudino,</inline> the Liberal Party&#39;s national public relations officer, was responsible for providing that documentation for those two people. In the immortal description of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies of a former colleague of his, he is a contemptible little squirt. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let me go further and refer to an even closer and higher association in the Liberal Party- that of its national secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eggleton.</inline> It is known that on last Monday week the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> obtained a confidential document about tactics for the Liberal Party. A copy of that document is now floating around this building. I draw the attention of honourable members to some obvious and major similarities in the typing presentation of this document, Tactics for Election Year&#39; signed &#39;Tony E\ and the bogus document prepared by the Liberals and distributed by the Liberals- Baudino, that contemptible little squirt, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies would have called him, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. In both cases, one does not have to be an expert to recognise the clear similarity, not only in the typing face but also in the style of setting out pages, the way in which each page is concluded and the indication of the succeeding page. </para>
          <para>One does not have to be particularly skilled to draw together the obvious conclusions that the Government, through the Liberal Party, has embarked on a sleazy exercise to propagate information which is quite dishonestly presented as a Labor Party document; that the collation of that information has been carried out in the Liberal Party offices; that a senior officer of the Liberal Party has hawked it to some journalists in this building; and that Ministers are seeking to do likewise. It does not take much intelligence, although it is quite a challenge for most members of the Liberal Party, to recognise that at the Sydney end of this connection clearly criminal behaviour has been associated with break-ins and unauthorised entry into the office of the agency of the Labor Party and that information from documents held there and there alone has been provided for the Liberal Party. It cannot be suggested with any conviction that this information has been obtained in this illegal way and then dribbled to the Liberal Party as a leak. No professional is going to do a Union Carbide Building bust job and just to keep his amateur status leak the information for the benefit of the Liberal Party. Believing that is like believing that whores are in business solely for thrills. </para>
          <para>How was the Sydney-Canberra connection bridged? How did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baudino</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eggleton</inline> of the Liberal Party obtain this sort of information? Clearly, all of the evidence establishes irrefutably that the information must have been obtained illegally; that it reached the hands of the Liberal Party; that the Liberal Party has now undertaken a particularly active campaign to disseminate this information; that it is a bogus document prepared within the Liberal Party offices; that the national secretary of the Liberal Party, Eggleton, is clearly implicated in some way; and that Baudino, the national public relations officer, is also deeply steeped in the whole arrangement of this bogus exercise designed in some way to embarrass the Labor Party. All that has happened is that the Liberal Party, the Government, has been exposed. It never anticipated that the documentation upon which the Party drew to fabricate this document was held exclusively by the agency of the Labor Party and that it would be impossible to leave doubt on the shoulders of anyone else. </para>
          <para>The fact is that the Fraser Government is a scandal-ridden Government. It is a Government that stands on impropriety. It is a Government that has lifted unethical conduct to a high art form, and it does that only through persistent practice. Look at its background: An allegation that goes to the court of attempted bribery of an election opponent, involving a Minister; electorate rigging, involving two Ministers; fixing computer tenders, involving the Prime Minister; widespread tax avoidance, involving numerous Ministers; malfeasance, involving a private company on the part of a former Minister; and rigging land deals on the part of a former Treasurer. The Government gives every indication that it is steeped in villainy. This is a clear case of political espionage. There are associated features of unauthorised entry, breaking and entering, safe breaking, theft and illegal removal of information. In all respects, the strong circumstantial evidence is that the Liberal Party is deeply involved in this escapade; that the national secretary is somehow involved; that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baudino,</inline> the national public relations officer, is clearly involved; and that a number of Ministers are involved, including certainly the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. It is a dishonourable Government and it deserves to be rejected. It ought to resign. </para>

It says something for the perception of the swinging voters in Australia that they really have the Prime Minister well and truly tabbed.

The Prime Minister referred to the document at the Liberal Party conference.

        <para class="block">That blows completely the idea that it is a Labor Party document. It proves definitely that it was prepared by the Liberal Party. Even worse, Tony Eggleton wrote to the Prime Minister on 18 October 1979 and in the second paragraph of his letter he stated: </para>

        <para class="block">It was not the ALP&#39;s report and assessment, but a report and assessment obviously from his own party. Obviously the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs knew that it was a Liberal Party document, compiled by the Liberal Party, with extracts stolen from the Labor Party&#39;s advertising agency. That is obviously beyond argument. The Liberal Party&#39;s director forwarded that document on 18 October. The Leader of the Opposition has already indicated to the House that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robert</inline> Baudino, a member of the Liberal Party secretariat, handed the composite document to journalists this week, also alleging that it was a Labor Party document. We now know that quite clearly the document contained extracts from an agency document which could only have been in the hands of the agency. It dealt with the number of Ministers stood down and dismissed by the Fraser Government. A correction from six to seven Ministers was made in October. The sheet which was corrected was never copied, never distributed. It was stolen from the safe of the advertising agency and it ended up in the hands of Malcolm Fraser, Ian Viner, Tony Eggleton and Robert Baudino. They are apparently the happy receivers of stolen goods. </para>

            <para>- The gang of four: that is for sure. It gets down to this issue: What motive could there possibly have been for anybody to burgle the offices of Mullins, Clarke and Ralph Pty Ltd, the Labor Party&#39;s advertising agency, if it were not for political espionage? Obviously the Liberal Party wanted to gain access to the Labor Party&#39;s campaign thinking not only in New South Wales but also in the Commonwealth sphere. There has been an arranged break-in and a burglary of those offices. The questions have to be asked: Is Robert Baudino the Charles Colson of the Liberal Party? Is Tony Eggleton the knowing receiver of stolen material? Did he realise that it was stolen? The New South Wales police now realise that it was stolen. There was only one copy of it. If it was stolen, what is Tony Eggleton &#39;s attitude? He is one of these great figures of the establishment; the erstwhile member of the Commonwealth Secretariat; a Press secretary for former Liberal Party Prime Ministers; and a confidante of the present Prime Minister. Did he realise that it was stolen material? Did he realise that his own organisation had arranged- or probably arranged- for this break-in to occur? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What is the attitude of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs to the fact that they are purveyors of stolen material themselves, that they are shunting stolen material right across the political landscape of Australia? This is a most serious charge levelled against the Government. It is levelled directly against the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs as a member of the Government, and the Prime Minister who has made these documents public. It is a serious charge against the Minister sitting at the table and a serious charge against the whole Liberal Party organisation. The Liberals may guffaw and try to write the issue off, but it is quite clear that there has been a burglary. It is now being investigated by the New South Wales Police. The material stolen was received by the Liberal Party. It was rewritten by the Liberal Party. It was purveyed by the Liberal Party. If honourable members opposite can be happy in government that their organisation, their Prime Minister and their Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs are the purveyors of stolen material, well, they can laugh their heads off. But I know that if it had been the Labor Party in this position it would have been hounded out of office and howled down for the Watergate-style activities which are involved here. </para>
          <para>A document was tabled in the Senate today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> and I will read from it. It is from the Liberal Party of Australia. It states: </para>

            <para>The ALP plans (attached) are particularly relevant in respect to current grandstanding by Hayden and Young about unemployment. The campaign strategy points to the hypocrisy of the Labor Parliamentarians- while they are professing their concern about the unemployed, their Party&#39;s campaign &#39;blueprint&#39; virtually ignores unemployment as an election issue. </para>

          <para class="block">In other words, the Liberal Party secretariat is claiming that it is the circulator of this paper which purports to indicate what is in the earlier part of this letter. So any allegations which are seen to be allegations by my leader, or by me; that the Liberal Party is the source and the receiver of this stolen material, are in fact well and truly indicated in this letter- this filthy, snivelling letter written by that corrupt mind, Eggleton, to these corrupt criminals on the front bench of the Liberal Party. </para>

              <para>- That is fair enough, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> because you would not have got a withdrawal anyway. Let me go on to say this: The Liberal Party really has made a gaffe on this occasion. It has put its foot right in it. It has mounted a burglary of the Labor Party&#39;s advertising agency. It has stolen material from the Labor Party. It has rewritten that material and has tried to pass it off as a Labor Party document. It has had its agent wandering around the Press Gallery and handing it out as though it was an authentic Labor Party document. Obviously, it is just part of the dirty tricks campaign which Tony Eggleton and the other thieves over there are thinking up. They are people who have no more integrity than the people who were convicted in the United States for breaking into the Democratic Party campaign headquarters. That matter went to the  President  of the United States and he was finally dragged out of office. It is not too fine a point to say that the present Prime Minister is far more directly linked to this burglary than Richard Nixon was ever linked - </para>

              <para>- I will withdraw that and make it clear that there is a direct link between the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and the burglary in Sydney in that he is purveying a document in Parliament and quoting from it as &#39;the Combe report&#39;, a page of which could only have been stolen from the advertising agency. The sort of letter which we now see published by the Liberal Party is part of a general campaign to besmirch and smear the Labor Party and to gain some kind of political espionage advantage for the Liberal Party at the cost of the Australian Labor Party. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs- a man without any reputation in this House, a man who sold the Aborigines down the drain in Queensland and had to be shifted from his portfolio, a man who is a gigolo of the Prime Minister, a hired gun, a smart mouth who will come in here and say and do anything- is now tied up with a criminal action involving a police investigation of a burglary of an advertising agency representing the Australian Labor Party. This is a serious and sad day for the Australian Parliament. It is a serious and sad day for Australian democracy. But it is a more serious day for the Liberal Party of Australia, for its Federal secretariat, for Baudino, for its parliamentary party, for its Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and for the Prime Minister. The motion moved by the Opposition should be carried, and carried with acclamation. </para>

              <para>- I raise a point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> about the inconsistency of your conduct of affairs in the House this morning. There was unbridled misbehaviour when I was speaking and you scarcely noted it. You are now lecturing the Opposition about a proper standard of conduct- something that I applaud but, I suggest to you, something that has arrived rather belatedly. These people on the other side of the House behaved like street-corner louts this morning - </para>

              <para>-What I said at the outset of my reply to the censure motion was that the document which came into the hands of the Liberal Party of Australia came from a Labor Party source. I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> instead of looking for a scapegoat on this side of the House, should look for the Judas within his own ranks. That is what he should be doing. Let me also make some facts absolutely clear. The document from which I quoted the day before yesterday was a document typed by the Liberal Party of Australia from the source material to which the Leader of the Opposition refers. That is what he refers to as a bogus document. But it is quite clear from what the Leader of the Opposition has said today that the authenticity of the contents of this document has been verified. There is no question whatsoever about that. I table the papers to which I have referred in the House. The front page is a frontispiece typed by the Liberal Party. The headings are typed by the Liberal Party. All the contents of the document are authentic from the source material as verified by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- Let the Leader of the Opposition deny the authenticity of the contents of that document. He cannot do so, of course, because he knows from his own checking that the contents are correct. Perhaps, when I referred to the Combe report, I should have referred to the Mullins report- the report from Mullins, Clarke and Ralph Pty Ltd. There is no question that the material was prepared by the advertising people of the Labor Party, the propagandists for the Labor Party, and was available to the Labor Party. So what we clearly have here today is an attempt by a classic smear campaign to overcome the Labor Party&#39;s own inefficiencies. </para>

          <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition said that there are strategy papers which have been drawn together by the Labor Party, and they are the documents to which I referred. I also inform the House of advice that I received this morning. On 12 November five other offices in the building occupied by Mullins, Clarke and Ralph (NSW) Pty Ltd were burgled- broken into- and had cash stolen. On 13 November it was reported that only cash had been stolen. Further up the street, in the permanent building society building nine other offices were broken into. Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that the burglar who is supposed to have stolen the Labor Party advertising document did a magnificent cover-up by burgling 13 other offices? As my colleague in the Senate, the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick),</inline> pointed out, this particular document has been circulating since some time in Octoberwell before the burglary of that building on 12 November. The document was known widely to be available. So much for a very transparent attempt to label the material as bogus material, to label the document as a bogus document and to allege that somebody within the Labor Party burgled the premises of Mullins, Clarke and Ralph Pty Ltd. </para>
          <para>It is also apparent that this censure motion, transparent as it is, is a last desperate throe by the Leader of the Opposition to regain some credibility within his own party. The document to which I have referred, under the heading of ALP and &#34;Swinging&#34; Voter&#39;, shows the crass stupidity and the rank hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the fact that its Leader holds no credibility whatsoever within the Party or among members of the back bench, who are sitting mute at the moment.

          <para class="block">It is a strange phenomenon that every time a Labor Party document is leaked it is alleged that there has been a break-in; yet every time a Liberal Party document is leaked, it is a leak. What has happened in this case is that a leak has developed within the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition has quickly gone to water. I suggest that not only can he not walk on water but he cannot even swim through the engulfment surrounding him at the moment. When we come back for the autumn sitting, every day that the Leader of the Opposition sits in this House Bob Hawke will be breathing so closely down his neck and he will be so worried that there is no possibility at all that he will be able to have a profile within the House or amongst the voters. </para>

              <para>- I think I will invite the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> to be the first one to put some money on that bet. As I was saying, the Labor Party, instead of facing up squarely to its own internal shortcomings, seeks to escape into the realms of fantasy. Today we have witnessed a transparent and, if I might say so, stupid attempt to contrive a political scapegoat. As I have said before, instead of looking for scapegoats in this House, the Labor Party would be well advised to search out the Judas within its own ranks. What warped minds and imaginations came up with this preposterous allegation of a break-in by the Liberal Party? Only the Labor Party could dream up allegations of this kind. It dreamed up an allegation when supposedly there was a burglary at Curtin House last year. That has gone the same way as this allegation will go. Shades of the stupidity that gave us the Iraqi breakfast that we all remember so well. It is one thing for a political party to try to cover up for its political embarrassment, but today&#39;s performance really demonstrates the depths to which the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition feel they must go; the depths to which the leadership of the Labor Party in this House has sunk. That is why I am prepared to put my money on Bob Hawke. One could almost feel sorry for Labor members if they were not so malicious and deceptive in what they say. The facts I gave to this House at the outset of my speech show that the allegations that this is a bogus document and that there has been a burglary by the Liberal Party are transparent because of their crass stupidity. </para>

          <para>The Labor Party has been wounded. Everybody in the Press Gallery of this House knows that the Labor Party has been wounded by the revelation of this document and the revelation of what the Labor Party and its propagandists think about the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition. That is why, when this document became notorious from the fact that I referred to it in this House, the Leader of the Opposition scrambled around the corridors of this Parliament so fast that he scattered the dust everywhere. He has not been able to come up with anything of any credibility. Because of the truth of this matter, as I have given it to the House, it is clear that a monstrous charade has been perpetrated on this House and a monstrous charge without any foundation has been made against me, against the Government and against the Liberal Party. There is no reason at all why this censure motion should be accepted and it will be defeated when a vote is taken. </para>

            <para>-What this House is dealing with is a crime. It is not just a crime directed against the Labor Party; it is a crime directed against the very fabric of our political structure. What are the demonstrable facts? The first demonstrable fact is that there was a break-in into the offices of the organisation carrying out work for and on behalf of the Labor Party. It is a demonstrable fact that material was taken from a safe in that office and that the material which the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> has relied on in this House was obtained from that safe, because there was no other place where the material was recorded. </para>

          <para>Let us deal with the credibility of this Minister because not the least serious of the aspects of this matter is that the Minister has lied to the Parliament, clearly and deliberately. Let me quote what this Minister said in the Parliament last Tuesday, as recorded at page 3178 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> You were in the chair at the time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> The Minister described this document as the Combe strategy paper. He did not use the term &#39;documents&#39;. He did not talk about a number of documents. He described the document as the Combe strategy paper referring to swinging voters. The Minister in the House today has admitted that there was no one document. He has admitted that the document which was circulated to the Press was typed by the Liberal Party. It is a document based upon a stolen document and it is a document that emanated from within the Liberal Party. The Minister knows that it is one document and last Tuesday when he stood in this House and lied to this Parliament he knew that he was using a document which was the fabrication of his own party, and he admitted that today. The best he could say today was that the document was verified. By whom was it verified? Was it verified by some of his ministerial colleagues, one of whom had to be stood down because of his sleazy operations with land developers who were slinging into the slush funds of the Liberal Party? </para>

              <para>- The Minister for Health is entitled to defend another Minister who has been caught in the act of lying but he does his own honour and credibility no good at all. As a lawyer who has acted for criminals in the past he is entitled to try to defend a Minister against his criminal actions in this matter. They are criminal actions. It is very simple: If an employee of this Government receives a stolen document he is a receiver of stolen goods and the Government will prosecute him. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has used a document which he admits was a Liberal Party fabrication. He tried to produce the document and use it in the Parliament knowing at the time he so used it that the document was a Liberal Party fabrication. He knew at the time that it had been produced in the offices of his own party. Yet he walked into the </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">Parliament, gave the document a title which he knew as false, and purported to use the document in a debate in a way that was grossly misleading and untrue, having regard to the Minister&#39;s own state of knowledge which he admitted to the Parliament today. </para>
          <para>I ask any honourable member to look at the statements made by the Minister in the Parliament last Tuesday. On any honest and objective assessment there can be no doubt that what the Minister was purporting to do was to say: &#39;Here is a document. It is called the Combe report. &#39; He even gave it a title. He said: &#39;It ought to be accepted as evidence in this House of the strategy and the attitudes of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party.&#39; I noted his statements today. He now says that the document that he used in that way last Tuesday was typed by the Liberal Party of Australia. He also said that the document was not collated by the Labor Party into a compendious document. </para>
          <para>What he is saying very seriously today when he is the subject of a censure motion is that a series of separate documents came into the hands of the Liberal Party Federal Organisation who put it together. Obviously, officers of the Liberal Party put it together. Who gave it the title? It had no title when first obtained by the Liberal Party. That was admitted by the Minister today. Who called it the Combe report? It was the officers of the Liberal Party or the Minister who purported to present that document to the Parliament on the basis that it was an original Labor Party document, titled the Combe report. At the time of making that statement the Minister knew that he was lying to the Parliament. </para>
          <para>The Minister is a self-confessed liar. It is as simple as that. It does not come as any surprise to any of us on this side of the House. We have seen the Minister shamelessly use personal correspondence. We have seen him smear and malign people outside the Parliament. His difficulty was that last Tuesday he did not know that the document which was a Liberal Party fabrication contained material which was not even available to the Labor Party. It contained material in a safe which was broken into. The House is entitled to hear from the Minister who verified the document. Did he believe that it was an authentic document? At no stage did the Minister attempt to tell us that. He has lied to the Parliament. He has attempted to deceive the Parliament. He has done so in a way that demeans this institution and the whole of our political process. That is a serious matter. It is not a matter to be treated in some jocular way. </para>
          <para>This Government is so desperate that any rules can now be broken. There are no rules governing political behaviour in this society. There is no element of honour or decency left when a Minister of the Crown can use in the Parliament a document which he knows is a fabricated concoction which has come out of the office of his own Party. He knew that last Tuesday. He has admitted knowledge of that today. He stands condemned. When one looks at the parliamentary record one sees that he tried to foist on the Parliament and people of Australia the view that this was a document that emanated from the headquarters of the Labor Party. Has a more mean, despicable and dishonourable act ever been committed by a Minister of the Parliament? Ministers opposite try to laugh it off and say that it is not a serious matter. After all, it is only a break-in! I suppose that it is all right to break into Labor Party headquarters! The Minister for Health chooses to associate himself with these actions. He is equally to blame. I would have thought that any selfrespecting Minister in any self-respecting government would not condone the introduction into our political life of Nixon-style break-ins. Such a Minister should not condone Ministers who in this House act in a way which would do great credit to Richard Nixon. The Minister for Health is a lawyer. I am sorry, I have just been informed by my colleague that he is not a lawyer. If he looked at last Tuesday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard he</inline> would know that on any reasonable and logical conclusion - </para>

              <para>- He will not be an honourable man if he continues to associate himself with a Minister who has lied to the Parliament, and who is not able to verify a document, portion of which could only be obtained by a criminal act. It is as simple and as clear as that. The House is entitled to expect a better standard of conduct. Whatever the differences that exist in either political philosophy or social belief, if within the Parliament and the Government we cannot establish what is to be regarded as essentially proper and honest political behaviour then our political system is in deep trouble. What the Minister has done in an attempt to smear the Labor Party is to involve himself in actions which are throughly dishonourable and criminal and which demean him and his government. The Minister does not escape today simply by repeating the false and specious allegations and relying upon the numbers of the Government to carry him through. If the Government is prepared to use its numbers on this occasion, as undoubtedly it will, it is demeaning this institution and the whole concept of political honesty and fair play. It is doing untold damage to our political structure. The Minister has lied to the Parliament and to the people of Australia. He deserves the strongest censure of this House. </para>

I have very little doubt that that is what has happened. In this Parliament and in the Press, documents are being quoted continuously that have been leaked from one source or another. Leaking is a despicable act. It is as despicable in the Labor Party as it can be in our party. The Opposition should face up to the fact that that is the real issue. Let us see what the facts are.

              <para>-I remind honourable members that the document has a frontispiece, if I can call it that, which admittedly was prepared and typed by the Liberal Party secretariat. There are headings to a number of sections on the next page, two of which state: &#39;ALP Themes&#39; and Pre-Campaign and Campaign Proper&#39;. There are headings to other sections of this document. It is not in dispute that those headings were put in the document by the Liberal Party. What is clear, however, is that, apart from that, the contents of this document, which has been tabled and is the subject of debate, were in the hands of the Liberal Party secretariat as long ago as early October. I rely on Tony Eggleton for that information, and I stand on his word. The contents of this document have been in the hands of the Liberal Party secretariat since early October. That gives the complete lie to the assertions that have been made in this House today. </para>

              <para>-I did not want to repeat what I was saying, but it really is the basis of this whole debate. The substance of this document, which is the subject of the censure motion today, has been in the possession of the Liberal Party secretariat, according to Tony Eggleton, since early October. There is no question that the Opposition admits that the substance of this document- that is to say, the various parts of itcomes from strategy documents prepared by or for the Labor Party. In other words, it came out of its own camp. There is no question about that. </para>

              <para>- Members of the Opposition are really in a bind. On the one hand, they want to say that we stole the document out of a safe on the night of 12 November, when apparently there were five other burglaries involving the pinching of cash in the same building and nine others in the same street, according to the information we have been given. Opposition members say that we pinched the document, yet in the next argument they say: &#39; It is not our document&#39;. What are they talking about? They should make up their minds whether it is their document or not. Of course, it comes out of their stable. </para>

It has come out because somebody in the Labor Party stable has been disloyal. That is how it has come out, just as documents are leaked out of the Public Service and out of the Liberal Party because people are disloyal. Honourable members opposite are entitled to feel upset about that, but they should not use it as a basis for attacking this Government. </para>

              <para>- Really, I felt sorry for the Leader of the Opposition. He was a policeman. It is no wonder that he left the force. He thinks there are self-respecting burglars. I was awakened, I think it was earlier this year, by a burglar. I did not find him self-respecting. I have seen burglars from time to time, in court and outside, but never have I seen a self-respecting burglar. No doubt that is why the Leader of the Opposition left the police force. But what a pity he did not continue with his law course. If he had done so he would not have attempted to put his brief before this Parliament today. It is a baseless, unfounded brief. It has no substance. What is right at the heart of this matter is the fact that whether this document belongs to the Labor Party or to its advisers- it has under a heading which relates to the swinging voter- it constitutes what is basically a slander on the average Australian. No wonder Opposition members are embarrassed. It also throws grave and serious doubt on the capacity of the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

          <para>We can understand Opposition members being embarrassed when they read in this document that the swinging voter is vaguely interested in what the Leader of the Australian Labor Party stands for but so far does not have a clue. Of course, that is an admission that the Leader of the Opposition is not getting through to the average Australian, that he is having no effect on the average Australian. No wonder honourable members opposite feel embarrassed. No wonder, on what we understand will be the last day of this session of Parliament, they are driven to desperation to bring forward a motion such as this in this way. </para>

They are not interested in unemployment; they are not interested in anything but themselves; they are ill-informed; they are generally selfish. They are the sorts of people to whom the Labor Party, according to its own advisers, is trying to appeal. This is a slander on the average Australian. I would like to believe that the average Australian is interested, that the swinging voter is interested in unemployment and in all the big issues that face us.

We have just had an example of what happens when members- Ministers or otherwise- get to their feet without being called. There is then haranguing across the table. I will not have it.

            <para>- I was not in the House at the time but I was informed when I returned to the House, particularly by the boys, the members, on the Government side, that I had stolen the document that had been tabled. What happened was that, when the document was tabled, I went to the  Clerk  of the House and asked whether I could have the document. I took that document, with the knowledge of that officer, and handed it directly to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding)-</inline> he was the next  speaker  on the Opposition side- to examine the document. That document never left that table. That was the situation. I later left the chamber. At no time did I remove the document from the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> what concerns me - </para>

            <para>-The honourable member for Reid will remain silent. The Minister has quite properly withdrawn any imputation whatsoever about which the honourable member for Reid may be sensitive. But I think that what has been said is worth saying because although it was said in jest- not by the Minister but by interjectors around the House- what is said in jest, when in print, does not have the sense of fun in which it was said. I assure the honourable member for Reid that what was said was in fun. I do not believe that it was said by the Minister but by a number of interjectors. </para>

            <para>- I take the point that has been made by the honourable member. I do not think, one way or the other, that there is any point that may lay against any honourable member or any Minister. In fact, it is a discretion of the Chair, when the adjournment question is put, whether the Chair proposes a question to adjourn the debate to a later hour that day or another day of sitting. Generally, that discretion rests in the Chair and if there is any error it might have been because of me. I apologise to the House. I will have the record corrected if a correction is needed. </para>

            <para>-For the information of honourable members, I present a response by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> and myself to the Sixth Special Report of the Joint Committee on Publications entitled The Australian Government Publishing Service and its role in Commonwealth printing and publishing 1964-1978&#39;. On 23 November 1978, the Joint Committee on Publications presented its Sixth Special Report, entitled &#39;The Australian Government Publishing Service and its Role in Commonwealth Printing and Publishing 1964-78&#39;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline>and I gave the report our earnest consideration. However, because of the fact that most of the recommendations contained in the report came within the province of the Government we withheld our comments until the Executive&#39;s response was made to the Parliament. This response was given on 18 October 1979. As expected, most of the Executive Government&#39;s comments related to the internal administrative arrangements connected with the AGPS, the Government Printer, the Department of Administrative Services, and user departments and authorities. Nevertheless, there are certain matters of principle affecting the Parliament to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> and I wish to refer. I suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have the terms of response incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> rather than have me read it out. </para>
          <para class="italic">
            <inline font-style="italic">The response read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>The first relates to the Government&#39;s response to Recommendation 1 of the Report. Recommendation 1 is as follows: </para>
          <para>That at the commencement of each Session of Parliament, a Resolution be agreed to by both Houses of Parliament similar to the following: </para>
          <para>That the Government Printer be responsible to the Presiding Officers for the printing of all Parliamentary publications and be provided with the necessary resources to meet Parliamentary printing requirements. That at all times, the Government Printer give priority to Parliamentary work. </para>
          <para class="block">The question whether a Resolution be adopted by the Parliament as recommended by the Committee, is, of course, a matter for the Parliament itself to determine, and we do not presume to comment on that particular aspect. Rather, our concern lies in the Government&#39;s response to the recommendation. </para>
          <para>With respect to the Government&#39;s comments on the status of the Government Printing Office, we acknowledge that, in relation to the strict administrative responsibilities of Government and its overall publishing requirements, the Government Printer is an agency of Government. However there has been a long-established practice, dating as far back as the establishment of the Printing Office in Canberra, that the necessary priorities of Parliament have been accepted and have constituted a considerable element in the functioning of that Office. We agree with the Government&#39;s comment that the working arrangements for the printing of parliamentary publications have proved satisfactory and we shall be anxious, and vigilant, to ensure that, with mutual co-operation, they remain so. </para>
          <para>The next matter of concern also relates to the principle declared above. Recommendation 10 of the Committee&#39;s Report states: </para>
          <para>That the Government Printing Office, wherever possible, operate its plant and associated personnel in such a way as to achieve the most effective utilisation of these resources. </para>
          <para class="block">The Government, in accepting the recommendation, emphasises difficulties which might be expected from time to time through changes in Government policies, workloads and priorities. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> and I would expect that changing workloads and priorities of the Parliament would require similar consideration. </para>
          <para>The theme of Government decision-making directed towards Executive rather than parliamentary requirements is continued in the responses to recommendations 92 to 97. The nub of the Committee&#39;s attempt to combine administrative flexibility with accountability to the Parliament may be summarised as follows: </para>
          <para>That a Board of Review be established on an inter-departmental basis to supervise Commonwealth printing and publishing, in accordance with a Charter of Responsibilities to be drawn up by Cabinet after consultation where appropriate, with the Presiding Officers; that a permanent secretary and support staff be provided by AGPS; and that the Board report at least annually to the Joint Committee on Publications. </para>
          <para class="block">The Government decided not to accept the Committee &#39;s recommendation to establish the Board of Review, adopting instead the creation of a Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Government Printing and Publishing. While we appreciate that such a decision was the Government&#39;s to make, we are concerned that, in accepting the proposal of the Committee for a Charter of Responsibilities, the Government has decided that Parliament be excluded from consultation in the drafting of a Charter in so far as that Charter affects the Parliament. Further, there will be no requirement for the IDC to report to Parliament through the Joint Publications Committee. </para>
          <para>The Parliament, having special requirements and responsibilities distinct from the Executive, should, in our opinion, be involved in framing the parliamentary aspects of the Charter. We note that the views of the Publications Committee, as expressed in the Report, will be taken into account when the Charter is prepared. Clearly, however, the modifications imposed by the Government&#39;s decision to establish an IDC will necessitate Parliament&#39;s taking a more active role in formulating the Charter. We believe that this role should be undertaken either by the Presiding Officers, as recommended by the Committee, or by the Committee itself. The Government&#39;s failure to provide a formal mechanism for specialist parliamentary scrutiny of publishing activities is also of concern to us. </para>
          <para>The final matter of principle we wish to raise relates to the Government&#39;s response to recommendation 108, which states: </para>
          <para>That the Standing Orders of both Houses of Parliament be amended to enable the Joint Committee on Publications to: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(i)">
              <para>move from place to place; and </para>
              <list type="lowerroman">
                <item label="(ii)">
                  <para>form itself into a sub-committee when considered necessary. </para>
                </item>
              </list>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Government rightly points out that this matter is one for the Parliament to determine. We therefore find it curious that the Government has chosen to proffer the comment that it sees no need for a power to move from place to place. We note that the Committee has previously sought and obtained the permission of the Parliament to move from place to place. We, of course, would be guided by any decision made by both Houses, and would ensure that, within the limits of financial and staffing constraints, the wishes of the Houses if the amendments proposed by the Committee were accepted, would be respected. We propose to take the recommendation of the Committee to the Standing Orders Committee of each House for consideration. </para>
          <para class="block">Other matters arising from the Report: </para>
        </speech>
        <para>Recommendation 70:</para>
        <para>That the Parliament undertake an investigation into the requirements of a complete inquiry and information service for the general public and that the results of such an inquiry be laid before the Parliament as soon as possible. </para>
        <para class="block">Comment: This is a matter for the Parliament to determine. </para>
        <para>Recommendations 106 and 107:</para>
        <para>That the Presiding Officers continue their examination of the most suitable computer information retrieval system for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>
        <para>That all necessary resources be provided to ensure that the introduction of a suitable computer information retrieval system is introduced into the Parliament at the earliest practical time. </para>
        <para>Both of these recommendations have been taken into account in the preparation of a brief to commission an information systems consultant to investigate the information systems of the Parliament. The consultant is expected to begin his investigation in March 1 980. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, we note with satisfaction that the Government has already implemented recommendation 42 of the Committee &#39;that a mail order service for Members of Parliament be introduced and operated by AGPS Bookshops, excluding Canberra&#39;. We understand that the service has already proved of great assistance to Members and Senators. </para>
        <para>We reiterate our concern, however, that the Government should recognise the practical extent of the Government Printer&#39;s responsibilities to the Parliament as an institution. </para>

              <para>- Honourable members will recall that that the Committee was established by the Government in February 1978 to consider whether principles and measures could be drawn up to promote the avoidance and, if necessary, the resolution of conflict of interest situations in regard to those who hold public office in the Commonwealth sphere. The members of the Committee were the Chief Judge of the Federal Court of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nigel</inline> Bowen, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Cecil</inline> Looker and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Cain, all persons of widely recognised experience and ability. The terms of reference were drawn up broadly to allow maximum scope for the Committee to explore this difficult subject. The Committee has produced a comprehensive and commendable report. The report contains a full examination of the complex and often sensitive issues involved and provides detailed recommendations on additional measures for the regulation of conflicts of interest. In view of the many and sometimes complex recommendations, the Government felt it desirable to give the report very careful consideration in order that it might indicate at the outset the position it has taken on the various recommendations. The Government believes that this will assist the consideration of the report by honourable members and by other persons pending the next sittings of Parliament when there will be an opportunity to debate the matter. </para>
            </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The report covers the whole range of persons who hold office in the Parliament and the Executive. Its recommendations affect members of parliament, Ministers, public servants, statutory office-holders and associated staff. I shall refer collectively to these persons- as the report does- as office-holders. The keystone of the report is a Code of Conduct which should apply to all office-holders. The report contains detailed proposals for the implementation of the Code in regard to the various categories of office-holders. The establishment of new parliamentary committees is proposed, and also special machinery to investigate alleged misconduct in a limited number of cases. New rules are proposed to avoid undesirable conflicts of interest in regard to the movement of officials from government service to the private sector. The Government has accepted virtually the whole of the Committee&#39;s recommendations in regard to Ministers, public servants and other officials. </para>
          <para>Other recommendations will be of more direct concern to the Parliament, touching as they do on Parliament, its procedures and its members. Whilst the Government is, generally speaking, favourably disposed towards those recommendations, it would wish to see them considered and debated in the Parliament before any decisions are taken. The Code of Conduct to which I referred embodies principles to be observed by all office-holders. In view of their importance I propose to read them. They are: </para>

          <para class="block">The Government has accepted the Code in principle as the basis for particular action to be taken in regard to particular categories of officeholders. The Code is a statement of the broad principles to which effect will be given, in the first place, in relation to Ministers, public servants and other officials. The Government accepts, as the report proposes, that every effort should be made to secure the widest possible familiarity with an observance of the Code. I draw attention in particular to the fourth principle in the Code, which requires disclosure by an office-holder of an interest he possesses which conflicts or might reasonably be thought to conflict with his public duty, or improperly to influence his conduct in the discharge of his responsibilities in respect of some matter with which he is concerned. Other principles spell out clearly the obligation that rests on those who hold public office to avoid taking advantage of their position for their private gain. The emphasis on the disclosure by an office-holder of a possible conflict between a particular private interest and public duty in relation to a particular matter is fundamental to the approach adopted in the report. This approach places a clear obligation on an office-holder to keep under consideration the possibility of conflicts of interest and to declare any such conflict at the appropriate time. </para>
          <para>The Government recognises that declaration of private interests will involve an intrusion upon the privacy of those involved, including in some circumstances the privacy of family members. This is a price that has to be paid in the interests of the accountability and integrity of public administration. Concern to minimise the intrusion upon privacy is one of the factors that led the Committee to recommend against the adoption of a general scheme for the registration of interests. The Committee pointed out that a general register is directed to the contingency that an interest might affect an office-holder&#39;s actions. It concluded that the proper practice should be aimed at revealing an interest when it does so, that is, by declaration of an interest when a possible conflict arises. The Committee expressed grave doubts about whether it would be possible to devise a register so as to eliminate lawful avoidance. It concluded that to introduce a register which could easily be avoided would fail to achieve any useful objective; it would be little more than political &#39;window dressing&#39;. </para>
          <para>The Government finds the arguments against a general register compelling and does not propose to adopt that approach. As I have stated, the emphasis will be on disclosure of interestsdisclosure is all that a register is about- when the relevance of a particular interest becomes apparent. That is the time when disclosure serves a purpose; to alert others to the existence of a possible conflict so that appropriate action can be taken in consequence. The report proposes that the Code should be implemented by means of standing orders, resolutions, staff rules and guidelines as appropriate for the various categories of office-holders, and that enforcement of the Code should be built into existing discpilinary procedures for those categories. </para>
		  <para>
		    <inline font-style="bold">Members of Parliament</inline>
		  </para>
          <para>The recommendations in regard to the Code of Conduct and members of parliament are broadly as follows: </para>
          <para>That each House be invited to adopt the Code in its Standing Orders or by resolution; </para>
          <para>That this House be invited to consider the desirability, in considering the recommendations about declarations by members, of strengthening Standing Order 196 which presently provides that a member shall not vote on certain matters in which he has a pecuniary interest; </para>
          <para>That both Houses be invited to consider adopting requirements for disclosure of interests in debate along the lines of a House of Commons resolution; </para>
          <para>That both Houses be invited to consider including provisions about the time when declarations should be made and the recording of declarations when made; and </para>
          <para>That the House and Senate be invited to consider their relevant Standing Orders to see if any amendment is required to avoid conflicts of interest in respect of Committee members. </para>
          <para class="block">I should note that the report contemplates that a member should be required to abstain from voting or speaking in exceptional circumstances only- normally a declaration of interest should be sufficient- and that divestment of interests is hardly an option for members except possibly in exceptional circumstances in relation to membership of certain committees. The report recommends that each House consider the adoption of a practice that would apply to the Presiding Officers similar rules as are proposed for Ministers in regard to retention of outside interests. The report also makes proposals for the application of the Code of Conduct to the staff of members of Parliament. The Government sees merit in action along the lines proposed for members and their staff, including, in particular, action to clarify or strengthen the obligation upon members to declare pecuniary interests that are relevant to matters upon which they speak in debate. However, as I have already indicated, the Government proposes to defer further consideration of these matters until there has been opportunity for them to be debated. </para>
          <para>I should add that the report recommends review of the provisions in the Constitution that provide for disqualification of members, that is, sections 44 (iv), 44 (v) and 45 (iii) of the Constitution. The Government has referred this matter to the Attorney-General for examination and report. </para>
		  <para>
		    <inline font-style="bold">Ministers</inline>
		  </para>
          <para>The report recommends that the application of the Code to Ministers be recognised by a letter from the Prime Minister to each Minister and recommends the reinforcement and extension of existing arrangements for the avoidance of conflicts by Ministers, and for declarations of interest, in relation both to the administration of their departments and to Cabinet business. Ministers would be required in certain circumstances to divest themselves of shares and similar interests. The report recommends that the current practice by which Ministers are required to inform the Prime Minister of their interests should be continued and that additional items should have to be disclosed. It is recommended also that existing guidelines concerning gifts received by Ministers should be continued and guidelines concerning acceptance of sponsored overseas travel should be drawn up. </para>
          <para>The Government has accepted the recommendations in regard to Ministers and steps are being taken to implement them. Ministers will be required to inform the Prime Minister of their interests in companies, trusts, partnerships and real estate and of their liabilities other than ordinary short term credit arrangements. As recommended in the report, the returns of Ministers&#39; disclosures of interests will continue to be made to the Prime Minister but will be kept for him on a confidential basis, by the Secretary to Cabinet. The Prime Minister will be able to consult senior Ministers in relation to those returns if he sees the need. As has been the position hitherto, Ministers will have to disclose to their colleagues interests that would conflict with their duty in relation to a matter under consideration by Cabinet. </para>
          <para>Disclosure to the Prime Minister will also be called for, so that appropriate action can be taken, where there could be conflict of interest in regard to a Minister&#39;s direction of the business of his Department. In some instances the possibility of such conflict will call for divestment by a Minister of shares or other interests. Requirements similar to those applying to Ministers are proposed for ministerial staff members and the Government has accepted those proposals too. </para>
		  <para>
		    <inline font-style="bold">Public Servants</inline>
		  </para>
          <para>In regard to public servants, the report recommends that the Public Service Board issue the Code as a general order or some other form of instruction, and that the Public Service Act and regulations should be reviewed to ensure consistency with the Code. There are specific recommendations in regard to declarations by a public servant to a designated officer of an interest which could conflict with his public duty, for the recording of such a declaration and either for the public servant to be authorised to proceed or for other arrangements to be made. The report also deals with steps to be taken to avoid the holding by an officer of interests which could conflict with the duties of his position. The report recommends action to clarify the position in regard to acceptance of certain gifts by the family of a public servant and in regard to acceptance of hospitality. The Government accepts these recommendations concerning public servants and the Public Service Board will consider and report to the Government on details of implementation.  </para>
		  <para>Other Categories</para>
          <para>The Government has also accepted the recommendations in the report regarding the application of the Code of Conduct to the Defence Force, parliamentary departments, consultants and contractors, statutory officeholders and the staffs of statutory officeholders and appropriate action will be set in train. Broadly speaking, members of the Defence Force and staff of the parliamentary departments will be required to observe requirements similar to those proposed for public servants. Amendments are proposed to the Public Service Board&#39;s document &#39;Consultants and Contractors for Services: Guidelines for Departments and Authorities&#39; to deal with the possibility of conflicts of interest arising with the engagement of consultants. The proposals in regard to statutory authorities are directed to introducing the requirements of the Code of Conduct, including such matters as avoidance or declaration of conflicts of interest, while having regard to the varying character and role of such authorities. Relevant provisions in the legislation establishing statutory authorities will also be reviewed. </para>
          <para>Machinery for dealing with conflict of interest cases </para>
          <para>The Committee&#39;s terms of reference required it to give consideration to the procedures that should be followed in determining whether there has been any breach of the standards of conduct required of those in public office. As I have indicated, the general approach  taken by the Committee in its report is that implementation and enforcement of the proposed new rules should be built into the existing framework and procedures relevant to the various classes of officeholders. The report recognises, however, that the established machinery for dealing with misconduct or misbehaviour on the part of officeholders may be inadequate or inappropriate in exceptional cases where a high degree of public concern is evident. The Committee saw a need in particular for strengthening the present arrangements for the investigation of allegations of conflicts between public duty and private interest concerning members and Ministers. The Committee concluded that special machinery should be established to deal with a very limited number of matters. </para>
		  <para>Parliamentary Ethics Committees</para>
          <para>The Committee has recommended in the first place the strengthening and formalising of the existing parliamentary machinery for dealing with allegations of conflict of interest concerning members. It has recommended that each House be invited to do this by establishing a Standing Ethics Committee empowered to report to the House from time to time on changes in the Code of Conduct and to receive, investigate and report upon complaints of departures by members from the Code. While considering those committee arrangements along the lines proposed may be called for, the Government will defer its consideration of the proposals until the Parliament has had an 
		  opportunity to debate them. </para>
		  <para>Public Integrity Commission</para>
          <para>Secondly, the Committee has recommended the establishment of special machinery- a Public Integrity Commission- to investigate cases where the ordinary machinery for dealing with misconduct or misbehaviour may be inappropriate or inadequate. The Commission would be a standing statutory body with powers of a royal commission. Its members would be part time and appointed by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. The Commission would not act on its own initiative but would investigate and report on matters referred by the Prime Minister concerning Ministers, by a House concerning a Minister or member, by the Public Service Board concerning a public servant or by a Minister concerning a statutory office-holder. </para>
          <para>The Commission would be required to report to the person or body by whom the matter was referred. The Commission&#39;s report would state the allegations that had been made, the nature of the misconduct in question, and its findings as to whether the allegations had been substantiated. Any disciplinary action in consequence of the facts found by the Commission would be the responsibility of the person or body by whom the matter was referred, not the Commission. The Commission would be an investigatory and factfinding body only. Provision would be made for reports of the Commission to be tabled in Parliament subject, the Government would have in mind, to appropriate qualification in any case where criminal action might follow. </para>
          <para>I emphasise that the Commission as proposed would deal with exceptional cases only. In the ordinary course, allegations of breaches of the Code would be dealt with by the relevant House, the Prime Minister, a Minister or the Public Service Board, as appropriate. The Government believes that a Commission of the kind proposed could be of value in exceptional cases. However, having regard to the proposed link between the Commission and the Parliament, the Government will give the matter further consideration following parliamentary debate on the report. </para>
          <para class="block">Post-separation Employment </para>
          <para class="block">The Committee was specifically requested to consider the question of the employment of former officials in the private sector following separation from government service. The report concluded that mobility from the public to the private sector may occasionally raise conflict of interest problems, and that there may be a need for a time lag before certain classes of officeholders take up particular forms of employment after leaving office. The report has accordingly proposed that senior public servants and certain other officials should obtain official consent if they wish to take up certain forms of employment in the private sector within two years after leaving government employment. Procedures would be laid down for an officer to apply to a committee of officials who would recommend to the appropriate Minister. There would be a discretion to reduce the two-year limit in particular cases. No restrictions are proposed on movement from the private to the public sector. </para>
          <para>The Government agrees with the views of the Committee that mobility between the public and and private sectors is in general unobjectionable and even desirable, but that in certain cases it may raise conflict of interest problems. The position of government employees who are involved in procurement and tendering processes is a case in point. The Government accepts the recommendations for restrictions in certain cases on the acceptance of post-separation employment, and for requirements in regard to the reporting of job offers, and action will be put in hand to implement them. In line with the views expressed by the Committee, additional legislation is not at this stage proposed for this purpose. </para>
		  <para>Criminal Law</para>
          <para class="block">The report makes proposals in regard to the criminal law to which I should refer. The Committee has recommended amendments to the present bribery provisions in the Crimes Act 1914. The amendments would extend those provisions to certain situations that may not be covered now, such as where a Commonwealth officer obtains a bribe for a third party, and to cover members of parliament. The Government has agreed to these proposals and will bring forward appropriate legislation in due course. The Committee has also recommended the amendment of the Crimes Act to make it an offence to misuse official information. This proposal, involving as it does the creation of a new offence in a complex area, will require detailed examination. </para>
          <para class="block">Categories excluded by Committee </para>
          <para class="block">The Committee refers in the report to certain categories of persons for which it has not proposed measures for the regulation of conflicts of interest. Those categories include federal judges, persons associated with media organisations and lobbyists. The Committee did raise the suggestion that bodies presently concerned with the maintenance of standards of conduct in the Australian media should consider adoption, with such modifications as may be necessary, of recommendations of the British Royal Commission on the Press 1977 which are relevant to the disclosure of interests. The British Royal Commission&#39;s recommendations covered, amongst other things, disclosure by a newspaper or periodical of its interests when reporting or commenting on matters in which its publishing group has a business interest. </para>
		  <para>Conclusion</para>
          <para class="block">As I indicated earlier, the report of the Committee covers a lot of ground and deals with difficult questions. It is apparent that the members of the Committee have put a great deal of effort into the inquiry and the report. On behalf of the Government, I express our appreciation to them. The matters dealt with by the Committee are of importance to the maintenance of proper standards by those holding public office and to the integrity of public administration. Honourable members will have an opportunity to consider these matters before they are debated in this House. In the meantime, the Government will proceed, as I said earlier, with the implementation of proposals made in the report that affect Ministers, public servants and other officials.

            </talker>
            <para>- The Opposition wants once again to put a number of matters before the Parliament. I say at the outset that I think the report is very weak. It is a very unsatisfactory report and one which I do not think we should adopt. There are reasons for my remarks. First of all, if we look at what is happening in the Parliaments in the States at present, we will notice that in Victoria an effort has been made to deal with this problem. In Victoria there is a register wherein members of parliament will disclose their pecuniary interests. If they do not do so, they are liable to a fine of $2,000 and are likely to be charged with contempt of Parliament. The Victorian legislation also provides for a code of ethics which sets out that all the financial interests of the families of the members of that Parliament also will be disclosed. So we see there an attempt, not completely satisfactory, but at least an attempt, to make it very clear that, if a person holds public office in Australia, his interests should be disclosed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Whilst we recognise the question of privacy and whilst we recognise the significance of having information disclosed, it is important to look at the matter from the point of view of democracy being strengthened to ensure that people elected to public office or appointed to public office do not get any financial gain by holding that office. That is one of the real issues that the Labor Party has been talking about. We have suggested that our own remuneration and emoluments should be adequate, indeed high enough, to guarantee that people will not be attracted to the idea of using their office to make substantial gain, either directly or indirectly, when it relates to their families. </para>
          <para>In New South Wales, it has recently been announced that, as from next year, all members of the Parliament will be required to register their assets with the  Clerk  of each House. I will indicate the nature of what that would mean. It would mean that, if a member had shares in companies or if he had debentures, they would need to be noted. All a member&#39;s sources of income and the capacity in which that income was derived would have to be noted. All the positions that a member held, whether in partnerships or professions, would be noted. All a member&#39;s interests in real property and the location of that property would be noted. All gifts exceeding $500 in value and all gifts which, in aggregate, exceeded $500 in value in any one year would be noted. Sponsored travel or holiday sponsorship where there was some suggestion of commercial link would have to be registered also. Overseas transactions relating to benefits that a member obtained either directly or indirectly would also have to be noted. Members would be required to make a statutory declaration of their interests for the previous year within three months of the appropriate motion being passed. I make this point: In New South Wales, any member who wilfully withholds information or who wilfully gives wrong information will be in contempt of Parliament and will be liable to suspension or expulsion. </para>

              <para>-Before the suspension of the sitting we were discussing the report of the committee of inquiry concerning the public duty and private interest of members of parliament and office holders. The Opposition is critical of the Government&#39;s attitude and the report. I was making the point that in Victoria and New South Wales there are much more stringent obligations on members of parliament to disclose in the register their pecuniary interests. The </para>

          <para class="block">Labor Party in its submission to the Bowen inquiry made the point that it did not think that it was too difficult to draw up a statement of principle to detect where private interests may conflict with public duty. In order to give a strong democracy a chance to survive we think it is essential that a register of pecuniary interests be made available to the public. Those of us who have been here for some time are also aware of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests, which was commonly known as the Riordan Committee. It was the committee which discussed this very matter. That Committee quite properly said the discovery and prevention of dishonesty was not the principal aim or perhaps not even an aim at all, of the proposal for declaration of members&#39; interests. However, action taken to restore, or perhaps to endow, the public with faith in the democratic process is essential. </para>
          <para>During the hearings of the Riordan Committee it was suggested by witnesses that stringent financial disclosure might deter potential candidates. The Committee said: </para>

              <para>-It was an excellent report. We have said before that people who want to go into public life should be encouraged so to do. We want the very best that we can get in Australia. They should be well paid and have adequate remuneration but we think that the suggestion that they should also have other sources of income, assets and other means whereby either they or members of their families will benefit through their office detracts from democracy. The public is entitled to know all the details of our pecuniary interests. I propose to move a motion in this regard at a later stage. </para>

          <para>The Committee that has produced the report has failed in what we would have liked to have seen achieved. I say this advisedly. The Committee may have felt that it was protecting us but I think that what it suggests in its report leaves us open to further problems of self-regulation. The Committee makes the point that self-regulation may be abused to the point that there is no regulation at all. Undoubtedly, one of the factors that encouraged the move for the imposition of a statutory obligation enforced by the court on members of Congress in the United States was a belief that in the past Congress was not prepared to discipline its own members. That was so even though facts showing serious misconduct were widely publicised. We can get into the same position if we make laws for ourselves which are different from those we make for other people. We should not be in that position. Whilst both Victoria and New South Wales have gone some way along the road towards public disclosure, we ought to go the full way. In the submission that the Labor Party made to the Bowen inquiry we said: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. there is an abiding public cynicism of politicians and the political process which can only be eradicated by firm action from the holders of public trust demonstrating that confidence is justified. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Government&#39;s proposals do nothing to restore public confidence in politicians or in the Parliament. The key weakness in the Government&#39;s decision is that there will be no public register outlining all the pecuniary interests of all members of parliament and their immediate families; nor is there any adequate penalty for failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest. The Cabinet is out of touch with reality. The public would say that the political arena has been discredited already, particularly over the last few years, by a lack of probity. There is not much point in trying to suggest that everything will be all right if the judicial commission were to be called the integrity commission. There is no hope with a slogan; we have to get to the fundamentals. I think that Government back benchers are a little closer to reality. They virtually laughed the suggestion out of the party room when it was proposed. I understand that the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> had to do something about it, with good cause. Even the Hamer Liberal Government in Victoria has gone further than this Government with its pecuniary interests legislation. </para>

              <para>-The South Australian Labor Government did too. The Wran Government in New South Wales is also doing something about establishing a register and implementing other measures which are far more stringent, as they should be, than what this Government now proposes. We think that the report is very weak. It can be deemed to have failed to grapple with the problem. It will only bring disgrace on us if we implement its recommendations. That is putting it mildly. There is only one way in which to solve the conflict between public duty and private interest, and that is by total disclosure. That was the tenor of our submission. Yet the Government not only is not prepared to support the rules of disclosure but also is prepared to take the view that this information should not be put on the public record. </para>

          <para>In the course of the Bowen inquiry the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> insisted on giving his evidence in camera. That set a very poor lead as to whether the Committee would be strong enough to talk about public disclosure. The Committee was invested with the task of resolving the conflict between public duty and private interest. I regret to say that it has come down very much on the side of private interest. The  Deputy  Prime Minister in his statement said: </para>

            <para>Concern to minimise the intrusion upon privacy is one of the factors that led the Committee to recommend against the adoption of a general scheme for the registration of interests. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In our submission we made the point that Labor policy is committed to legislation and constitutional reform to protect individual rights and the right to privacy. We are also committed to the right of the public to be informed about the processes of government. That is a superior right. It is one which we support. Clearly there can be a conflict between private interest and public duty. Let me refer to what the United States Deputy Comptroller stated in testimony before the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Government Relations of the House Committee on the Judiciary. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Obviously, the Congress faces a difficult dilemma in seeking to accommodate the policy considerations underlying requirements for public disclosure of personal financial information and the right of personal privacy which affects all of us. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Here the primary concern is promoting confidence in public officials through a code of ethics and full financial disclosure of their personal financial status. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the Labor Party&#39;s position. The reporting provisions in this report for members of parliament are totally inadequate. The Minister said: </para>

            <para>The Government finds the arguments against a general register compelling and does not propose to adopt that approach. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One could ask why the Government finds the arguments so compelling. It is the intention to protect the private interests of members, particularly Ministers, in the Parliament but not to take the public into our confidence, I see no real value in that sort of compulsion. We will have a situation of continual questioning in the Parliament, obviously encouraged by members of the public, when we try to find out from Ministers and what their interests are or whether there has been a conflict. A register of those interests would get over that problem. They would be known. We would not have the son of exercise that takes place in the House. The Deputy Prime Minister also said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee expressed grave doubts about whether it would be possible to devise a register so as to eliminate lawful avoidance. </para>
            <para class="block">I think that is an insulting situation. To suggest that we cannot devise a register whereby lawful avoidance will not take place is virtually to say that members of Parliament will be able to evade their obligations. To suggest that the Committee thought that does not help the situation and I am surprised that the Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia would create the impression, probably unwisely, that members of Parliament would take lawful or unlawful means to avoid publicly declaring their interests. If they did fail to declare their interests I am certain it would come out in public, and we would deal with them. In fact, they would be removed from public life. I do not think any member of Parliament would be anxious to avoid the register. </para>
            <para>The Opposition would introduce provisions requiring the disclosure of all shareholdings, directorships, interests in land, gifts, liabilities, and incomes of members of Parliament and their spouses and dependent children. In our view, any member of Parliament who tried to circumvent those provisions should face a substantial fine or imprisonment. In other words, that would be the end of his political career. The threat of imprisonment is the only way to bring out the honesty of a government. It is important to point out that what the  Deputy  Prime Minister has said will lead only to dishonesty, and we emphasise that point. Other countries- I instance Canada and the United States of America- are taking action to require the public disclosure of financial interests by Ministers. This Government takes the view that members of Parliament should disclose their interests only when they believe that those interests might conflict with their public duties. We have had this problem before. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted).</inline> I appreciate that extension of time. I did not look at the clock, and I thank the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> for that courtesy. The Opposition wishes to move an amendment. So that there is no further delay, I move: </para>
            <para>That all words after &#39;That&#39; be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: the Government be condemned for not making it obligatory for all Members of Parliament to disclose their pecuniary interest and that of their immediate families in a register available to the public&#39;. </para>
            <para class="block">That amendment is consistent with our submission and it is consistent with what I have been saying. I think it is the only way to provide some stability in what we are about. I will continue with the point I was making, and I will be brief. We have in public life what is called a shareholding provision. In this Parliament we deal with all sorts of interests that could well mean a rapid escalation on capital gain in certain areas, whether it be in the transport industries, Ansett Airlines of Australia or coal marketing. All these matters can be the subject of decision by governments. It does not augur well if there is a suggestion that the decision was made because of shareholding interests. If those interests are disclosed on a public register they will be obvious to all. But we will always run the gauntlet of it being said that it was done because of private interests. There were difficulties in the Government relating to what could be called the Victorian land revaluation and rezoning position, and a capital gain was made in certain circumstances which meant that a Minister had to leave his portfolio. That was not a Federal matter, but it related to the propriety of conduct on the basis of whether profit was made in circumstances in which it would not otherwise have been made. That brings odium to the situation. </para>
            <para>The Opposition is saying that this report is not a good one. It is a shoddy document. It does nothing to respond to the improprieties of people in office, and that includes all of us. The Committee was appointed to try to overcome the odium that attaches to this situation because of past behaviour. It has taken some two years to bring this report to light. The Committee and the Government are saying virtually that we have to go on in the way we did before. That is not good enough. I make the point that there should be public declaration by members of Parliament of all their interests, including their incomes and liabilities. The declarations should be tabled annually. Public servants advising the Government should declare their interests to their permanent head. The permanent head should declare his interests to his Minister. All advisers to Ministers and shadow Ministers should declare their interests to both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. It is for those reasons that I have moved the amendment. </para>

            <para>- by leave- The Commonwealth Government is concerned about the problems of young people in making the transition from school to work or to further education, and is prepared to join with the States and the Northern Territory in developing a comprehensive policy to assist them. The Commonwealth will provide additional grants to a total of $150m over five years for a special transition program involving matching contributions from the States and the Northern Territory in the later years. The Commonwealth&#39;s contribution in 1980 will be $25m, rising to $40m in real terms in 1984. It is envisaged that a range of developments in the interests of young people making the transition from school to employment will be stimulated or extended as a result of this initiative and that in the longer term the education system as a whole will become better geared to the needs of young people in the changing circumstances of the 1980s. Our primary concern is the 50,000 young people who now leave school each year with poor employment prospects. We wish to provide appropriate education and training courses for them and also tackle the problem of those in the schools who are likely to be in similar difficulties when it comes their turn to leave. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Developments likely to occur in 1980 with support from the Commonwealth&#39;s provision of an additional $25m include: </para>
          <para>Expansion and development of transition courses in technical and further education institutions, including pre-apprenticeship, prevocational and pre-employment courses. </para>
          <para>These would be full time courses up to one year in duration to prepare young people for vocations, particularly in the trades and technical occupations where shortages of skilled workers still exist. </para>
          <para>Expansion of the number of places available in the Education Program for Unemployed Youth-EPUY. </para>
          <para>It is expected that an additional 7,000 places could become available in these TAFE courses in 1980, with substantial further increases in later years. </para>
          <para>Development of improved services and techniques for identifying potential early school leavers. </para>
          <para>Expansion of school counsellor, vocational education and guidance services to provide more intensive and comprehensive assistance for students at risk and their parents. </para>
          <para>Development of alternative courses in schools for potential early leavers. </para>
          <para>Establishment of after-school and vacation programs of vocational education and counselling. </para>
          <para>Development of &#39;link&#39; courses involving students&#39; participation in programs combining elements of secondary and TAFE courses. </para>
          <para>Teacher development programs- in-service courses and re-orientation programs to fit numbers of teachers for their roles in the development and implementation of alternative courses and identification and counselling of at risk &#39;students. </para>
          <para>Community education projects to include increasing employers&#39; and parents&#39; understanding of school activities and programs to increase teachers&#39; awareness of specific employment requirements for new employees. </para>
          <para>The Government acknowledges that a number of measures is already available from the States and the Commonwealth to assist young people to be better prepared for the world of work. It considers, however, that there is a need for substantial changes and development in education, training and preparation for initial employment for a significant minority of young people who have unsatisfactory experiences at this important and formative stage of their lives. The Government has decided, therefore, to commence a program of special action directed to the transition from education to working life. </para>
          <para>The aim of the Commonwealth &#39;s policy is that ultimately all young people in the 15 to 19 years age group be provided with options in education, training and employment, or any combination of these, either part time or full time, so that unemployment becomes the least acceptable alternative. Progress towards this objective is seen as involving development of improved techniques for identifying children at school who are likely to be at risk in transition from education to work, improved vocational education and counselling services and provision of alternative courses for at risk* students. Other developments might include extension of work experience and community service programs involving students at school and of &#39;link&#39; courses combining elements of secondary and TAFE courses. Teacher development programs may need to be supplemented or adapted to prepare larger numbers of teachers to implement the changes successfully. In addition, expansion and development of TAFE programs, such as pre-apprenticeship and preemployment courses and the EPUY program, which contribute to the successful transition of young people to employment is regarded as an important element of a comprehensive transition education and training program. In the development of programs the Government would wish to see attention given to the particular problems which girls have in making the transition from education to employment. </para>
          <para>It will be important to the success of the new policy that effective guidance and counselling services be available. In addition to making some provision for this in the special funding arrangements, the Commonwealth wishes to review with the States the existing vocational guidance services to see how they can be improved and rationalised. Over a period the Commonwealth wishes to see the pattern of allowances and benefits for young people, and of related assistance to industry, reorganised to ensure that these separate measures provide the appropriate incentives to participation in education and training. This important aspect of a comprehensive policy is being examined, but we do not intend to withdraw or reduce the unemployment benefits presently available to young people. </para>
          <para>The developments the Commonwealth proposes follow from the consideration the Commonwealth and the States have been giving to issues in transition for some time. They are consistent with the deliberations of the Australian Education Council, which led the State, Northern Territory and Commonwealth Ministers for Education who constitute the Council, at its meeting last month, to endorse the need for a comprehensive policy on transition from school to work. In my capacity as Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs I was able to attend that meeting. The developments are also a natural consequence of the findings of the Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training. The additional funds will be available for agreed programs in government school and TAFE systems and non-government school systems from the beginning of 1980. They will be provided, as special grants, in addition to the programs of the Tertiary Education Commission and the Schools Commission. Commonwealth grants will be made available under the program for a period of five years as follows, with expenditure adjusted after 1 980 to allow for inflation: </para>
          <para class="block">The Commonwealth&#39;s contributions are being offered on the understanding that in 1981 the States and the Northern Territory will contribute a total of $9m for the agreed program and that in later years they will match the Commonwealth&#39;s spending on their government systems dollar for dollar. The particular purposes for which the grants may be spent will be worked out in discussions with State, territorial and nongovernment education authorities to commence immediately the States and the Northern Territory accept the Commonwealth&#39;s offer. The Government will invite the Tertiary Education Commission and the Schools Commission to take account of this new policy in the development of their program proposals. </para>
          <para>The problems of transition are not, I stress, an area for government action only. A comprehensive approach to the problems requires the interest, understanding and support of the whole community. Teachers have an obvious and crucial part to play. Parents need to encourage and support their children and to be interested and involved in the vital work of the schools and the decisions made by authorities affecting their children. To a large extent the motivations and attitudes of young people are affected by the expectations their parents have of them and the encouragement they receive at home. Employers should develop closer links with education systems, particularly at the local school level, in the interests of, on the one hand, schools understanding better the requirements of the work place and, on the other hand, employers appreciating more clearly the education processs and the difficulties faced by young people and their teachers in preparing adequately for the complex requirements of life and work in the 1980s and 1990s. Organisations of employees should lend their support and participate in the working out of the new arrangements. </para>
          <para>The Government is presenting this initiative as an important and substantial contribution to the difficult problem of equipping our young people for the world of work. With the co-operation and support of the community, the opportunity is now being given to develop a comprehensive approach to the transition from school to work of all young people which, given time, will ensure that the teenage years are productive, constructive and satisfying, and that unemployment is not an option that they would seek rather than participate in the opportunities opened up by a comprehensive transition policy. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>-by leave-Mr  Deputy Speaker,  my colleague, the honourable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Cass),</inline> and I have made an arrangement with the Leader of the House, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> to share the time that the Government has allotted the Opposition in which to speak to his statement. The statement cuts across two areas- the way in which schools and educational institutions may be used under and helped by the scheme announced by the Government, and the impact on young people of their entering the work force. As the statement cuts across two areas we would both like to say a few words about it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Anybody going through the statement which the Minister made today would realise that the scheme, encompassing the expenditure of some money for what the Government now calls the transitionary stage from school to work, is of absolutely no assistance in the year 1979-80. The school leavers, the 250,000 young people who are expected to leave the educational institutions over the next few weeks, will not be assisted one iota by the scheme which was announced by the Government today. I only wish that the back bench members of the Government, who were reported to have put pressure on the Government to announce some job creation scheme, had been successful in their claims on the Government. </para>
          <para>The great difficulty is not the preparation of people for the work force; it is the supply of work which is the problem in Australia today. We have 400,000 people who are registered as looking for work, but we know that there are far more than that. We have 250,000 people coming on to the work force from the schools. That is a net increase of 1 10,000. We have an undersupply of jobs. It does not matter whether we send every school leaver through the universities of Australia and give them all the training that our educational institutions can give them, there are still just not enough jobs to go around for all the people who require work. </para>
          <para>The Government has been attracted to one of the Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys which showed that a little over 7 per cent of the people interviewed said that they had not received employment because they did not have the necessary educational qualification or skills. The Government horned in on this one result of the survey and said that it was going to do something about the problem. But 47 per cent of the people interviewed said that they did not get a job because there was absolutely no job available. Unless the Government moves to create jobs, we are going to have to live with a permanent army, a very high percentage of unemployed in this country. The Government cannot expect that members on this side of the House or people observing the Government&#39;s actions outside the House are going to take this announcement seriously. Just three months ago, on the first day of the Budget sitting, the Government announced it was going to slash $55m or 69 per cent from the Special Youth Employment Training Program; $55m was taken off on the first day of this session; $10m has been given back in another program on the last day of the session. In spite of the inadequacies of the program, the $55m was helping people to go into the work force. The Government does not seem to understand that a lack of jobs is the problem. It is not necessarily the training, the educational qualifications or the skills of people. This year the Government announced, and beat its chest, that it was going to spend an additional $ 18m on apprenticeship training. But when we got down to the tin tacks and analysed what this additional $ 1 8m was going to do, we found there was going to be an increase in the intake of apprenticeships in Australia of between one per cent and two per cent. </para>
          <para>We are still short of 10,000 skilled tradesmen a year in Australia. The Government still intends to bring 10,000 skilled migrants into this country to make up the shortfall here while we refuse to train our own people. Why cannot the back bench say to the Ministers that this is where they have to spend our resources if they are serious about putting people to work? The Government is not serious about putting people to work by saying to someone who has finished three years of high school that he will be better equipped if he finishes five years of high school, in spite of the fact that there is going to be no job available. The Government is not going to assist people to get work by increasing the intake of our universities by 5 per cent a year unless it makes the jobs available in the work force. Unless that is done the Government is not going to be able to put these people to work. That is the real inadequacy of the situation in our economy today. The Government is not facing up to reality; it is not facing up to what is required in this country. It is being condemned throughout the country for a lack of foresight of the problems that we are running into. It was expected- no doubt the Government considered this-that the Government would abolish the payment of unemployment benefits for school leavers. It was quite a serious consideration when it was placed before Cabinet in the last few months of its considerations. </para>
          <para>Fortunately, pressure from this side of the House and from people outside the House has made the Government do away with that idea. It could not dare do it politically, but it might do it next year. </para>
          <para>The announcement made by the Government today will do absolutely nothing to assist people into the work force. We have a substantial oversupply of labour. While the Government continues with its philosophy of not assisting job creation we are going to have to live with that oversupply of labour. We are going to live with broken families, with crime, with drug offences, with alcoholism, with all the things which come out of high unemployment in this country because the Government refuses to recognise what has to be done. But there are many other people who do recognise it, not just the Labor Party, but a lot of apolitical people outside the Parliament. I hope they will get their opportunity of telling the Government what they think of it about this time next year. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I am speaking because the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> has put out this statement simultaneously with the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner).</inline> My colleague, the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> has already mentioned that the funding provided is chicken feed compared with the cutback in the various schemes offered by the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Government previously for people who need further training. I will not dwell on that point. In the statement the Minister says his primary concern is for the 50,000 young people who now leave school each year with poor employment prospects. I think he is underestimating the problem. As my colleague pointed out, over a quarter of a million young people are going to leave school. About 64 per cent of them will have had less than three years&#39; secondary school training; so they are hardly trained people. Let me be generous and say that perhaps half of them will get lost in some way or other. I would suggest that the figure the Government is worrying about is closer to 100,000 young people, not a mere 50,000. The inadequacies of the funding is highlighted even more when one looks at the figures in those terms. </para>
          <para>The Government is proposing expansion and development of transition courses in technical and further education and full time courses for up to one year in duration to prepare young people for vocations, particularly in trades and technical occupations where shortages of skilled workers still exist. My colleague pointed out that for years the Government has relied on bringing immigrants into the country to fill these vacancies. Now at last the Government is coming round to the view that maybe it should train some of the people here. I agree wholeheartedly. But there is still a further problem which the Government has to consider It is not that we have never trained these skilled people. They keep their jobs, but they soon find that, for a variety of reasons, the conditions of the job are not satisfactory and the rates of remuneration are inadequate. They leave the skilled jobs and go into more congenial, unskilled jobs where they can get more money. For years the Government has been using immigrants to fill these positions. But when the immigrants have been here long enough to learn the language and the ropes, they too learn that it pays them better to get out of these skills and to go somewhere else. </para>
          <para>So, sadly, this scheme will not succeed unless the Government does something about that very real problem in relation to the work force and gives a proper reward for people with skills. There are lots of other suggestions made, namely, improved services and techniques for identifying potential early school leavers, and more intensive advice for parents as well as students. These deficiencies in the education system have been known for years. In a speech I made in this House on the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill on 14 November I quoted Judith O&#39;Neill. She pointed out that of the early school leavers-most of the children are early school leavers- 64 per cent do not get beyond third year high school. Most of these early leavers are totally ignored. She stated: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. each year large numbers of young people move out of school and into the work force with little time to consider available opportunities for employment, with little or no guidance from others, and with little chance in any case. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That position will be barely changed by this suggestion because the policy is totally inadequate. Advice on this course of action has been given over the years, not the least by the Williams committee which was set up in 1976 and took three years to pontificate. Finally it suggested that it was very important to consider schemes which deal with the problem of youth unemployment, the place of schools and of technical and further education in helping the community and the young unemployed to deal with this problem. In addition, the Schools Commission itself has been reporting along these lines for ages. Those reports were available in time for the Government to have considered the matter for inclusion in the Budget we have just passed for this year, but it was ignored and left. The scheme will not get off the ground next year. Even though the Government is providing funding, nothing will be done, practically nothing will be spent next year. No doubt we will find that although $25m has been allocated, when it comes to the Budget next year most of the funds will not have been spent. </para>
          <para>The Government mentions the aim of its policy is that ultimately all young people in the 1 5 to 19-year age group would be provided with options in education, training and employment, or any combination of these, either part time or full time, so that unemployment becomes the least acceptable alternative. I will conclude on this note: That strikes me as a most ominous aspect of this policy. Is the Government serious? Is it really conscientiously wishing to train young people or has it at last recognised that when they leave school and are unable to obtain jobs that they have to be paid unemployment benefit? Is this move now going to be seen as a very clever technique to force them to stay on at some sort of schooling with some financial support less than the unemployment benefit with the threat that, if they do not accept this extra schooling, with the lower support, they will not qualify for unemployment benefit. It implies that the financial support for these young people will really come not just from the Government but significantly from their own families who are already in financial difficulty. In most cases this is probably why the children leave school early as they feel that they have to get out and help their families. Is this proposal that the Government is offering really an alternative, or is it a veiled threat? </para>
          <para>Further on the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> says: </para>

            <para>Over a period the Commonwealth wishes to see the pattern of allowances and benefits for young people, and of related assistance, to industry, reorganised . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He also says:  we do not intend to withdraw or reduce the unemployment benefits presently available to young people. </para>
          <para class="block">I do not know why it was necessary for him to make that statement. Is this a hint? I repeat: Is it a hint? In fact, once the scheme is going, is it the Government&#39;s intention to use this as a device to force the children once again back onto their parents so that the parents will have to shoulder most of the financial responsibility for keeping the children at school and in training. </para>

              <para>- I hope not. I see some honourable members on the opposite side whom I respect and I trust that it is not the intention of the Government. Let us keep our eyes and ears open to ensure that this does not happen. I am prepared to accept the assurances, but let us note the danger. If the Government does that, it will be consistent with what it is doing on the question of the national health scheme. The Government is quite surreptitiously and consciously on its part, forcing the cost of health care back onto the individuals in the community who are ill and can least afford to pay for it. I fear that this may be what the Government might do in relation to the young unemployed. I hope that I am wrong. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I wish to make a statement to the House concerning developments at the London Constitutional Conference on Rhodesia, and concerning the nature and extent of Australian participation if the anticipated settlement is achieved at that Conference. The conflict in Rhodesia has for many years been a most serious international problem. The unilateral declaration of independence by the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Smith in 1965 sowed the seeds of a political struggle in Rhodesia between black nationalists and white settler parties that a few years later erupted into a bloody civil war. That war has brought great suffering to the peoples of Rhodesia and the surrounding countries, and has exacerbated racial tensions throughout the region. It has created dangerous opportunities for outside powers to expand their power and influence, and has jeopardised the peace and stability of the entire African continent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Australian Government has over the years taken a closer interest in developments in Rhodesia. The internal elections this year, which resulted in the installation of Bishop Muzorewa as Prime Minister, were a step forward as far as the internal situation in Rhodesia was concerned, but they were held under an undemocratic Constitution, and they did not allow for the participation of all Rhodesian political elements. It was almost inevitable, therefore, that the war would continue unabated, with neighbouring countries continuing to support the Patriotic Front guerrilla forces against the Muzorewa Government. The Lusaka Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, held in August of this year, took place against a most difficult and disturbing situation in southern Africa. It was a situation that was described by the Commonwealth Secretary-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ramphal,</inline> as one of escalating conflict, with increasing military, economic and social pressures on the African front line states, and in the background a deepening intransigence on the part of Pretoria. The increasing sense of frustration and of anger of black African leaders and their people made it not unlikely that the Lusaka meeting would see a polarisation of the Commonwealth and a possible confrontation that could split the Commonwealth and threaten its very survival. </para>
          <para>The Government took the view that the situation then existing in southern Africa was morally wrong, and we believed that it would only enhance the interests and activities of hostile outside nations, including the Soviet Union and its supporters. The Government believed that, if a lasting peace was to be achieved, there was a need for a negotiated settlement between all the parties to the conflict, with the support of the front line states. We were aware of the very great difficulties and the failure of earlier attempts to achieve a settlement, but we saw the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting as providing perhaps the last opportunity for a peaceful settlement. Because of this, and because we value the Commonwealth as a body, the Government worked vigorously to develop a consensus at Lusaka on principles that might allow a settlement to be made. At Lusaka, agreement was reached on six principles that might underlie a peaceful all-party settlement. Shortly thereafter, the British Government convened a conference in London of the opposing parties. </para>
          <para>The Conference has been a difficult exercise. Agreement has now been reached on an independence constitution, and on arrangements for the transitional period leading to the holding of free and fully democratic elections in Rhodesia. The Conference is now in its third and final phase- negotiation of arrangements for establishing and maintaing a ceasefire during the transitional period. Provided that this third phase can be successfully concluded, a British Governor will shortly thereafter arrive in Salisbury to assume control of the administration of the country in the transitional period. President Kaunda&#39;s call for a mobilisation of Zambian forces demonstrates the tensions that exist in the southern African region and underlines further the need for a prompt settlement to be reached in London to benefit not only the people of Rhodesia itself but also those in the neighbouring countries. </para>
          <para>In the hope and expectation that an all-parties package agreement may be achieved in London, the British Government has sought Australian assistance in the implementation of that agreement in two respects. Firstly, and as the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> announced on 9 November, the British Government has requested the Australian Government to contribute a contingent to a Commonwealth military ceasefire monitoring force. This request came at a difficult point in the negotiation of arrangement for the transitional period. The Australian Government agreed in principle to this request, subject to an all-parties settlement being reached in London and subject to satisfactory arrangements being worked out for the operation of the Australian contingent. We have since learned that our agreement, and that of the other Commonwealth countries asked to contribute contingents, greatly assisted the successful negotiation of arrangements for the transitional period. </para>
          <para>Discussions are proceeding with Britain on these matters, and planning for the Australian contingent is well advanced. The Australian Government has also agreed in principle to assist with the movement of a Fijian contingent from Fiji to Rhodesia, and has agreed to consult with Fiji about the extent to which Australia can provide in-country support to the Fijian contingent. The Commonwealth ceasefire monitoring force will include teams from Britain, Australia, Fiji, Kenya and New Zealand. It will not be physically involved in the maintenance of the ceasefire; nor will it have any responsibility for the maintenance of law and order during the transitional period. Its sole function will be to observe and to report that the agreed ceasefire is being correctly maintained. The safety of the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian contingent- and also of the Australian election observers in Rhodesia, to whom I shall refer in a moment- is a matter of particular concern to the Australian Government. In the event of any serious breakdown of law and order in Rhodesia in which the lives of Australian personnel could be at risk, they would be immediately withdrawn after appropriate advice to the British Government. The Australian defence authorities are giving close consideration to all aspects of the physical security and legal protection of Australian soldiers taking part in a Commonwealth ceasefire monitoring force in Rhodesia. </para>
          <para>The anticipated duration of the assignment is governed by the length of the transitional period leading up to the elections. It has been agreed at the London Conference that this period would be limited to two months. Allowing time for the announcement of election results and the installation of the new Government, and travel between Australia and Rhodesia, the Australian contingent could be expected to be outside Australia for a maximum of <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> months. The  Deputy  Prime Minister indicated on 9 November that Britain had requested 10 teams of 1 1 men each-a total of 1 10 men. With a national headquarters staff, this could require a total Australian force of up to 135. It is possible that in the event, a smaller Australian contribution may be all that is needed, depending on the final assessment of the monitoring requirement. </para>
          <para>The second area in which Australia has been asked to assist is the sending of election observers. The Lusaka agreement provided for Commonwealth observers to be present during the elections. The British Government has now invited Australia to send a group of such observers to Rhodesia for the pre-election period and the elections. The Government has agreed to send eight persons, provided that a settlement is reached which is in accordance with our understanding of the Lusaka agreement. The composition of the group and its travel and financial arrrangements will be decided following consultations among interested Ministers. The main task of the group will be to report to the Australian Government and Parliament on the conduct of the elections. A small Australian liaison office will be established in Salisbury for the duration of the transitional period. It will maintain liaison with and provide political advice to the ceasefire monitoring contingent and assist the Australian election observers. It will also serve as a direct point of contact between the Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Government and the British authorities in Salisbury. </para>
          <para>I also wish to state the Government&#39;s position on the removal of the sanctions that have been in force against Rhodesia since the unilateral declaration of independence in 1965. It is possible to engage in some fine legal distinctions about the obligations of United Nations members in regard to the lifting of sanctions. It seems clear to the Government, however, that when all the Rhodesian parties concerned and the British Government have freely agreed to an independence Constitution, freely agreed on arrangements for the holding of elections and the implementation of that Constitution, and when British authority has been re-established in Rhodesia for the purpose of instituting those arrangements, then the objectives for which sanctions were originally imposed will have been achieved. We recognise that for a number of reasons there may be some delay before the United Nations Security Council might be able to take the formal steps which may be thought necessary in respect of sanctions. We hope this process will not be long. For Australia, however, as we are likely to have Australian military and civilian personnel and an Australian liaison office in Rhodesia during the period leading up to independence and as we will, in the circumstances I have described, be satisfied that the objectives for which sanctions were imposed have been achieved, the Government considers- I believe all Members of the House will agree with this-that it would be inappropriate for it to maintain sanctions during that time. A further announcement will be made on this matter in due course. </para>
          <para>Finally, I wish to emphasise that the Government&#39;s intention in making this statement is to inform honourable members of the Government&#39;s present intentions and commitments regarding Australian involvement in a Rhodesian settlement, in the event that events at the London Conference proceed to a successful conclusion along the lines that we now hope for. </para>
          <para>However, I must end on a note of caution. While it is now reasonable to be generally optimistic about the London Conference&#39;s chances of achieving a final agreed settlement- bearing in mind that the Conference has made enormous progress against heavy odds already- we cannot be certain that it will do so. The agreements achieved so far in London are conditional on an agreed total package, and the discussion of ceasefire arrangements will throw up further difficulties. The Australian Government will therefore take into account developments in the final phase of the London Conference in determining its final position on participation in Rhodesian settlement arrangements. The success of the London Conference to date is most gratifying to the Australian Government. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition welcomes the statement on Rhodesia and notes particularly the concluding remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> when he spoke about the hatred and the suspicions of the past decade being finally overcome. I say at the outset that it is with some sense of concern that the Opposition notes what is happening in Rhodesia at the present time. I advert to the fact that one of our young Australians, a young Australian Broadcasting Commission correspondent, has been seriously and dramatically involved in an incident this morning which could well cost him his life. Tony Joyce is his name. He has been shot in the head and his chances for survival will be difficult. We hope and trust that he will recover. He was shot in circumstances which, to some extent, will concern all Australians. He apparently was in a police vehicle at the time he was shot and the shot came from outside the vehicle. There was, allegedly, a confiscation of a camera. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I place on record the great work that is done by Australians in this area of the gathering of news. These people risk their lives. We saw the great tragedy in East Timor of five Australian newsmen losing their lives. A shadow has been cast over both governments- I make no excuses; the Labor Government and the present Government- for what happened there. I make that point because obviously with this type of news the situation there is not really as stable as we would have hoped. </para>

          <para>The point I am trying to make relates to the problem we have in Australia in trying to get through the message of what a democracy is about. I do not know that we always succeed. In my experience in the Federal Parliament I had the opportunity to go to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Jamaica in 1975. The most firm impression I came away from the conference table with at that time was that of  President  Kaunda and  President  Nyerere warning the world in April 1975 that there would be severe bloodshed in Rhodesia. They said that they could not stop it. In fact, they understood that it would happen because there was no democracy in Rhodesia. We do not want to get into that argument, but the warning was clear. Big problems exist at the present time. We still see military action taking place in Zambia. There are guerrilla movements and we know that in many cases they are related to other influences. The issue involves freedom, free elections and equal suffrage. All those conditions have to be present if there is to be more stability in the world. This statement is welcome. It embraces the past conflict, the agreement, the British being able to re-establish their authority by way of a governor, the difficulties that Kaunda has experienced in Zambia, the use of a monitoring force, a transition period, election observers, sanctions and what is called a final phase. The total package is still to be delivered. I understand all that. I refer now to the situation in recent weeks. </para>
          <para>We cannot avoid querying the involvement of Australia in the past in justifying the Smith regime. There always appeared to be a strong influence in this country, particularly on the Government&#39;s side, to try to prop up that regime because it was argued that it had a future. It has no future. There is an understandable struggle for human rights and self-determination. We can recognise the grave problems for all of us from racial conflict between white and black which creates enormous problems in the world. We can understand the problem but there is no solution in a few phrases. I am mindful of the fact that the air force of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia is probably carrying out fairly extensive military operations in Zambia. The air force is led by a Queenslander, I am told, who is actively involved as the Air Vice-Marshal. Death and destruction is flowing. We have to mention these matters. When Todd and others visited this country some years ago, they warned of all these dangers. Kaunda and Nyerere were warning of all these dangers. The big hope we have is that a peaceful solution may arise. The present difficulties appear to be coming to bear more than ever on Kaunda. I am looking at news as recent as 1 1 November. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail.</inline> It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda &#39;s peacemaking role in Zambabwe-Rhodesia is costing him dearly. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is a matter of concern to the Opposition because while a peace keeping discussion has been going on and while Kaunda has been playing a leading role in the negotiations, there has been escalating activity against his country on the basis of trying to beat the guerrillas. The article states further: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Rhodesian Army raids into neighbouring Zambia and Mozambique have picked up since the peace force talks started nine-and-a-half weeks ago, culminating in the dynamiting of the Zambian Chambesi River bridge three weeks ago. The vital bridge carried the railway to the Tanzanian port of Dar Es Salaam, and was being used to import 300,000 tonnes of desperately needed maize into Zambia. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honourable members will see that while these negotiations are going on and the  President  of Zambia is making a very important effort- as evidenced by what happened in 1975- his own country is getting into more difficulties because of the war being waged against it. Starvation is occurring in Zambia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that there is concern that the Zambian forces have now been mobilised. I cannot see how we can reconcile the fact that there has to be a severe escalation of military activity against Zambia and the destruction of its infrastructure which will cause many problems for that country. As honourable members know, the situation could well bring down Kaunda if he cannot control it. What a tragedy it would be if we attributed this merely to guerrilla activity. Our own Tony Joyce was caught up in the conflict this morning when he was trying to film news in relation to a bridge that had been destroyed. He became involved in a dreadful accident, to say the least. </para>
          <para>We are also concerned about the type of action that Australia is taking. The action is welcomed from the British point of view but is it the safe attitude for Australia? We are sending a very small force to Zimbabwe-Rhodesia which will total about 135. I am mindful of some of the statements that I read in the London <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times.</inline> An article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The British Government seems to think that a ceasefire runs itself . . . But it can&#39;t be quite as simple as that In the run-up to elections there will certainly be a great deal of intimidation on all sides, if only because the outcome of the election, in which many parties may be competing, is itself so uncertain. Remember, one black party or coalition of parties must get nearly 64 per cent of the black seats if it is to have a majority in the Lower House. What happens if there is an accident&#39;, or if Nkomo or Mugabe fail to discipline their followers? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is one thing to be a monitoring force, and another thing to be a supervising force. The article makes the point: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If there are flagrant violations of the ceasefire . . . two possible consequences follow: either the Salisbury regime&#39;s security forces will stay in barracks and remain &#39; neutral&#39;, and there may or may not be pitched battles between the followers of Muzorewa and those of the Patriotic Front; or else the security forces will attempt to restore &#39;law and order&#39; and the British governor may find himself in charge of a continuation of the war against the guerillas. In that case, it is difficult to see how he can extricate himself from Salisbury, or how Rhodesia can proceed through elections to freedom and legitimacy. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honourable members will notice that the guerrillas themselves say that the forces suggested are not large enough; they should be much larger. That statement comes from the guerrilla front itself. The guerrilla leaders want a six-month transition period rather than one of two months. They seek an independent military force, possible from the United Nations, to help to supervise- not monitor- a ceasefire. I draw that distinction. I know that the Government will take these matters into consideration, but the concerns of a number of Australians obviously have to be mentioned. The British have been having discussions about why sanctions are being withdrawn in such a hurry. In opposing sanctions Callaghan mentioned:  . . the danger that the Government&#39;s action in appeasing its own back benchers who were not prepared to vote for a renewal of sanctions would be misunderstood abroad. </para>
          <para class="block">That seems to be the situation that we could get here. I emphasise again the strong military action against Zambia. A thousand South African and Zimbabwe-Rhodesian troops crossed into Zambia in October. Much damage was done. Death and starvation came to the Zambians. People thought that the situation would be all right if a British governor were there. What would happen if a ceasefire broke down? What would happen if we withdrew sanctions? We want to see peace and we want to see the ability to bring that peace about. Should we not be doing more to comply with the wishes from all sides, not just the wishes of those- well meaning as they may be, and misdirected as they may be- who think that the problem will be solved by a scrap of paper. The issue involves the flesh and blood of people who now have very bitter memories of tragedies of some 16 years of illegal existence. </para>
          <para>I have highlighted, in the course of my remarks, the statements which I think are going to be made by many people in the next few weeks. The withdrawal of sanctions leads to recognition of the Rhodesian passport and virtually to the recognition of the entitlement of refugees, whatever race, coming from that area. I think that has to be mentioned. Whilst I can understand the Minister&#39;s saying that he wants to have a withdrawal of sanctions now, I think we ought to wait a little while to see that we are going to get the final result that we want. I am convinced that  President  Kaunda is far from satisfied with what one might call the integrity of what has been happening from the point of view of the merits of a settlement. He has been belittled and betrayed. There has been an escalation in the war against him and his country and death and destruction in Zambia. I think we ought to be taking more cognisance of that fact rather than rushing into the withdrawing of sanctions to help the situation. Frankly, unless something is done to control the intelligence forces which, in many cases, are masterminding the activities of the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian regime, we will have more troubles in Africa. </para>
          <para>Australia is not directly involved. But it will be involved if there is a refugee flood. Australia would be the area to which refugees would come if everything were legitimised and sanctions had been withdrawn. I can well understand that this matter cannot be solved by us talking to each other. Australia had a lot of influence in the past. I put it on record that the British failed in the past. Kaunda and Nyerere have been pleading for years about the problems concerning Rhodesia. They could not get any recognition of the problems of that area. The British Government, of both shades of opinion, seemed to walk away from giving the solution that they want. It appears that a solution may now be reached, but from a military point of view the governor has no real support. I understand that if difficulties arise we will discuss the matter further with the British, but I do not know whether that will get us very far along the track, bearing in mind the tension existing in the region. It has been stated that if there is any serious breakdown in law and order Australian troops will be withdrawn after appropriate advice to the British Government. I can understand that, but we have to talk about the situation a bit more constructively. </para>
          <para>In summary, we would like to see Australia comply more with the wishes of what the guerrilla forces in terms of enforcing the ceasefire and maintaining supervision in the area. We would like to see the British more directly involved, to guarantee some maintenance of law and order. I think the question of sanctions should be delayed until such time as we get some tangible evidence of a solution to the problems in that region. </para>

But we did want to show our sincerity in proposing this matter by being present in the House. In spite of the rather small time attitude of some back benchers who are attempting to interject, the fact is that the order of business set out on the blue sheet was departed from. The blue sheet is put out each sitting day and when a matter listed on that sheet is not to be dealt with in order it is normal courtesy for those who are involved to be informed.

            <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Bill that I now bring before the House, together with an associated tax rates Bill, gives legislative form to previously announced changes in the basis of taxing income of trusts and of dependent children. Also included in the Bill are provisions dealing with the taxation value of housing provided to employees by their employers. Previously foreshadowed measures to counter schemes of tax avoidance that seek to exploit the deduction for bad debts are another part of the Bill. The Bill will also confer tax deductions for gifts towards relief efforts in Kampuchea and East Timor. </para>
          <para>Let me deal first with the last of these matters. The Government believes that the level of human suffering in Kampuchea and East Timor is such that we should add to Australia&#39;s support by allowing tax deductions for gifts to the appropriate appeals. Accordingly, the special concession of a deduction for gifts of $2 or more will apply to gifts made in the current financial year to the International Disaster Emergencies Committee Kampuchean Relief Appeal and to the Australian Red Cross East Timor Appeal. The response to the appeals so far clearly indicates that the granting of tax deductions has been welcomed throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will recall that I announced broad proposals on the taxation of income of trusts and dependent children at some length on 26 July last. After a careful examination of the many responses to this announcement, from individuals and organisations, the Government decided on a number of modifications to eliminate potential anomalies and unintended consequences. Details of these were given in my statement to the House last week. Against that background, I think that I can in this speech confine myself to the main features of the proposed arrangements as reviewed and modified. </para>
          <para>Broadly speaking, the new system applicable to income of dependent children will apply to the taxable income, whether derived directly or through trusts, of children under the age of 18 years at the end of the year of income. But there are to be several important exceptions. Thus the new system will not in any way affect children who are married at the end of the year of income or are in full time employment then. There are also to be exclusions for double orphans and handicapped children. These exclusions will, quite properly, keep the income of a large number of children entirely outside the new system. Income not so excluded will, at base, bear tax under the proposed new system. Particular categories of income, whether derived directly or through a trust, will, however, be excluded and will attract tax only according to the tax rules applicable to individuals generally. </para>
          <para>Thus, income from deceased estates, or from property left to the child by a deceased person will be outside the new system. So too will income from the investment of other sums coming directly to a child on a person &#39;s death, such as the proceeds of a life insurance policy or a lump sum from a superannuation fund. Income from property transferred to a child by another person to whom the property was left by a deceased person, if transferred within three years after the death of that person, will be excluded if within limits set by relevant rules of intestacy. A child in full time employment will, of course, be outside the new system altogether but, as regards a child not categorically excluded in this way, employment income from part time work and income from a business conducted by the child alone or with another minor will both be outside the new system. Income from the investment of compensation paid for damages, for example, for loss of parental support or for personal injury is not to be subject to the new system. Neither is income from funds raised by public appeal for the relief of persons in necessitous circumstances. Income from court-ordered settlements arising as a result of divorce or judicial separation, income from the investment of a child&#39;s lottery winnings and income from the investment of savings out of any of the excluded categories of income make up the balance of the classes of income excluded from the new system. </para>
          <para>Experience regrettably having shown that there will always be some who will seek to take unintended advantage of provisions designed, as these exceptions are, to provide relief in particular circumstances, the Bill contains a number of safeguards against exploitation of the exceptions to avoid tax intended to be charged. These safeguarding measures aim to ensure, for example, that profits are not diverted to a child &#39;s business by relatives or other persons not at arm&#39;s length, and that income from a child&#39;s investment is not inflated by similar diversions. </para>
          <para>Income to which the new system appliestermed in the legislation &#39;eligible&#39; income- will for 1979-80 be taxed at a minimum marginal rate of tax of 47.07 per cent in the hands of the person who is taxable in respect of the income. However, if the eligible income does not exceed $1,040, the special rate will not apply. That means that if the total taxable income does not exceed $3,893 and the eligible income does not exceed $1,040 no tax will be payable. If the eligible income exceeds $1,040, &#39;shading-in&#39; arrangements will apply so that the special rate will not be fully applicable until the eligible income exceeds $3,625. Up to that point the average rate of tax will, of course, be lower than 47.07 per cent. As I have explained previously, if a person has other income as well as eligible income in excess of $ 1,040, the other income will be taxed in the normal way. This means that the zero rate will apply to the first $3,893 of other income, and the standard rate of 33.07 per cent to other income between $3,894 and $16,608. </para>
          <para>Trust income to which a child under 18 years of age is, or is deemed to be, presently entitled is already taxable in the trustee&#39;s hands and will be taxed under the new system on the same basis as would apply if the child derived the income directly. This means that, as to trust income to which the new system applies, the trustee will be taxed at the minimum marginal rate of 47.07 per cent, subject to the $1,040 threshold and shading-in arrangements. As to other trust income, the trustee will be taxed at ordinary personal tax rates including the zero rate on income up to $3,893. </para>
          <para>As I indicated in my statement on 14 November, the Bill will authorise relief, by way of a rebate of part or all of any increase in tax payable as a result of the new system, in respect of income arising from arrangements entered into on or before 26 July 1979. An applicant for relief will need to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Taxation that the circumstances are such that it would be unreasonable that the whole of the extra tax should be payable. The basis for this relief in the ordinary case where one or both parents have a taxable income is spelt out in the legislation. It is to the effect that a child, or the trustee for a child, will be eligible for a rebate to the extent that the tax otherwise payable on the relevant eligible income is greater than the tax that would have been payable on that income if it had been derived by the parent, or the parent with the higher taxable income. If the child has minor brothers or sisters also in receipt of eligible income, the eligible incomes of all of them will be added to that of the relevant parent in ascertaining how much tax the income would have borne in the parent&#39;s hands. In determining the amount of any rebate under this provision, the fact that a parent&#39;s income has been reduced by artificial tax avoidance arrangements may be taken into account by the Commissioner. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that this rebate, together with the specific exceptions and exclusions provided in the Bill, should ensure that application of the new system will operate appropriately. However, to make doubly sure, the Commissioner will be given a discretionary power to allow a rebate of part or all of the extra tax payable as a result of the application of the new system if cases should arise where it is shown to his satisfaction that exaction of the full amount would entail serious hardship. In both of these discretionary areas, the Commissioner&#39;s decision will be open to the usual rights of objection and appeal. </para>
          <para>As previously foreshadowed, the Bill will, again with some exceptions, alter the arrangements for taxing accumulating trust income, that is to say, income of a trust to which no beneficiary has, or is deemed to have, a present entitlement. At present, this income is taxed in the trustee&#39;s hands, either at the maximum personal rate of tax or at ordinary personal tax rates but not including, except in relation to the first three years of a deceased estate, the zero rate of tax on the first $3,893 of income. The first change proposed is that a beneficiary who has an indefeasible vested interest in accumulating trust income will be treated as being presently entitled to the income. </para>
          <para>Other accumulating trust income will be taxed at the maximum personal tax rate, 6 1.07 per cent for 1979-80. However, subject to rules designed to guard against their exploitation for purposes of tax avoidance, there will be significant exceptions. First, the accumulating income of deceased estates will continue to be taxed as at present; that is, the income will bear ordinary personal rates of tax, including the zero rate for the first three years and will attract the benefit of a minimum taxable income of $417 and associated shading-in arrangements thereafter. Secondly, bankrupt estates, and trusts of moneys received as compensation for a particular event, trusts of moneys payable on the death of a person and funds raised by public appeal for persons in necessitous circumstances, will continue to have accumulating income taxed at ordinary personal rates of tax, without the zero rate but with a $4 1 7 minimum taxable income and associated shading-in arrangements. </para>
          <para>As the legislation will not be considered in the Parliament until the autumn sittings, the Government has decided that it would not now be appropriate to impose an obligation on people concerned to pay provisional tax for 1979-80 on the basis of the proposed new arrangements. This decision means that the new arrangements could be seen as having a double effect when assessments on income of the year ending 30 June 1980 are made after the end of the year. These will, of course, show both tax for 1979-80 and provisional tax for 1980-81. Accordingly, taxpayers who wish to avoid this apparent doubling-up effect may do so by applying to have 1979-80 provisional tax varied under the existing self-assessment procedure. The Bill also provides an option for those not otherwise liable to pay provisional tax for 1979-80 to pay that tax on the basis of the new arrangements. I should emphasise at this point that, whilst the Government would be happy to receive representations on technical aspects of the legislation before it is considered in the autumn, we have already given very careful thought to the substance of the trust and related measures. The changes that I announced last week, and which are incorporated in this legislation, represent the Government&#39;s considered response to the representations it has received. </para>
          <para>I come now to the subject of employees&#39; housing. Honourable members may recall that on 13 June 1979, following completion by the Government of its review of the provisions dealing with taxation of the value of housing accommodation provided for employees, I foreshadowed certain changes to those provisions. As I indicated on that occasion, the Government believes that a general provision which brings to account for taxation the value of employee benefits is a necessary part of an effective system of personal taxation. Such a provision must, of course, operate in a practical manner having regard to the many and varied circumstances which it must cover. To assist in that direction, amendments proposed by this Bill will make it clear that the Commissioner of Taxation is to take into account all relevant matters in assessing for income tax purposes the value of any housing accommodation provided to an employee. In particular, the amendments proposed will ensure that, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances, specified matters will be brought into consideration as factors tending to reduce the amount of the taxable benefit. </para>
          <para>Remoteness or isolation of the area in which the accommodation is located is one such factor. Any lack of choice by employees in the matter of accommodation and whether occupancy is subject to any onerous conditions imposed on the employee concerned are others. Whether the quality or size of the accommodation provided exceeds the standard of accommodation that the employee would ordinarily seek is another. All these stated factors will ensure that, as far as possible, full account is taken of those circumstances which might ordinarily reduce the value to an employee of housing benefits granted by an employer. To the same effect will be a specific requirement for the Commissioner to take into account whether it is customary in the particular industry for employers to provide free housing for employees or to provide housing at a low rent. This matter is to form part of the valuation criteria because the Government is conscious of long-standing arrangements between employers and employees in some industries under which accommodation is customarily provided either without charge or for a charge less than the fair rental value of the accommodation. These arrangements are common in respect of industry and employment outside the capital cities and in relatively remote or isolated areas of Australia. </para>
          <para>The valuation criteria to be expressed in the law are to apply in respect of 1977-78 and subsequent income years. The Bill will authorise amendment of assessments for 1977-78 and 1978-79 made before the Bill comes into operation where the new measures would result in a reduction of the value of housing benefits included in the assessments. Such amendments may be made whether or not the employee has exercised the rights of objection and appeal that the law provides. The backdating to 1977-78 will not, of course, retrospectively create any liability for tax on housing benefits. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Bill contains amendments foreshadowed in my statement of 12 June 1979 to counter tax avoidance schemes that exploit the income tax deduction for bad debts. This is done through arrangements under which the loss claimed to be suffered by way of a bad debt is effectively recouped in a non-taxable form. Amendments to provide a counter to tax avoidance schemes of the recoupment type that exploit deductions ordinarily available for expenditure incurred in borrowing money, in discharging a mortgage, in the acquisition of trading stock or by way of interest or rent were foreshadowed in my statements of <inline font-style="italic">24</inline> September 1978 and 1 March 1979. They were approved by the House recently when it considered the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1979. The amendments now proposed will extend the operation of those provisions so that they apply also to bad debt schemes. </para>
          <para>Reflecting my statement of 12 June, the amendments will mean that a deduction will not be allowable for a bad debt where the debt is incurred in respect of a loan made after 24 September 1978 as part of a tax avoidance arrangement entered into after that date. For the amendments to apply it will be necessary that the arrangement involves the receipt by the taxpayer or an associate of a compensatory benefit the value of which, when added to the tax benefit sought in respect of the bad debt, would effectively recoup the taxpayer for the loss incurred in respect of the loan so that no real loss is suffered. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>you will note that the amendments proposed by this Bill are to apply to loans made after 24 September 1978. This is the date on which the Government&#39;s intention to act against recoupment arrangements was originally announced and is in accord with the warning I gave at that time that, if further recoupment schemes were to emerge, the Government would, with effect from that day, act against them as outlined in that announcement. </para>
          <para>My statement of 1 March 1979 with respect to schemes of this type entered into to exploit the deductions for borrowing expenses was an earnest of the Government&#39;s intention in this regard. Despite that, the bad debt schemes emerged and it has again been necessary to act. I trust that by now the Government&#39;s determination to put an end to these schemes in which taxpayers seek deductions for losses or outgoings which, in a practical sense, they do not bear is clear both to those promoting the schemes and to taxpayers contemplating paying fees to promoters for access to deductions under such schemes. However, should this still not be the case, I repeat again that the Government will not hesitate to amend the income tax law to counter any other schemes exhibiting similar features and with effect from 24 September 1978. </para>
          <para>I also announced on 12 June that losses generated by bad debt schemes would not be permitted to be carried forward for deduction into a future income year. This is in accord with the policy of the Government announced on 24 May 1979 that paper losses produced by tax avoidance schemes, including recoupment schemes, are not to be allowed to be carried forward as income tax deductions. The amendments proposed will mean that losses created by bad debt schemes in 1 977-78 or earlier years will not be allowed as carry-forward deductions in 1978- 79 or in subsequent income years, while such losses manufactured in the 1978-79 income year will not be deductible against income of 1979- 80 or subsequent years. As is usual, the technical features of the Bill are dealt with in an explanatory memorandum. Copies of the memorandum are not yet available, but will be provided to honourable members within the next few days. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

Its purpose is to declare the rates of tax payable on income of dependent children, and trustees for them, that comes within the scope of the new system for taxing such income proposed in the Bill that I have just introduced. In speaking to that Bill, I mentioned that the income in question is to attract a minimum tax rate for 1979-80 of 47.07 per cent. That rate is declared in this Bill, which also provides for the special tax threshold of $1,040 that is to be available.

            <para>-May I begin by saying that I have always had a peculiar objection to the kind of rubric that is used to introduce the interaction of a cognate debate. I have always preferred the formula used in the Senate, where the Minister says: &#39;I suggest that the second reading of these two Bills be debated cognately&#39;. In this House Ministers always inject an element of surprise, as though the idea of a cognate debate had just occurred to them in a great moment of inspiration. These are objectionable Bills, obnoxious in principle and practice, and they ought to be opposed vigorously. The Bills were discussed at some length in another place on 15 November, when seven senators took part in the debate. Unfortunately, exigencies of time on this last day of sitting will prevent the Bills being discussed at length in this place. By arrangement, I understand that I will be the only  speaker  on the Bills. I assure the House that I will not take my full 30 minutes. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The main purpose of both Bills, the Australian National University Amendment Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill, although it is not obvious from reading the clauses of the Bills, is to dismember and destroy the Australian Union of Students. This is a remarkable example of extreme partisanship, showing how a small sectional group with strong influence within the Liberal Party has been able to exert quite illegitimate pressure on the Government to introduce legislation. In 1 977 the Council of the Australian National University adopted new fee rules which provided for exemption from compulsory membership of and payment of fees to approved student bodies and gave rights of appeal to any students dissatisfied with decisions on these issues. However, this did not go far enough for the youthful Liberal enthusiasts who wanted to attack and destroy university autonomy. </para>
          <para>The objectionable clauses in the Bills are clauses 16 and 19 of the Australian National University Amendment Bill and clauses 5 and 6 of the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill, which are virtually identical in wording. The clauses tie the hands of the Australian National University Council and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Council by providing that moneys collected by way of fees shall not be made available to any student organisation- the Australian Union of Students is not actually named at this stage- unless &#39;the Council is satisfied that the governing body of the organisation is representative of the members of the organisation&#39;; and by providing that Councils may not pass statutes to authorise expenditure on &#39;amenities or services that are not of an academic nature&#39; unless the provision of these amenities will directly benefit the University, the College of Advanced Education or its students, or promote sporting, recreational, educational, social, cultural or post-graduate interests. In other words, funds can be applied only for non-political purposes, using that term in the narrowest sense. </para>
          <para>Let us suppose that the Australian Union of Students tried to organise a Kampuchean relief fund or an East Timorese relief fund. Let us suppose it tried to raise funds for Amnesty International, to mention an organisation in which I know you are interested, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> Under this miserable Act, the councils of the ANU and the CCAE would have no power to do that, even though there might be a very strong consensus of support. They simply would have no choice. It is striking, for example, that clause 19 of the Australian National University Amendment Bill and clause 5 of the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill provide that membership of student unions should not be compulsory. This is an extraordinary example of a piece of legislation which is both superfluous and offensive, because the existing rules of the Australian National University provide that membership of student unions should not be compulsory. Fifteen per cent of the student membership at the ANU is not in the Australian Union of Students. What has really happened is that Government has said: &#39;No, but they might change their minds. We do not propose to allow the Council of that University to be able to exercise its own judgment as to what it thinks ought to be done. We will make the provision for them in this piece of legislation&#39;. I might say that that is totally contradictory in some ways to the overall objective of the legislation. </para>
          <para>The criticism of the AUS, and it is criticism that might have had a good deal more validity two or three years ago and is less valid now, is that it did not have enough people actively involved in student unions and in voting for the Australian Union of Students. The Government is saying: &#39;We have a master stroke. We have a wonderful way of resolving that problem. We will cut out compulsory membership of student unions&#39;. Inevitably that will have the effect of reducing the number of people who are likely to want to vote in student union elections. </para>
          <para>The opponents of the AUS claim that the organisation is unrepresentative, and there is no doubt that in recent years it has had a very bumpy record. From time to time various university student groups have withdrawn from AUS. In the case of my own alma mater, Melbourne University, it ceded some years ago and then returned this year when 65 per cent of all students voted to go back into the AUS. Sydney University was another university which withdrew at one stage. Each withdrawal has necessarily made the AUS less, not more, representative. That is axiomatic. As a general principle, I believe that there ought to be a nationwide coalition of student unions. Like Voltaire&#39;s God, if there was not an Australian Union of Students it would be necessary to invent one. If students or Ministers research officers do not like the AUS, its leaders or its policies, surely the way to solve that problem is to mobilise for political changes within the organisation. If AUS is thought to be unrepresentative, the answer is to make it more representative, to get more of our 250,000 university students to participate, to run for election, to vote, to argue, and to propose new policies. I would have thought that this is a classic example of a Liberal point of view. It dates back as far as 1 976 when somebody replied to critics who felt that there ought to be more coercive action against student organisations. That person wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I share the concern of your members that any student body should promote international terrorism and antizionism. These are wholly non-Australian and they are evil concepts. </para>
            <para>However, as within the trade union movement, the cure must originate basically from the members themselves. It is within the students &#39; unions to rectify the matter. </para>
            <para>It is an important problem and I would be happy to discuss it further. In other days I have participated- successfully too- in the marshalling of student ideas and energies towards the democratic process. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again, the same writer stated:  in many . . . cases the fault lies with the failure of the general student body to participate in the election of office bearers and in the general critical comment of the actions of the office bearers throughout the year. If there is to be an elected body of any sort its success or failure will depend fairly heavily upon student participation. </para>
          <para>You would agree with those views, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> I am sure that the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> would also agree with them. He nods assent. They were, of course, stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> the Minister for Education, who originated this miserable Bill. Rather, he responded to pressure and introduced this miserable Bill. That is the correct way to do it. The worst way, the method adopted in this Bill, is to destroy the AUS, to make it less representative by interfering with the tradition of academic freedom and to prohibit the councils of tertiary institutions from enabling fees to be paid except for very narrow- one might say, almost selfishpurposes confined to &#39;student welfare&#39;, narrowly defined. To give a political analogy, it is as though the Fraser Government decided that it could not win a free election in 1980 against the Australian Labor Party and that the best way to secure its political future would be to pass legislation prohibiting trade unions from making financial contributions to the Labor Party, but by exclusion encouraging trade unions to provide political sustenance to other smaller left wing parties to the extreme. That is a perfect analogy of what this miserable legislation is doing. </para>
          <para>If AUS leadership is to be changed, it ought to be left to the students to do it. If enough people vote in elections this will happen. There is a good deal of strong evidence to indicate that there have been very striking changes in the AUS. Curiously, this legislation is really about two years too late to deal with the situation with which it purports to deal. If reasonable campuses disaffiliate, the AUS must inevitably fall under more extreme influence. This, of course, could come from the Right or from the Left. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I move: </para>

            <para>It was noted that the Standing Committee of Council in its consideration of this matter on 12 October 1979 had been satisfied, through the investigations of the General Services Fee Advisory Committee, that there was a liability on the part of the Students&#39; Association to pay to the Australian Union of Students the 1977 and 1978 outstanding fees, and that the legal impediment to payment that had stood during 1977 and 1978 had now been removed. </para>
            <para>In discussion it was suggested that the only test of a legal obligation was whether the Australian Union of Students was competent to sue the Students&#39; Association and to succeed in that suit. </para>
            <para>It was resolved to approve, that in the context in which the Students&#39; Association manages its own affairs, the Association be permitted to use the sum of $5,224.81 from pre- 1 979 fees received in 1979 and the sum of $1,934.44 towards the payment of outstanding 1977-78 Australian Union of Students fees of $ 1 6, 1 25.84. </para>

            <para>It was noted that the Standing Committee of Council at its meeting on 12 October 1979 had referred to the Council Tor consideration the matter of whether the Students* Association should be permitted to pay to the Australian Union of Students the Association&#39;s affiliation fee for 1979 from the 1979 General Services Fee money. </para>
            <para>It was further noted that the Chancellor had received a letter dated 24 October 1979 from the Minister for Education concerning the ANU Amendment Bill 1979. The Minister had observed, in part, that that section of the Amendment Act dealing with compulsory fees and student organisations had, at the University&#39;s suggestion, been made effective from 1 January 1980. The Minister asked that, as the Bill would not be effective until 1980, the University follow the Government&#39;s policy as reflected in the Bill in the application of compulsory fees collected in respect of 1979. </para>
            <para>The Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor assured the Council that no undertaking had been given to the Department of Education or to the Minister that the University would treat the disposition of the 1 979 fee in accordance with the prospective provisions of the Government&#39;s amendments to the ANU Act. </para>
            <para>The following documents were received: 3029/1979-Paper by the  President,  ANU Students&#39; Association on the payment of Australian Union of Students affiliation fees by student organisations. 3098/1979-Copy of a letter dated 24 October 1979 from the Minister for Education to the Chancellor on Amendments to the ANU Act. 3099/1979-Copy of a letter dated 26 October 1979 from the Chancellor to the Minister for Education in reply to the Minister&#39;s letter. 3032/1979-Paper dated I November 1979 by the Assistant Vice-Chancellor on the Bill for an Australian National University Amendment Act 1979. </para>

            <para>It was noted from the Vice-Chancellor&#39;s statement that under the terms of the Bill the University would be prevented from distributing money from the General Services Fee other than for the provision to students of those amenities and services that are not of an academic nature and that are declared by University statute to be amenities or services that are of direct benefit to the University. The Council of the University would be given discretion to approve payments for these purposes to national bodies concerned with sporting activities, to bodies with objectives similar to that which represents Australian university law students, and to a national body representing postgraduate students. However the terms of the Bill would deny to the Council any discretion to approve payments from compulsorily collected fees to a national body representing students in a more general way even where the national body provided particular amenities and services of a non-academic kind which would clearly be of direct benefit to the University and its students. </para>

          <para>I think this is a deplorable piece of legislation. It is notorious that student bodies are capable of great variations so far as political philosophies are concerned. There is nothing wrong with that. We would not want them to be locked into positions. Among the revolutionaries who have been thrown up by the Australian Union of Students and its predecessor, the National Union of Australian University Students- for obvious reasons, it could never have had the initials of the Australian National Union of Students- was that terrible revolutionary, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Peter</inline> Durack, the Attorney-General, who is a former president! He no doubt has passed through the revolutionary phase and is now an impeccable conservative. I believe that this is a bad Bill. The Opposition does not propose to force the issue to a division but we want to indicate our very vigorous opposition and, of course, our support for our amendment. It is unlikely that our amendment will be defeated -it might be a pretty close call- judging by the numbers in the chamber at the moment. We strongly oppose the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I rise to speak very briefly in support of the Bills and to oppose the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition in relation to the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill. I do not think that I have ever had as much interest shown in a speech as is being shown in the House this afternoon. Everybody is interested to know when I will finish. There are just a couple of things that I would like to say on this legislation. The honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barry Jones)</inline> tried to pin this legislation as an attack on the Australian Union of Students. Let us be quite clear about this. The thrust of these two Bills - the Australian National University Amendment Bill and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill- represents the Federal Government&#39;s response to the problems of compulsory membership of student organisations, so-called student unionism, and the unrepresentative use of student funds from those campuses for which the Federal Government has some sort of legislative responsibility. The legislation seeks to safeguard the very important principle of freedom of association and, equally important, freedom of non-association. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not have time to detail the whole of the history which has given rise to this legislation, but I think two major historical facts need to be remembered. They have largely contributed to the need for this sort of Bill. The first is the channelling of compulsory student funds by unrepresentative student organisations to every conceivable ratbag minority cause in the country and overseas. The second fact is that in the past there has been a denial of student status and student rights by some university administrations around the country to those students who refused to pay the compulsory student union levy. We are safeguarding those students, a protection that I certainly did not enjoy when I was at the campus of the University of Western Australia. </para>
          <para>We have heard the Opposition contribution. I want to contrast that furphy with the facts of the legislation. It is to safeguard students&#39; rights. Let us just remind ourselves of the main provision in the legislation. Membership of student organisations will be voluntary. Fees payable in respect of membership of a student organisation will also be voluntary. No student will be penalised for not joining. That is a right which was not enjoyed by all students in the past. Compulsory fees can be used only for the provision of amenities or services. Where it is the case that the council of a university makes compulsory fee money available to a student organisation for the provision by that organisation of approved amenities or services, the council must firstly satisfy itself that the governing body of that organisation is representative of its members. When paid, such moneys will be for the provision of amenities and services which will directly benefit the university. Moneys will not be paid to any national organisation unless the council is satisfied that it is encouraging students&#39; sporting and recreational activities, promoting student interests in some other particular educational, cultural or social field, or promoting the interests of post-graduate students. </para>
          <para>There is also going to be accountability in terms of the disposal of that money with details of receipts and expenditures. In summary, we have a legislative package which I believe takes a very small step along the important road of providing for the introduction of the principles of voluntary association and academic freedom. We are talking about the principles of voluntary association; simply that means the freedom to join or not to join. If one decides not to join, one is not to be penalised for that decision. It is the freedom to pay money to an organisation one supports. Any student in any tertiary institution in this capital can still belong to Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Union of Students or any other organisation, but this legislation goes one step further in that it provides for the freedom not to join and not to pay that money, and importantly, not to be penalised for that decision. Therefore, I find it absolutely incredible, when we are talking about such basic freedoms, that we are encountering the opposition that we have had this afternoon and that we had in the chamber only last week. I strongly support the legislation and I trust the House will oppose the amendment. </para>

            <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Public Works Committee Act</inline> 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Redevelopment of Brisbane International Airport- Initial works phase 1. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">The proposal referred to the Committee for investigation and report is for the construction of the initial works associated with the proposed redevelopment of Brisbane International Airport to the north-east of the existing Airport. The initial works include reclamation of the site with sand filling dredged from Moreton Bay to accommodate the proposed new runway, taxiways, apron, building areas and roadways; the construction of a floodway channel to divert the flood waters presently discharging across the site; the construction of a 3,500-metre runway and associated taxiway system; and other associated engineering preparatory works. The estimated cost of the proposal when examined by the Committee was $98m at July 1979 prices. </para>
          <para>The balance of the works required to complete phase 1 involves the provision of additional facilities such as domestic terminal buildings, aprons, control tower, access roads, car parks and navigational aids and system at an additional cost of approximately $74m based on July 1979 prices. In reporting on the proposed works, the Committee has drawn a number of conclusions and made a number of recommendations which the Government has considered. The Committee in its report has agreed that the proposed concept for redevelopment of Brisbane International Airport is satisfactory, that the site is suitable and that the general scope of the initial works of phase 1 is necessary for the redevelopment. However, the Committee recommends that commencement of the proposed works be deferred until at least 1986 and that in the meantime the present runway be extended for international services and the Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airways terminals be expanded by those airlines. </para>
          <para>It is normal procedure for government decisions on major investments in public works to be justified in full cost/benefit economic analysis. In the case of this project this analysis was carried out by the Bureau of Transport Economics, and subsequently reviewed by the Department of Transport in the light of the latest information available. In fact, the analysis and recent review compared the proposals referred to the Committee with an alternative similar to that now recommended by the Committee. The review concluded that there is no economic penalty in proceeding with the redevedopment immediately by comparison with delaying it and making interim improvements to the existing airport. The Committee has not challenged this analysis. Furthermore, the review brought out unquantified benefits which would support a decision to proceed now. These benefits include the virtual removal of significant noise nuisance to some 10,000 residents near the airport, the elimination of current building heights restrictions, and the reduction of the cost of air traffic delays. In short the Committee appears to have based its recommendations on minimising short term government capital expenditure without due regard to the full economic considerations in the longer term. Turning now to the Committee&#39;s specific recommendations and conclusions I make the following comments: Firstly, based on the range of forecasts for aircraft movements until the 1990s, which is well within the capacity of the existing main runway, the Committee considers that a need has not been established for the immediate development of the proposed 02/20 runway. The Department of Transport stated in evidence that the proposed new runway was not required to provide early additional runway capacity. However, the Government is confident of the continued growth of Brisbane and Queensland generally. It believes that long term forecasts, such as prepared by the Department, reflect more accurately the growth prospects for aviation at Brisbane than do the predictions submitted by the domestic airlines to the Committee, apparently based on fairly recent trends, and that these long term forecasts are more appropriate for decision-making purposes. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the Committee does not accept that the total elimination of the curfew at the present time at Brisbane Airport will generally provide any significant benefit to the users of passengers or freight services. Thirdly, the Committee considers that the building height restrictions within the Brisbane Central Business District are not, of themselves, sufficient reason to advance the requirement for the proposed work at this time. Fourthly, the Committee recognises the noise problem in certain Brisbane residential suburbs and agrees that eventual redevelopment of Brisbane Airport should remove or reduce this nuisance. The current noise problem is not, in itself, sufficient reason to redevelop the airport immediately. The evidence from the Department of Transport did not suggest that any one of these individual benefits on its own justified the proposed redevelopment. However, in aggregate they are complementary to the economic analysis and offer significant benefits in support of the proposal. In particular, the Government believes that the opportunity to alleviate noise nuisance to a substantial number of people should not be passed over. </para>
          <para>Fifthly, the Committee accepts that upgrading of current domestic terminal facilities is warranted and should be permitted as proposed by Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia. The cost of upgrading required to meet demand until 1992 would be considerably higher than the domestic airlines have recently contemplated. Inevitably, these costs will be reflected into airline fares in due course. In any case the Department&#39;s investigations show that the ultimate capacity of the present total domestic terminal area, regardless of improvements made in the meantime, will not suffice for the period contemplated by the Committee. </para>
          <para>Sixthly, the Committee recommends the extension of the existing 04/22 runway to the north-east by approximately 300 metres be considered an interim measure to enable greater utilisation of Brisbane Airport by international operators. This recommendation relies on paragraph 113 of the Committee&#39;s report which conflicts with advice obtained recently by the Department from Qantas Airways Ltd. The Government will further investigate this aspect to determine whether there is need to review the required length of the proposed new runway. </para>
          <para>Seventhly, the Committee agrees that the proposed concept for the ultimate redevelopment of Brisbane Airport is satisfactory. Eighthly, the site, to the north east of the existing airport, is considered suitable for the redevelopment of Brisbane Airport. Ninthly, the Committee agrees that the general scope of the initial works of phase 1 are necessary for the ultimate redevelopment of Brisbane Airport. I have already noted the Committee&#39;s acceptance of these aspects of the proposals of the Department of Transport. Tenthly, a new international terminal building should be included in phase 1 works. </para>
          <para>The Department of Transport is satisfied that, subject to appropriate operating procedures, the interim use of the present international terminal would not be prejudicial to safety. However, the Government will give further consideration to the Committee&#39;s recommendation. </para>
          <para>Eleventhly, as it has not been effectively demonstrated to the Committee that the proposed redevelopment deserves high national priority, the increases in domestic and international air fares that will result from full cost recovery of the project are considered premature. Because of the variables involved it is premature to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of the cost of this project on air fares beyond the general conclusion that they would not be substantial. In any event, the Government has already recognised a need for special consideration to be given to cost recovery aspects of this project, and this will be done at a very early date. Twelfthly, the Committee recommends that the commencement of the works proposed in this reference be deferred until at least 1986, and recommends for consideration the works set out in paragraphs 103 to 116, which it believes will enable the current facilities to meet Brisbane&#39;s major airport needs to the year 1 992. </para>
          <para>For reasons which are apparent from my comments on other recommendations, the Government does not accept that the proposed works should be deferred. Deferral is not supported by the economic analysis which establishes that there is no overall economic penalty in proceeding immediately with this project. The Government believes that there are real and substantial community benefits to be derived from proceeding without delay to the redevelopment of Brisbane Airport in a manner which will provide an adequate base for future improvements to meet the long term needs of Brisbane. Upon the concurrence of the House in this resolution, detailed planning of the work referred to the Committee can proceed having regard to the comments contained in this resolution. The Government desires to thank the Committee for its thorough consideration of this large complex project. </para>

However, my colleague, the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Humphreys)</inline> has some special personal views in relation to the location of runways that has been suggested in the recommendations of the report. He will deal with those himself. At this stage, the Opposition is completely opposed to any suggestion for a total abolition of the curfew, and, on existing technology for aircraft engine design, it is a matter that we will look at when the time arrives. The Opposition takes considerable pride from the fact that, contrary to some of the claims made by honourable members opposite, it initiated the land acquisition program and acquired the first land for the new airport site.

              <para>- You said that more than $70m is an absolute waste. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I return to the more important subject. The overall cost of the project is estimated at $172m. In January 1979, the Queensland Director of the Department of Transport estimated the cost of the total project at $l50m at 1977 prices. The point that the Opposition wants to make is that this is a major item of expenditure. In two years, the estimate of costs has risen already by some 15 per cent- not one sod has yet been turnedfrom $ 1 50m to $ 1 72m. There will need to be absolute stringency and control over construction, design standards, and the quality of fitments that go into the whole project. Can I make this one point as strongly as I can on behalf of the people who will use the airport and will pay for the airport. Airports ought to be functional. They ought to be utilitarian. But they ought not be monumental. It is not the province of a Minister for Transport, or a government, to erect a Taj Mahal at an airport for which air travellers forever have to pay. </para>

              <para>- That is a utilitarian, conservative type of airport terminal and was a credit to the Minister at that time. In the report of the Public Works Commission, the point is made that on the information provided to the Committee there will be a cost to each international air traveller of $1.30 directly attributable to the cost of this development. The cost to domestic passengers will be $2.10 each. These are large amounts considered in the context of the total air fare and as an addition to the cost recovery component of domestic air fares. </para>

          <para>In his statement to the Parliament, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> said that special consideration is to be given to the cost recovery aspect of this project. On behalf of the people who use aircraft, I ask him to provide that information as soon as possible. If it is a scheme that can be used elsewhere, we ought to know about it. I have expressed my view in respect of the Opposition&#39;s attitude towards the curfew. It is dealt with in the report of the Committee. The valid clauses are referred to, particularly in clause 70 and 72, and the Committee&#39;s conclusion is in paragraph 73. </para>
          <para>On behalf of the Committee, I say that this is a detailed and very expensive project. The report was tabled yesterday. Obviously the Government has worked all night and has given detailed consideration and analysis to the content of the report, the priority of expenditure and the justification for that expenditure, and it has come up with a pre-printed document this afternoon. This makes a farce of the work of the standing committees of this Parliament. We know that the project is urgent. But the Government could have come back within a reasonable time- say within four years- after it had considered the work of the Committee. I ask honourable members to go through the statement of the Minister when they have the time to do so. I say this on a bipartisan basis: Go through the statement of the Minister and look closely at the response to each of the recommendations of the Committee. The responses are an insult. The Government has rejected the evidence given to the Committee by the Department of Transport. Its own advice to the Minister for Transport, who is sitting at the table, is rejected.

              <para>-I am pointing to the table. Later on in the report the evidence given by the airlines is rejected by the Government. The conclusion drawn by the Committee in the paragraph on the extension of existing runways is rejected by the Government. I am not saying that these are the wrong conclusions. What I am saying is that better consideration should have been given to the matter and a much better argued case should have been presented. The Parliament is being treated as being totally irrelevant. I conclude with those remarks because I want to allow my colleagues time to speak on the matter. The Opposition supports the motion but it rejects the proposals to abolish the curfew at Brisbane airport. </para>

            <para>- I speak on this matter as the  Chairman  of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I wish to respond to some points made in the statement made today by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> I want to refer in particular to several areas in relation to which the advice he has outlined in his statement today varies substantially from the advice that his Department gave to the Committee. Firstly, the Committee was concerned with short term considerations, especially the rise in air fares. The Minister has told us today that special consideration will be given to the cost recovery factor in relation to Brisbane airport. The Committee welcomes this move because, in the Committee&#39;s view, when money is spent on facilities before they are needed and when this cost is charged to air travellers, some special provision should be made. The very fact that the Government acknowledges that it has to do this in the case of Brisbane airport, I think to some extent acknowledges the very point made by the Committee, namely, that the expenditure is premature. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the very limited time available to me if I am to allow other honourable members to speak, I wish to point out some of the inaccuracies in the statement and where these conflict with some of the evidence presented to the Committee. Let me deal, firstly, with the matter of the taxi-ing distance to the international terminal. It is quite clear from the evidence of the Air Pilots Guild of Australia and from Qantas Airways Ltd that there was a substantial element of danger in any taxi-ing distance greater than 5 kilometres. Aircraft could taxi for such distances with slower taxi-ing rates and the like, but there would have to be some reason for it, such as in the case of an abortive take-off. </para>
          <para>Secondly, I come to the matter of cost recovery. The Committee was very concerned about this matter because we heard a lot of evidence to the effect that there were substantial needs in airports in other areas. The situation could be summarised in many ways. I could quote the actual evidence that was given. For instance, even the Department of Transport acknowledged that Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport was saturated and that something had to be done, but that the solution would be very costly. The air pilots see the length of the runway at the Adelaide airport as presenting the biggest danger. It says that that has to be lengthened. Qantas and some of the other airlines see the needs of the airports at Perth, Darwin, Sydney and Adelaide and even Canberra as being more compelling than those of Brisbane. They put forward their submissions along that line. </para>
          <para>The Committee could not get from the Department of Transport a list of priorities of works to be carried out by the Department over a period. It seemed to the Committee that the Department was adopting a piecemeal approachdoing one thing at a time- and that we would have to look at the effect of that approach on the cost recovery program and air fares. It is quite clear that if the works at Brisbane airport go ahead, as the Government is now proposing, there will be an increase in air fares of at least 4 per cent solely to cover the cost of that project, unless special provisions are made in relation to cost recovery. When the cost of that project is added to the cost of other projects that are proposed, such as those at Canberra and Sydney and those which are badly needed in a number of other areas, we see that there is a requirement for cost recovery positions. The Minister&#39;s statement referred to the capacity of the current terminals. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In any case the Department&#39;s investigations show that ultimate capacity of the present total domestic terminal area complex, regardless of improvements made in the meantime, will not suffice for the period contemplated by the Committee. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is in direct contradiction of what TransAustralia Airlines told the Committee. It is obviously the result of a survey that has been carried out by the Department, because the Department told the Committee nothing about this. The Department obviously treated the Committee with contempt in relation to that matter. </para>
          <para>I refer to what TAA stated in its evidence in relation to the terminal buildings. It said that the current state of the existing terminal buildings, aprons, roads and surfaces is such that it is possible with some improvement to cater for TAA forecast traffic levels for the next 12 to 15 years or about 6 years longer than 1992. TAA also told us that the situation in Brisbane is not as serious as that which exists at some other airports in Australia. So that is the situation in relation to the terminal buildings. If the Committee is to bring down a solid report it is unfortunate, I think, that we are not given the benefit of some of these analyses made by the Department of Transport. Our proceedings are conducted in such a way that the Department of Transport has the right and the opportunity at the end of the evidence to counter any of the other evidence that has been given. But we still received no evidence in relation to that matter. </para>
          <para>In his statement the Minister says that these costs to be borne by the airlines will inevitably increase fares. The point I wish to make in relation to that matter is that these costs will increase air fares to a much smaller extent than will the total costs incurred through the cost recovery program. In fact, the amounts contemplated by the two airlines were something like $2m, $4m and $6m. In the first year of operation of the Brisbane airport development- in 1985-86- the total amount to be paid by the airlines under the cost recovery program will be something like $ 13.5m. That compares the two components that will cause air fares to rise. </para>
          <para>There were a number of other inaccuracies in the report. Because I know that some other honourable members whose electorates are located in Brisbane wish to speak on this matter I will not say any more, except to refer to the Minister&#39;s statement that the Government&#39;s recommendation in relation to the extension of the runway is based on paragraph 1 13 of the Committee&#39;s report. In fact, paragraph 1 13 of the report is almost word for word part of the submission that the Qantas representatives gave to the Committee under oath. If the Department has got further information from Qantas the Committee certainly has not been told of it. Qantas gave the Committee that information under oath and we accepted it as being true and genuine. The Department now tells us that it has other information. There are a number of other points that I could make. But, as I said, the Committee supports the general concept of the development. Our argument is in relation to the timing of it. I feel that the Government has made a mistake in adhering to the original timing proposal. </para>

            <para>-I rise to defend the Committee&#39;s report. Having heard the statement by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and having read it as he was reading it to the House, I find that this Minister, who is quite well known throughout Australia for his contempt of Parliament and all that is associated with it, was quite contemptuous of the report written by the Committee. In fact, I would be highly surprised if he even read it. It seems to me that the Minister and or the Government have treated the Committee and this Parliament with contempt. This proposal involves an expenditure initially of some $90m and eventually $172m. After taking evidence from witnesses for more than five days- all of them were under oath- the Committee came to certain conclusions on this matter, although I might say that they were not unanimous conclusions. It did not do that lightly. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Committee presented its report yesterday afternoon, and it was ordered that it be printed. This afternoon, 24 hours later, this Minister holds the whole report in contempt. In fact, I bet that his statement had been written before he even read the report. He brought the matter back into the House today. We have limited time available to debate this statement, and he knew that. It is an old tactic of his: &#39;Jam them right up and you will get them right out of the bales&#39;. So at the last moment he brought this matter before the Parliament and he is giving us all a limited time to talk on it. The whole proposal, in my view, is based on emotion rather than fact. </para>
          <para>If his Department were more competent than it was when it appeared before the Committee during this inquiry it would have argued strongly that a new airport should be developed in Brisbane. It did not do this. The Minister says that the Department had information that was not available to the Committee. Why was it not available to the Committee? Does the Committee have to drag everything out of the Department? Why can his Department not put together in the first instance something that does not have to be brought out by cross-examination oy the Committee? The Committee spent a lot of time just getting the Minister&#39;s Department to give us facts and figures. Finally, the Committee had to get the Department to rewrite them all because nothing lined up; they were out of sequence. Having got all of those facts and figures before us and having marshalled and mustered and considered them- we spent a lot of time doing thatthe Committee came to the conclusions set out in its report. The Minister- I take him to task on this here or anywhere- made a rather bland statement about the inordinate taxi-ing distances of up to 6 kilometres for aircraft at Brisbane airport. The Minister in his statement said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Department of Transport is satisfied, that subject to appropriate operating procedures . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not know whether that means that the aircraft will be pulled around with a Ferguson tractor, but we were told if these aircraft were run under their own steam for 6 kilometres their brake linings would heat up to 1,200 degrees fahrenheit. If they were to stand for a period of 90 minutes after attaining that temperature they would lose only half of that heat. The heat would drop to 600 degrees and that is when the tyres pop. The Minister&#39;s statement continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The interim use of the present international terminal would not be prejudical to safety. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If the Minister is a responsible Minister he will expunge those words because the use would be prejudical to safety. I invite him, instead of smirking to his colleagues behind him, to find out what happened at Honolulu airport when the reef strip was built. Qantas told us of that. If the Minister wants to charge Qantas with contempt of the Committee, he can go ahead and do it. That report is based on the evidence of Qantas and the operators. I know that time is running out and I do not want to delay the House more than is necessary, but I think this matter is very important. I cannot understand the Minister&#39;s statement about paragraph 113. At the top of page S of the statement he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This recommendation relies on paragraph 113 of the Committee&#39;s report which conflicts with advice obtained recently by the Department from Qantas. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not know how recently that advice was obtained. He stated further </para>
          <para>The Government will further investigate this aspect to determine whether there is need to review the required length of the proposed new runway. </para>
          <para class="block">Who said that? Nowhere in this report does the Committee deal with the length of the proposed runway. This is what makes me suspicious. I do not think that the Minister has read the report. If he reads it he will find that the Committee is saying that with a maximum of a further 300 metres added to the existing runway- not the proposed runway- it would allow Qantas flights, with any configuration of loads- passengers, fuel, luggage and cargo- to go anywhere that Qantas might want them to go. If honourable members read the report they will find that Qantas flights can go anywhere they want to go now but the extra 300 metres of runway would allow them to go where they might want to go. So the Minister has not read the report. He is railroading this matter through the Parliament. If this Parliament were a responsible parliament it would defer this matter and hold it over until honourable members have had time to read that report and to find out how irresponsible this Minister is in making offthecuff statements about things not being prejudicial to safety. No responsible Minister can say that. I hold strongly to the view that the Committee is correct in its conclusions. I agree with all 13 conclusions. If the Government had any sense and any respect for this Parliament, and if it were not our pork-barreling, which I rather suspect it might be- a Country Party Minister our porkbarreling; goodness, gracious me, who would ever make such an allegation?- it would certainly let the matter have further investigation by the Parliament. The Government is not prepared to do that. I trust that the Parliament will reject this statement and adjourn the matter until next year. </para>

            <para>-I want to say a few pleasant things for a few minutes. I support completely what the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> had to say. What he said is correct. He should be assured that at least two and a half million people in Australia applaud every sentence of his statement. The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works is a very important committee. It has a very distinguished  chairman.  But of course the Parliament is still the Parliament and committees do not run the country. Parliament is responsible for legislation and for the economic management of the country. I know that all sensible members here support what the Minister said. Let me go over the history of this project. I am incited to do this because of what has been said by the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson).</inline> Brisbane airport has been a makeshift one since World War II. It was developed by the Americans when Brisbane was a garrison town in World War II. The airport has always been inadequate, poorly planned and in an inappropriate place. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are those of us here who have fought for many years- well over a decade- for this event to take place. It is appropriate that at the end of the parliamentary year in 1979 the highlight is represented by the Minister&#39;s statement. I now come to the politics of the matter. A question worth asking- I hope that everybody asks this question- is: Were this Government not on these benches, would this airport project be going ahead? I have been provoked to say that it would not be going ahead. I produce at least two imporant pieces of evidence. Every person who gets a job in constructing this airport- there will be 6,000 man years involved in its constructionought to remember that were this Government not in office, the project would not be going ahead. The McMahon Government at the end of 1971 and the beginning of 1972 stated quite clearly what were the plans for the construction of the airport. There was a program of expenditure for 1973, 1974 and 1975. That decision was predicted. In 1973 the Whitlam Governmentthrough the agency of the Coombs report- said:  No airport. Put it off. It &#39;s not a goer. Don &#39;t do it &#39;. When the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> in the election campaign in 1977, indicated that the airport project would get under way, very sadly the then  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition- I have not quoted this in the House before- on behalf of the Opposition said: </para>
          <para class="block">We are not going to pull any Brisbane airport out of a Pandora &#39;s box&#39;. Everybody should know that the Opposition, when in Government, said no. Were the Opposition in government, the project would not be in the process of authorisation of this expenditure today. The honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Humphreys)</inline> knows that I have not said this kind of thing before, but I have been provoked to say this by words that were uttered earlier in the debate. </para>
          <para>I have two minutes left in which to deal with one or two points. The Committee&#39;s proposal for the development of the airport by adding to the present runway, doing something to the terminals and so on, then proceeding to build a new airport half a dozen years later, would have two effects. Honourable members know that if they postpone something for half a dozen years, it will not be done. That is not in the mind of the Committee. But it is a more expensive proposition to put more money into the present site and then half a dozen years later to build the new airport. That involves an expenditure of an extra $2 5 m. More precisely, because of the immediate terminal propositions and because of those effects on air fares, it would not have been an acceptable proposition to increase air fares in six years time; it was an acceptable proposition to increase air fares today when the first brick was put on the new site, as would have to be done by Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines and so on. That builds immediately into the cost structure. The Committee&#39;s proposal was uneconomic. It has another fault. It relies upon estimates of the throughput of traffic at Brisbane Airport. The Committee never made a judgment about this. I am not scarifying it as I have too much respect for the Committee and its chairman, but I believe that the result was influenced too much by the inadequate and grubby evidence submitted by Australia&#39;s domestic airlines. They have a vested interest in under estimating the throughput of passengers. They were attempting to project matters 20 years ahead and they have never done that successfully before. That should not have occurred. I support the Minister&#39;s statement. I have made the political position perfectly clear for the first time in this House. It had to be made perfectly clear. The project will be a capital works program of enormous economic benefit and it will help the whole northern part of Australia. </para>

              <para>- It is correct. On the evidence of the Department of Transport the constituents of my electorate, mainly those in the areas of Cannon Hill and Morningside, will be within the 25-NEF- Noise Exposure Forecast. If the Department of Transport had given greater consideration to this matter it would have moved runway 02/20 probably a mile further north-east so that the constituents in my electorate would not have come within the 25-NEF, thereby alleviating the problem that they will be inundated with from noise pollution, air pollution and not least of all the hazards of fully laden aircraft taking off in a south-easterly direction at certain times of the year over a heavily populated area of my electorate. </para>

          <para>The Committee did recognise in its conclusions the noise problem in the Brisbane residential area but did not think it was of such a magnitude as to justify the expenditure of the money at this time. I cannot agree with that. I feel that we should spend the money. I want to make it clear that the city of Brisbane and the State of Queensland should have a new international airport. When the Department of Housing and Construction and the Department of Transport were designing the airport they should have thought a little harder instead of playing politics and taking noise pollution out of one electorate and placing it in my electorate. This is what concerns me more than Brisbane and Queensland getting a new international airport. </para>
          <para>As other members of the Public Works Committee have already explained in this place, when phase 1 of the project is completed there will be taxi-ing problems. The Jumbo jets will not be able to taxi the full 6.5 kilometres. They will have problems with tyres blowing out because of heat. The light aircraft that will have to taxi that distance will have cylinder head problems and will have to shut down before they can take off. Jumbo jets will be taking off with their tyres blown out. That is okay; they can take off with tyres blown out, but they cannot land. These are the sorts of hazards that this Minister has agreed to today, and so has the honourable member for Lilley. They are agreeing today that the airport at Brisbane will have a runway which will allow aircraft to taxi that distance. It is totally irresponsible of the Minister. I suggest that when he sent his officers from the Department of Transport to give evidence in Brisbane to the Committee he deliberately told them not to give the Committee the full details. The Department of Housing and Construction did give full evidence, but the evidence of the Department of Transport was lacking. It is the Minister who is playing politics. He knew that the evidence that the Department of Transport would give to the Committee would make it reach the conclusion that it did and then he could come into the House and claim to be a great man by saying: &#39;We are not going to listen to the Committee. We are going to let the project go ahead &#39;. It is absolutely disgraceful of the Minister and I deplore his actions today. He is saying that the people of Brisbane are going to be inundated with noise pollution, air pollution, safety hazards and they will be without a curfew. The Minister will remember and rue the day he has made this decision. </para>

              <para>-by leave-First of all, I thank my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Shipton),</inline> for the privilege of tabling this report. In presenting this report, I inform the House that a separate report is in preparation on that pan of the terms of reference related to assistance to the civil power. I point out to the House that it seems that, when matters of defence come forward, by a conspiracy of circumstance, time is cut short to a point where there is practically no debate at all. I think it most regrettable that an important report of this nature, particularly at a time like this when international events are anything but encouraging, should be introduced at this very late stage. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The precise terms of reference for the present report were: &#39;The implementation and effectiveness of Australia&#39;s announced defence programs, with particular reference to procurement policy&#39;. This reference was received on 12 July 1978 and Sub-committee C of the Joint Committee commenced hearings on 20 June. The last formal evidence was presented in October 1979. In the intervening 18 months, we took over 2,300 pages of written and oral evidence from a very wide range of sources. The report is not a lengthy document, but I put it to the House that it may be one of the more significant papers to emerge from the parliamentary committee system in recent years. It represents a year and a half of concentrated work and detailed examination of evidence in a very complex field. It was exhaustively considered before being agreed to. </para>
          <para>This report takes &#39;procurement&#39; in its widest sense. It examines the procurement process from the initial strategic analysis right through to the acquisition of equipment for the defence forces. We have expressed our full agreement with the strategic assessment as set out in the 1976 defence White Paper and as subsequently updated and restated by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> It is most unlikely that Australia could become the target of major direct attack inside the next five years. At the same time, we allude to the Sino- Vietnamese conflict and developments in Iran and, I might add, developments in Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia and here, there and everywhere, not in any alarmist way but to point out the continuing potential for sudden and unforeseeable changes. </para>
          <para>I wish to acquaint the House with our major recommendations. Honourable members will appreciate that in a statement of this type brevity is essential, and I commend a study of the report to those who wish a full outline of the Committee&#39;s views on the subjects I now mention. We have certain reservations concerning what is known as the &#39;core force&#39; concept. These centre on our concern for the capacity of the Defence Force to expand rapidly enough to meet some contingencies. Our concern is sufficient to prompt us to recommend that a high-level inquiry into the expansion capability of the Defence Force be undertaken. There is a need for an interdepartmental or national approach to such an inquiry which should determine the industrial and manpower support which could be available to the force-in-being. </para>
          <para>This Committee reported two years ago on Australian defence industry, and we have followed the matter up in the present report. We maintain our view that our defence industry base is not as good as it might be, and that we should develop it to make Australia as free as possible from dependence on foreign suppliers. We suggest that this can be achieved through the provision of stable workloads, acceptance of apparent cost disadvantages where these are not excessive, improved communication between industry and the Department of Defence and, importantly, by Government and the Department sticking to decisions previously announced. </para>
          <para>The Committee, whilst concurring with the view that our strategic outlook is favourable, wishes to make the point that we should use this time to advantage. We consider that it would be unwise to wait for some threat to emerge before acting to enhance preparedness and further increase our self-reliance. We do not suggest in detail how this might be done, or how much money should be allocated. We recommend that Government act to determine several matters: The most effective security strategy; capabilities needed to execute that strategy; deficiencies in our present capabilities; and what is required to make good any such deficiencies. We recommend that these capabilities be introduced over a 10-year period, and wish to make the points that this will require a bipartisan approach to defence. Some form of supplemental equipment acquisition budgeting may also be required. Such funding would provide for supplemental 10-year budgeting packages to cover the development, production and entry into service of specific equipment systems. This funding would be separate from the annual defence budget. We think this an extremely important consideration. I repeat it: This funding would be separate from the annual defence budget. </para>
          <para>The Committee received convincing evidence that there is a problem in procedures which apply to the purchase of defence equipment in Australia. We are persuaded that these procedures act as a deterrent to Australian industry and to the Department of Defence. We have recommended improvements, and suggested principles on which these might be based. We have made an exhaustive study of the Defence Department&#39;s decision-making system. A major point arising from this study is the length of time it can take to acquire a piece of major equipment for the forces. According to standard Defence Department procedures it can take up to eight years from the issuance of a major equipment proposal, and rarely takes less than three or four. These lead times exceed likely periods of warning for some defence contingencies we may have to face. This has been accentuated over the last two or three days. The Committee has therefore recommended that, if it is not possible to reduce the contribution of decision-making to lead times, key major equipments should be acquired earlier. Our examination of the organisation of defence procurement revealed that for several reasons aspects of this function have been dispersed between various departments or agencies. The Committee considers that this dispersal can lead to inefficiencies or lack of flexibility. For this reason, we have recommended that functions related to the procurement of major military equipment now with the Department of Administrative Services be transferred to the Department of Defence. </para>
          <para>The development of the Defence Force should be based on a deterrent posture to show that the cost of interference with Australia or her vital interests would be prohibitive and should seek to demonstrate that Australia is concerned to contribute to the security of the region. The approach used by the Defence Department to define the Defence Force requirements- the core force concept- has much to commend it in a period of financial stringency. The Committee considers, however, that there has been an overemphasis on this approach. The Committee agrees with the introduction to the 1976 White Paper on Defence which stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The first responsibility of government is to provide the nation with security from armed attack and from the constraints on independent national decisions imposed by the threat of such attack. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">However, long lead items, high attrition rates and potential political direction of military action may dictate that future conflicts will be of relatively short duration but of very high intensity, with limited prospect of immediate resupply. Therefore, the force in being, in contrast to the core force, must be sufficient to survive the initial shock of such conflict and still establish a base of capabilities for subsequent action. If this objective is to be attained, it will require the allocation of additional financial resources to defence, particularly for the timely acquisition of new equipments. In examining the procedures, practices and constraints relevant to the selection and subsequent acquisition of specific brand names of equipment, the Committee formed the view that: </para>
          <para>The system for procurement from Australian sources is excessively cumbersome and complex and that it poses serious problems for both the Defence Department and local industry; </para>
          <para>The Government should direct relevant Departments and agencies to produce an improved system for local defence procurement, and that this should be a matter of high priority; </para>
          <para>The expenditure overseas of large sums on defence equipment should in principle be supervised by Australians; and </para>
          <para>The Department of Defence should investigate ways of reducing the contribution of departmental decision-making processes to equipment acquisition lead times, which often exceed the five year warning period spoken of before, without degrading the quality of decisions. If this is not possible, it will be necessary to acquire additional equipments well in advance- I have already stated this- of any warning period. </para>
          <para>The evidence shows that the organisation of procurement: </para>
          <para>Divides responsibility between too many departments and agencies, with a consequent lack of consistency and loss of fast reaction time; fails to take account of the fact, recognised in overseas reports and organisations, that procurement is a specialist activity in its own right; and so far as local procurement is concerned, is based on requirements and practices which tend to erode our defence industrial base. </para>
          <para class="block">Australia is separated from its overseas suppliers of defence equipment by long lines of communication. These lines of communication are vulnerable and potentially capable of interdiction although Australia&#39;s dependence on the use of foreign shipping for the carriage of its overseas trade restricts this possibility to the context of a general threat to Western shipping. In a deteriorating world situation overseas suppliers would be likely to accord higher priority to their own needs than Australia&#39;s. That is pretty obvious. In a conflict with a regional country, overseas suppliers may be unwilling to provide Australia with its defence requirements. For these cogent strategic reasons the Committee recommends that Australia should become increasingly self-reliant for its production of defence equipment. </para>
          <para>It is necessary that there should be informed discussion in the electorate and the Parliament with a bipartisan approach developed in respect of defence policies and strategies, the essential requirements of the Defence Force, and the extent to which these resources should be allocated to provide these requirements. The Parliament, through its committee structure, should monitor all defence programs, and the Department of Defence should be encouraged to make a positive and continuing contribution to the informed nature of the debate by its active participation in and promotion of public seminars and by its briefing of the Parliament on defence issues. In this regard the Committee notes several innovations in recent months where this has been done. They are all to the good. </para>
          <para>In determining priorities for development of the Defence Force consideration should be given to the following elements: </para>
          <para>Those capabilities that are required to provide a military response to the lesser contingencies which could arise with little or no warning; those high performance capabilities relating to a general strategic requirement as dictated by the characteristics of the environment rather than by specific contingencies and required to provide deterrence against the use of military pressures or military means by a potential enemy to achieve its objectives and which could not be acquired within the period of warning likely to be available before a major threat to Australia could develop; and a representative selection of second tier or substitute capabilities- moderate cost, moderate performance, short lead time systems, that could be acquired in relatively large numbers during a period of developing threat- to enable the development of operating techniques, procedures and doctrines in a short period of crisis. </para>
          <para class="block">I pay tribute to members of the Committee. Each member of the Sub-Committee was completely objective in his approach to our responsibilities and I commend each member for his continued interest and the serious manner in which we examined and evaluated the evidence and finally formulated the recommendations. </para>
          <para>I wish to thank Malcolm Hills for his intense dedication to his work and to express the regrets of the Sub-Committee that continued illness has deprived the Committee of his services. </para>
          <para>Robert King has done a splendid job under extreme difficulties. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hills</inline> was not available <inline font-weight="bold">Mr King</inline> was there to take over and the Sub-Committee is grateful to him. </para>
          <para>Our two consultants, Commodore Ken Gray and Gary Brown justified the reputation they both have for their knowledge and understanding of the defence scene. The vast and valuable experience of Ken Gray and the observations and monitoring of defence activities here and abroad by Gary combined to provide most valuable assistance to the Sub-Committee. </para>
          <para>Finally the Sub-Committee is immensely grateful to all who were prepared to appear before it and assist with their submissions. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Defence, the Honourable Jim Killen, and the Minister assisting him, the Honourable John McLeay, never hesitated to make every possible facility available to the SubCommittee to assist our inquiries as a result of Minister Killen &#39;s co-operation Defence Department witnesses of the highest possible calibre appeared as witnesses before the Sub-Committee. </para>
          <para>Having said this, I must point out that, as this House is well aware, the inquiry which has produced this report has on occasions been controversial. On one or two occasions the controversy has reached this House. </para>
          <para>I have to inform the House that the Subcommittee expresses concern about remarks made in the House on 26 October 1978 by the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence and on 8 March 1979 by the Minister for Defence. </para>
          <para class="block">We consider that the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence over-reacted to criticism which had been levelled at the Department of Defence by witnesses who appeared before the subcommittee at public hearings and which in some cases had received Press publicity. The subcommittee considers that, to a lesser degree, the Minister for Defence also over-reacted to such criticisms. </para>
          <para>At the time of the criticisms levelled at the subcommittee, evidence favourable to and critical of the Department had been presented and further evidence was still to come. All this evidence had yet to be evaluated by the sub-committee and, accordingly, any criticisms of the sub-committee for its handling of the evidence were premature and ill founded. The sub-committee emphasises that the inquiry was carried out in accordance with the established procedures of the committee system of the Parliament and its Standing Orders. We therefore reject the criticisms that were levelled at the sub-committee, though we appreciate that the Ministers were understandably sensitive to some of the Press coverage of evidence given at public sessions of the sub-committee. </para>
          <para>We are pleased to note that, as further evidence was received and evaluated, far better understanding obtained between the Minister for Defence and the Department of Defence on the one hand and the sub-committee on the other. As a matter of fact, it built up to a crescendo. People from the Defence Department of the very highest calibre, appeared before the Committee by authorisation of the Minister, including <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Tange and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Anthony</inline> Synnot. </para>
          <para>I have also to inform the House that certain allegations have been made regarding the alleged intimidation of some witnesses before the subcommittee. These allegations are under examination. The Minister for Defence responded in detail in this House in November 1978 to the previous report of the Committee on defence industry. This mark of attention by the Government was most welcome. </para>
          <para>I commend this report to the House, and consider it essential that the report be debated after honourable members have had time to consider it. In that regard, I appeal to the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> to put on the program of business very early in the next sitting a debate on this report. I look forward to comment by the Minister for Defence in debate in this House after he has had opportunity to consider the matters raised in the report. </para>

            <para>-This report covers one of the important areas of government responsibility, especially in the area of defence. It has come before this Parliament not without considerable difficulties and some traumas. Firstly, this sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is seriously understaffed in view of the type of task it is required to carry out and the level and quality of reports it should be expected to produce on behalf of the Parliament. The people who have worked for the sub-committee have done more than should be required of such persons on behalf of the Parliament. Certainly the Parliament should examine seriously at some stage whether it wants such reports and, if it does as I indicated on another occasion when speaking on another report, it has to accept the responsibility of providing the necessary resources and finance. It is unfortunate that this House has decided that a separate committee on defence is not warranted, as I consider this subject is of sufficient importance to warrant such a committee. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The last two major reports of this subcommitteethe first on Australian defence industry and this one on Australian defence procurement- have examined two of the most difficult and important areas of government responsibility both nationally and internationally. The sums of money involved in procurement, the difficulties faced by the Parliament, which appropriates the sums of money included and the methods by which procurement becomes the private operation of a few individuals are subjects which should consistently and continually be examined by this House. During the period covered by this report a number of shortcomings, if not deficiencies, within the procurement system were exposed. Some of the deficiencies were minor, some were major. One thing which is highlighted is that one or two individuals in the employment of the Government have suffered very materially because they gave evidence honestly to the Committee about faults in the system- whether accurate or otherwise- which they believed to be correct. I think they have been treated very badly by the Department concerned and by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> who is responsible for that Department. He took the opportunity on one occasion in this House to make remarks about witnesses which were not warranted in any other way than as political justification. </para>
          <para>If there is to be an honest examination of procedures, if the procurement of defence equipment in Australia is to proceed on a basis which is above any form of criticism and which is to the advantage not only of the Australian Defence Force but also of the Australian nation, continuing examination of procedures and of the results and decision-making processes is necessary by this Parliament. This report marks the commencement of the examination of a problem. The report really should be repeated in the next Parliament by a full committee of this House, with adequate staffing and facilities, to see whether some of the problems raised during the hearing have been dealt with. If they have not, the failure to deal with them should be highlighted in every possible way. </para>
          <para>May I mention one or two practices that are a problem. Overseas tenderers for Australian equipment in many instances have substantial commercial advantages over Australian-based firms. Firstly, they are able to negotiate on the basis of estimate prices and not the actual price. Quite often they have the advantage of commercial assistance for their operations at government level which is not available to Australian firms. They are subject to different contractual arrangements which are beneficial to the overseas firms. In many cases, the actual specifications for the goods required are written in a form which denies more than one company the opportunity to tender. There was one instance in evidence where for five years an Australian firm had been seeking an alteration to the specifications for the provision of goods which are costing this Government $150,000 a year more than they would cost to buy from the Australian firm, but the Australian firm cannot tender. There are also cases of brand name tenders, which makes a farce to the tender system. </para>
          <para>I would like to say much more, but I will refer to only one thing which I think the  chairman  of the sub-committee did not mention. I will conclude on this note. I thank not only those people who worked on the sub-committee but also the Parliamentary Librarian for making arrangements for Gary Brown to be made available to the sub-committee. Without him we would have been in grave difficulties because of the total lack of staff available. Two officers are not enough for such a job, and anyone who suggests that it is sufficient is a fool. I also thank the  chairman  for the manner in which he conducted the inquiry. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

          <para class="block">In speaking to that motion, I take the opportunity to make a few remarks at the close of this session and at the close of this year. I have been Leader of the House for only a short time. I would like to express my thanks to all those people who have so strongly supported me in this new role. I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> for the help and assistance which you have given me and for the help and assistance which you have given the whole House in the manner in which you have conducted the proceedings of this House during these Budget sittings. As you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you and I are both barristers. In that respect, some may think that we have earned the title learned in the law&#39;. Others may not agree, of course. When it comes to the application of the Standing Orders, you have had occasion to point out to me the error of some of my ways in this chamber. I have been thankful for the coaching that you have given me in doing that. I hope that with continued coaching I might be able m time to learn the art of the Leader of the House. You <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> have conducted the proceedings of this House with decorum, dignity and appropriate firmness, where that has been required. I think all members of the House appreciate the way in which you have done that. </para>
          <para>I would like to thank the  Chairman  of Committees and the  Deputy  Speakers for the way in which they have handled their side of the business of the House. There have been some lengthy debates in Committee as well as at the second reading stage of Bills. The  Chairman  of Committees and each of the  Deputy  Speakers have handled that responsibility well and capably. I would like to thank the Clerks at the Table for the way in which they have helped me in my role as Leader of the House. I thank the staff in the Table Office and the other offices of the Parliament. I also thank the Clerks and the other staff and officers on behalf of all members of the House. Theirs is a very important role. The role of the  Clerk  is to advise you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> the  Chairman  of Committees and the  Deputy  Speakers. If the  Clerk,  his officers and the other staff in this area do not operate efficiently, sensibly and wisely, then of course the affairs of this House will stumble. </para>
          <para>I wish to make particular mention of my colleague, the right honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> who is the former Leader of the House. I can speak very plainly on behalf of all of us on this side of the House. We were very sorry to see the way in which the honourable gentleman was treated and the circumstances in which he felt, in the highest sense of duty as a Minister and as a member of parliament, obliged to resign his ministry and his position as Leader of the House. I think we would all say that as we look at 1980 we would certainly hope that the right honourable member for New England will obtain a clear acquittal of the charges levelled against him and that he will come back to this House next year with a completely clean bill of health. We look forward to working very closely with him in the future. </para>
          <para>I wish to express my thanks to my colleague and close friend, the Government Whip. He and I were both elected to this House in 1972. We both won seats from the Labor Party in an election when the Liberal and Country parties lost government. I thank also the  Deputy  Whip for his assistance to me. I thank the Opposition Whip and the  Deputy  Opposition Whip for the way in which they have co-operated with us within the vicissitudes of parliament and the requirements of their own party. I thank also my counterpart, the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> for the way in which we have been able to co-operate, again within the interests of and responsibilities for our own parties, to keep the business of the House running smoothly. I have appreciated since becoming Leader of the House, that the Parliamentary Liaison Officer occupies a vital role in the machinery of government. For two and a half years to the end of the last autumn sittings Roger Webb was the Parliamentary Liaison Officer to the former Leader of the House. He has now returned to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In his place, John Fox has performed the function of Parliamentary Liaison Officer extremely well, extremely ably and with an assiduousness that ought to be commended. He has occupied that position from the commencement of the Budget sittings. </para>
          <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, as we would judge from some of the proceedings in recent days, has a very difficult task- but nevertheless, as we know, a very important task- in reporting faithfully what has been said in this House for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. I thank the Principal Parliamentary Reporter and his staff. Always there is the Public Service, more often than not, in anonymity behind all those of whom I have spoken up to now. I wish to thank all of those members of the Public Service who work in support of the operations of this Parliament for the way in which they have carried out their functions. I also thank the staff of the Parliament who help us in this House. </para>
          <para>During the session there have been a number of parliamentary reforms. I will mention them only briefly. The Estimates committees were introduced for the first time. They were conducted as an experiment. I am sure that during the recess honourable members will seriously examine the operation of those Estimates committees, as will the Government. Legislation committees came into operation in the autumn sittings. Although they have not been used in the Budget sittings, I expect that they will be used in the next autumn sittings. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> have circulated a paper on the Estimates committees. Also, the  Clerk  has circulated a paper on the parliamentary committee system. The report of the Standing Orders Committee which suggests changes to the way in which petitions and claims of privilege are handled is before the House. I expect that during the recess honourable members will consider those papers and reports. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>we are about to leave the decade of the 1970s and enter the decade of the 1980s. I am sure that my colleague, the  Deputy  Prime Minister ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony)</inline> will say to the House that the Government certainly faces the 1980s with confidence. We are very happy with the way in which the Government has operated during this year. We are also very happy with the way in which the House has been able to operate with the help and assistance of you and of the other officers whom I have mentioned. I wish to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> to all those other officers and staff, the compliments of the season and a happy and healthy New Year. As always, we need that health so that we can carry on our work. </para>

          <para>It is not inappropriate to note that as we prepare to leave the House we cannot help looking around the world and seeing a great deal of concern. There is certainly no reason for any calmness or complacency. At the moment there are very real tensions, particularly in the Islamic world. There are tensions between nations that must be of great concern to all of us. Many lives are endangered. There are enormous difficulties in Asia. There are continuing problems in Africa. I know that all members will join with me in expressing concern at the serious wounding of an Australian journalist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tony</inline> Joyce, in an accident in Zambia yesterday. As we prepare for the Christmas season, the season of goodwill, we must all fervently hope that reason and sense will prevail, that tensions will ease, that men and women of goodwill will be able to comprehend the dangers in the present situation and that compromise and solutions will be found to their many problems. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> cannot be with us today, as you know, but I think I could express on behalf of all his colleagues- indeed, everybody in this chamber their wishes to him for a quick and speedy recovery. It is bad enough being sick at any time, but for a person in a high public position, carrying enormous responsibilities, it is very difficult to be able to free oneself from those responsibilities, free oneself to the extent that is necessary for convalescence when one has been damaged by illness. I know that he would like me to thank all of those people who have served the Parliament so efficiently and with so much dedication this year. Firstly, I would like to thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> for the excellent job that you have done as  Speaker  of this Parliament. You distinguished yourself by the very dignified way in which you hold that great office. You have had a very busy year. I know sometimes it has been somewhat turbulent, but with your unfailing good humour you have always been able to bring the House back to its senses. You have been ably backed up by the  Chairman  of Committees, the honourable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Millar)</inline> who on a number of occasions has had to sit in for you and has done an admirable job. He too has been supported by the Temporary Chairmen who have done an excellent job with the workings of this chamber. </para>
          <para>I would like to put on record appreciation of the work of the  Clerk  of the House and his officers. They provide great assistance and indeed very wise advice. Anybody from outside who might think that there are some apparent and obvious deficiencies in this Parliament must recognise that the situation would be absolutely impossible without the assistance of the  Clerk  and his officers. I would like to thank the staff of the Table Office for their assistance to us all. To the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, John Fox, who took over from Roger Webb during the sittings, I express my thanks for his work in making the House function so smoothly. But there are many, many people who help in the workings of Parliament and we owe them thanks. The Librarian <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Weir,</inline> and his staff; <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kerr;</inline> the Joint House Department, under its Secretary <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Donnelly;</inline> the First Parliamentary Counsel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Quayle</inline> and his staff; the attendants; dining room staff; transport officers; and all of those people who make life possible in this place. I would also like to mention those silent members in the Australian Broadcasting Commission box who spread the activities of this Parliament right across the nation and whom we so often tend to overlook. </para>
          <para>I would like to thank especially the members of the Public Service who not only serve Ministers but all members as well. I believe that in this country we have a Public Service that we can be extremely proud of, a band of dedicated, efficient, skilled people who serve their nation and, in many cases, they serve with real distinction. To my ministerial colleagues who carry so many burdens of office- far greater burdens than most people realise and I think that one has to experience being a Minister to realise the extent of responsibility they carry- I offer my thanks and the thanks of the Prime Minister for their loyalty, their support and their co-operation, and indeed their hard work. I am proud of being part of a ministerial team, part of the Government team, and I know that all my ministerial colleagues are, too. To all my party colleagues in the Liberal Party and the National Country Party I offer my thinks for their support, co-operation and for their work in the Parliament, in the committees and in many other ways. Appreciation also goes to the Whips of both the Liberal Party and my own party for keeping us in an orderly state. To the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Hayden) and to all of his colleagues, may I express my thanks for their contribution to the work of Parliament and my good wishes for the Christmas period and the year ahead. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>I believe that the great majority of Australians can look forward to 1980 with a great deal more optimism and confidence than they have been able to contemplate for any year for some time. The world faces many difficulties, political problems, economic problems, the threat of conflict and the realities of human misery on a very large scale. Australia, despite its own problems, is indeed a fortunate country. Australians are fortunate people and I only hope that their goodwill will be accompanied by a sense of responsibility. We do have a responsibility to the rest of the world, a responsibility we can exercise in many ways by providing the world with food and fibre, providing the world with energy and raw materials, and by responding in a humanitarian way to the plight of the world&#39;s poor and hungry people, to the world&#39;s refugees, especially at the moment in places like Indo-China, and to the people of Timor. These are some of the matters we need to think of at this time of the year. Indeed, we should think of them at all times. </para>
          <para>To you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and to all honourable members, I express the hope that you have a very restful and enjoyable Christmas and holiday break and that you all return next year ready to cope with the demands, challenges and responsibilities of another year of public duty. </para>

            <para>- I join with the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> in conveying seasonal greetings to the many people whose work ensures that the parliamentary institution functions and, I believe, functions well. Of course, like him, I convey seasonal greetings to those very important people, the people of Australia. As he pointed out, 1979 has been a difficult year for many Australians and I would hope that 1 980 brings about the sorts of developments for which government can contribute very largely that will allow prosperity, too long escaped, to be recaptured for the benefit of the Australian community. There is literally a multitude of people working in this establishment and in other places nearby in association with this establishment who ensure that the parliamentary system does work. Their efforts, meshed together in a smooth, synchronised way, bring about a marked efficiency and impact on what we are doing. Too often they are unnoticed and most often unsung in the efforts that they contribute. An occasion like this, once a year, does at least allow us to recall the value of their efforts and how dependent we are upon them. I do not think it puts the issue too high to say that in many respects we are carried on their backs: I use that as a figure of speech. They are the spear carriers who do so much of the hard work that is not noted and certainly not celebrated but which allows us to get on with the very important task of government, of Opposition, of fulfilling our parliamentary functions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would not try to enumerate the various people, the various bodies which sustain this system in which we all work, but there are some people I do feel about whom I have to make some observation because their work is so proximate to where we are; the people in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> who assiduously record what we are saying and report us, thank God, not literally, but well; the Clerks of the House who sit there inscrutably, diligently recording the processes of the House, men of long memory but fortunately silent tongue. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I have said some unkind things about you from time to time. I shall not take the opportunity to recall them. I am sure if you think it worth remembering them you will do so without any assistance from me. They are said- often in the passion of debate- most often because we feel at that time that they are justified. But on that point, if I can just dally a second, it is sometimes observed that there is some noise- more uncouth people might say a little disorder- in this parliamentary institution and people are a little aghast that it should happen. </para>
          <para>However, I would suggest that it is a very important safety valve for the functioning of our system that people are able to generate that passion because they genuinely feel about an issue, and then allow it a healthy release in debate in this House. In other places they resort to the street; they resort to violence; and they resort to arms. Here we resort to words, sometimes elegantly, quite often I suspect somewhat brutally; nonetheless, it is part of the healthy processes of the institution. </para>
          <para>Having said that, I had better say also, as I can almost see you blushing now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker-</inline> and might I add that the mild pink that is showing up contrasts well with the great white wig that you wear, and say also, for the benefit of my colleagues, that that is the only area where you become pink in politics- that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> have striven to contribute some dignity to the proceedings of the House. Generally, I would applaud what you are trying to do. I would not want my comments to be interpreted too widely. </para>
          <para class="block">There are some points that I would like to discuss, if not debate with you, in relation to the broader parliamentary reform. But can I say for the record: Thank goodness that someone is thinking about parliamentary reform. We desperately need to think about it in many other areas. I seem to recall that I said last year- but whether or not I did is not important and I say it for the record on this occasion- that there are many procedures that we follow in this House which are more relevant to a bygone age which represents a gap of a century or more between us and the things that were then appropriate. For instance, I do not believe that Question Time is any challenge for a reasonably intellectually agile Minister. I say that not in any sense of personal criticism of present Ministers to the exclusion of past Ministers. I speak from my own experience as a Minister. It is not a real test and it boils down to our trying to determine what we want to do in the parliamentary institution. </para>
          <para>After having expressed some reservations initially, I believe that the move towards the estimate committee system seems to offer some opportunities for honourable members to make more constructive and concrete contributions to what the parliamentary system is about. I have said for many years in this institution- not regularly, but when the time has seemed appropriate- that we desperately need a more effective committee system functioning here. There is nothing more frustrating for a member of this Parliament than to sit on the back benches and to find that the greatest moment of glory, after extensive and diligent research- which can sometimes absorb days in the preparation of a speech- can be lost because he can be ruled out completely from speaking because of the compressed speaking time available; or after having delivered a very important and thoughtful speech which has more than just some significance to the affairs of state, finding that the best reward he can expect is a by-line or a few lines in a newspaper. </para>
          <para> I have quoted often the experience that I had on a joint committee of inquiry into pharmaceutical benefits many years ago. I then discovered the enormous advantages of sitting away from this chamber which, by the predisposition of a debating chamber, tends to lock people into fixed positions very much like trench warfare in the First World War- many fusillades heavy bombardment, but not so much progress one side or the other in terms of moving backwards or forwards from the trenches. That committee allowed a break-up to take place, not so much on a bipartisan basis, but because the more progressive people in the conservative coalition were able to support people like myself, when we put forward constructive views, and, as more conservative people in the coalition found an odd ally from our side. In the less dramatic and less contrived situation where reflection and hard work are important it seems to me that the Committee system, developed much more extensively, has a great deal to offer our parliamentary institution and the nation. Our parliamentary institution was developed in a much earlier time. We live in a much more complex and technologically demanding age than when the parliamentary institution was at its peak. It is impossible for us properly to attend, in all of the detail which we should apply ourselves to our task, to the many things that come into this Parliament. </para>
          <para>I am going off in a different direction and I suspect that I am starting to challenge you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> as the sort of parliamentary reformer of the moment. I know better than to do that, having had enough trouble with you this year. You might be unkind enough to say that you have had more than enough trouble with me. I merely want to say that I regard this as a very important institution, and one which is capable of a great deal of improvement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I congratulate you on what you are trying to do. The fact is that you are opening debate. </para>
          <para>There are so many other people here whom I have not been able to mention. I think of the attendants in the House who are ever cheerful, diligent and helpful. The attendants outside the House, the people in the Papers Office, the people in the Library, the people who look after the amenities in the various parts of the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms and so on. We just could not function without them. We are extremely grateful to them. But, most of all, when we stand here on this occasion we are most grateful to the people of Australia. To all those people, the people who keep us going, the people of this great country, we convey seasonal greetings. </para>

            <para>-I thank honourable gentlemen for comments they have made which join in the spirit of goodwill to us all and to those who serve us. This is the 24th valedictory debate that I have heard. I find that they have been improving. They used to be called hypocrisies but today I heard nothing hypocritical and that means that they have improved a great deal. We come here elected by the people of Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The sovereignty of the people of Australia belongs to each and every one of them. They cannot exercise it individually and, therefore, they must have a system of entrusting the sovereignty to others; and that is the democratic parliamentary system in which we are elected, by a group of people in Australia, to come here and speak for them and represent them. We must speak fearlessly, without favour or hope for favour. </para>
          <para>In this Parliament the truth must be spoken, the truth must be demanded, for only in that way will we fully discharge our obligation to the people of Australia. That is why I am so keen about parliamentary reform. In that way, we can ensure that what we do today fully answers the requirements of the people of Australia, so that every individual member of the Parliament can contribute to the fullest extent of his intellectual capacity, his experience, and the passion with which he holds views. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned something upon which I wish to comment, that is, that I often receive letters from people who complain about the behaviour of the House because of its noise. Often there is good reason for it, but more often there is not good reason for it because nobody comes here by invitation. Everybody who is here came here by his own effort and by his own capacity to persuade people that he can properly represent them and, therefore, when issues arise which they hold passionately they will certainly express their views passionately and strongly; and that is to be expected. There are some &#39;parliaments of the world &#39; which are perfectly behaved, but they are not parliaments which in any way hold the sovereignty of the people. They are parliaments which are controlled by non-elected people. For that reason, we must take our parliamentary institution with all its faults, but ever attempt to make it a better place in which to discharge our duties. </para>
          <para>It has been a significant year for parliamentary reform because, for the first time, we have adopted Estimates committees. Last year was a great year because, for the first time, we adopted legislation committees. I have already circulated a paper which indicated how much more time was available to the Parliament as a result of the Estimates committees. I also make the point that, whilst this is a theatre of political debate and political point scoring, when members of this Parliament are in committee it is remarkable how they can agree with each other and give unanimous recommendations which are in everybody&#39;s interests. The year 1978 was legislation committees; the year 1979 was Estimates committees; and I very strongly hope that 1980 will be the year of the adoption of the Westminster convention of the independent Speaker. </para>
          <para>I also thank the  Chairman  of Committees, my  deputy,  the honourable member for Wide Bay, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clarrie</inline> Millar, who is a most reliable  deputy  and who is well respected by the House. I thank his  Deputy  Chairmen-Mr Armitage, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dobie, Mr Drummond, Mr Giles, Mr Jarman, Dr Jenkins, Mr Martin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Robinson. I thank the Clerks. The  Clerk  of the House is called &#39;the little pet&#39; in my office. I think it is a contraction of his name. It has nothing to do with his character because he used to fly multi-engine aeroplanes over the Atlantic during the war. I also thank his staff. I thank <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> There is the story about the man who said: &#39;I want to be reported as I am &#39;. Twenty minutes later he got the report back and it contained a single sentence. He changed his mind and he wanted to be reported as the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff edit us. I thank them for that. </para>
          <para>I thank the Library staff. I see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Weir</inline> the Librarian sitting in the chamber. The Library is no longer a library in the way we understand it. It is an intellectual resource that services all back bench members of the Parliament and especially the front bench of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Weir,</inline> I  regret  to inform the House but not with any melancholy tone to my voice, needs to have an operation on his eye next week. He has put off that operation so that he could service us. I know he has been under very considerable personal strain as a result and I take this opportunity, on behalf of the House, to assure him of our good wishes for a successful operation. </para>
          <para>I thank the Joint House people who look after us extremely well- the girls in the dining room, the men and girls in the kitchen and the men in the bar, although I think there are some ladies there too. Of course, few of us would know about that latter part but all of us know about the eating part. We thank them and we thank the attendants, the people who maintain order here when we are unable to do so. The attendants stand ready to back up the Serjeant-at-arms if ever he has to eject somebody from the chamber. I express my thanks to my own personal staff also. They are deserving of tremendous praise from me. Having been kind to people here I leave the chamber often and am unkind to my staff. I would like them all to accept the fact that on occasions I have to make a little protest to somebody and they, unfortunately, have to hear it. I might say that as a result of the efforts of the members here this morning, when I returned to my office after leaving the chair, I was a little bad tempered, and I hope my staff will excuse me for that. </para>
          <para>Finally, I ask all honourable members to continue the practice that they have adopted this year, and that is of spending the first half hour of their waking day thinking about how they can be kind to the  Speaker.  If they continue with that practice we will have a very good year in 1980.I wish everybody the best for Christmas and the New Year. </para>

            <para>- I realise that the time is late. I thought you would adjourn the House at six o&#39;clock, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I do not want to delay the House. First of all, I wanted to make a speech today during the Grievance Debate or at some other time but for some reason or another it always seems to be very difficult for back bench members to make speeches. That is a protest that should be expressed a little more often. The time is late, so I am not going to make a speech. I want to thank those officers and staff of the Parliament who have been so kind to me. The honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> and I have been members of this House for 21 years today. It was on 22 November 1958 that we were first elected to Parliament. During that time my service, at least- I am not speaking for Charlie- has been controversial from time to time both inside and outside the House. However, I have received nothing but courtesy from the officers and staff of this Parliament. </para>

          <para>I thank also the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> for mentioning particularly those people in Indo-China and the people of East Timor. We in Australia are in a more fortunate country than those people. We are certainly not going through the trials and tribulations that those people are suffering in this time of goodwill to all men. This Parliament has to look at the farreaching policies of the 1980s to overcome what we call the curse of unemployment which exists in this country and which affects so many unfortunate people in our community. </para>
          <para>Today I wanted to talk about the report of the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council which clearly stated that there is no solution to the problems of nuclear waste. However, I will put my comments on record in a Press statement. I thank the House for its patience. I again thank the officers and staff of the Parliament for being so kind to me during the last 2 1 years. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>The report does, however, misrepresent the operation of the offshore rebate scheme under section160ACA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, where it suggests that only companies that hold current licences or permits issued under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act may lodge declarations for the purpose of conferring rebate entitlements for capital subscribed by their shareholders.

              <para>The Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL) measures radon daughter concentrations in units of working level. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>For an open pit, the circumstances when radon daughters occur at significant levels are those occasions when there is poor natural ventilation. This happens in practice during times of strong temperature inversion when there is no vertical air movement, and the air becomes very still. Radon gas, emerging from the ore surface then remains in the immediate area for long enough to decay into radon daughters. Significant radon daughter levels are therefore only likely to occur during the night and in particular at times close to sunset and sunrise. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The ARL maintained a continuous measurement program throughout the active mining phase at Nabarlek, during which radon daughter levels in the pit were regularly recorded. During the daylight hours they were observed to be quite negligible, and even at night time turned out to be lower than expected. Prior to August 1979 there were very few occurrences of temperature inversions, and no significant levels were observed until then. For the month of August, which happened to be the time when the highest grade of ore was removed from the pit, the maximum recorded level was 0.27 working level observed over a 10 minute interval just before sunrise. Such sharp and shortlived peaks in radon daughter concentration were not uncommon during this period. The mean level for night times during August and September was 0.02S + 0.004 WL, and essentially zero for the day shifts. In general, ARL estimates agree reasonably with the independent measurements made by the mining company. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>It is not possible for ARL to provide estimates of the highest total exposures as it does not have records for the individual hours worked by employees. The company has however reported its estimates to the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy which is the supervising authority. ARL can however estimate the mean total radon daughter exposure, based on its measurements of radon daughter levels and the number and length of day and night shifts worked per month, once inversion conditions began to occur. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Estimated mean exposure from 1 August 1979 to the close of mining on 1 1 October 1979 is 0.06 working level months (WLM) which compares well with the company&#39;s estimate of 0.05 WLM. This should be compared with the maximum exposure permitted under the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores ( 1 975 ) of 4 WLM in a full year. </para>

            <para>There were several submissions to me from the Australian Postal Commission dealing with the July 1978 increases in postal charges which were of a deliberative, policy formulation nature. In order to preserve the confidentiality of advice between me as Minister and my Department and the authorities for which I am responsible, I do not believe that these submissions should be made public. -&#62; I can say, however, that the public statement of 1 June 1978 by the Acting Chairman of the Australian Postal Commission outlined the main impact on the finances of Australia Post of the increase in postal rates which operated from 1 July 1978. More detailed reasons for the increases are given in the Commission&#39;s &#39;Service and Business Outlook for 1978-79&#39; and the Annual Report of the Australian Postal Commission for the year ended 30 June 1978 which have been tabled in Parliament. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) The Small Business Development Council of New South Wales, in its submission to the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System (Campbell Committee) claimed that trading bank loan facilities made available to small businesses in 1 977-78 constituted 36.5 per cent in value of the total facilities available for lending and that small businesses account for 56 per cent of private employment: I am not aware of the basis for either claim. During the current Campbell Committee inquiry the Australian Bankers Association estimated that about 40 per cent by value of all business loans by the Banks were to small businesses. The discrepancy in these figures does not appear to be large and may be due to the use of different criteria to establish a definition of a &#39;small&#39; business. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Based on the commonly accepted definition of a small business as being one employing less than 100 in manufacturing and less than 20 in non-manufacturing, the Department of Industry and Commerce estimate that small firms employ about 40 per cent of total private employment. On this basis estimates of the proportion of business loans going to small business given in ( 1 ) above indicate that there is no such shortfall. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>However the demands which businesses make on the banks for loan funds depend on a number of factors besides the size of their wage payments and there is no basis, either in theory or practice, for expecting a particular sector&#39;s share of trading bank finance to equate with that sector&#39;s share of total employment. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Yes. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>The Government&#39;s policy that adequate finance should be made available to small business and that no arbitrary limits should be placed on such finance has been conveyed to financial institutions. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>New arrangements for term lending by the trading banks emphasize the availability of such loans to the small business sector and the terms for such loans have been extended from three to ten years (previously three to eight years). </para>
          <para>There has also been a significant increase in lending by the Commonwealth Development Bank since its charter was extended in June 1978 to allow it to lend to all kinds of business. In the year ended 30th June 1979 the value of non-rural loan approvals was $29.2m compared with $15. lm in the previous year; of this increase $8.7m or 62 per cent went to business undertakings in sectors which were previously outside the Bank&#39;s charter. </para>
          <para>In the Budget speech, the Treasurer reaffirmed that the Government&#39;s monetary policy is directed at providing adequate funds for sustainable expansion in private sector activity and employment while continuing to bear down steadily on inflation and inflationary expectations. The allocation of the available credit among particular sectors is a matter for the commercial judgment of lenders. However the Banks have on several occasions reaffirmed to the Reserve Bank that they: apply the same lending criteria to all business customers whether large or small do not discriminate against applications for loans to small businesses which by number are the bulk of their business continuously review lending criteria. </para>
          <para>The SRD mechanism is an instrument of monetary and banking policy: its essential role is that of influencing the liquidity base of the banking system: it is not a device for the channelling of funds into particular forms of lending. </para>

The Commonwealth&#39;s general approach is to secure for Aboriginals access to Government services equal to that accorded other Australian citizens, together with additional services appropriate to their state of extreme disadvantage. Aboriginals, as residents of the State, are entitled to receive general community services provided by the State out of its own resources (including Commonwealth subventions) and to benefit from such community services on the principle of need.

There was general agreement that it was desirable to concentrate expenditure on the construction of new houses of satisfactory standard in and around Brewarrina, rather than on any costly renovation of the existing dwellings at West Brewarrina. My Department is providing $145,000 this financial year and $50,000 in the first pan of 1980-81 to the Ngemba Housing Co-operative for the construction of four houses. Subject to tenant participation, the Co-operative will also have additional funds for the purchase and construction of houses available from the sale of houses to tenants. The Department has provided $561,147 to the Ngemba Housing Co-operative since 1975-76. In addition, substantial grants have been provided to the New South Wales Housing Commission for Aboriginal housing in Brewarrina and the Commission had, at 30 June 1979, completed 18 houses Tor Aboriginals in the town with these grants (and another 14 of the Commission&#39;s houses in Brewarrina are occupied by Aboriginals).

Clearly, considering the average seat utilisation achieved by Qantas since the introduction of lower fares, the number of unsold seats significantly exceeds the number of seats for which APEX passengers have forfeited their fares. (3)I understand that Qantas has examined the feasibility of operating a wait-list for persons wishing to purchase a cancelled APEX ticket at off-peak rates. </para>
          <para>I am informed this examination has shown that such a facility presents difficulties. The introduction of a wait-list would add significantly to Qantas &#39;s administrative workload, the costs of which would need to be recovered either through fare increases or the levying of some other charge. </para>
          <para>Further problems involve the impact on passengers&#39; expectations. With the availability of a wait-list facility outside the advance purchase period, some intending APEX passengers may be tempted to defer completion of their travel arrangements in anticipation of ultimately obtaining an APEX seat through the wait-list, particularly if their preferred travel date is fully booked and instead of choosing alternative travel dates they could elect to wait-list for their preferred date of travel. </para>
          <para>Should no seat become available outside the advance purchase period for the preferred date of travel, not only will the intending passenger not travel on that date, but in all likelihood the passenger would have missed the opportunity to arrange APEX travel at an acceptable alternative date. </para>
          <para>In the circumstances it would appear that the limited benefits which would be derived from a wait-list facility may be far outweighed by the disadvantages and additional cost of providing such a facility. </para>

It has decided to prepare draft franchising legislation for the industry and a draft Bill will be exposed for public examination and comment as soon as possible. The intention of any legislation would be to ensure equitable treatment for lessee and licensee petroleum dealers. The draft Bill will provide for payment of compensation to franchisees for unjust termination of a franchise or unreasonable refusal to renew a franchise. It will also provide for full disclosure of relevant information to incoming franchisees, rights for franchisees to continuation of supplies, without discrimination in the event of any shortage, and rights of assignment of their franchises. The Government has deferred a final decision on the possible proposals relating to price discrimination and a prohibition of oil companies engaging in retail petroleum marketing. A decision will be taken on these proposals after the Government has had the opportunity to consider comments on the draft franchising Bill and also a report from the Trade Practices Commission which has been requested to monitor and report on the extent of price discrimination in the industry. </para>

            <para>It would be possible to implement a scheme whereby indexed family allowances would be payable to families where the families&#39; incomes were equivalent to or less than average weekly earnings, but administration would be complex and costly. Before such a scheme could be implemented a large number of decisions would be required on matters such as: </para>
            <para>The definition of the family members to be included in the income unit for the purpose of income testing, e.g. would income of children be included? </para>
            <para>Over what period would family income be assessed and average earnings determined? Would it be, for example, the previous financial year, the previous quarter or an estimate for the current year? Would provision be made to vary payments for families whose financial and other circumstances change? </para>
            <para>Would the increases be paid on an all-or-nothing basis? If so, there would be inequities. If not, would the tapering take place before or after the income limit of average weekly earnings? What would be the rate of taper? </para>
            <para>How frequently would the maximum rates of family allowances be adjusted and how soon after the relevant movement in the Consumer Price Index? </para>
            <para>Would pensioner and beneficiary families be treated in the same way as other families or would special arrangements be made to avoid overlapping income tests? </para>
            <para>Answers would need to be given to these kinds of questions before any work could be done to make a reasonable estimate of the cost and numbers involved. The cost would also, of course, be dependent on the rate of inflation and movements in average weekly earnings. Even if these matters were resolved, cost estimates would not be reliable since comprehensive and up to date information on the income distribution of Australian families, in a form suitable for costing purposes, is not available. It may be possible to more accurately cost such proposals once the detailed results of the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1978-79 Income Survey become available. </para>

            <para>To ensure general community awareness of the proposed Community Access 80 changes, telephone directories published before the introduction of the scheme in May 1 980 will include a concise explanation of the new charging arrangements that will apply. A more detailed explanation of the scheme will be included in the information pages of telephone directories to be distributed after its introduction. However, because of the already large size of the metropolitan directories and the extra costs that would be involved </para>
            <para class="block">Telecom does not at this stage intend to list subscribers who will have community call access to their central city zone in the metropolitan telephone directories. In the Sydney fringe area there are some 76,000 customers involved and to include them in the metropolitan directory would increase the size of the book by a minimum of 150 pages and involve additional costs of more than $300,000. </para>
            <para>Subscribers within the Access 80 zones around the metropolitan areas can obtain free copies of the metropolitan directories, on request. </para>
            <para>I might add however, that I have discussed this matter with both the  Chairman  and Managing Director of the Australian Telecommunications Commission and they have agreed to give the matter further consideration. </para>

        <para>Such programs and systems usually do not directly save staff and may in some cases increase staff requirements. </para>
        <para>For some systems, staff savings are notional, i.e. staff is saved&#39; by reducing the rate of staff growth and the savings are the additional people who would have had to be recruited if Telecom had kept carrying out activities in the same manual way as compared with the number needed to do the same things with the assistance of a computer. Given the continuing growth of Telecom&#39;s business, staff savings are generally notional only. </para>
        <para>Due to the above factors, estimating staff saved as a consequence of the use of computers is extremely difficult. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that computers have been used in the Australian Post Office (including some systems used by Australia Post after 1 July 1975) and Telecom over a period of more than 18 years, and some early systems have undergone progressive evolution by way of on-going enhancement and/or redevelopment: for these systems, estimation of staff savings by comparison with an &#39;all manual&#39; environment is either impossible or of extremely dubious accuracy. </para>
        <para>Staff savings achieved as a consequence of computer systems and programs are, of course, offset by the staff numbers employed in providing the data processing service: in Telecom&#39;s case, about 727 persons currently employed in Information Systems Department and Branches. Many of this staff are engaged in developing systems and facilities to serve the future. The lead times involved in developing computer systems mean that employment is created in advance of benefits (of whatever nature) being achieved. </para>

            <para>As a preamble to the answers to this and the series of related questions (4180-4183) asked by the honourable member for Cunningham, Telecom has provided the following background information to assist members&#39; appreciation of the general subject of 10C exchanges and the implications of their introduction into the Australian telephone system. </para>
            <para>Until the advent of modern processor-controlled trunk switching systems, such as the 10C system, equipment design dictated a policy of increasing centralisation of residual manual assistance traffic following conversion of local exchanges to automatic working to achieve efficient and economical handling of such traffic. </para>
            <para>With the IOC system it is possible to physically separate the control (operator) and switching functions of manual assistance traffic. The operator still controls the connection of: call but the circuit is established at the switching centre (the IOC exchange), not via the operator&#39;s switchboard. The use of IOC equipment makes it possible therefore to still realise the significant cost savings and high switching efficiency attainable from centralisation of the traffic switching function, yet locate the manual operators&#39; positions remote from the location of the switching centre- in fact up to 800 km away. Telecom is currently reviewing its manual assistance policy to take advantage of this new flexibility with a view to retaining employment opportunities in more country areas, and to at least maintaining the present country to metropolitan ratio of manual assistance operators. </para>
            <para>The answer to Question No. 4 1 79 is as follows: </para>
            <list type="decimal">
              <item label="(">
                <para>1 ) Yes, at Woolloongabba. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(2)">
                <para>This exchange will ultimately handle all ISO and all manually assisted international traffic originating in Queensland, plus all manually assisted trunk calls originating in the Nambour and Toowoomba areas, and selected Brisbane exchanges. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>It will also perform STD trunk switching and charging functions for selected exchanges within Brisbane. Nambour and Toowoomba exchanges both have their own trunk switching exchanges (ARM &#39;s) and the majority of STD traffic from these centres will be unaffected by IOC. </para>
            <list type="decimal">
              <item label="(3)">
                <para>(a) No. (b) The extension of Brisbane IOC exchange functions is currently under review in the light of a revised policy on decentralisation of manual assistance operations. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(4)">
                <para>Most capital city networks have multiple trunk machines, eg 10C and ARM (electromechanical). Trunking between trunk exchanges is arranged so that the service impact when a trunk switching machine or a major transmission bearer fails is minimised. Each of the Sydney trunk exchanges, for example, have large direct routes to each of the corresponding trunk exchanges in Melbourne. Thus, the loss of any one of the Sydney trunk exchanges would not completely cut off traffic flow between the two cities. </para>

A recent review of flexible working hours by the Public Service Board did not reveal any widespread abuse of the system. </para>

              <para>A diplomatic conference was convened in Geneva in 1977 to adopt a Convention on Territorial Asylum but failed to complete its consideration of all the draft articles submitted. No decision has been taken on reconvening the conference. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has continued his consultations with governments on thus matter and in his latest report to the General Assembly has stated that in the light of these consultations it would appear that the convening of a future session of the conference may be premature at the present. The matter is, however, being pursued by the High Commissioner who will report on further progress in due course. </para>

              <para>At its thirtieth session in 1975, the United Nations General Assembly debated the report of the SecretaryGeneral on the question of diplomatic asylum which had been prepared at the request of the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session in 1974, and decided to give further consideration to this question at a future session of the General Assembly. Informal consultations indicate that more time may be needed before further consideration of this question should take place. The Government will continue to keep the matter under review, so that if and when it appears that the time is ripe for further consideration the question can be raised for consideration at a future session of the General Assembly. The Government believes that the discussion of the question at the General Assembly in 1974 and 1975 was both timely and valuable and it is confident that the discussion will bear fruit eventually in the form of a deeper international understanding of the humanitarian considerations behind the practice of diplomatic asylum. </para>

            <para>A number of positions have been allocated in my Depanment specifically for activities devoted to some aspect of the marketing, use, supervision, control and assessment of Australia&#39;s uranium ore and/or the products, services and activities derived from its existence. In addition an Australian Uranium Export Office and a Uranium Advisory Council have been established. The direct costs of operating these two organisations appear separately in the appropriations of my Depanment. </para>
            <para>It is estimated that in 1979-80 the total salaries and other administrative expenses of these activities would represent 3.3 per cent of the costs of administration of my Depanment. I would expect the costs to remain at much the same level in future years. Only those items of appropriation dealing with the general administration of the Depanment have been included in the base figure as costs of administration. </para>

            <para>I refer the honourable member to the reference to the former mining operations at Rum Jungle on page 6 of the first report of the Uranium Advisory Council which I tabled in Parliament on 1 3 September 1979 (Daily <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> pages 1085-87). I also refer the honourable member to the Ministerial statement on uranium development I made on 25 August 1977. In that statement I made it clear that there will be no more projects like Rum Jungle. The operations at Rum Jungle reflected environmental attitudes of 25 years ago which Australians would not tolerate today. </para>
            <para>The Government&#39;s policy in respect of uranium development takes fully into account the need for environmental protection. Development approval for particular projects will only be given following, amongst other things, completion of the necessary environmental requirements. As indicated in my statement of 13 September 1979 on the tabling of the first report of the Uranium Advisory Council, the Government does seek the views of the Council on the development of individual uranium projects. I have referred to the Council Pancontinental Mining Limited &#39;s final environmental impact statement on the Jabiluka project together with the comments, suggestions and recommendations provided by the Minister for Science and the Environment under the Environment Protection Administrative Procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. lt is my intention to do the same in respect of Noranda Australia Limited &#39;s Koongarra project and of other proposals for uranium development. </para>

              <para>Presumably the honourable member here intended to refer to PAYE taxation deductions of 33.5 cents in the dollar and not 43.5 cents. The former is the current rate on a taxable income in excess of $3,893 but not exceeding $ 16,608. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>To avoid their being faced with a large tax bill at the end of a financial year, taxpayers who derive income from more than one source have their income from all but the major source taxed at the standard rate of taxation. As announced, the standard rate will revert to 32 cents in the dollar for PAYE purposes from 1 December 1979. </para>
          <para>The standard rate is applied in these circumstances because ordinarily, anyone who has a second source of income would, in the aggregate, be receiving income sufficient to attract that rate. The application of the tax instalment deduction arrangements usually has the result that the total of the tax instalments deducted from the income of a person with two sources of income is approximately equal to the amount of tax that would have been deducted if those earnings had been from the one source. </para>
          <para>There are exceptions to this and the Commissioner of Taxation may, if requested, arrange for lower instalments that those prescribed (or even no instalments at all) to be deducted if the circumstances so warrant. </para>

              <para>The implication here seems to be that postgraduate students undertaking additional work would, automatically as it were, receive a refund of the tax instalments deducted from their earnings because their income would be insufficient to attract tax or, if they were liable for taxation, that the instalments deducted would exceed the amount of tax payable. </para>

          <para>Where a taxpayer considers that instalments deducted in accordance with the schedules would be excessive, he or she may apply to have them varied. A person who wishes to do this should contact the nearest Taxation Office giving details of estimated income, allowable deductions, dependants and concessional expenditure for the year. Advice will then be given regarding the tax instalments appropriate in the particular circumstances and, if necessary, arrangements made to have instalments deducted at a lower rate or discontinued altogether. </para>

The proposed franchise legislation would not apply to Southern Cross since it is not in a franchise relationship with its suppliers. A decision on the price discrimination and divorcement provisions of the original package of proposals has been deferred. In any case these measures were not intended to apply to independent resellers, so that they would continue to have freedom to negotiate with suppliers for supply on the best terms available from time to time and thereby preserve the beneficial effects on competition provided by independent resellers. </para>

              <para>The particular nature of the program makes it difficult- and perhaps even irrelevant- to try to estimate savings&#39; consequent upon the changed funding basis. Because the Commonwealth reimburses the States for approved expenditures under the program, any notional savings in 1978-79 and 1979-80 would be dependent upon State estimates of what their expenditure would have been on the former $2:$1 funding basis. Such estimates are not available. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The honourable member will, no doubt, be interested in the following information concerning expenditures under the program: expenditure for 1 979-80 is estimated to be $ 10,372,000; an increase of $964,3 10 over expenditure in 1 978-79. </para>
          <para>Total State and Commonwealth expenditure has risen from $14,788,758 in 1977-78 to an estimated total of $20,744,000 in 1979-80, partly due to an expansion in expenditure on existing services, but additionally from the approval of 25 new home care services and 79 additional welfare officer positions. </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member&#39;s question: (1)1 have seen the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline> to which the honourable member refers. It concerns allegations relating to two situations arising out of past activities of Queensland Mines Limited in the Nabarlek area which could have led to radiation exposure of Aboriginal people. The allegations were made by a field officer of the Northern Land Council to the Manager of the Jabiru Laboratory of the Office of the Supervising Scientist. The Supervising Scientist passed these allegations to the appropriate Northern Territory Supervising Authorities, the Departments of Mines and Energy and of Health, for investigation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first allegation was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Solomon</inline> Nayilibitj, a local Aboriginal who is an employee of Queensland Mines, and his family and other Aboriginals had some years ago lived for approximately 6 months in a core shed containing uranium bearing core samples. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nayilibitj</inline> was alleged to be worried about possible radiation effects and to have requested Queensland Mines Limited to carry out medical checks. </para>
          <para>The second allegation was that radioactive ore samples were scattered about an old Queensland Mines Limited exploration camp site, some 9 kilometres from the present Nabarlek lease, an area in the vicinity of which Aboriginals hunt </para>
          <para>I am advised by the Supervising Scientist, on the basis of information supplied by the Northern Territory authorities and Queensland Mines Limited, as follows. </para>
          <para>Some three or four years ago when the Queensland Mines Limited site was on a care and maintenance basis, local Aboriginal people camped for a few months about an old drillers galvanised iron shed near the Nabarlek ore body. In the shed were a number of plastic bags containing smaller calico bags of percussion drill hole cuttings. Some of this bagged material contained uranium ore. </para>
          <para>It is understood that the Aboriginals did not spend much time in the shed but lived and slept outside under the verandah 2 to 3 metres from the bags. I am informed that the camp was probably occupied for no longer than 6 months. The Aboriginals were asked to leave by a Mines Depanment inspector in June 1976 and the company subsequently removed the shed and buried the cuttings nearby. </para>
          <para>Queensland Mines Limited have no details of the discarded drill cuttings nor of the uranium content of the samples. However, the buried samples were located and a radiometric survey was carried out by Queensland Mines Limited and the Northern Territory Depanment of Mines and Energy in the presence of representatives of the Office of the Supervising Scientist on 21 September 1979. The average radiation exposure rate at about 1 metre from the uncovered samples was three to four times that due to local background radiation (0. 1 millirem per hour compared with a background rate of 0.03 to .04 millirem per hour in the vicinity). </para>
          <para>All the material has now been removed and will be disposed of in the pit with other waste. </para>
          <para>It is not possible to calculate the radiation exposure that may have been received by the Aboriginals without knowing the radiation field around the cuttings in the shed and the time spent in their vicinity. The exposure rate where the Aboriginals would have spent most of their time would have been much less than the 0. 1 millirem per hour measured at 1 metre from the specimens and it is unlikely that exposures much above background would have been experienced. Clearly any accumulated exposure would have been less than the annual dose limit of 500 millirem per year laid down in the Australian Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores for members of the public living in the vicinity of uranium mines. </para>
          <para>A medical examination would not reveal effects of radiation at these exposures. I am informed that Queensland Mines Limited are not aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nayilibitj</inline> has expressed concern about radiation exposure, nor that he has ever requested a medical examination. He has never been denied one by Queensland Mines Limited, and on 20 September 1 979, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nayilibitj</inline> chose not to accept a Queensland Mines Limited offer of a medical examination. I am also informed that Queensland Mines Limited is prepared to arrange, upon request, for medicals for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nayilibitj,</inline> his family or any other member of the Nabarlek Aboriginal community who is concerned about radiation and at no cost to the Aboriginals. </para>
          <para>The second allegation was investigated by the Northern Territory Depanment of Mines, Queensland Mines Limited and staff of the Office of the Supervising Scientist together with representatives of the NLC and the local Aboriginals. The location of the radioactive samples was the original Queensland Mines Limited exploration camp site some 9 kilometres south-east of Nabarlek, and outside the present Queensland Mines Limited mining lease. This camp was abandoned late in 1970. Queensland Mines Limited has not been permitted access to this locality since 1973 when exploration in the area ceased. </para>
          <para>The investigation revealed two sources of radiation at the site giving exposure rates above background. One source was about 80 bags of mildly radioactive powdered drill samples located in a small cave close to the old camp. The other was a number of uranium ore specimens found on the ground in two spots within the camp area. General radiation exposure rates within the cave, about 1 metre from the piles of bags, were 0.1 millirem per hour (three to four times local background). Dose rates on the surface of individual bags, some of which had broken open, ranged between 0.0S and 0.2 millirem per hour with a maximum of 1 millirem per hour. </para>
          <para>The ore samples were apparently hand specimens of Nabarlek ore. There were 9 rocks in all weighing one or two kilograms each with surface dose rates ranging between 10 and 60 millirem per hour. Dose rates at 1 metre were 1 to 2 millirem per hour. Prolonged handling of such rocks or living close by them for long periods could lead to unacceptably high radiation exposures and the possible manifestation of medical effects. </para>
          <para>The state of the bagged samples and the rock specimens indicated that they had been undisturbed for some years. The camp site could have been visited by the odd hunting party during the dry season but is inaccessible during the wet. The general area shows no signs of recent habitation. It thus appears unlikely that anyone has received excessive doses of radiation. </para>
          <para>All bags and rock specimens and any residual contamination were removed by Queensland Mines Limited in the presence of officers of the Department of Mines and Energy and a representative of the Supervising Scientist. Radiometric surveys have indicated that with the exception of one small patch ( 1 metre x 4 metres) radiation levels in the area now approximate normal background. </para>
          <para>An inspection and survey of the area on 20 September 1979 by Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy officers accompanied by representatives of the Supervising Scientist and Queensland Mines Limited, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Solomon</inline> Nayilibitj and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Nalowed, another traditional owner, confirmed that the radioactive material had been removed. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) No information is available on the overall average increase in 1978-79 for the Sydney metropolitan area in prices of &#39; an average three bedroom house &#39;. However, one set of information on prices is contained in a report by the New South Wales Valuer-General&#39;s Department This contains valuers&#39; conclusions on the market (as distinct from actual sale prices) for &#39;average 3-bedroom cottages&#39; in a selection of suburbs. Of the 33 Sydney suburbs surveyed, price increases ranged between 6 per cent and 35 per cent between June 1978 and June 1979; increases exceeded 25 percent for only two suburbs. </para>

          </list>
          <para>In several of the outer suburbs surveyed, which are representative of the areas where many first-home buyers acquire houses, increases in prices were considerably lower. </para>
          <para class="block">Analysis of Home Savings Grant approvals data indicates that the average price of dwellings purchased by first home buyers in Sydney increased by 12.3 per cent between 1977-78 and 1978-79. </para>
          <para>Although the Valuer-General&#39;s data cover both new and previously occupied cottages, it is likely that in most of the suburbs surveyed few, if any, of the prices covered would relate to new houses. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that in the twelve months to September 1979, new house prices in Sydney rose by 7.9 per cent, compared to the overall increase in the CPI for Sydney of 10.0 per cent </para>

              <para>As is evident from ( I ), sharp price increases have only been recorded in a few established suburbs of Sydney suburbs where the stock of houses is fixed suburbs which are in demand because of their location close to the central business district and/or their good access to public transport. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Other factors which may have affected house prices in Sydney would include: an element of &#39;catching up&#39; following several years of relatively modest increases in prices a marked reduction in completions of flats and home units from 1974 onwards, especially in established suburbs, due in large part to local government restrictions. </para>
          <para>In most other capital cities, the average prices of land and dwellings remained relatively stable in 1978-79. The comparatively rapid increases in values of houses and land indicated&#34; for many suburbs of Sydney, appear to reflect characteristics peculiar to the Sydney market. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The increases in dwelling prices in 1978-79 reflect a strengthening of demand for housing in Sydney and shifts in the locational preferences of homebuyers. The price increases may be understood as pan of the clearing process in the housing market. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Pan of the overall increase in prices may have been due to a small degree of &#39;underbuilding&#39; in the mid- 1970 &#39;s, relative to the trend of underlying demand for housing. The recent strong improvement in new dwelling construction in Sydney indicates that this situation is being rectified by the market. </para>

              <para>No. While the information required to make a detailed assessment is not available, a general assessment is that there is no overall housing shortage. This is not to say that particular shortages do not exist relative to demand in some suburbs, or that particular groups are not facing some difficulty in finding suitable housing. </para>

              <para>to (6) All aspects of the proposed closures including the question of security during emergencies and the effect on local employment have been considered carefully, and Telecom does not propose to depart from its long standing policy of progressive conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working, resulting in a gradual decline in the level of manual assistance. Fortunately, the application of modern computerised technology to manual assistance systems allows more flexibility in the location of operators&#39; positions without economic penalty, enabling employment opportunities to be decentralised to a much greater extent than previously planned. Prior to this new development, of which Telecom is now planning to take full advantage, equipment design and economic pressures had favoured a policy which eventually would have led to the closure of all country manual assistance centres in South Australia. Telecom&#39;s present aim is to try to retain the present country/metropolitan ratio of manual assistance operators. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The increasing use of radio links and underground cable in the trunk and local subscribers&#39; networks will continue to progressively reduce the possibility of physical disruption from causes such as bushfires. Continuous service will increase as the automatic conversion program proceeds. In any emergency, the availability of secure, continuous telephone communications is an obvious advantage. </para>
          <para>Trunking of the network is also arranged in a manner which minimises the impact on service when failures occur. By the widespread use of automatic alternative routing techniques, and the establishment of manual assistance at the most strategic locations, maximum security within the network is achieved. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The Fisheries Amendment Act 1978 removed imprisonment as a direct penalty in respect of offences under the Act committed by foreign fishermen, except in cases of offences relating to the obstruction of officers. This amendment accords with provisions that have been negotiated with respect to the 200 miles offshore fishing zones of coastal countries at the current United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Instead, the Act allows for the imposition of heavy fines. In default of payment of fines imposed, foreign fishermen continue, however, to be liable to imprisonment. Imprisonment remains a penalty under the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Act 1968 that applies to the taking of sedentary species. Australia has no international obligations to allow foreigners access to those species on its continental shelf and they will not be dealt with in fisheries agreements that Australia negotiates with other countries. At present, there are no arrangements under which a person serving a sentence of imprisonment, including imprisonment in default of payment of a fine, may be transferred to another country for the purpose of serving the sentence in that other country. The conclusion of such arrangements will need to await the outcome of negotiations that are currently proceeding for a scheme for the transfer of prisoners between the States and Territories of Australia. With respect to countries which may not share the basic criminal justice system applicable in Australia, very careful consideration would have to be given to the basis for any transfer arrangements to ensure that persons transferred from Australia not only received treatment in accordance with our notions of penal justice but that they would also be required to undergo imprisonment for a sufficient period, in accordance with their Australian sentence, to deter them from breaches of Australia&#39;s fisheries legislation in the future. The matter raised by the honourable member will, however, be kept under consideration by the Government in the light of experience in the administration of the Australian fishing zone. </para>

          <para>There is no reason why sportsmen and women who intend to stay in Australia indefinitely or for extended periods should not apply for migrant entry rather than temporary entry at the outset and so obviate a need to seek change of status after arrival.

          <para>Consideration is currently being given to a variation of the rules relating to the issue of temporary entry visas to sportsmen and women, which in some instances will limit the numbers being admitted to Australia temporarily, so that Australian residents of equal talent will be given opportunities to enter the higher levels of sports. Such an approach, however, would still allow for the temporary entry of sportsmen and women whose skills were regarded by the appropriate sporting national body as of benefit to a particular sport. No other review of policy in this regard is contemplated at present. </para>

          <para>Under Recommendation 45 an additional amount of $5m is being provided by the Commonwealth over a three year period, commencing in 1979, to assist in the area of multicultural education in schools. This program will support activities in both government and non-government school systems, and the bulk of the funds will be allocated to particular projects on the advice of representative committees convened in each State. One intended outcome of this program is to assist in combatting any racist influences which may seek to have an effect within Australian schools. It is anticipated that a substantial amount of the funds provided will go towards the development of appropriate resource materials. </para>
          <para>As a follow up to Recommendation 14, the Government is providing a further $.324m over three years to assist Australian professionals working with large numbers of migrant clients to obtain or upgrade language skills, and understand cultural differences. Pilot courses under this program commenced during the 1978-79 financial year, and further courses are currently being mounted. Participants in a number of these courses have included school teachers, and this program is therefore assisting to promote the goals of inter-cultural understanding and racial harmony within Australian schools. </para>
          <para>In response to Recommendation 48, the Tertiary Education Commission has approached tertiary institutions throughout Australia with a view to having components on the cultural background of ethnic groups included in appropriate professional courses.

It is proposed to conclude the mailing at the end of first semester 1980, with further trials in Qld (4), NSW (3) and WA ( 1 ). In total, 18 schools will have been involved in the mailing over a period of21/2 years.

This phase is concerned with the revision of the draft materials for publication, the production and publication of related materials (movie films, Aboriginal literature), the production and publication of a teacher inservice education package and the dissemination of all materials. </para>
          <para>The interest in the materials being expressed by State Education Departments, as well as by individual teachers, indicates that CDC should aim to make the basic kit, and as many associated materials as possible, available for use at the start of the 1 98 1 school year. It is an expensive undertaking, and the Centre is considering ways and means of dealing with the financial ramifications of publishing this major work. Alternatives are being canvassed and the Centre will advise me of possible and preferred solutions. </para>
          <para>As further evidence of the Government&#39;s general concern to effect improvements in the field of Aboriginal education, it should be mentioned that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs discussed with State and Northern Territory Ministers at a recent meeting of the Australian Education Council the promotion of Aboriginal studies in schools. The Minister stressed the importance of community education programs to enable all Australians to gain a better understanding of the present situation of Aboriginal people. The Council agreed in principle to a number of propositions, including the production of high quality resource materials covering all aspects of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, both historic and contemporary. </para>
          <para>Both the CDC and the Institute of Aboriginal Studies can be expected to act as valuable resources bodies as developments in this area proceed. </para>

The report outlines a number of programs which contribute to improved community relations. Expenditure on those programs in 1978-79 was $28.8m and in 1979-80 is estimated to be $33.5m. </para>

              <para>to (5) The Australian Government continues to recognise the Pol Pot regime of Democratic Kampuchea. The Government has maintained the recognition that was bestowed by the former Australian Government in 197S. The United States Government never recognised the Pol Pot regime. The Heng Samrin regime of the People&#39;s Republic of Kampuchea, which was installed in Phnom Penh following Vietnam&#39;s armed intervention in Kampuchea, does not appear to have superior claims to recognition. Only 23 countries, most of which are pro-Soviet, recognise the Heng Samrin regime. There is evidence to suggest that, without Vietnam&#39;s active military support and presence, the Heng Samrin regime could not survive. </para>

          <para>Australia and other like-minded countries in the region cannot condone Vietnam&#39;s use of force to overthrow the legitimate government in Kampuchea. De-recognition of the Pol Pot regime could be interpreted as tantamount to endorsing the right of Vietnam to intervene militarily in the affairs of other states in the region. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s policy towards Kampuchea is based on the belief that only a negotiated settlement, in which all interests are involved, can bring peace and stability to Kampuchea. A pre-requisite for the establishment of an independent, neutral and popular government in Kampuchea, free of Great Power rivalries, is the withdrawal of Vietnamese armed forces. The Government would be willing to support any international efforts to achieve these objectives. </para>

The Australian Government upholds those general international principles which call for respect for international borders and the sovereign integrity of States, and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. For this reason it cannot condone the Tanzanian incursion. There are, however, elements in this situation which make it a special case. The authority of the administration in Kampala extends throughout the country, whereas the Heng Samrin regime in Phnom Penh does not effectively control Kampuchea and would not in any case survive without the support of the Vietnamese armed forces. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Section 23 (z) of the Income Tax Assessment Act exempts income derived by way of a scholarship, bursary or other educational allowance by a student receiving full-time education at a school, college or university. Specifically excluded from the exemption are amounts received by a recipient student under bond to the person or authority from whom the allowance is received or under the National Employment and Training System (the NEAT Scheme) and the Former Regular Servicemen&#39;s Vocational Training Scheme. Also excluded from the exemption is income derived after 31 October 1 978 under a Commonwealth Postgraduate Award, i.e., under a postgraduate award granted under the Student Assistance Act 1973. </para>
            <para>Exclusion from the section 23 (z) exemption means that the living allowance, incidentals allowance and thesis allowance payable under a Commonwealth Postgraduate Award are now assessable income in the hands of an award holder but the travelling allowance and establishment allowance are not Expenses of self-education incurred in carrying out the terms of the Award qualify for deduction against an Award holder&#39;s assessable income except for the first $250 of such expenditure which qualifies as concessional expenditure for concessional rebate purposes. Expenditure for which the travelling allowance and establishment allowance are paid is not an allowable income tax deduction. </para>
            <para>This means, broadly, that Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards are subject to taxation whereas the section 23 (z) exemption would apply to non-bonded postgraduate scholarships awarded by universities and private enterprise. The section 23 (z) exemption does not apply, of course, to the remuneration that some employers continue to pay to employees while pursuing a full-time postgraduate course of study. </para>
            <para>The question of which scholarships awards, etc. should be included in the section 23 (z) exemption and which should be excluded from the exemption was reviewed during the 1979-80 Budget deliberations. The Government decided, however, that there should be no change to the present position. </para>

            <para>It is not possible to identify readily the salary and other costs of staff involved in the management of the Australian fishing zone. However, a total of $900,000 has been appropriated to the Department of Primary Industry for the management of the zone in 1 979-80 for specific items such as reimbursement to the States for observer functions on foreign fishing vessels, apprehension and prosecution of foreign fishing vessels, computer services, as well as incidental expenditure covering log books, surveillance manuals, licence forms and manne charts. </para>
            <para>In respect of the above appropriations it should be noted that the determination of future estimates of management related expenditure in the Australian fishing zone will be based on practical experience gained in the first year of operation of the zone. </para>
            <para>It should also be understood that surveillance of the Australian fishing zone is provided by primary and secondary units which are also engaged in covering the requirements of a number of other departments. These surveillance efforts are co-ordinated through the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre, within the Depanment of Transport. It is not possible to apportion surveillance costs to any one department or to any specific incident, in this case the detection of illegal operations by foreign fishing vessels. </para>

I am advised that the current operation of the Lake Hawthorn project is in accordance with recommendations of the River Murray Working Party as set out in its report of September 1973.

          <para>This is in accordance with strict operating procedures to ensure no harmful effects to downstream users. At present, the operation of such schemes both in Victoria and South Australia is carried out under informal co-operative arrangements with the River Murray Commission. Under the proposed amended River Murray Waters Agreement, I would expect that future operations would be formally integrated with a comprehensive water quality management plan for the river system. </para>

            <para>-The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) There are no published data relating to broader measures of the volume of money than M3; data on M3 are published in the Statistical Bulletin of the Reserve Bank. However, broader measures may be constructed by adding to M3 selected liabilities of financial institutions other than banks. For example, one wider measure of the volume of money may be constructed by adding to M3 the withdrawable funds of permanent building societies. Data for the withdrawable funds of permanent building societies are available from the ABS publication, Housing Finance for Owner Occupation- Permanent Building Societies, Australia (Catalogue No. 5610.0). Another, even wider measure, could be constructed by adding (some of) the liabilities of finance companies. The choice and use of particular measures depends very much on the purpose of the analysis. </para>

            <para>The Senate Standing Committee&#39;s Report entitled &#39;Drug Problems in Australia- an Intoxicated Society?&#39; referred to said that the tobacco industry has probably spent close to $ 100m on advertising in the last six years whereas total Commonwealth expenditure on anti-smoking campaigns over the same period has been $ 1 .5m &#39;. </para>
            <para>As the report was printed in October 1977, the period to which I assume the honourable member is referring is the six year period prior to 1977. In three years of this period, 1972-73-1974-75, an amount of $ 1.5m was spent by the Commonwealth in the National Warning Against Smoking Campaign. </para>
            <para>It is not possible to provide details of total expenditure by the Government to discourage smoking as the Commonwealth supports, or has supported through other funding mechanisms, a wide variety of health education activities carried out in hospitals, health centres and other health agencies. These programs aim to promote healthy lifestyles and include anti-smoking as a major part of the overall programs. </para>
            <para>Apart from Commonwealth financial outlays, the honourable member will be aware that, as a significant antismoking measure, the Government prohibited, as from I September 1976, the advertising of cigarettes and cigarette tobacco on radio and television. </para>

            <para>Has his attention been drawn to comments of the Australian Mining Industry Council that due to a sharp decline in world demand for uranium and the discovery of major uranium reserves abroad, the estimates of the volume and price of uranium sales contained in the Fox Report are a serious over-estimation of the current probabilities; if so, and in view of the major uncertainties in the uranium market and the unresolved questions concerning the impact of uranium mining on the Australian economy, will he formulate a paper on the economic aspects of uranium mining for debate by the House. </para>

            <para>I am aware of various views, both from within Australia and from overseas, on the market outlook for uranium in the short and long term. The Australian uranium industry has a dynamic growth potential and undoubtedly has a very important role in supplying essential base loads for electricity generation in many countries. Earlier this month the first contracts since December 1972 were signed providing for the export of 2,500 short tons of uranium concentrates over the period 1983 to 1992. These contracts are worth, at present day prices, a total of some $A 1 60m to $A 1 80m. </para>

              <para>The Motor Vehicle Manfacturing Plan requires companies to meet local content commitments on an annual basis. Figures published by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs for the first six months of 1979 indicate that Chrysler, AMI and Nissan may need to improve content performance if they are to meet their 1979 commitments. I understand the three companies have sourcing arrangements in train with local component suppliers which should result in significant increases in their local content situation. The claimed loss in business and employment opportunities can, therefore, only be hypothetical at this stage. The local component industry received considerable additional business in the period 1977-1979 as a result of the need to increase physical local content following an increase in the value of the imported components as a result of appreciation of the Japanese Yen. </para>

As a consequence, the company must pay duty at substantive rates on some part of its Plan imports.

They were either extracted from or comprised updates of data made available by the Depanment of Defence during a public hearing of the Williams Royal Commission nearly two years ago, or else were drawn from related data. Those of currency in December 1977, comprise Exhibit 129 of the proceedings of the Royal Commission. The record of evidence given by the Department has for some considerable time been in the Parliamentary Library and it will be seen that the statistics are not confidential and were tendered as a public document. They were reviewed at the time the Senator&#39;s question was being examined, but neigher they nor any other data available would have enabled the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator to</inline> be answered on a comprehensive basis consistent with the terms of his question. One reason for this will be apparent from (2) above. Another was that discharges have occurred when drug or alcohol abuse was a contributing but not necessarily the determining factor; a third was that in many instances the drug offence most certainly could not be described in terms f addiction: in some instances, discharge has followed imediately upon a first known occurrence of &#39;hard&#39; drug </para>

              <para>The guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group require suppliers to exercise restraint in the transfer of sensitive technologies, such as enrichment plants, equipment or technology. They also require International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards to be applied to equipment, other than analytical instruments, especially designed or prepared for the separation of isotopes of uranium which is transferred. If such sensitive technologies are transferred, suppliers are also required to encourage recipients to accept supplier involvement and /or other appropriate multinational participation in facilities. The detailed obligations of suppliers concerning any transfer to a non-nuclear-weapon state of enrichment technology are set out in IAEA document INFCIRC/254.

          <para>Throughout 1979- a year marked by serious disruptions in the international oil markets- Saudi Arabia has maintained moderate and responsible policies in regard to the pricing and supply of its crude oil. Naturally the Government hopes that Saudi Arabia will be willing to maintain its moderate pricing policies and the production levels on which they are based. We consider that the best way Australia can encourage Saudi Arabia in this matter is for us to take action both domestically and internationally to encourage exploration for oil, to conserve oil and to encourage the development of alternative energy sources. As is also clear from the Government&#39;s statements refered to above, Australia has appropriate policies in place to pursue these aims. </para>
