            <para>- I address my question to the Treasurer. It concerns today's announcement of an increase in food prices of 3. 1 per cent for the month of April, which is the largest monthly rise since February 1973. It brings the annual rate of increase in food prices to 14 per cent. Does the Treasurer agree that this one month's increase in food prices will alone increase the consumer price index by 0.6 per cent? With large increases in petrol prices, building costs and manufacturing inputs also to be included in the June quarter index figures, does the Treasurer concede that the ongoing rate of inflation by the end of the financial year could be double the Budget estimate of 5 per cent? In view of the Government's arguments in the current national wage case that price rises in petrol, alcohol and tobacco products resulting from last year's Budget added 1.9 per cent to the consumer price index in the past two quarters, will the Treasurer acknowledge that the Government's budgetary actions have been a major factor in accelerating the rate of inflation? </para>

            <para>-The Government and I are concerned about the level of increase in food prices which was published today. There is no point in anybody's disguising his disappointment that such a very important component of the consumer price index has risen by the largest amount since 1973. The facts speak for themselves. How the honourable member for Gellibrand relates an increase in food prices to actions taken in the last Budget, which the latter part of his question seems to imply, completely escapes me. Of course, there is a number of cost pressures in the Australian community at present. Some of them are the result of movements in commodity prices which are good news to the producers of those commodities and for </para>

What this means, of course, <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> that the Government must sustain, even redouble, the efforts that it is taking in the monetary and fiscal policy area to ensure that maximum downward pressure continues to be exerted on inflation. </para>

            <para>-I have already indicated-I think it was on 14 May- that the Government is absolutely opposed to this sort of resolution. It has been put into the World Health Organisation assembly by a group of Arab countries. It is a resolution to suspend Israel's voting rights and World Health Organisation services to Israel. If it were to be adopted by the committee, it would pass to the World Health Organisation plenary for further debate before being put to the vote. As indicated at the outset of the answer, this Government absolutely opposes this resolution. I said it last week and I reiterate it. Such resolutions introduce needless political questions and debate into specialised agencies. This Government is utterly opposed to the poll.ticalisation of these specialised agencies. We believe it is essential that the principle of universality of membership of the United Nations' organisations be maintained. After all, if we brook this sort of principle- expelling a nation state from the United Nations- I think that we will be taking a walk down a path which is perhaps endless. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Australian delegation at the Assembly, led by the Minister for Health, has also spoken out against the moves directed at Israel and will continue to do so. In regard to other questions posed to me by the honourable member, I state that in an attempt to highlight the serious implications of this draft resolution Australia cosponsored, along with Ghana and also Fiji, a procedural motion which will make the suspension of a member of WHO what is termed 'an important question' requiring a two-thirds majority of the votes. The passage of this resolution, which, I am pleased to say, was adopted in committee stage of the Assembly by a very significant majority, will reduce the prospects of the substantive resolution being adopted. The draft resolution on the suspension of Israel is expected to be voted on in the next day or so. We will continue to employ all appropriate measures to oppose the adoption of this draft resolution. </para>

            <para>-My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Government promised to 'bring taxes down- not increase them', that the tax surcharge would be 'a temporary measure for 1978-79 only' and that 'full automatic indexation' will be introduced in 1978-79? Will the effect of these promises be to reduce the tax paid by the average income earner with a spouse and two children by about $6.50 a week? Has the Treasurer seen reports that the Government's decision to abolish gift duty from 1 July will enable widespread tax avoidance with consequent revenue losses of more than $600m? In the absence of this change, could the tax burden on those who cannot avoid tax be reduced, so facilitating the honouring of the promises to  bring taxes down '? </para>

            <para>-I will take the last part of the honourable member's question first. I have seen some reports that suggest there are certain tax avoidance consequences as a result of the abolition of gift duty. I remind the honourable member that the great bulk of the abolition of gift duty took effect back in November 1977, not from 1 July this year. So if the consequences to which he is referring are correct, perhaps they would have been observable by now. I doubt the figure that the honourable member cites. There are obviously some consequences in terms of revenue diversion as a result of the abolition of gift duty. I doubt very strongly whether it is the figure that he has cited. Of course, the Opposition has a terrific track record when it comes to taking action against tax avoidance. It is quite fascinating that members of the Opposition continue to drag the issue of tax avoidance into questions on the overall area of taxes. I do not mind if the honourable member for Burke, the Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Gellibrand want to keep asking me questions about tax avoidance. I will be delighted to answer as many questions as they like to ask me. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>So far as the other matters in the honourable member's question are concerned, I inform him, in case he was away when the Leader of the Opposition asked me similar questions, that I have nothing to add to what I have previously said on the subject of the 1 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent increase and tax indexation. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the advertisement to which the honourable gentleman refers. During the current national wage case hearing the Government has drawn to the attention of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission statements by various union leaders of a similar kind to that made in this advertisement which, if pursued, would put the whole wage fixation process at very serious risk. The heading 'Full indexation or Else' in the Australian Bank Employees Union advertisement, which the honourable member quoted, really speaks for itself. It is a threat. It is a threat that unless the union gets what it wants it is prepared to embark immediately on a campaign of disruption which the union must realise cannot change the decision which the Full Bench hands down. The union is attempting to blackmail the Commission. It is threatening its own industry and the community with quite unnecessary disruption because it may be unhappy with a decision which has not yet been made. </para>

          <para>I emphasise again that once that decision is made it cannot be changed. Therefore, members of the ABEU may well ask their union officials what they hope to achieve. In the light of their irresponsible and- I agree with the honourable member- provocative statement, the union's expressed concern that it does not want people put out of work is seen for what it is. It is nothing but a smoke screen to hide the union's very selfish and, I might add, totally contradictory motives. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the Treasurer's recent statement that at least $ 1.4m has been lost to revenue through tax avoidance. I refer also to the enormous losses incurred by policy holders and shareholders in collapsed financial institutions such as VIP Insurances Ltd, Associated Securities Ltd and the troubled Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd. Is the Treasurer aware of claims in the VIP Insurances liquidator's report and other liquidators' reports that more than the present level of 50 staff is needed to protect policy holders in more than 200 companies? Further, is he aware that the Taxation Office staff is being forced to take short cuts in assessments because there is insufficient staff to handle the work load? If the Treasurer is serious about reducing the appalling level of tax avoidance and financial institution collapses, when will he take steps to lift staff ceilings so that this can be done? Finally, for how much longer will he fiddle with the petty cash while corporate incompetency and corporate criminals continue to plunder the bank vault? </para>

            <para>-The honourable member for Hawker has asked me really two separate questions. I will deal first with the question about financial institutions. I think it is regrettable that the honourable member for Hawker inferred that shareholders and debenture holders in Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd have lost or are under threat of losing money. That is not the case. On my understanding of the situation I specifically repudiate the suggestion contained in the honourable member's question. I think it is extremely regrettable that he should have made it. So far as VIP Insurances Ltd is concerned, there have been investigations into the circumstances surrounding its collapse. Much of the investigation into the alleged misconduct of people concerned with VIP Insurances was of course the responsibility of the New South Wales Government and the New South Wales Corporate Affairs - </para>

              <para>-I am not suggesting for a moment that the New South Wales Government has not done its job because on this occasion there was significant evidence to justify the investigation by the New South Wales Government. I am glad that the honourable member does not dissent from what I have said. The second question raised by the honourable member concerns the allegation that in some way the Government's activities regarding tax avoidance are being hampered by staff ceilings. That has been the subject of discussion between the Commissioner of Taxation and me on a number of occasions over the past several months and, whilst no section of the Public Service ought to be totally immune from a policy of staff ceilings, I can say to the honourable member that there have been increases in the staffing levels in the Taxation Office. I am satisfied that no significant damage is being done to the anti-tax-avoidance activities of the Commissioner of Taxation. Indeed, if any evidence comes to my knowledge or the knowledge of the Government that the Taxation Office is being hampered by the present staff ceilings, something will be done about it. This is a classic example of people trying to jump on to the bandwagon. The honourable member for Hawker and the honourable member for Chifley both sat on the back bench when the Whitlam Government was in office, but for the 18 months that I was here while they were members of the Government back bench they never raised a squeak about tax avoidance. </para>

            <para>- I would not seek to anticipate the debate initiated by the honourable member for Lilley, but I would take leave to say that I share completely every sentiment that resides in the notice of motion that he has given to the House. It is not just a matter for mere astonishment that a political leader could make the speech of the character that he did; it is to be deeply deplored. I would adopt this language with respect to the bases in question: 'This Government will not yield to pressure to break the American alliance, withdraw from the ANZUS treaty or divulge secrets about American defence bases in Australia'. </para>

              <para>- Times have changed, but I venture to say this to the honourable member for Hunter: If the Treasurer imposed a tax on brains he would get a massive refund. I regret very much that the honourable gentleman in question made the speech he did. I am bound to say that personally I respect him and I have a great deal of affection for him, but he has entered upon a highly dangerous field. I believe that the Leader of  Her  Majesty's Opposition would do his party a singular service if he were to state the position of his party with respect to these bases. For my part- I know that I speak for the whole Government and for the Government parties which are not parties to repudiation- I believe that to follow the course advocated by the honourable senator in question would mean a repudiation of the ANZUS agreement, and we do not propose to do that. </para>

            <para>- Over a period a number of complaints have been made about the delay in meeting payments from the export market development grants which are one of the forms of incentive the Government has given to people to export. Recent articles have dealt with this matter. The delays have been caused by a number of factors. Some of the forms have been incorrectly filled in by claimants. In some cases there have been disputes between companies and the Export Development Grants Board. These factors have caused delays of about six months between the time of application and the grant being approved. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Some of the delay has also been caused by a lack of staff since the legislation covering export market development grants was broadened to include internal services and tourism. This together with the introduction of the Export Expansion Grants Act has meant that the work load of the Export Development Grants Board has increased considerably. It was only recently that the Public Service Board agreed to a staff increase of about eleven and permission was given for the Board to get temporary staff to meet any surges. I believe we will be able to keep up with most of the requirements. </para>

            <para>- I have already made it clear to the House that the Government will not permit any drilling on the Great Barrier Reef or any drilling or mining which could damage the reef. That is a categoric and absolute guarantee. I have indicated on other occasions that more information is required for the permanent preservation of the reef in a number of circumstances. Accordingly, the Government has taken steps towards the consideration of what information is required concerning the reef environment and what research ought to be undertaken. The Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee- AMSTAChas been asked to submit advice on a program of research on the reef environment for consideration in the Budget context. </para>

          <para>I hope all honourable gentlemen will be able to look upon the accomplishment of that research under the proposals of AMSTAC as something which will advance the cause of the preservation of the reef in all circumstances. Let me say in the most clear and categoric terms that we would not allow anything to occur that would in any way or could in anyway damage the reef. If there is a doubt about whether an activity would damage the reef, that activity would not take place. </para>

            <para>-At the United Nations conference on disarmament I expressed in the strongest and most categoric terms the Commonwealth Government's policy- I believe it is Australia's policy- in relation to disarmament and all matters concerning it. Negotiations on strategic arms limitations matters are obviously a very important part in halting an arms race and in achieving a world where there is less suspicion and less tension than there might otherwise be. This Government certainly places very great importance on the negotiations of adequate and appropriate arrangements between the Soviet Union and the United States. We welcome the agreement that has been reached. The United States Administration would know from statements made in the United Nations and from statements made by my colleague the Foreign Minister that this Government very strongly supports its endeavours in this regard. We would hope that the treaty, therefore, would be ratified. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>These matters are of the highest concern. It is not only the question of the arrangements in SALT itself but also the changed environments and the changed perceptions of the relationship between Russia and the United States that properly negotiated arrangements between the Soviet Union and the United States can acheive. If there is a lessening of tension in that area, if there is an extension of co-operation on matters of importance, not only to those two super powers but to the whole world, the cause of peace and disarmament generally is advanced. Let nobody think that the signing and the ratification of SALT treaties is an end to the problems and difficulties of disarmament. It is a continuing matter. However, an advance on one point is important in making it easier to achieve successive steps on the general road to disarmament. This Government's efforts will certainly be maintained. </para>

            <para>-The discussions with  President  Marcos, Prime Minister Ohira and  President  Suharto were particularly useful. I think it is worth recalling that in the past there have been difficulties in the relationship with the Philippines over trade matters. A trade treaty was negotiated and initialled many years ago, but after initial discussions with the  President  it was clear that the relationship was developing in such a way that it was well worth while to bring that treaty out of the dust covers. The  President  expressed a willingness to undertake the ratification procedures virtually forthwith. I think that is a recognition of the efforts that Australia has made over recent years to provide access to Australian markets not only for the Philippines but also for the Association of South East Asian Nations. It is worth noting that ASEAN products have been increasing their access to our markets at over 30 per cent a year. The Philippines has exceeded that. It is increasing its access by over 45 per cent a year. Admittedly that is from a small base and the ratio is still against the Philippines, but it is nothing like it was seven or eight years ago. Also I think new tensions in South East Asia- much closer to the Philippines and to ASEAN than to Australia- have increased the awareness of the need for close co-operation and consultation in many matters between the Philippines and Australia and between ASEAN generally and Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The visit was timely not only because it enabled those discussions and discussions with Prime Minister Ohira to take place but also because of the importance of the general trade matters that were being debated at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. I think that it might not generally have been understood that the Foreign Minister of the Philippines, in introducing me to the UNCTAD forum, took the very unusual step of making some very complimentary remarks about the role Australia has played in the Common Fund negotiations and about the way that we have been prepared to compromise on air fares matters. He welcomed the compromise that had been reached in Kuala Lumpur. He made those remarks from the chair in an open forum. </para>
          <para>In Indonesia, the discussions were very relaxed and forward looking. There is clearly a recognition by  President  Suharto that Indonesia and Australia are two important neighbours and that we need to look in a constructive way to the future of that relationship. I am quite certain that it is the wish of the Government of Indonesia to work in many ways to advance the relationship with Australia as it is the wish and the determination of my Government to advance the relationship with Indonesia. I expressed appreciation of the way in which the Indonesian Government, on a number of occasions, has brought about the intervention of refugee boats. Some boats get through, but quite plainly the cooperation of the Indonesian authorities is preventing larger numbers of unheralded arrivals. That is important when considering the number of refugees that Australia can take. We both expressed the view that the seabed negotiations now under way should be resolved as quickly and as agreeably as possible. We both expressed the view that further reunification of Timorese refugees should occur. We expressed the hope that the program could be continued and concluded as soon as possible. To this point there has been co-operation from Indonesia. I expressed appreciation to the  President.  At the same time, the  President  expressed his determination that further progress should be made. A number of other important matters were touched upon during the visit to the Philippines and Indonesia. It is my intention to report fully to the House on this matter at 8 p.m. this day. </para>

At the same time, the various co-operative programs involving that area obviously need to be taken into consideration in the development of future aid programs for Indonesia. I would have thought that the honourable gentleman, for all his concern in this matter, would well recognise that the future purpose of both Australia and Indonesia will be advanced by working together in a constructive manner. I cannot say that I see anything constructive or anything that could be achieved from the thrust of the honourable gentleman's question. </para>

            <para>- I think we are all very pleased that we have the Minister for Commerce from Saudi Arabia with us today. I know that the honourable member for Kennedy, who has a special association with the Middle East part of the world, would be particularly glad to have him here. The visit of the Minister is in response to a visit that I made to Saudi Arabia a few months ago. He has brought with him a number of officials and businessmen to talk about furthering trade relations between our two countries. Saudi Arabia is going through a phase of enormous development which opens opportunities for extending trade and for Australian construction companies to be involved in some of the development in that part of the world. This morning I had the pleasure of initialling a trade agreement between our two countries which establishes a framework for businessmen to be able to operate with a degree of confidence knowing that they have the imprimatur of government behind them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>For Australia a very significant trade development with Saudi Arabia has already taken place in regard to meat, particularly sheep meats and also beef, and in relation to slaughtered and chilled meat. An enormous quantity of dairy products is also imported into Saudi Arabia. Additionally the potential trade in fruit and wheat is very significant. I am hoping that Australian construction companies might also become more deeply interested in tendering for contracts for some of the development work that is taking place. Indeed, I would like to see Australian manufacturing companies looking at the prospects of joint ventures with companies in that nation. The Minister has with him a number of very senior Saudi Arabian businessmen. They will be meeting Australian businessmen in both Melbourne and Sydney. I am very hopeful that as a result of that contact there will be further development of trade and business relationships between Australia and Saudi Arabia. </para>

              <para>-I think that it is a matter of regret. I have already made the attitude of the Federal Government clear and I will repeat it for the benefit of the honourable member for Port Adelaide who may be under some misapprehension about it. In terms of the reputation of this country for foreign investment, I think that the South Australian Government's decision is very damaging. In the eyes of many people, it amounts to a confiscatory action by the South Australian Government. It is precisely the sort of action on the part of a State government which creates a reluctance on the part not only of overseas industries but also of people inside this country to invest in that particular State. I think that the great majority of people in South Australia, irrespective of their political allegiance, want to see the maximum incentive for industry in South Australia. This is not the sort of action by governments which will encourage industry into a country. It is the sort of action that sits very poorly with the expressed statements of the South Australian Premier and the Minister for Mines and Energy in South Australia. I state this as a mattter of principle and repeat that any action by a State government, irrespective of its political allegiance, which demonstrates the degree of commercial provincialism which this decision demonstrates, does not help the cause of investment, either in Australia or in that particular State. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security: Is it a fact that the Federal Government's subsidy towards the provision of the Meals on Wheels service now stands at 30c a meal? Is it also a fact that the provision of this one hot meal a day, combined with the visit of a volunteer to deliver the meal, has a highly beneficial effect upon the lives of the recipients? Is it also a fact that if this service were to be discontinued most of these old people would graduate to a public hospital or a nursing home at enormous economic cost to the Government and at great humanitarian shame to the community? Will the Minister therefore ensure that the 30c subsidy that the Commonwealth now pays towards the Meals on Wheels service is brought to a reasonable and humanitarian percentage of the estimated cost of $2 for each meal? </para>

            <para>-The Meals on Wheels service is one service that Liberal-National Country Party governments have consistently supported. I am certain that it was a Liberal-National Country Party government that introduced the measure. This Government believes in encouraging people in the community to try to help those less fortunate than themselves rather than leave all welfare on the shoulders of big brother government. We do appreciate the service that is rendered through the system that has been in operation for some time. However, I will take into consideration the support that the honourable gentleman has obviously shown for the program and some of the views that he has expressed and I will pass those on to the Minister for Social Security. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs aware of a recent statement by an Opposition shadow Minister that young people in receipt of unemployment benefit should be allowed to go surfing so that job vacancies can be filled by 40-year-olds? Does the work test allow for the situation proposed by the honourable member for Prospect to occur, that is, that people who do not want to work need not do so but may continue to receive unemployment benefit? </para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable gentleman for the question. As it happens, both he and I were at a conference on employment at Penrith in his electorate at which the honourable member for Prospect made the statement referred to by the honourable member for </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Macquarie. I happen to have with me a copy of the transcript of" that conference. I shall quote from it. The honourable member for Prospect said:   . . what's the point  of pushing  say young people into a particular job? Let's assume, take the worst case, that a bloke wants to be a  surfie  or whatever and he doesn't particularly want to get a job, let's admit that there are some number of people that are in that position that would rather get the $36 per week than get a job . . . </para>
          <para class="block">He went on to make some comments about why we should not chase those people and force them to take a job. He continued:   . . we are just being narks to try and push people who, and it is the whole community not just the Government, but there are large numbers of people in the community who feel very strongly about it, that this young kid really  doesn't  want to work, we ought to chase him and make him work. Completely ridiculous. </para>
          <para class="block">I venture to suggest that a great many people in the community do not accept the proposition of the honourable gentleman and do not believe that surfies should be allowed by their own choice not to try to get a job. Having attended that conference at Penrith, I was rather interested to read of the remarks by the Leader of the Opposition about certain people in the community who were proposing that people who want to follow an alternative lifestyle should be allowed to do so at the expense of the Government. It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition is at odds with the honourable member for Prospect and another leading member of the Labor Party. In his speech to the Labor Economists Conference the Leader of the Opposition said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is lip service to the principle that we cannot live with five to six per cent unemployment, but there is a lack of stomach to do anything much about it. </para>
            <para>Such a lack of urgency in public policy terms is reflected in visionary concepts directed to the development of alternative living patterns as a solution to mass unemployment. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I would think that the prominent leader of the Labor Party would be flattered at being described as a visionary. The Leader of the Opposition continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To my mind, it is fanciful to assume that great masses of people and young people in particular, can be lured into Utopian solutions of this sort. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister for Social Security and I have undertaken a review of the work test. The Government does not believe that people of the kind to which the honourable member for Prospect has referred should be allowed to get away with not working, at the taxpayers' expense, when they are fit and able to work and work is available to them. One aspect of the review of the work test procedures which I expect will be announced within a reasonable time will be to cover precisely the situation to which the honourable member for Prospect referred. </para>

The agreement is a further step in the establishment of a network of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements between Australia and other countries. The purpose of these agreements is to ensure that when Australia supplies uranium for peaceful purposes it will not be diverted to non-peaceful or explosive uses. To this end the agreement incorporates stringent safeguards and controls on the use of the uranium we supply to the Republic of Korea for peaceful purposes. The agreement incorporates all the Government's nuclear safeguards requirements as announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 24 May 1977. These are: an undertaking that nuclear material supplied by Australia will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes; the application of International Atomic Energy Agency- IAEA- safeguards, which provide an international check against diversion of material; fall-back arrangements to ensure continued safeguarding of nuclear material should IAEA safeguards for any reason cease to apply; a requirement for Australia's prior consent to any retransfers, to ensure that uranium supplied by Australia cannot be re-exported unless we are satisfied as to the ultimate destination and as to the controls that would apply; a requirement for Australia's prior consent for high enrichment or reprocessing of material supplied by Australia. This ensures that these operations can only take place if Australia is fully satisfied about the arrangements and conditions. This effectively reserves our position on reprocessing, as we have said we wish to, pending the outcome of international studies, including- INFCE- the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation; provisions ensuring that adequate physical security will be maintained, to guard against theft or other illegal use of nuclear material by groups or individuals; provisions for consultations to ensure the effective implementation of the Agreement; and all these safeguards and controls to cover nuclear material derived from Australian uranium so long as it remains in a form relevant from the point of view of safeguards. </para>
          <para class="block">The agreement also contains: a sanctions Article acknowledging Australia's right to suspend supplies and to require return of material in the event of detonation of a nuclear device, failure to comply with IAEA safeguards or breach of the agreement; and arbitration procedures for the settlement of disputes. </para>
          <para class="block">The agreement itself establishes safeguards obligations which the Republic of Korea and Australia have accepted; the accompanying letter concerns the practical application and implementation of these obligations. It does not change or dilute the agreement itself. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the letter is to provide a degree of reassurance to the Republic of Korea of the manner in which Australia intends to exercise its prior consent rights and to handle administrative problems that might arise from multiple labelling, that is the attachment of different national nuclear safeguards conditions to material as it is transferred internationally for processing purposes on its way to the end user. The letter also deals with the implementation of the noncompliance and fall-back safeguards provisions, and the intended scope of the administrative arrangements. The letter states Australia's intention of being a reliable supplier and its attitude towards a possible international convention on the physical protection of nuclear material. </para>
          <para>The Republic of Korea's nuclear program is a large one, and envisages over 40 reactors by the year 2000, at which time nuclear power would account for 60 per cent of electricity generation and 20 per cent of the Republic of Korea 's total energy requirements. One reactor is already operating, two are under construction and two are on order. Under present plans, work on two new reactors will start each year. The Republic of Korea estimates that its cumulative requirements for yellowcake between now and the year 2000 will be of the order of 80,000 tonnes, a very substantial quantity. The conclusion of this nuclear co-operation and safeguards agreement with the Republic of Korea provides a basis for shipments of Australian uranium to that country under commercial contracts. It therefore opens the way to an important new link between the two countries. Further nuclear safeguards agreements with other countries will follow. I assure the House that each agreement will be made public as it is signed. The Government's nuclear safeguards policy is a comprehensive, stringent and highly responsible policy aimed at contributing to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is also an eminently practical and internationally workable policy. The willingness of potential customer countries to accept Australia's nuclear safeguards requirements, thorough and stringent as they are, is evidence of this. </para>

            <para>-by leave- the agreement tabled today was released to the Press 20 days ago. On that day, the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> provided some information on the visit to Australia by the Korean Prime Minister. It will be on record also that when the Opposition sought to debate this matter the week before last, the Government gagged that debate. In examining the text of this agreement, we note it is essentially the same as the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement between Australia and the Philippines. We note that the document emphasises co-operation in peaceful use of nuclear energy and the transfer of nuclear material. The Minister will agree that this text is derived from what is referred to as the model safeguards agreement. The title 'Nuclear Cooperation ' is more appropriate than safeguards as the intent of this agreement is to pave the way for very substantial co-operation with the Republic of Korea in these matters. It is also significant that the Minister for Trade and Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> now has policy control in this area. During Question Time on 2 May, the  Deputy  Prime Minister made clear that he regards economic relations with the Republic of Korea as having great prospects particularly for the export of our raw materials from Australia to meet the industrial expansion of the Republic of Korea. </para>

              <para>-Don't get too impatient. You are overacting for a change. The  Deputy  Prime Minister made clear that the Republic of Korea bases its expansion plans in substantial part on nuclear generation of electricity. This is all from the  Deputy  Prime Minister. The pre-occupation of Australian foreign policy with China and Japan and the pre-occupation of conservative Australian governments with security issues has obscured the rate of growth and economic importance of Korea. We welcome the fact that the Government recognises the importance of relations with Korea other than as an aspect of the security of Japan. We are concerned about the future security and stability of the Korean peninsula and the avoidance of war there. The Minister will recall that it was the Labor Government which, in 1974, extended recognition to, and established diplomatic relations with, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. It is gratifying that the present Government has not withdrawn that recognition although relations with the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea are in a state of suspense. We take the view that Australia should keep open the prospect of restoring relations with the Democratic People's </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Republic of Korea, recognising the isolation from the rest of the world which that country has suffered, or has inflicted upon itself, for three decades. Any dialogue with a country so isolated for so long must proceed with difficulty, but such difficulty ought not to turn us against the dialogue itself. </para>
          <para>It is in the interests of the Republic of Korea and of ourselves, among other countries in the Asian-Pacific region, that relations between North and South Korea be placed on a more peaceful and stable basis. That objective can be achieved only with meaningful dialogue with North Korea, as well as development of relations with South Korea. We welcome the progresshowever slight that may have been- in the recent past towards resumption of dialogue directly between North and South Korea. There will be no solution to the so-called 'Korean problem' other than one initiated and settled by the Korean peoples themselves. We hope that it will be a peaceful solution. These remarks are relevant to the tabling of this Agreement because the Government has made quite clear the Agreement is to provide for significant co-operation between Australia and South Korea into the 21st century in an area of energy production and of sweeping social and international security significance. </para>
          <para>We have discussed with the Foreign Minister in previous debates the details of other nuclear co-operation agreements during the last session of the Parliament. Since that time, of course, events in the world affecting nuclear energy have not stood still. We note, for example, that the Government has extended the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox as Ambassador-at-large for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Safeguards Matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox is on record in a paper published in November 1978 by the International Consultative Group on Nuclear Energy as proposing quite new approaches to the avoidance of nuclear proliferation.  His  proposals, made in a personal capacity, are forms of international control of weapons-usable material. These proposals reflect a different approach to that evident in the Government's continuing program of negotiating nuclear safeguards agreements. We also note that a very senior officer of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, again in a personal capacity, has proposed a quite radical new approach to international nuclear co-operative activities for the avoidance of nuclear proliferation. It is our interpretation of views that he has expressed that they bring into question the effectiveness and manageability of these safeguards that the Government has established. </para>
          <para>Quite apart from these personal and creative initiatives associated with the Government, the Government, of course, is now caught up in the events in Iran and Harrisburg. The decline in confidence in petroleum supplies brought about by events in Iran undoubtedly increases international interest in nuclear energy. The events at Harrisburg, however, have greatly increased public apprehension about the safety of nuclear reactor operations. In many of the democracies, nuclear power programs will be set back. We note arguments whether Babcock and Wilcox reactors, like that at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, should be shut down. We note arguments by some commentators that pressure water reactors should be replaced by gas cooled reactors. We note that the United States and Japan have agreed to a joint study of the safety of light water reactors. We note that Sweden will now hold a referendum on nuclear power. The  Deputy  Prime Minister has told us of the projections by the Republic of Korea of its nuclear reactor requirements over the next 20 years- 40 reactors requiring 80,000 tons of uranium. These are ambitious plans. Were it solely within the capacity of the South Korean Government to determine how many reactors it could buy, one might consider these ambitious projections reliable. They are, however, open to considerable doubt to the extent that the major manufacturing countries will be able to continue to supply reactors if the reactors are judged to be suspect in operation. The magnitude of the Korean nuclear program can be illustrated in comparative terms by saying that the Koreans wish to buy, by the year 2000, a quantity of uranium equal to twice the current annual world market for uranium and five times the amount the  Deputy  Prime Minister would like Australia to be able to export annually by 1988. </para>
          <para>We wish to express the following reservations and concerns about this proposed nuclear cooperation agreement. These are: First, neither the Parliament nor the people of Australia have been provided with an account of the profound economic, political and strategic consequences of the  Deputy  Prime Minister's plans for cooperation with Korea. Secondly, the projections made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister are, to say the least, suspect and, if accepted, could lead to investment decisions on the basis of unrealistic market estimates. The prospect is that, if the Government were permitted to proceed with its plans on such a basis, we could find ourselves so substantially committed to uranium exports a decade from now that we would be a desperate seller rather than a seller concerned, as we should be, about the safety, environmental, weapons proliferation and waste disposal problems of nuclear energy. Thirdly, the Government clearly denies any responsibility for these issues generally and as they particularly affect Korea. </para>
          <para>The advocates of nuclear energy have included two camps: Those who see the nuclear option as a major long term contributor to energy needs; and those who, especially more recently, have justified nuclear energy as essential to fill an energy deficit which may be upon us in the mid 1980s. </para>
          <para>Some argument persists whether there will actually be such a deficit. But in terms of confidence the deficit is clearly upon us already and is reflected in the market place. The two approaches to nuclear industry lead to different conclusions. If nuclear industry has a long term future, the reviews, adjustments and options made remain relevant. If, on the other hand, nuclear power is supposedly only a stop-gap to be replaced by more benevolent, renewable alternatives several decades from now, we must doubt very much whether nuclear power now has the viability to be a gap-filler. The immediate future probably lies between these two alternatives. There are reactions against nuclear power, but other countries with major nuclear programs will continue with these and are likely also to press for exports. Exports may be in increasing demand, in spite of risks, in middle level countries facing the increasing pressure of oil prices. The Republic of Korea is a country in such a position. </para>
          <para>At the same time, the Republic of Korea is a country which has quite clearly contemplated the" acquisition of nuclear weapons in the past. In fact, evidence available to the United States Government as far back as 1976 led it to bring pressure to bear on France and on Korea to prevent the export of a nuclear reprocessing plan t by France to Korea. That pressure also culminated in the Republic of Korea becoming a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty after many years of avoidance of that commitment. The facts remain that, firstly, South Korea is a country with an understandably great concern for its defence and which cannot be considered to have excluded from its future plans the acquinon of nuclear weapons. The Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty provides for withdrawal of any country 'if it decides that extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardised the supreme interests of its country'. </para>
          <para>Secondly, neither the Treaty tabled today, nor the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would prevent the Republic of Korea- or any other country similarly bound by Treaty- from accumulating over time and within its so-called peaceful' nuclear fuel cycle, both the materials usable for nuclear weapons and the technology and skills for converting that material into weapons in less time than the three months required for withdrawal from the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. The provisions in the Agreement, at Article X, enabling Australia, as supplier, to suspend or cancel further supplies of uranium, or enabling us to require return of uranium or material derived from Australian uranium, provide no effective force to stop the Republic of Korea acquiring weapons, not least because of the proportional principle contained in the Treaty and now defined for the first time. </para>
          <para>This means that if, for example, Australia provides 40 per cent of the Republic of Korea's- or any other country's- uranium supplies, those uranium atoms will undoubtedly be mixed with uranium atoms obtained from other countries and the extent of our eventual fallback safeguards controls will be proportional only to the 40 per cent of our supply. That is, if the Republic of Korea withdrew from the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty and from the safeguards regime, and if it further declined to accept the full scope safeguards required, Australia would have the capacity to exercise its safeguards or retrieval rights only in respect of, say, 40 per cent of the nuclear material. It may be that similar safeguards commitments entered into by Korea bilaterally with other countries could commit it similarly in respect of part of the remaining 60 per cent, but any such obligation is beyond the reach of this Treaty. </para>
          <para>In making this point, I do not wish to isolate for accusation the present or future policies of the Government of the Republic of Korea. That country is nonetheless a country with an interest in nuclear weapons. My primary intention is to identify the ineffectual nature of the safeguards adopted by the Australian Government. It must also be noted that since the subject of nuclear non-proliferation was last debated in the Parliament in November 1978, announcements by the Deputy Prime Minister about uranium sales contracts have made even more clear than was then the case that the Government regards the safeguards as little more than a political cosmetic to facilitate exports. It is common knowledge that other areas of the Government, including the Department of Trade and Resources, regard the work done by and the interest taken in the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to nonproliferation and for the enhancement of safeguards, as merely peripheral. </para>
          <para>The harsh facts are that, firstly, the Government is continuing to do no more than mouth its commitment to selective elements of the proposals in the Fox report; secondly, the Government has not kept abreast of, and has not informed the Parliament of the pace of international developments concerning nonproliferation; and thirdly, the Government is pursuing a policy which is dangerous in terms of economic investment, political, social and environmental consequences and national security. Finally, nuclear exports policy is now unqualifiedly in the hands of the  Deputy  Prime Minister, who we say is not competent to manage this policy. </para>

              <para>-by leave-The report that has just been tabled is the third report of the Committee established in the 3 1st Parliament. The inquiry upon which this report is based resulted from the inspection of Aboriginal art located near Laura in north-east Queensland on the Cape York Peninsula. Committee members were impressed with the paintings and were concerned that this area which is clearly of national importance be properly preserved. The first major discovery of Aboriginal rock art on Cape York Peninsula was in 1 960. Since then, several hundred galleries containing thousands of paintings have been discovered. These galleries contain one of the largest bodies of Aboriginal art in Australia and were described to the Committee as one of the largest and most exciting bodies of pre-historic art in the world. The earliest art styles in the galleries could be more than 20,000 years old. In the past, the sites have been protected by their isolation. As roads in the area improve and the existence of the sites becomes more widely known, tourist pressures will increase and so will the potential for damage. The Committee believes that a proper plan of management for the area needs to be developed before tourist numbers increase to an extent that irreparable damage occurs. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has developed plans for similar sites for the Northern Territory. While it is recognised that the Queensland Government is responsible for the management of the parks and reserves in the State, the Committee believes that the experience gained by the Commonwealth parks service would be of great assistance to the development of a management plan for the Quinkan reserve. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Committee has recommended that the parks service offer assistance to the Quinkan Reserve Trust. The Committee hopes that the Queensland Government will accept any offer that the Commonwealth Government may make to assist in the preservation of this spectacular and unique area of Australia so that the paintings can be maintained undamaged for the enjoyment of future generations. It is vital that areas of such significance should be preserved for posterity and therefore every endeavour must be made to ensure proper control and management of these galleries. The Committee also recommends that a research program be undertaken by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies to determine whether the traditional owners of the art are still living. The Committee considers that unless the traditional owners can be located some of the myths and legends of the area will be lost forever. I commend the report to the House. </para>

            <para>- The newspapers, television and radio are currently ablaze with speculation about the latest batch of broken promises about to be served up to the Australian public. Their commentary is preoccupied with the concern about how the Fraser Government- the selfproclaimed low tax government- is about to hoist taxes once again. It is not a matter of moving towards a record level; that has already been established by the Fraser Government. That is indisputable. That is verifiable from the official statistics. Quite obviously, the Government is determined to improve even on that level. It is not a matter any longer of the Government's credibility being at stake. Nobody disputes that it has any credibility left. That has been shot to tatters by its own actions. The succession of broken promises leaves its credibility beyond any redemption. What does concern people is the way that there can be massive alienation in the community from a Government which should have responsibility for very serious economic management matters at a time of crucial economic concern. The speculation in the Press does not arrive there by chance. It has been initiated and is being fostered by Government sources and by members of the Ministry. What we have to be clear about is what is behind this tactic. It is an effort to have a re-run of the very successful ploy which was adopted in relation to the release of the March quarter consumer price index figure. Honourable members and the public will recall how there was informed speculation in the newspapers about the likely level of the consumer price index measurement, that is, 2.4 per cent, for the March quarter. Even the night before the release was made by the Bureau of Statistics, a senior Minister- the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> knows him better than anyone else here- was advising any interested journalist in Perth that the figure would be 2.4 per cent. However, it was 1 . 7 per cent. </para>

              <para>- I raise a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition, in making an explicit charge of deceit is not complying with the forms of the House. It is not a question of rejecting the Leader of the Opposition's criticism on a matter of merit or substance. The Leader of the Opposition is making a direct charge of deceit and I ask that that charge be withdrawn. </para>

              <para>- I will not withdraw. I was not suggesting but stating that he was clever; he disputes it. The point I want to make is that there is a replay going on of the same sort of tactic that we saw in relation to the March quarter CPI figure. The public was enormously relieved to discover that the CPI figure was not 2.4 per cent but 1.7 per cent, which was better than the bad forecast. The 1.7 per cent increase was far worse than the 1.3 per cent increase for the same quarter 12 months earlier. Moreover, what the public lost sight of was that the March quarter figure divulged beyond any question that inflation was breaking out again and there were enormous problems on the doorstep not only of this Government but also of this country. The same thing has been attempted now. The broad spread of informed leaks on taxation matters, coming from Government sources, represents much more revenue than the Government really will need. Accordingly, even though they are about to be ripped off again with increased revenue charges, the people will undoubtedly be led to believe that they are better off than it was projected they would be a few months or weeks ago when the announcement was made on forthcoming revenue increases, in whatever form they take. That is the tactic. The point that we must not lose sight of is that revenue is going to be increased and it is going to be increased because of impulsive promises made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> which have only narrow sectional appeal and narrow sectional benefit. The appeal and the benefit do not go to the vast majority of the people in this community. I will come back to that. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>What really is on trial here is the integrity of the Government. There is a long list of broken promises. Promises from the Fraser Government specifically in relation to taxation matters, have the staying power of snowballs lobbed in hell. In the 1975 election campaign the Prime Minister said: </para><quote>
            <para>We will encourage people 's initiatives and enterprise, not batter them into the ground with punishing taxes. We will reduce the taxation burden. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">After three years under a Labor Government, revenue raised by Government from all forms of taxation and charges on the public was 27.8 per cent of total national income, which is the best way of putting it. In three years under the Fraser Government the rate has risen to 29. 1 per cent on average and it will rise higher than that in the forthcoming Budget, or in any ad hoc arrangement made between now and then in anticipation of the fiscal needs for the year 1 979-80. In his 1977 campaign speech the Prime Minister said: </para><quote>
            <para>We have reduced taxes, revived incentive and restored fair reward for achievement. We have ended the big tax rip-off. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">The fact is that in three years, although average weekly earnings under the Fraser Government increased by 31 per cent, pay-as-you-earn income tax increased by 47 per cent, a much faster rate than actual income increased for people in the community. In addition, increasing this form of tax at a far faster rate than the actual movement in average weekly earnings, meant simply that the amount of real income left for people to spend after tax was reduced over that period. That is the way in which people's living standards are being depressed. More disturbingly, over the same period other direct personal tax payments did not go up but went down by $3m. </para><para class="block">That is a measure of the level of tax avoidance which is going on at the present time. </para><para>If the Treasurer were genuine in expressing concern about the need to eliminate tax avoidance- I understand, he has estimated that this costs the community some $3,000m in lost revenue in the course of a year- he would do what has been done in Great Britain and introduce a legislative provision with retrospective effect. Almost overnight, in the experience of the United Kingdom, the tax avoidance industry dried up. Why does he not do this sort of thing so that the people who should be paying their taxes, the wealthy people, will be forced to pay them. When that is done the vast majority of people in the community who are ripped-off by this Government's taxation policies will have a far better chance of making ends meet and of avoiding the depression of living standards that they have had to bear. There can be no disputing the fact that there has been a rip-off. The average income earner would need to have his income before tax increased by $8.50 a week if in real terms he were to have as much spending power now as he had in 1975. </para><para>In the matter of tax indexation, the Government has given firm pledges that the community would have full income tax indexation. It never has and, if it does get it, serious questions would have to be raised about how it has been advantaged or disadvantaged. Indexation in the first Budget of the Fraser Government was only 90 per cent and in the next Budget it was 80 per cent. It is now down to 35 per cent. Inspired leaks in the newspapers, coming from Government sources as close as one can get to the Treasurer's office, are suggesting that full indexation will be established in the forthcoming Budget. It will not, of course. It will be partial indexation. If the indexation situation is improved it will be probably to a higher level than the 35 per cent now, but it will not be to 100 per cent indexation. The claim of the Government before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on the national wage case makes it clear that the Government wants wages discounted by the increase in charges imposed on the community by Government measures- that is, by 1.9 per cent. That ignores the countervailing proposition that the savings coming from health insurance charges of 1.5 per cent ought to be applied as an off-set. Accordingly, if there is to be any discounting it should be only about 0.4 per cent. </para><para>The point I want to make is that there will be a price for any improvement on the level of income tax indexation applying at the moment. That price, according to informed speculation in the newspapers, is the imposition of a <inline font-style="italic">2'A</inline> per cent levy on income tax. After allowing for any savings from tax indexation improvement, even if 100 per cent indexation were imposed, and applying against that the cost of an increased tax levy introduced from 1 July, the taxpayers in Australia will be $500m worse off in the course of a year. The Government is in this jam because of the knee jerk responses of the Prime Minister on the very important matter of revenue. Let me explain how much of this situation has come about. There was the abolition of death duties at a cost of $50m, the abolition of the coal export levy at a cost of $93m, and the effects of the Government's oil pricing policy, flowing from the increases of petrol charges, costing $ 120m. That is a total cost of $260 m. All these factors benefit those who are largely much better off than the great majority of people in the community. Because of these and other concessions, which have to be paid for and which come to about $800m to $900m, the Government will have to make someone pay. Because it is pandering to preferred groups, the wealthy groups that represent a minority in the community, and because it wants to protect privilege, the Government is going to make the rest of the community pay. </para><para>Let us look at the abolition of death duties, as desirable as it may be in the view of so many people. It is desirable in my view too but only after other priorities have been attended to first. By abolishing death duties a substantial advantage goes to a few people, but it has to be paid for by the rest of the community. In 1977, 6 per cent- only 750- of the estates in Australia out of nearly 14,000 which were processed involved estates in excess of $200,000 but provided 55 per cent of the duty. If the exemption had been lifted to, say, about $100,000, the cost to the public purse would have been of the order of no more than $14m. If the Government really wanted to ease the burden in this area it would have lifted the exemption. People with estates in excess of $100,000- after all, people not hard up- would still be making a contribution to public revenue. The fact that only 750 estates worth more than $200,000 each on average have been exempted from death duties means that the rest of the community has to make up the shortfall. That is why the community is going to have to pay more tax. </para><para>Abolition of the coal export levy adds to the profits of Utah Mining Australia Ltd. Utah's profits last year were $138m of which $104m was exported overseas to the parent company. Australian taxpayers will have to pay more tax so that that can take place. I refer now to oil pricing. As a result of the Government's pricing policies for petrol, the gross profits of domestic oil producers will be more than $300m higher this year than would otherwise be the case. They will be more than $420m higher next year- 1979-80- than would otherwise be the case. Some $120m of that amount which goes to gross profits next year comes directly from revenue otherwise available to the community. Those companies do not need that revenue; they are doing very well. Esso Australia Ltd and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd recorded profits of $ 104m yet they are receiving this windfall gain. Because the Government has conceded this revenue to these companies the taxpayers, the average wage and salary earners, will have to pay more tax. </para><para>We make no apologies about avoiding these sorts of impositions on the public by introducing a capital gains tax which would raise about $100m conservatively, a resource rental tax which would raise $150m and a crude oil levy which would raise $450m, and by cracking down on family trusts- so beloved of the conservatives in the Liberal National Country Party- which would raise $ 100m. This total of $800m could be raised from people who are well able to pay. The Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> said in 1975 to the State Council of the Liberal Party that the Liberal Party's options should be kept open on the matter of a capital gains tax. He could see virtue in it then as shadow Treasurer. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> who was Minister Assisting the Treasurer in 1977 in a speech in Perth lauded the virtues of a resource rental tax. I quoted the profits of the domestic oil producers to indicate the rip-off they are receiving. This is completely unfair. We make no apologies for raising revenue from other sources. It is inescapable that additional revenue will have to be raised as a matter of responsible economic management. The argument between the Government and us is: Who pays? We say that those who have been escaping for so long, those who have so much wealth available to them and who are not paying tax on large amounts, as happens with capital gains, ought to be paying instead of the average income earners in the community. </para><para>

            </talker>
            <para>- This matter of public importance is about, inevitably, the comparative taxation records of the Government and the Opposition. I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> on the question of taxation. I will welcome at any time between now and the next election and during the next election the opportunity to debate the question of taxation with the Leader of the Opposition. I will be more than happy to draw comparisons between the taxation record of this Government in the time that it has been in office and the taxation record of the former Labor Government when it was in office and the likely taxation performance of a Labor government led by the honourable member for Oxley with the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> as Treasurer. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Honourable members should note that the two speakers from the Opposition in this debate, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand, are responsible for the economic statements of a party which still believes that one of the first obligations of a re-elected Labor government will be to go about persuading the Australian people that they ought to be prepared to pay much higher taxation in order to rebuild the public sector. There is no argument about that. That is not my charge. It is not my fanciful allegation. Those words were used by the honourable member for Gellibrand when he was addressing the Labor Economists Conference in Brisbane only a few months ago. He said that on the quite realistic assumption that the Labor Party would not be elected to government at the very earliest before 1983, one of its first jobs would be to go about persuading the Australian people that much higher taxation was needed in order to pay for an expanded public sector. The Leader of the Opposition still leads a party which, when last in government, believed fundamentally that its vast public expenditure programs could be financed through the huge and automatic impact of a progressive taxation scale in a time of high inflation. The then leader promised the Australian people that that was what would occur in December 1972 if a Labor government were elected. </para>
          <para>The most important things to keep in mind when talking about taxation are the fundamentally different philosophies between this side of politics and the other side so far as the size of government is concerned and, as a consequence, the size of the taxation burden. Even the Leader of the Opposition and his economic followers know as well as I do that the capacity of a government to provide transfer payments, to provide public services and to function as a government is related directly to the revenue raising effort it is prepared to undertake and the revenue raising effort that the community is prepared to put up with. The fact of the matter is that we on this side of the House have demonstrated, whatever the test, that we believe in smaller government, we believe in making less demands on the community through taxation and imposts and we believe in giving to the individual in society a greater capacity to make decisions as to how he or she will dispose of his or her individual income. The first thing to remember when debating taxation policies of the Labor Party and the Liberal and National Country Parties is that we have a fundamentally different approach to the size of government. The Labor Party believes in high taxation because it believes in big and meddling government. The two parties have a fundamentally different approach to government. Over the past 3 years a number of changes have been made to our taxation system. I do not claim for a moment that the taxation system that we have at present is perfect. It is anything but perfect. It still contains a large number of anomalies both as to the actual levels of taxation and also as to the structure of taxation. </para>
          <para>This Government has attempted a number of quite fundamental reforms. Honourable members will remember that when we came to government there were seven steps in the progressive rates scale; there are now three. That particular reform is of very major significance itself. It has meant that a person on average weekly earnings can earn in the order of $5,000 additional income through overtime or a second job without being moved from the basic taxation rate into the intermediate taxation rate, whereas under the old scheme if a person earned something in the order of $2,500 extra he or she passed immediately from the lowest taxation rate into the next step in the progressive taxation scale. That is one of the reforms we have undertaken which has made a major change to the incentive for people on low and modest incomes to undertake further work, to expend further effort, to undertake overtime and to take on second jobs. It is an illustration of the commitment of this Government through taxation changes and through taxation reform to give a greater sense of incentive to the individual. Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition can say, nothing that the honourable member for Gellibrand can say and nothing that anybody on the other side of the House can say during this debate will alter the fact that if the Hayden rate scales had been in place now this Government would be collecting $3,000m more in tax in 1 978-79. </para>

              <para>- It was $3,000m more in 1978-79. Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition can say can alter that fact. The standard response of the honourable member for Gellibrand to that charge- I have mentioned it before and I mention it again because the Labor Party keep bringing up these matters of public importance dealing with taxation- is: 'Oh well, if we had stayed in government we would have indexed taxation. We would have altered the rates. We would not have kept the rate scales as they were'. The fact of the matter is that when the Labor Party went out of office it was not its policy to alter those rate scales. When it went out of government it had not given any commitment to make any changes to those rate scales. It was not until some time later that the Opposition realised, rather belatedly, that changes by the present Government were the sorts of changes that should have been made. Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> or the honourable member for Gellibrand can say will alter that very simple statistical fact. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Nothing can alter the other very simple fact that notwithstanding the grandiose things that were said by the then Leader of the Opposition at Blacktown in 1972, such as: 'We will end the tax lurks,' nothing whatever was done by the then Labor Government to end the tax lurks in this country. It is a source of endless amazement to me that the Opposition, the champion of the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer, the champion of the battler, the little bloke who has his tax deducted each week without option, when it was in government did nothing about tax avoidance. It is only in recent months that this Government, in a way that no other government has since the World War II, has cracked down on tax avoidance, and it will continue to crack down on it. It is only because we have done something about it that the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Gellibrand and other spokesmen for the Labor Party have decided that it is about time that they got on the tax avoidance bandwagon. Of course, having failed to do anything effective while it was in government, the Labor Party is now trying to exhort the Government to take more action against tax avoidance. </para>
          <para>Honourable members on the Government side and the Australian people know that it is the Fraser Government that has done something about tax avoidance. For the first time since the World War II, it is the Liberal and National Country Parties that have made a concerted attack on the inequities of tax avoidance. It will be ever to the credit of this Government that it has done more in that area to protect the take home pay of the average taxpayer in Australia than was ever done by the Labor Party. Let us hear nothing more from the Opposition Leader or Opposition spokesmen about tax avoidance. They sound extremely hollow. </para>
          <para>Of course, the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges that gift and estate duty ought to be abolished. This Government has done something constructive about it. The Leader of the Opposition rails about the Utah company. The Opposition seems to have a fixation about a company which has been extraordinarily successful and which has exploited in a most economic fashion the vast coal resources of Australia. Of course, what the Leader of the Opposition did not say was that Utah pays about $50m a year in wages, that it employs a large number of Australians and that it pays about $60m in Queensland rail freights. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition does not mention that. All he talks about are the profits that Utah makes. The Opposition still has an eternal hang-up about profits. It still does not like profits. It still cannot grasp the simple economic fact that when companies make profits they have a greater capacity to employ people and to pay taxation. </para>
          <para>What the Leader of the Opposition did not say was that Utah pays about $200m in taxes. He did not mention that. There is supposedly something wrong with that. He would have us believe that Utah pays no tax at all. He did not mention that this Government has introduced a branch profits tax to prevent a larger remittance of profits by Utah to the United States of America. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition does not mention those facts. He tries to have us believe that because the company makes large profits and because we have not imposed all the taxes that he would like us to impose, it follows as a natural consequence that that company is getting away absolutely scot-free. He does not recognise the royalties paid by companies such as Utah, the company tax paid by them, the freight charges that are borne by them, the wages bills they bear and the number of people they employ. It is about time that this House was treated to a more objective examination of precisely what are the realities of the profit levels of these very large companies in Australia. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition also did not treat us to a comparison of the level of tax collections that have occurred in Australia over the past few years. I would have thought that a person talking about which government has taken the most in taxation- and that is essentially what the Leader of the Opposition's matter of public importance is all about- would have had a look at a set of statistics called 'Personal Income Tax Collections'. Copies are readily obtainable. They are official statistics. They show personal income tax collections between 1968-69 and 1978-79, the current financial year. In 1971-72 there was an increase of 11.4 per cent over the previous year. In 1972-73, the last year of the LiberalCountry Party Government, there was an increase of 2.4 per cent over the previous year. In 1973-74 there was an increase of 20.1 per cent over the previous financial year. In 1 974-75 there was an increase of 19.9 per cent. In 1975-76 the increase was 3.5 per cent; in 1 976-77 it was 7.6 per cent; and in 1977-78 it was 0.5 per cent. In 1978-79, for the first time, it is projected that there will be a fall of 0.3 per cent in the real level of personal income tax collections in Australia. If that fall eventuates, and the evidence is that it will eventuate, it will be the first fall in the level of real income tax collections in this country over the past 10 years. I would have thought that to someone comparing personal taxation collections made by various governments in Australia those statistics would not have been a bad guide or a bad indication of what this Government has done about taxation. </para>
          <para>If the Opposition is not satisfied with that illustration, let us go to the most recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development figures, which show that Australia ranks seventeenth out of 23 countries in taxation collections as a percentage of gross domestic product. They show that on that basis taxation collections are 6 per cent less in Australia than in the United Kingdom and West Germany. They are almost the same in Australia as they are in the United States of America. Of course, they are of the order of 20 per cent less in Australia than they are in socialist, welfare-state-ridden Sweden. That gives a good idea of the comparative taxation performance of this country under this Government. This Government is happy at any time to debate its taxation records and taxation performance with the Opposition. Our record stands very fairly and squarely as evidence of this Government's philosophical commitment to smaller government. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-For the last quarter of an hour the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> has blustered and thundered away on the subject of taxation, but he has not given any assurance whatever to the Australian people about the charges that have been made in the Press and in this Parliament that this Government is considering once again breaking more promises. This Government has one unparalleled record. It has broken far more promises than any previous government, State or Federal in our history. Apparently it is about to break more promises. For a quarter of an hour of prime time in the Parliament, the Treasurer has refused to give an assurance or a guarantee to the Parliament or to the Australian people that this Government is not about to break further promises. Of course, those promises relate to the surcharge of 1.5c in the dollar which the Treasurer solemly assured the House in August last year would apply only for one year and the promise made by his predecessor in the 1977 Budget Speech that full taxation indexation would apply in the coming financial year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That is the issue that we have put to this Government. We have asked the Treasurer to give us that assurance and he has not given us that assurance. Indeed, he now leaves the House, having given us no comfort whatever about the Government's intention in this area. Quite clearly, what this Government intends to do is break its promises once again in this fundamental and important area of the tax burden which is imposed on the Australian people. This of course is not the first time that we have seen such an enormous breach of promise but it is probably the most blatant of all because it affects every Australian taxpayer. Every Australian taxpayer will now know that promises made to him in previous years will not be kept by this Government. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer made various allegations in the course of his speech. I will deal with a couple of them. He said that last year I advocated that we would need to have higher taxes. What he did not say was that I went on to point out what sorts of taxes should be imposed. What I said, of course, was that we needed to be looking at taxes- not the imposition of higher taxes on wage and salary earners, but on others who had the greater capacity to pay. I said that we should do more about tax avoidance and I will say more about that later. I talked about imposing taxes on the super profits of mining companies and imposing taxes on personal capital at a time when this Government is taking away such taxes. Those are the kinds of tax initiatives about which I was talking. I was not talking about increasing the tax burden on the Australian wage and salary earner. Somehow the Treasurer declined to mention that. The Treasurer said that the Fraser Government has done something about tax indexation. Of course it has done something about tax indexation- it has never introduced Full tax indexation. We had 90 per cent indexation in the first year, 80 per cent in the second year and 33'A per cent in the third year. But we have no guarantees at all about the future. </para>
          <para>Let us trace in a little more detail what has happened in the past. In 1975 and 1977 this Government gave assurances to the Australian people that a lower burden of tax would be imposed on them. This, particularly in 1977, was one of the major issues of the election. Every Australian taxpayer knows that in 1978 the Government introduced legislation to give effect to that promise and then broke that promise later with the imposition of the income tax surcharge. Of course what has happened in the period 1976-77 and 1978-79 is that, as a result of all the Government's efforts, the burden of tax has fallen much more heavily on the pay-as-you earn taxpayer, that is, the wage and salary earner, the person who does not have the chance for tax avoidance. If we look at the tax burden in the last two years- 1976-77 and 1978-79-we find that the total tax payments for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers have risen by 2 1 per cent, assuming that the Budget estimates for this year are somewhere near correct. The total tax payments of nonpayasyouearn taxpayers- these are people who are not wage and salary earners, but who derive incomes in other ways- are estimated to rise by 3 per cent. So that is 3 per cent against 2 1 per cent. Certainly there could be some explanation for this difference through a difference in the rate of increase in incomes. But I am very doubtful that there has been such a dramatically lower rate of increase in incomes for non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers as for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. Certainly a large part of the explanation must be the fact that non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers have been able to slough off the burden of tax by some smart device or other. Despite all this Treasurer's bluster about how much his Government has done in respect of tax avoidance, the reality is that this Government has a tremendous amount to make up in this whole area. Massive tax avoidance is still taking place. </para>
          <para>Recently it was reported in the Press that a confidential Treasury document had estimated the loss of income tax revenue through tax avoidance as $3,000m- a tremendous loss of revenue. It is because there is such a large loss of revenue and because this Government is faced with much higher Budget deficits than the Whitlam Government ever faced-over $9.5 billion in the last three years as against less than $6.5 billion under the Whitlam Government in its three years in office- that this Government finds itself in this embarrassing position. It is not prepared to take the action to close all the tax avoidance loopholes. It is putting the burden on the wage and salary earner by continually breaking its promises in respect of tax- promises which it made solemnly in 1977, which it broke soon after and which it will break even more in the near future. </para>
          <para>The effectiveness of the Government's action to prevent tax avoidance was described last year by one observer as like patching a diseased elephant with worn out bandaids. That of course is the reality. This Government has introduced various devices to block tax avoidance, but it has still left the larger amount of tax avoidance untouched. Indeed, the Government's own back benchers know that that is the case. Recently a good  Samaritan  delivered to me a document entitled 'The Economic Outlook and Its Implications for the 1979 Budget'. It was prepared by the Treasury back bench committee of the Government and was dated 29 March 1979. This document, prepared by Government back benchers, presumably some of whom are sitting in the chamber now, states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">However, the incidence of tax avoidance procedures is a joker in the pack. According to the Treasury, there is accumulating evidence that tax avoidance schemes are increasing rapidly, and that this will cause a significant revenue drain unless serious and urgent action is taken. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is what Government back benchers really think, despite the fact that the honourable member for Eden Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sainsbury)</inline> or some other Government member who will follow me in this debate might say that what I am saying is wrong. The fact is that what they say in their written document is that they are terribly worried about tax avoidance. Apparently they think the Treasurer is not doing enough to block off tax avoidance. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable member would grant me a 10-minute extension of time I would be happy to tell him. The Labor Party has given its response time and time again as to what should be done. Quite clearly, this Government is not prepared to take the necessary action to block this massive tax avoidance. It is simply going to advocate, as was done in this document, that there be an increase in the surcharge. This Government back bench committee recommended that the surcharge be 2c in the dollar instead of 1 <inline font-style="italic">Vic</inline> in the dollar, which applied in this current financial year, and that it be made permanent and not another temporary measure. They said that that would only cause them the embarrassment of having to break their promise again- a fairly realistic approach I should imagine. Therefore they said: 'Let us make it a permanent increase of 2c in the dollar'. So they know and recognise that their Treasurer is not doing enough about tax avoidance. But perhaps they do not want him to do enough because they do not recommend in their document that he do more. What they say is that we have to make up for the loss of revenue. Therefore they recommend this tax surcharge which it now appears highly likely that the Government will implement. This tax avoidance question is tremendously important and is a major factor which is relevant to all Australian taxpayers. All of us who pay tax on wages and salaries are going to pay more and more tax because those who are able to use tax avoidance devices are able to pay less and less. Yet the Treasurer boasts that his Government is the one that has done the greatest amount about stopping tax avoidance. The reality is that tax avoidance has become a mammoth problem only since the Fraser Government came to office. When the Whitlam Government and previous governments were in office there was always some level of tax avoidance. But it has become a much greater and a vaster problem since this Government has been in office. </para>

          <para>Let me quote from an article entitled 'The Tax Avoidance Merry-Go-Round' in the <inline font-style="italic">Chartered Accountant in Australia</inline> of December 1978. It was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pascoe,</inline> the  President  of the Taxation Institute of Australia. It states: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The past year or two' in an article dated December 1978-  tax avoidance became a big business in Australia. It became a disease which, being allowed to go unchecked, reached epidemic proportions. It is, perhaps, not going too far to say that the tax paying community of Australia almost went mad in its rush to become a party to a tax avoidance scheme. </para>
          <para class="block">So there we have it being said by a very authoritative person, the  President  of the Taxation Institute of Australia, that tax avoidance has become a major problem under this Government. Because this Government has been so ineffective or so undesirous of stopping tax avoidance, it is going to load more and more tax on the wage and salary earners of this country and make them carry the higher tax burden for this country. That is the reality. The fact is that this Government has also been involved in tax giveaways to high income earners. It has abolished estate and gift tax and the coal export levy. It has introduced the investment allowance and a stock valuation adjustment- </para>

            <para>- This discussion on taxation today is a matter of public importance because taxation is the fuel for the running of the government sector of the community. Governments are bound to organise this sector and to ensure that it operates as efficiently as possible in the interests of Australians. It is good to hear that the members of the Australian Labor Party want to debate taxation openly. As the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> has said, in any debate on taxation the Labor Party comes off pretty badly when one considers the way in which it went about its offices between 1972 and1975 and the way in which it would attempt to do so in the future especially if one is to believe some of the arguments that it is putting forward on taxes, such as the introduction of a capital gains tax. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is always much talk about broken promises no matter which party is in office. There is no doubt that at the present time the Opposition, which does not have positive policies, is using the allegation of broken promises on the part of this Government constantly to try to gain political capital. I notice from the results of the opinion polls on the popularity of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> that the Labor Party is not doing too badly at trying to con the Australian people into believing that this Government is a government of broken promises. Opposition supporters have said at various times that this Government has broken its promises on such important matters as Medibank, wage indexation, pensions and taxation. They have accused this Government of breaking promises on pretty well anything one could name. But when one looks at the facts, at what was said in the various election campaigns and the things that have been preserved, one sees that broken promises do not come too freely these days and that this present Government has a resolve to keep that very important promise that it made, namely, to put Australia in an economic position in which ordinary Australians can go about their normal work, make a profit, invest and have enough left over to spend on their children. </para>
          <para>What is the record of the Labor Party on tax avoidance- the subject under debate? What is the Labor Party's record on tax indexation and tax reforms? It is absolutely zero. On all of these things it has done nothing. However, the Hayden tax reforms had the effect of taxing many pensioners who had not previously been subject to tax. Those reforms taxed people who came to me at the end of 1 975-76 financial year and said ': We have not paid tax before. What is this? We have to fill in a tax return and we have to pay tax this year. It is only a few dollars but we are frightened about it. ' That is the record of the Opposition on taxation and that is the record that the Australian people need to remember. They also need to remember, despite the fact that so many pensioners came to Canberra a couple of weeks ago to complain about some of the things that had been done by this Government, that it was the government which removed taxation on low income earners that was imposed by the Opposition when it was in power. </para>
          <para>This Government promised that there would be smaller government. The figures brought forward a short while ago by the Treasurer have demonstrated that this Government has a very firm resolve in that area. I hope that, as the economy can afford it and as people are relatively better off through good management, we will have smaller and smaller government. I believe that is what the Australian people want. If one can believe what is written in the newspapers and broadcast by the media this morning, the Australian people want smaller government, they want less taxation and they want less money transferred out of their pockets to go to those people who are already well off or to Governments which will spend it unwisely through bureaucracies that have built up so grossly in recent years. </para>
          <para>This Government wants a lower tax regime. That is what we have created. Our first step was the one to stop the taxation gallop that was created under Labor- created, I must say, with due warning. Due warning was given in 1972 by the then Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> when he told the Australian people that he would use the inflationary aspects of taxationeverincreasing taxation because of inflation- in order to fuel his grandiose programs. So let us not kid ourselves about that. Our first step was to stop that galloping increase in taxation. Our first step was to introduce one of the very solemn promises of the 1975 election campaign, and that was tax indexation. That was introduced forthwith on 1 July 1976 and has operated ever since. Every working man in Australia who picks up his pay packet every week or month has known every year since 1 July 1 976 that he has more money to take home because of tax indexation. </para>
          <para>The second step which was able to be taken early last year involved the reformed tax scales. Those tax scales were tampered with unfortunately towards the end of last year because of the introduction of the tax surcharge but basically those scales remain. As I said, they removed the payment of taxation for many underprivileged people who, for the first time, had taxation imposed on them by a Labor government. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the effect of this Government's tax reforms through indexation and changes in the tax scales since 1975-76- since the Hayden Budget. I will give only one example although there are plenty of official statistics relating to people on all levels of income. Under the Hayden tax scales a man with a spouse receiving a wage of $ 1 80 a week would have paid $42.23 a week in tax. Under the coalition Government scales in 1976-77 this tax was reduced to $39.53. Following tax indexation on 1 July 1978, it was reduced to $36.99. It was further reduced under the new scales to $34.52 as from 1 February 1978. Since then the tax has gone up to about $36. Except for the tax surcharge there have been tax reductions because of the very firm policies of the present Government which promised lower taxation. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition has had much to say. Of course, he always has much to say but he used a good deal of mendacity- something that annoys the Australian people and certainly annoys me a good deal. He used statistics about taxes going up faster than incomes. He chose to misuse statistics. For instance, he chose to discount the fact that family allowances were introduced in a way that prevented taxation deductions being made. In other words, there was no net change for most people but there was a good net change for people on lower incomes. In another part of his speech the Leader of the Opposition implied that the Treasurer knew about consumer price index increases before the release of the information. That is a completely untrue statement. The Leader of the Opposition also talked about tax avoidance. What a record he had on tax avoidance when he was Treasurer. Absolutely nothing was done. The court case on the Curran scheme appeal was a matter of record as from 1973, well within the Whitlam era, but what was done about the Curran scheme by the present Opposition when it was in government? Absolutely nothing. </para>
          <para>What does the Opposition talk about now? It talks about a capital gains tax. Opposition members refer to it at every Question Time. They talk about it every day. I hope that the type of capital gains tax that the Labor Party wants to introduce, as is shown by its record, will be well known to the Australian people by the time of the next election. What is going to happen to pensioners under a capital gains tax? What is going to happen to the taxi driver or person on wages who has saved up and invested and, by his own efforts, has been able to buy a couple of flats? What is going to happen to people who own a block of land? What is going to happen to all the people in Australia who know that saving and investing is the only thing that will help them and their children in the future? </para>
          <para>It is well documented now that the Opposition wants a capital gains tax. It wants to hit the soft underbelly of the ordinary Australian who is prepared to save and invest his money. Opposition members can talk about all those other things they would like to do for the ordinary working man by way of his pay-as-you-earn taxation, but they have not done anything about them. That too is a matter of record. Now the Opposition is talking about substituting any increases in personal income tax with a capital gains tax. It is an insidious tax, one that under a Labor Government would not be indexed. The Labor Party when in government has never indexed any revenue-gaining scheme, and that also is a matter of record. The Labor Party, in raising the tax matter again and again in this House, is putting nails in its own coffin. At least the Government is willing to admit that it wants less tax whilst at the same time wanting less in government programs. For the Labor Party to do this is absolutely mendacious. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">The Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill 1979 will, together with the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 and the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1979, which have been introduced in, but have not yet passed the Senate, provide the statutory framework for fundamental reforms to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. These reforms were recommended by the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security constituted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope after a thorough and searching examination of the needs of the nation for a security service. That commission, I remind the House, was set up by the previous Government. In the very exhaustive consideration given to the Bill in the Senate, there was a large measure of consensus in relation to the Bill. Amendments moved by the Government took account of a number of Opposition proposals although the Government, after careful consideration, found that other proposals could not be accepted. Clearly, the national interest requires that a substantial bi-partisan approach should be taken to the legislation. </para>
          <para>The legislation was foreshadowed in the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to the House on 25 October 1977 when he outlined in broad terms the Government's decisions to implement reforms affecting the intelligence security agencies recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope. This legislation enacts these reforms and substantially follows the recommendations of the royal commission which are set out in the reports tabled on 25 October 1977. The legislative reforms themselves are so fundamental and wide ranging that a completely new Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill rather than amendment to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1956 has been drafted. The existing ASIO Act which the Prime Minister of the day, the then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies,</inline> introduced into this House 23 years ago, will be repealed. </para>
          <para>In so far as the recommendations of the royal commission have not required legislation they have already been substantially implemented. Thus, there have been substantial changes to ASIO since the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward on 9 March 1976 and particularly since the recommendations of the royal commission were accepted in 1977. The managerial structure and methods of the Organization have been reviewed and substantially improved. A series of management training courses has been conducted by an independent team of professional management consultants from private industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward has instituted a rigorous system of internal checks to ensure that the Organization's intelligence collection is geared as closely as possible to the assessed national security priorities and therefore that resources are most efficiently deployed. </para>
          <para>The Organization's financial control system is being put on a new footing with the assistance of professional advice from relevant government departments. The Organization produces regular assessments and reports on national security matters and participates with Government departments on a wide range of matters of national security interest. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will appreciate that there have been substantial changes to the overall management of the intelligence community following the Prime Minister's statement to the House of 5 May 1977 outlining new intelligence and security arrangements in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security. A key aspect of the new system is that the budget of the community is scrutinised by senior officials outside of the intelligence community. Funds sought must be justified with respect to priorities and requirements and care is taken to ensure that activities are coordinated and duplication avoided. Overseeing the functions of officials and constituting a final venue for review and decision is the Intelligence and Security Committee of Cabinet composed of key senior Ministers. This system therefore provides an external discipline to ASIO in regard to its overall efficiency. I can report to Parliament that this new system, recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope, has brought substantial improvements to the overall management of the intelligence community and has prompted a range of on-going reforms. In the most recent international crisis affecting Australia's neighbourhood, our intelligence was both timely and relevant and the assessments of our intelligence community accurate. </para>
          <para>I shall now discuss the terms of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope pointed out that the justification for the existence of a security organization in a democratic country should be reflected in its charter and, in particular, its functions as set out in that charter. He found that the proper fields of investigation by ASIO should be more clearly defined than in the present legislation and went on to indicate in detail what these should be. These recommendations by  His  Honour are reflected in the terms of clause 1 7 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill which states the functions of the Organization as: </para>
          <para>To obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security. </para>
          <para>For purposes relevant to security and not otherwise to communicate any such intelligence. </para>
          <para>To advise Ministers and authorities of the Commonwealth in respect of matters relating to security. </para>
          <para class="block">It should be noted that, in accordance with the recommendations of the royal commission, the definition of 'security' in the present Act has been expanded to include not only espionage, sabotage and subversion but also active measures of foreign intervention (meaning clandestine or deceptive action taken by a foreign power to promote the interests of that power) and terrorism. It should be noted that, while ASIO will be empowered to collect intelligence concerning these matters, criminal offences are not thereby created. ASIO is not a law enforcement agency. The provisions of clause 20 requiring the Director-General to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the work of the Organization is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the discharge of its functions and that the Organization is kept free from any influences not relevant to its functions, follow closely the significant recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope in that regard. Honourable members will recall that an important theme in the Royal Commission's report is that ASIO should at all times comply with the law. It has also been the concern of the present Director-General that ASIO should comply with the law but existing laws present problems for effective intelligence collection. This was recognised by the Royal Commission which concluded that the Organization required certain specified powers of intelligence collection and that the laws should be changed to this end. </para>
          <para>After careful consideration, the Government accepted this recommendation. Thus, Division 2 of Part III of the Bill provides for certain powers to be exercisable by ASIO subject to significant safeguards. At the same time ASIO will be prohibited from carrying on these activities except under warrants provided in the legislation. The additional powers thus provided for are, to enter premises to search for records, to use listening devices, to open and inspect postal articles. However, before such powers could be exercised in any particular case, there will need to be a request by the Director-General to the Minister who in turn must be satisfied as to the need for the action before granting a warrant. In the case of listening devices, the Director-General will be empowered in emergency circumstances to issue a warrant of very limited duration. </para>
          <para>Balancing this re-definition of the functions and powers of ASIO are a number of important considerations. First, recognising the key position of the Director-General and the need for a bi-partisan approach to the security of the nation, the Bill will require consultation with the Leader of the Opposition before appointment of the Director-General. Additionally, amendments moved by the Government in the Senate require consultation with the Leader of the Opposition before appointment of an acting Director-General- sub-clause 14 (2)- the Director-General to consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of keeping him informed on matters relating to security- clause 2 1 -and a copy of the annual report of the Director-General to be given to the Leader of the Opposition- clause 94. Further, in accordance with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope's recommendation, the provisions of the Bill relating to the Director-General, particularly as regards tenure of office and the grounds on which his appointment may be terminated, have been brought in line with provisions dealing with statutory office holders in other Commonwealth legislation. </para>
          <para>A further major consideration is the creation in Part IV of the Bill of a totally new statutory framework for the preparation and communication of ASIO security assessments in respect of individuals and the giving to most persons affected by prejudicial security assessments of a right of appeal to a tribunal presided over by a judge. The effect of this Part is that, where a security assessment has been made in respect of an employee of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth contractor or, broadly speaking, in respect of a person for the purposes of the Migration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 or the Passports Act 1938, that contains an opinion or information prejudicial to his interests, that person must ordinarily be given notice of the assessment. Further, the person will be given a right by this Bill to appeal to a tribunal to be presided over by a judge where the assessment will be reviewed. Commonwealth departments and other agencies will be required by the Bill to treat the findings of the tribunal as superseding the assessment. In determining the procedures to be followed by the tribunal, regard has had to be had to the special needs of security, particularly preservation of secrecy as to identity of informants. Thus, confrontation between the parties to the appeal is not possible but special provision is made to ensure that an appellant is not thereby prejudiced. </para>
          <para>An amendment to clause 39 moved by the Government in the Senate will make it clear that Commonwealth departments and authorities may not take administrative action to which the Bill applies on the basis of an adverse or qualified assessment made before the legislation comes into force. A new assessment will of course carry with it the rights as to notification and appeal provided in the Bill. Thus, in effect, the legislation will cause 'the slate to be wiped clean ' so far as past ASIO adverse or qualified assessments are concerned. A further amendment moved by the Government in the Senateinsertion of clause 40- will require the Organization to furnish assessments intended or likely to be used by a State for prescribed administrative action only through a Commonwealth department or authority, thus ensuring that the person concerned has the benefit of the rights as to notification and appeal provided in the Bill. </para>
          <para>The statutory procedures for notification of security assessments and for rights of appeal in large part implement the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope. They represent the first attempt, at least in a common law country, to provide a comprehensive statutory framework regulating the making of security assessments of individuals and providing a right of appeal to an independent judicial tribunal. They therefore represent one of the most important steps taken in this Parliament for many years directed to the protection of the rights of individuals. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will recall that the Royal Commission rightly gave much attention to what should be the relationship between the Director-General and the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope concluded that legal doubts as to the nature of this relationship that had arisen under the terms of the present Act should be removed and the relationship should be clearly defined. The Government has acted on this recommendation and clause 8 of the Bill defines this relationship, although on slightly different lines from those recommended by  His  Honour. Clearly, the Government must, in the ultimate, bear the responsibility for the security of the nation. It must also bear the responsibility for the general direction of the activities of the security organisation. At the same time it is proper that the Organisation should be under the control of the Director-General and that the Government should not be able to override the opinion of the Director-General on whether security requires or does not require the collection of information on an individual, whether information held concerning an individual should be communicated or on what advice should be given by the Director-General to a Minister or a department. Clause 8 of the Bill reflects these considerations. </para>
          <para>However, while we must seek to express in appropriate statutory form the proper relationship between the Government and the Director-General of Security, I must observe that the personal calibre of the holder of that difficult and lonely position will remain of the utmost importance. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, Australia is indeed fortunate in having an outstanding Director-General and I am sure that members of all parties share that view. He has set a standard for holders of that office that Governments must seek to match in future appointments. The relationship between ASIO and State governments and agencies raises important considerations. In accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission, the Bill provides for ASIO, subject to directions of the Minister, co-operating with departments, police forces and authorities of the States. Similar provision is made for cooperation with authorities of other countries but in such cases the Minister must approve the country as being capable of assisting the Organisation in the performance of its functions. </para>
          <para>The legislation that I am today introducing represents a balance between the needs of the nation for a strong, reliable and highly efficient security service and the need to preserve our individual rights and freedoms. Australia faces a number of serious threats to its internal security including persistent efforts on the part of hostile intelligence agencies to obtain intelligence from within Australia. This legislation will give ASIO a charter appropriate for the circumstances of today and the tasks it will be called on to perform. It will equip ASIO with the powers essential for those tasks and at the same time provide safeguards for the rights of individuals and the continuation of our democratic institutions. The national interest demands an approach above party politics to this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para class="block">That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">This Bill contains many amendments that were in the Navigation Bill 1975, which lapsed with the termination of the 29th Parliament. They were again in the Navigation Amendment Bill 1976, which lapsed also with the prorogation of Parliament on 28 February 1977. It also contains a number of other urgent, important measures. The amendments fall into groups for a number of important specific purposes and there are numerous other amendments mainly of a minor nature. Because of the complexity of the subject matter explanatory notes on the clauses are being circulated to honourable members. One particularly important aspect of the Bill is that it contains the legislation necessary for Australia to become a party to no fewer than five international maritime Conventions, four of which are Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation conventions. I shall deal briefly with each one. </para>
          <para>The first is the International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-going Ships 1957. This Convention came into force internationally in 1968, but the relevant law in Australia still consists of the Merchant Shipping Acts of 1894 and 1900 of the United Kingdom. One of the main practical effects of this group of amendments is to increase the amounts to which a shipowner will be able to limit his liability- unless he is held to be actually at fault himself- in respect of claims arising out of the specified occurences to which the Convention applies. The existing very low limits of about $28 a ton for personal claims and $15 a ton for property claims provided for in the Merchant Shipping Acts are to be increased to the equivalent of the Convention limits- about $179 and $57 a ton respectively at the present time. </para>
          <para>In giving effect to the 1957 Convention, Australia, like a number of the European shipping countries, will, at the request of the States, exercise the option provided for in the Protocol of Signatures to exclude the application of subparagraph ( 1 ) (c) of Article 1 of the Convention. This means that shipowners will not be able to limit their liability in respect of damage to harbour works, or for wreck removal. The Bill specifically approves ratification by Australia of the Convention, subject to a reservation making that exclusion. The new section 338, which absolves shipowners from liability in respect of certain property claims, does not introduce any new benefit for shipowners but is a re-enactment of an existing provision in Part VIII of the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act, which is being repealed to make way for the new limitation provisions. New section 59B, however, will prevent shipowners from limiting their liability for claims by crew members serving under Commonwealth articles of agreement. This was sought by the unions, and is also a practice followed by many maritime nations. </para>
          <para>The Bill will also enable Australia to accede to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972, which prescribes new 'rules of the road' for ships on the high seas and in all connected waters navigable by sea-going vessels. Those international regulations came into operation on 15 July 1977, and were incorporated in Commonwealth and State regulations and so are observed in practice. However, the Convention could not be acceded to because the Commonwealth and State Acts under which the regulations are made do not enable the regulations to be applied to all the vessels covered by the Convention. The new provisions rectify this aspect. </para>
          <para>The third Convention is the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1 974, known as the SOLAS Convention, which consolidates and supersedes the 1960 Convention of that name and the up-dating amendments made over the intervening years. 1'he 1974 Convention, which is the latest of several such Conventions that have been drawn up over the years since the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> disaster of 1912, lays down more advanced technical safety requirements. It deals with such matters as ship construction and stability, machinery and radio and other equipment, fire protection, detection and extinction, lifesaving appliances and carriage of cargoes of potential danger and requires surveys and inspections to ensure compliance with the standards laid down and the issue of international safety certificates to ships that comply. The Navigation Act already gives effect to the 1960 Convention, and so the Bill makes the necessary amendments to cover the further-improved requirements of the 1974 Convention and the amending 1978 Protocol. The Protocol was adopted at the Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention Conference convened by IMCO at the request of the United States last year following a number of serious pollution incidents off the United States coast. It introduces a number of additional measures into the Convention, aimed at greater tanker safety. Although neither the Convention nor the Protocol is yet in force internationally, it is the Government's wish that </para>
          <para class="block">Australia should become a party to these instruments as soon as possible and thus contribute to their early commencement. The Bill contains the necessary legislation to enable this to be done. </para>
          <para>The fourth Convention being dealt with by the Bill is the International Convention for Safe Containers which was adopted in 1972 and has entered into force internationally. This Convention lays down requirements for the structure, testing, inspection, approval and maintenance of new and existing containers used in international transport, excluding air transport. Under the Bill approval is given to ratification by Australia and the necessary provisions for that purpose are inserted in the Act. Additional structural safety requirements or tests may be prescribed to the extent permitted by the Convention. </para>
          <para>The other Convention concerned is the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships 1969, which aims at providing a universally acceptable system for the tonnage measurement of ships, by volume of interior spaces, in place of a number of other systems that each have their particular adherents. The main purposes of such measurement are to facilitate the levying of dues and charges and to enable ships to be compared for size by measurement of interior volume. All the present tonnage measurement formulae have disadvantages, particularly for roll-on roll-off and container ships, and these will be eliminated under the much simpler methods of the Convention, which has received almost enough support to put in operation the procedures for bringing it into force. The Convention is expressed to apply to ships on international voyages excluding ships less than 24 metres in length. For the first 12 years the Convention provisions are mandatory only for new ships and for existing ships that undergo substantial alterations. It will become mandatory for other ships at the end of that period. Whilst, therefore, the Bill contains the necessary provisions to enable ratification by, and application in, Australia, it also leaves the existing provisions to apply as long as they continue to be required. </para>
          <para>In the case of the first four of these conventions the Commonwealth has agreed that it would be appropriate to include saving clauses in the Bill to permit State legislation to apply the conventions within limits appropriate to State responsibilities. In this context I use the word 'State' to include the Northern Territory. The effect of these saving clauses will be that to the extent that a State chooses to legislate on these matters within the limits laid down, the Commonwealth law contained in the Bill will not apply. The scope provided for State law on these matters varies with each Convention and, broadly speaking, is as follows: For the Limitation Convention and the SOLAS Convention State law will be permitted in the case of 'intra-State ships,' that is ships not proceeding on interstate or overseas voyages; for the Prevention of Collisions Convention State law will be permitted in the case of all ships in the territorial sea and internal waters, that is, on the landward side of the 3 mile limit; and for the Containers Convention State law will be permitted in respect of containers in the State. These arrangements reflect the Government's policy of co-operative federalism and they are beneficial from the point of view of the Commonwealth as well as the States. From the Commonwealth viewpoint it is possible for Australia to become a party to the respective conventions once the Commonwealth legislation is enacted and without the need to await complementary legislation by the States. From the States' point of view the benefit of the arrangement is that their legislative powers are not eroded by an unrestricted exercise of the Commonwealth's external affairs power. </para>
          <para>Two important related sets of provisions that have been in the Act since its early days are being repealed and replaced under this Bill. I refer to the provisions dealing with the manning of ships and the qualifications of masters and other officers and of seamen. The new provisions have been arrived at after considerable consultation with the industry and the State marine authorities. </para>
          <para>The old inflexible manning provisions of the Act, designed for the shipping industry of half a century ago, have long been completely inappropriate. New section 14 is being substituted in place of the excessive detail now in the Act, with its precise but outmoded scales of officers and seamen in Schedules I and II. These provisions will enable the Minister to specify detailed requirements as to the minimum numbers and qualifications of officers and seamen to be carried in specified ships or classes of ships, to the extent that it appears necessary in the interests of safety or protection of the marine environment. The criteria to be applied in determining the minimum manning are to be set out in the regulations after further discussions with the industry. The new provisions have been arranged so that the changes can be implemented in two stages. Initially it will be possible to remove the application of the outmoded Schedules and other inflexible provisions, and then, following detailed discussions with the industry, to prescribe and bring into operation the minimum safety manning for ships when all aspects of the regulations have been satisfactorily resolved. Failure to carry officers and seamen as specified will be an offence for which the master and owner will both be liable to a fine of up to $1,000. A ship not carrying officers and seamen as required may be detained, or specified operations restricted, with a maximum penalty on both master and owner of $5,000 for non-compliance. </para>
          <para>Turning to the related area of qualifications, which includes training and examinations, here too the Bill repeals the old outmoded provisions. A new section 15 is substituted which provides broad enabling powers under which standards of competence to be attained and other conditions to be satisfied in order to be 'qualified' for the purposes of the Act will be specified by regulation or by order under the regulations. Amongst other things to be so prescribed will be detailed requirements in respect of instruction, training and the conduct of examinations and the issue of certificates of competency, the recognition of certificates issued by other countries, and the review by an appropriately constituted Administrative Appeals Tribunal of administrative decisions made under those regulations and orders. The power conferred by section 25 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act will be used to make regulations prescribing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in these matters. Under these provisions there will be a new structure for certificates of competency designed to meet modern shipping needs and derived from the uniform shipping laws adopted by State marine Ministers and myself in the Marine and Ports Council of Australia following consultation between my Department, State marine authorities and the maritime industry. These provisions of the code are based on international requirements developed through IMCO, which in July 1978 were embodied in an international convention, and will provide the basis for courses of study at the new Australian Maritime College. Certificates issued under the new provisions will be acceptable to the various Australian marine authorities. </para>
          <para>The Uniform Shipping Laws Code which I have mentioned extends to a wide range of matters besides qualifications and the Act contains powers to enable legal effect to be given to those other sections of the code. For some considerable time working groups of Commonwealth and State officials have been drawing up this code, which contains requirements for the survey and manning of commercial vessels to be uniformly adopted in order to overcome the present serious lack of uniformity between the requirements imposed by the various States and the Commonwealth. Under the Bill, therefore, it will be possible to put the code into practical effect. </para>
          <para>A further important feature of the Bill, because it will make a valuable contribution to safety of life and property at sea, is that it gives legal effect to the ship movement reporting scheme, known as AUSREP, that has been operating voluntarily for some time. The scheme ensures that positive action is taken to search for a ship in the Australian search and rescue area if more than 24 hours have elapsed since the ship last indicated that all was well. Also, if a ship is in distress, it enables the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre of the Department of Transport to know immediately what ships are in the area and which of these would be best suited to assist in the emergency. In addition to improved safety, the system achieves significant economies in the use of search and rescue resources by providing a datum on which to concentrate a search if a ship becomes overdue. </para>
          <para>As it appears that no such legislation exists anywhere else, Australia is the world leader in this important development. Information about the system aroused considerable interest in IMCO, and Australia proposed to IMCO that a uniform ship movement reporting system should be an integral part of any internationally agreed search and rescue plan. This led on to the recent International Conference on Maritime Search and Rescue held in Hamburg, at which the Australian delegation included two experts from my Department responsible for Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre and AUSREP operations. The conference adopted a new Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue providing for a global search and rescue plan incorporating systems such as AUSREP. </para>
          <para>The other subject involving a group of amendments is historic shipwrecks. The Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to declare particular shipwrecks and related relics of historic significance to be historic shipwrecks', thus bringing them under the protective provisions of the legislation. This requires some consequential amendments of the Navigation Act. </para>
          <para>The Historic Shipwrecks Act requires the finder to give notice of his discovery and does not prohibit salvage operations until the wreck is declared historic, when strict controls come into effect. The finder may acquire salvage rights under the Navigation Act, the United Kingdom </para>
          <para class="block">Merchant Shipping Acts, or at common law, before the wreck is declared historic. The Bill therefore provides that various provisions of the Navigation Act that deal with wreck and salvage matters do not apply to a wreck from the time it is declared historic and while it remains so. As salvage rights or liabilities under the Navigation Act acquired before a wreck is declared historic are to be preserved, the Bill also makes express provision for this purpose. There is provision to ensure that, for reasons of safety of life and navigation, the provisions of the Navigation Act giving the Minister powers regarding removal will still apply to any wreck, whether declared historic or not. The Minister is not to exercise any of those powers unless it is necessary to do so for purposes of safety or environmental emergency. Another provision ensures that his powers to deal with oil pollution threats arising from damaged ships continue unrestricted. The other amendments can best be classified as 'miscellaneous'. Many are of a purely drafting or machinery nature. </para>
          <para>One important amendment extends the references in the Act to the owner of a ship to include a reference to the operator, except in a few special circumstances. This is to ensure that where a duty or liability is imposed by the Act on the owner, responsibility for ensuring that that duty or liability is discharged is imposed on the person who is directly concerned with the relevant operations, for example, a bareboat charterer, as well as on the owner. Conversely, a benefit conferred on the owner will also, in appropriate cases, be available to the operator. Other amendments empower the Minister to make orders in relation to detailed technical requirements to be applied under the Act, so that such requirements can be quickly implemented, or varied without delay, in the light of ship casualties, equipment failure investigations, or technical developments. There are a number of amendments relating to the engagement and discharge of seamen and certain of the conditions of their employment, mainly to cater for modern developments in the industry. </para>
          <para>In addition to the prescribing of penalties at appropriate levels for newly created offences, the opportunity has been taken, where sections are otherwise amended, to update some maximum monetary penalties for existing offences against provisions of the Act and regulations and to increase some general penalties and make consequential adjustments. Other penalties will need to be brought into line later. As was the case with the 1976 Bill, this Bill does not purport to effect a general revision of the Navigation Act. The need for such a revision has been recognised for some time and it is the Government's intention to undertake such a task following the completion of discussions currently under way with the States and industry. Although not a general revision, the Bill now before honourable members provides the framework for a significant updating of Australia's navigation laws in accordance with the latest international standards of safety and environment protection. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

Under that Bill effect will be given to the 1974 Safety of Life at Sea Convention in place of the 1960 Convention of the same name and the definition of the Convention in the Navigation Act will be amended accordingly. Australia will become a party to the 1974 Convention. The Lighthouses Act refers to Australia's obligations under that 1960 Convention to establish and maintain marine navigational aids which will instead become obligations under the 1974 Convention when it enters into force for Australia. This Bill therefore amends the Lighthouses Act so that, in effect, the reference to the Convention under which those obligations exist will automatically mean the latest Safety of Life at Sea Convention to which Australia has become a party.

The amendment to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1977 will be the final adjustment as it makes provision for increases in the salary and wage content of 1978 recurrent programs to December 1978. The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1978 will be amended again in the Budget sittings of the Parliament to take account of further cost increases in accordance with the Government's announced policy. This Bill does not increase any of the non-government schools general recurrent and migrant education grants as the necessary adjust-, ments to these grants have been effected previously. To finalise 1978 grants, an additional appropriation of $ 1.6m will be necessary making a total allocation for that year of $639.6m. The adjustment of 1979 grants involves a further appropriation of $ 1 1 m which increases the commitment of the Commonwealth for this year to $673.6m. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill amends the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1977 and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1978. The Bill adjusts the approved programs of grants to the States for tertiary education for the years 1978 and 1979 by providing additional amounts in the light of variations in costs between June and December 1978. In addition to supplementing the grants for 1979 in respect of approved advanced education level courses in Technical and Further Education institutions, the Bill provides a further $485,000 for these courses. It also modifies the conditions relating to the provision of funds for special initiatives in the training of TAFE teachers in order that State instrumentalities as well as colleges of advanced education may become eligible to receive grants. </para>
          <para>In his statement to the Senate on 19 October 1978, the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> noted that a shortfall in expenditure of the 1978 tertiary education capital programs would enable additional university and college of advanced education capital projects to commence in the second half of 1 979. This Bill makes provision for expenditure of up to $4.1m on the additional projects in respect of 1979, including $1,288,000 for commencement of the Australian Graduate School of Management building. With the additional amounts that the Bill provides in respect of 1978 and 1979, the total programs of grants to the States for each sector are as follows: </para>
          <para>In accordance with the Government's decision to restore fixed triennial funding for recurrent expenditure the Bill also provides recurrent grants for colleges of advanced education in respect of the years 1980 and 1981 at the same real level as for 1 979, and supplements the recurrent grants to universities, for these years, which were provided previously in the principal Act. The total provisions for recurrent expenditure, other than for equipment, for universities and colleges of advanced education are $6 15.8m and $422.2m respectively for each of the years 1980 and 1 98 1 . It is expected that arrangements for recurrent grants for technical and further education in respect of 1980 and 1981 will be announced during the Budget sittings after the Government has considered the report of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training. In accordance with the new arrangements for funding non-government business colleges, announced by the Minister for Education on 6 December 1978, the Bill makes provisions for grants to the States for assistance to non-government business colleges in the 1979-81 triennium. The proposed level of assistance, $55 per student per month at December quarter 1978 cost levels up to a maximum of $550 per student per annum, is the rate which was recommended by the Tertiary Education Commission in its report on non-government business colleges. It will be adjusted to take account of cost increases. </para>
          <para>Assistance in 1979 is being provided in respect of courses which were in existence in 1978 and met the guidelines recommended by the Tertiary Education Commission. Colleges will be required to achieve non-profit status by the end of 1979. In approving courses beyond 1979, the Minister for Education will be advised by a small standing committee. Assistance in general is to be restricted to courses involving more than 20 hours of teacher-class contact a week and of more than 20 but no more than 44 weeks duration. This would not include courses leading to registrable academic awards. Assistance will not be provided for courses in colleges which have not been recognised by a relevant State regulatory authority. The provisions will provide assistance on an equitable basis in an important area of training. However, the Government is opposed to the proliferation of small business colleges, and to any development of business colleges annexes by non-government secondary schools. The approval of individual courses is to be reviewed after three years and the overall scheme of assistance is to be reviewed after it has been in operation for five years. I commend this Bill to the House. </para>

        <para class="block">The Customs Tariffproposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The Proposals implement the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in respect of injection moulding machines, which formed part of its report on miscellaneous industrial machinery. The Commission recommended that these goods be dutiable at 15 per cent and the industry receive special transitional assistance by means of a phasing bounty. The Government has accepted the recommendations and consequently the rate of duty on certain injection moulding machines will be reduced to 15 per cent from tomorrow. I will be introducing the necessary bounty legislation into the House as soon as possible, also operating from tomorrow. </para>
        <para>The effect of these measures will be to replace the assistance previously provided to the industry by means of a 55 per cent customs duty with a customs duty of 15 per cent supplemented by a bounty which will be phased out over a period of five years. The Industries Assistance Commission stated that the corresponding effective rate of the existing duty is very high and that it could not identify benefits to the community commensurate with such high levels of assistance. The Commission considered that a reduction would encourage more efficient use of resources in the production of goods under reference and reduce costs to user industries. A summary of the tariff changes contained in the Proposals has been prepared and is now being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. </para>

            <para>- Nowhere is the attitude of the Government towards the wage and salary earners of this country more epitomised that in the legislation now before the House- the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill 1979. The Bill is certainly not accurately termed when one talks about retirement. As I say, it epitomises the very evil attitude that this Government has towards not only all wage and salary earners of this country but also specifically its own employees, this Government being the largest employer in Australia. The Opposition does not for one moment concede that provision should be made to allow a government maintaining attitudes such as those held by this Government to have the power to dismiss, to sack, to retrench employees of the Commonwealth Public Service at its whim. For <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> years we have had displayed to us this Government's attitude towards wage and salary earners. It is coarse and unacceptable both to the Opposition and to the people involved. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I draw attention to correspondence dated 25 November 1977 from Malcolm 'say anything at election time' Fraser to the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations outlining his attitude on a wide variety of issues concerning the future of Commonwealth public servants. On the question of employment levels and job security, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It has been our express policy to avoid retrenchments and this will continue. </para>
            <para>Overall staffing levels will be determined in the light of need. Although there may be both increases and decreases in particular areas of administration as work loads vary, the  intitial  process of streamlining has now been substantially completed and in general there will be stability in the service. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">When this Prime Minister goes to an election, he is capable of saying anything to anybody in the hope that he will survive as Prime Minister of this country. The Commonwealth public servants are now feeling the thrust of this Government's motivations, as did the pensioners with the Government's broken promise to index pensions twice-yearly. The Government's promise to the pensioners was broken last year; this promise to the public servants is being broken this year. </para>
          <para>Continually we hear spokesmen from the Government say that these measures are being initiated by the Government after consultation with peak union councils involved. This Government does not believe in consultation with peak councils. Any consultation with the peak councils concerned with the employees who will be affected by this measure would certainly have told the Government that the course it had embarked on by way of this legislation was totally unacceptable to all those people who would be affected by it. The Government cannot stand on its record after having said that the Commonwealth public servant is safe from the politicisation of the Public Service by this Government, or safe in his job, or safe from the pressures that the Government can bring to bear on employees in the Commonwealth Public Service but not on people in the private sector. In the 3V4 years that this Government has been in power, we have seen thousands of jobs closed off in the Commonwealth Public Service. We have seen a breakdown in the service that the Commonwealth is supposed to give the community. The community is now receiving the worst service, by virtue of this Government's imposition of staff ceilings, that it has received from any government of this country. This Government is on record as having broken promise after promise. </para>
          <para>Let me reiterate so that everybody in this country understands that Malcolm Fraser, the Prime Minister of this country, will say anything to anybody at election time. But half way through his term, as we are now, and as far away from the last election as he is from the next election, he is about to break another promise to the people who work for this Government. We have received notification after notification of the attitude of the unions that represent Commonwealth employees. Could anybody have imagined that in this country, with all the terms already being used such as 'receiving the sack', 'being retrenched', 'being put off'- all the terms that are recognised in industrial relations- this </para>
          <para class="block">Government would come up with the new term management initiated retirement'. Fancy telling somebody of 30 years of age that the management has taken the initiative to retire him. He can go home to his family and say: 'I haven't been sacked; the Commonwealth just used its initiative to retire me, 35 years before I was due to retire'. </para>
          <para>Inherent in this Bill is a long sought after condition of employment by the Commonwealth Public Service and that is optional early retirement for some over 55 years of age. But the Government cannot even introduce that as a measure of goodwill, as a measure of understanding, as a measure of good industrial relations towards its own employees. The Government says to the Commonwealth Public Service, Here is something really decent that a government ought to do for you, something which everybody in this land supports and we are going to see a lot more of it', but it cannot do it without bringing in the good hammer. At least the Commonwealth public servants have had the common sense to say: 'We are not accepting one decent provision of this Bill because we realise that at the same time an axe is hanging over the head of everybody who works in the Commonwealth Public Service through the various clauses of this Bill which give the Government the power to ascribe any reason at all to a dismissal.' The Opposition does not accept and it will not accept that proposition. As I have said, we have been notified time and time again by the peak councils of their attitude. As late as today we have been notified by CAGEO of its attitude. The Government cannot say that it has consulted with the peak councils in relation to this issue because time and time again the peak councils have made their attitude clear. The Government is acting in complete contradiction of both what the unions have said and what the members will accept. The following resolution was carried at the CAGEO conference held last week: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Conference notes policy determined at 1977 Conference that CAGEO vigorously and totally oppose legislation in any form which incorporates management initiated retirement provisions: </para>
            <para>Calls upon the Federal Executive to actively implement such policy in opposing the CE ( RR) Bill: </para>
            <para>Declares that the CE (RR) Bill is offensive to merit based career service employment and to CAGEO in <inline font-style="italic">numerous</inline> other respects: </para>
            <para>Requires that the full support of CAGEO and its affiliates including if necessary collective industrial action be given to protect the interests or affiliated members who conscientiously refuse to co-operate in the administration of any Act which results from the CE ( RR) Bill in its current substance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So if the Government is suggesting that it has consulted with the peak councils, representing the thousands of people who work for the Commonwealth Public Service, that consultation must have been one way traffic. The Government must have said: 'Well, you can accept this or there will be no provision for early retirement or there will be no introduction of any legislation at all'. I have said that the Commonwealth Public Service is looking at this Government on its merits. The fact is that there are approximately 15,000 fewer jobs now in the Commonwealth Public Service than there were three years ago. </para>

              <para>-The idiot son of the establishment in Victoria, the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baillieu),</inline> says 'Hear, hear! ' because he does not believe in full employment. He wants the kids to be unemployed. He wants them to be lying around the streets, involved in all the crime that is going on. He is so stupid that he did not even read the article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> about what is happening to the unemployed youth of this country. The people on this side of the House say that jobs have to be provided. This Government and government instrumentalities are providing 25 per cent of the work force. It has decreed that the Public Service has to be efficient and its functions carried out correctly, but that cannot be achieved the way in which this Government is attempting to achieve it. Firstly, it cannot be done by bludgeoning and using any reason for the dismissal of Commonwealth public servants. Secondly, it cannot be done through the mad, crazy staff ceilings which have been plucked out of the air. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There is well documented evidence in the Public Service annual report, the Coombs Royal Commission and for many other speakers of substance on the matter that the ceilings initiated by this Government are not working. The only thing that is occurring as a result of ceilings in the Commonwealth Public Service is that the people of Australia are getting worse service. People who are dependent on social security are not being given the service that they require from the Government because the Government has initiated ceilings which do not allow public servants to carry out their duties to the people of this country. If the unemployed, the pensioners and all the people who are completely dependent on this Government for assistance want to be critical of the service they are getting they should not blame the public servant, they should blame the Government which is taking the action to restrict the public servant in carrying out his duties. </para>
          <para>This Bill demonstrates the confusion and bloody mindedness of present Government policies in relation to the administration of the Public Service. This is the second occasion on which this Bill has been before the House. Even at the second try the Government cannot get it right. Superficially, as I have said, the Bill demonstrates a worthwhile concern with the achievement of economy and efficiency in government administration. The Government has already been given a blueprint for necessary reforms in this area by the Coombs Commission- a blueprint it has chosen to ignore. The present legislation is badly drafted, inconsistent in places and illogical. Although it incorporates some improvement in conditions of employment long sought by Public Service employees, it also attempts to wield the big stick. Voluntary early retirement is the sweetener while the threat of wholesale redundancies or, to use plain English, mass sackings, is introduced under the guise of management initiated retirement and greater efficiency and economy in the Public Service. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party is committed to economy and efficiency in the Public Service. As I said, when in government it set up the Coombs Royal Commission to look at the proper and efficient management of the Public Service. It was the first and only comprehensive review of Australian Government administration in over 50 years. The Coombs Commission produced a comprehensive list of recommendations concerning efficiency and economy in the service. ALP policy supports these recommendations. It is absolutely imperative to install checks and balances that compel greater efficiency in public administration. This Government's record in the area of public administration is nothing short of gross negligence and complete incompetence. Putting aside the provisions of this Bill, an examination of its record of personnel management over the past <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> years reveals staggering false economies. I ask honourable members to consider the case of the employment officer in the Commonwealth Employment Service who was not allowed to notify unemployed workers of job vacancies by telegram because this miserable Government fails to appropriate enough money to ensure the efficient operation of a modern employment service. I want to quote from a minute from the former Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. The reference on the minute is 66/3608. It indicates the way in which the Government views efficiency in the Commonwealth Public Service. The subject matter of the minute is the use of telegrams by the CES. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We have been advised that there is a funding difficulty of considerable magnitude in regard to the CES Postal Vote on a National level and unless expenditure is curtailed immediately, funds will very quickly be fully spent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The minute then lays down the conditions under which people are to scrutinise the sending of telegrams. There are some interesting points in the CES document, dictated by the Government. It states: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="1.">
              <para>Restrict the use of telegrams to applicants registered at the vacancy office. Other OCES should display the vacancy only, but should not match unless asked to do so by the vacancy office. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="2.">
              <para>Use a ratio of two or three telegrams as a maximum for any one vacancy. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="3.">
              <para>Ensure that each applicant without a telephone is asked for the telephone number of a neighbour or friend. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">In order to save money by not sending a telegram to the person seeking employment this Government says: 'Let us use the whole community. If there is a telephone a couple of blocks away it is much cheaper to interfere with the private lives of the people who live down the street. They can take the telephone call from the CES office rather than the applicant being notified by the CES'. This is just another way in which this Government expresses efficiency in the mad dog fashion which has ensued in the last three years. </para>

              <para>- I might even do that. During the five days I was away from Australia I had discussions with Presidents Marcos and Suharto, and Prime Minister Ohira of Japan, and addressed the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development meeting in Manila. This series of discussions was held against the background of significant changes in the international strategic situation. There is continuing instability in Africa and parts of the Middle East. Developments in Iran continue to generate anxiety regarding oil supplies and about the security of the north-west Indian Ocean area. In Korea, new assessments of the north's military strength have placed this at a significantly higher level than had previously been estimated, and concern over security in the Korean Peninsula has led to adoption of a longer time scale for United States ground troop withdrawals from the Republic of Korea. Hostilities continue in Indo-China as Vietnam attempts to consolidate its position in Kampuchea. The tensions which led to fighting between China and Vietnam are -still in evidence. A resurgence of fighting would lead to the danger of wider international involvement. In this international environment my discussions with  President  Marcos and  President  Suharto made clear our common recognition that broadly based cooperation between Australia, the Philippines and Indonesia- and between Australia and the other members of the Association of South East Asian Nations- has become all the more important. We recognise our responsibility to press for moderation and conciliation in the conduct of international affairs. The movement toward greater cohesion among ASEAN countries is of particular importance to Australia's interests. It provides mutual support, promotes co-operation, strengthens confidence and assists forces for stable development. Accordingly, Australia seeks to strengthen our links with the ASEAN countries. </para>

          <para>My talks with  President  Marcos made manifest that Australia and the Philippines, as members of the same region with similar interests and attitudes, have a joint desire and determination to work together to respond effectively to the strains and tensions in the international situation. We both welcomed the normalisation of relations between Peking and Washington. It will assist the development of a more effective United States policy in the Pacific and Asia, which had been hampered by the absence of formal recognition. Normalisation, and the conclusion of the friendship treaty between China and Japan, creates new opportunities for these countries to play a positive and constructive role in the Asia-Pacific region. We expressed the hope that the Soviet Union would make a similar constructive contribution to the peaceful development of the region- a contribution which would be of particular importance because there are areas in which the Soviet Union is not without influence. Australia welcomes the conclusion of agreements between the Philippines and the United States on military bases. These agreements are of major importance to the strategic balance in the western Pacific. By concluding them the Philippines has made a major contribution to the stability and security of that region. </para>
          <para>Against the background of a potential world energy shortage the Philippine and Australian governments will co-operate on energy matters. A bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement has recently been concluded, opening the way for negotiations for the supply of Australian uranium to the Philippines. In an exchange of letters between  President  Marcos and myself, Australia has undertaken to be a reliable and reasonable supplier of energy to the Philippines and to give technical and other assistance to help the Philippines develop its own energy potential, including uranium exploration. With respect to other aid programs, it is noteworthy that Australia's two largest current aid projects are in the Philippines. The growing co-operation between Australia and the Philippines is further reflected in the signature of a double taxation agreement and the ratification of the trade agreement between Australia and the Philippines that had for some time, indeed for several years, been put aside. The ratification of this agreement comes at a time when trade with the Philippines has been growing faster than our trade overall, with Philippine exports to Australia growing at more than 45 per cent a year. The joint commission, which will be established under the terms of the agreement, will pursue means of futhering our bilateral trade and investment.  President  Marcos warmly welcomed Australia's strong support for ASEAN and the arrangements which Australia is making to assist the Philippines as a member of ASEAN to take up market opportunities for exports to this country. </para>
          <para>The Philippines and Australia have many common concerns and common interests, a common perception of the challenges that confront us and that we can work together to surmount. The recent visit to the Philippines, at President Marcos 's invitation, resulted in the consolidation of a strong and constructive relationship between our two countries. The joint communique issued at the conclusion of the visit reflects the range of matters we discussed, and something of the spirit of the meeting. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a copy of the joint communique. </para>

			<para>President Marcos and Prime Minister Fraser Manila, 11 May 1979</para>
			<para>At the invitation of His Excellency President Ferdinand E. Marcos, the Prime Minister of Australia, the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, made an official visit to the Republic of the Philippines from 8 to II May 1979. </para>
			<para>During the visit the  President  and the Prime Minister held extensive discussions on a wide range of subjects of mutual interest. The talks were held in a very cordial and friendly atmosphere, reflecting the important and expanding relationship between the Philippines and Australia. </para>
			<para>Discussion covered three broad areas: regional and world stability; the international economic situation; and the bilateral relationship between the Philippines and Australia. </para>
			<para>The  President  and the Prime Minister agreed that some aspects of the international situation caused considerable concern, with areas of instability affecting parts of Africa, the Middle East and Indo-China. In addition, they noted that international economic difficulties added significantly to world tensions. </para>
			<para>In such circumstances, Australia and the countries of the ASEAN region had a strong mutual interest in working closely together to prevent such tensions from impeding the peaceful progress and development of the region. </para>
			<para>The  President  and the Prime Minister noted the recent normalisation of relations between China and the United States and the conclusion of the Friendship Treaty between China and Japan, and agreed that these events created new opportunities for these countries to play a positive and constructive role in the Asia/Pacific region. They expressed the hope that the Soviet Union would make a similar constructive contribution. </para>
			<para>The two leaders expressed serious concern about the situation in Indo-China and called for a settlement of differences among the parties concerned. They agreed that disputes should be settled by peaceful means, and without resort to the use of force. </para>
			<para>The  President  and the Prime Minister referred to the critical importance of the Sth Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, currently being held in Manila. They agreed that its location and timing made the present conference especially important. The immediately preceding period had been one of reduced growth of world trade caused by inflation and leading to the spread of unemployment and the dangerous increase of protectionism. </para>
			<para>The two leaders recalled the part they and their governments have played to date in bringing about an agreement on the basic elements of a Common Fund, and welcomed the prospects it brings for greater stability in commodity prices at levels which are remunerative to producers and equitable to consumers. They expressed the firm conviction that the Fund should be established as soon as possible. </para>
			<para>The also called, in particular, upon producers and consumers to proceed to negotiate expeditiously appropriate international commodity agreements and arrangements under the Integrated Programme for Commodities of which the Common Fund was a key instrument. </para>
			<para>The  President  and the Prime Minister agreed further that there was a need to look to the future and to improve on the results of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. It was of critical importance to achieve significant reductions in barriers to world trade. In this context, they noted that high rates of inflation were a significant element in the slower growth in volume of international trade and in market opportunities for all countries, especially developing ones. They therefore called upon countries, and in particular the major industralised ones, to pursue policies to bring inflation under control. </para>
			<para>The  President  and the Prime Minister were pleased with the contribution that had been made by ASEAN to political stability and the economic and social development of the region. The Prime Minister emphasized Australia's strong commitment to South-East Asia and the whole-hearted support for ASEAN, which he referred to as an excellent example of the strength and stability which could be achieved through regional co-operation. It was a basic element of Australia's policy to work closely and cooperatively with ASEAN in all matters. </para>
			<para>The two leaders discussed the new Australian low air fare scheme and, in this connection, they welcomed the progress made in the discussions at the recent meeting of Australian and ASEAN officials in Kuala Lumpur, including the agreement to recommend to ASEAN and Australian Ministers a settlement on a package basis. </para>
			<para>The  President  and the Prime Minister agreed to start discussions on arrangements covering routes between Australia, the Philippines and countries to the north. </para>
			<para>The  President  and the Prime Minister reviewed the full range of the bilateral relationship between the Philippines and Australia and were able to settle a number of issues, thus clearing the way for the fuller development of the existing network of bilateral agreements. </para>
			<para>Referring to the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement which has just been concluded, the two leaders agreed that this would be the basis for subsequent arrangements for the supply of uranium from Australia to the Philippines. </para>
			<para>The  President  and the Prime Minister noted that while the value of trade between the two countries has increased considerably, there remains a significant balance in Australia's favour. In this context, they noted and the  President  welcomed the arrangements that the Australian Government was making to increase market opportunities for exports to Australia from the Philippines and other ASEAN countries. </para>
			<para>The two leaders welcomed the exchange of letters of ratification which' they had authorized to bring into force the trade agreement between Australia and the Philippines and agreed that this was a significant development. </para>
			<para>The Prime Minister and the  President  further welcomed the signing of a double taxation agreement between the two countries which would help promote greater economic co-operation. </para>
			<para>These various agreements, together with the accompanying strengthening of the political relationship, reflected the growing warmth and co-operation between the Philippines and Australia. </para>
			<para>The two leaders recognised the considerable prospects for the substantial growth in tourism between Australia and the Philippines and agreed to consider early measures to realise this potential. </para>
			<para>The  President  welcomed the continuing commitment of the Australian Government to the economic development of the Philippines through its various aid programs, and the Prime Minister confirmed that the Australian Government expected to maintain its aid allocations to the Philippines. </para>
			<para>The Prime Minister said that the Australian Government had studied a recent Philippines request for assistance in the development of its energy capability, and confirmed that Australia would provide such assistance. The  President  welcomed the Prime Minister's assurance that Australia intended to be a reliable and reasonable supplier of energy sources to the Philippines. </para>
			<para>The Prime Minister expressed his pleasure and deep gratitude to the  President  and Government of the Republic of the Philippines for their invitation to him to visit Manila, and for the excellent arrangements and gracious hospitality that had been offered to his party. The  President  accepted an invitation by the Prime Minister to visit Australia at a mutually convenient time. </para>

		  <para>As honourable members will know, UNCTAD V is meeting in Manila throughout this month. It is a meeting of enormous importance. It comes at a significant time, towards the end of the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and before the Tokyo economic summit. It comes at the end of a period of some real progress on the North-South Dialogue, particularly on the Common Fund. Over the last five years, both developed and developing countries have come to accept the necessity for compromise- for movement from the rigid positions they adopted in the past. In this process, Australia has sought to set an example and has worked to build consensus. This is reflected in Australia's work to advance the Common Fund, which has long been a policy of this Government. At one stage, both developed and developing countries took the position that the other side had to move first. Australia's view was that, if such rigid stances were maintained, there would never be agreement, and that Australia, in the interests of progress, should take some initiative. </para>
          <para>At the 1977 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London, Prime Minister Manley of Jamaica and I took the lead in establishing a Commonwealth technical group to define the realistic possibilities for a Common Fund, and how this could relate to an integrated program for commodities. A negotiating conference on the Common Fund was held in November 1 977. Its results were disappointing. The outcome was a virtual deadlock which held out the prospect of continuing frustration of growing conflict between developed and developing countries. To aid in avoiding this outcome, at the Sydney Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in February 1978, Australia took a new and positive position on the Common Fund. It was an advance of the position hitherto taken by the B group countries. In April 1978, my colleague, the Minister for Special Trade Representations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland)</inline> represented Australia at a Commonwealth ministerial meeting, called to discuss the report of the technical group established at the London Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. This ministerial meeting contributed significantly to a greater flexibility in the positions of the developed and developing country participants. And, before the November 1978 Common Fund Negotiating Conference, Australia circulated a paper setting out a suggested model on fundamental aspects of the Fund, with the aim of encouraging an accommodation between the two sides. Much of what Australia put forward was adopted by the Conference. </para>
          <para>In addition to Australia's actions in international forums, the Foreign Minister and I were active in discussions with the United States Secretary of State, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD, and with many others, in advancing the idea that countries must be prepared to move if the Common Fund is to become a reality. The discussion at the December 1978 Heads of Government Meeting in Jamaica was instrumental in helping to reinforce developed countries' support for the Common Fund. The most recent Common Fund negotiating conference, in March of this year agreed at long last on the fundamental elements of a Common Fund- a position that, 18 months ago, few would have thought possible. Australia made an important contribution to that, but there is much work to be done before the Common Fund becomes a reality. UNCTAD must build on the gains that have been made. At UNCTAD I announced the Government's decision to contribute to the first window of the Common Fund, which will finance buffer stocks of international commodity agreements. Further negotiation is needed to define the formula for contributions to the first window. Australia will also make an effective contribution to the fund 's second window, which will finance other measures for the stabilisation of commodity prices, such as adequate research and effective promotion. It will also be important for commodities where it is not appropriate to establish a commodity agreement based on buffer stocking, for example, a perishable commodity. </para>
          <para>Our support for a second window is firmly based in our own history and experience. We know from experience that such supports as research and promotion can be crucial to the success of a commodity agreement. Australia believes that with respect to the second window, although contributions are to be voluntary, it too needs a formula approach which would give more stability in financing and would do much to guarantee its success. Australia will continue to be involved fully in the further negotiation within UNCTAD, on the Common Fund. We know from our own experience, from earlier days when the Australian economy was very much dependent upon the profitability of two or three major primary commodities, how changes in the fortunes of those commodities could significantly affect Australia's development and economic well-being. If that were true of Australia in years past, it is much more true of other countries that might depend solely on one or two commodities for their export earnings. </para>
          <para>If the Common Fund is to work there needs to be international commodity agreements for certain commodities. Unfortunately there has been little progress so far in negotiating commodity agreements involving both producers and consumers and consistent with the policies of the Common Fund. Although some progress is being made in relation to rubber, the International Sugar Agreement is in jeopardy because of the attitude of the European Economic Community, while the United States Administration is experiencing great difficulty in having the agreement ratified by the United States Congress. Further, some aspects of existing agreements would need to be renegotiated to make them acceptable. </para>
          <para>Developed countries must join, and agree to participate financially, in all viable commodity arrangements where they have a major interest in the trade, otherwise it will be difficult to see their agreement to the establishment of the Common Fund as other than an empty and rather cynical gesture. The effective translation of the commitment to a Common Fund into a reality will contribute to the well-being of developing and developed nations by contributing to greater stability in trade and commodities, but alone this is not enough. The dangers of inflation and increased protectionism represent major problems to both the developed and developing nations. </para>
          <para>Inflation undermines both confidence in governments and the confidence of governments. It causes unemployment by reducing profitability and increasing uncertainty. With inflation, costs rise, industries are priced out of markets, firms invest less and employ less- creating a national and international unemployment problem. Inflation leads to disorderly exchange rate conditions and increases pressure for forms of intervention which inhibit market forces in general and world trade in particular. </para>
          <para>We cannot overlook the conjunction between the increased rates of inflation since 1973 and the fact that the volume of world trade grew at only 4 per cent a year between 1973 and 1978, compared with 8 per cent over the previous 20 years. Therein lies a great deal of the current world economic problems. In Europe in particular, new protectionist devices have been created in recent years. Export subsidies and wage and agricultural subsidies in the EEC run as high as $25 billion each year. These are just as protectionist as tariffs, quotas or 'voluntary restraint' arrangements, which are hardly ever voluntary in their negotiation. They deny markets to developing countries and cause unfair competition for developing countries' products in third markets. </para>
          <para>Countries must move to adopt the positive adjustment policies advocated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and allow market forces to work. As my discussions with the Secretary-General of the OECD, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Van</inline> Lennep, in Manila, made clear, the OECD's view is that interventionist policies by government have the effect of locking labour and capital into particular industries. The removal or reduction of such policies would significantly enhance the prospects for growth in the international economy and international trade. It is worth noting that perhaps because of the name 'positive adjustment policies' there are not a few around the world who have totally misconceived the nature and thrust of the policies in fact advocated by the OECD and the Secretary-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Van</inline> Lennep. </para>
          <para>The Tokyo round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations has put some brake on the increasing move to protectionism, and that may be its greatest success. But although there are individual negotiations within, the round will be of significant benefit to Australia, and many of our exporters will have better assurance of market access than ever before in their history. In the world wide scene, the gains are modest and the impact of the negotiations is certainly not revolutionary. There has been some progress in the reduction of industrial tariffs but little has been done in relation to non-tariff barriers, particularly in relation to agriculture. Virtually nothing has been done in relation to wage subsidies and export subsidies. Against this background the world must look beyond the MTN and ensure the continuation of efforts to liberalise trade. </para>
          <para>A lapse into protectionism would deny the basic truth that the success of the existing system, a system which has allowed enormous progress to be made in the fairly recent past, depends essentially on the growth of mutual trade, and on maintaining the conditions which allow and encourage that growth. Nothing would lead to greater bitterness and greater disillusionment among developing nations and would do more to strengthen the case of those who argue for extreme policies than the systematic frustration of access to developed country markets. If the reward for success is to be punishment by means of new protectionist devices, by selective safeguards perhaps to be sanctioned at the MTN, it will demonstrate that the economic principles by which the developed countries have professed to live apply only to those which have already arrived and not those which are on their way. The major developed countries carry a great burden of responsibility. Their management or mismanagement of their own economies has decisive effects on the international system. </para>
          <para>Australia has proposed that UNCTAD should call on these countries when they meet at the economic summit in Tokyo to adopt policies that will bring inflation under control and to resist the temptation to surrender to the pressures of protectionism. It is a matter of great regret that in many of the major countries inflation is rising rather than still falling and the power of their economies is so great that we are all affected by what they do and by the decisions they make. </para>
          <para>Australia is developing a resolution on inflation, protectionism and structural adjustment and it is expected that this resolution will be launched at UNCTAD tomorrow. It has been undertaken in close concert with a number of developing countries. We hope that the resolution will have a productive effect and will cut across group lines in UNCTAD. For Australia 's part, our record of trade with the developing nations is a good one and we should not forget it or be talked out of it. In 1966 Australia introduced the first system of tariff preferences to assist developing countries. The Australian system has been substantially expanded. Some 80 per cent of imports from developing countries now enter Australia duty free or at a preferential tariff rate. Australia's imports of industrial products from developing countries have increased substantially. On a per capita basis, Australia's imports of manufactured products from developing countries, excluding petroleum, more than doubled between 1973 and 1977- a better performance than that of the United States, the EEC or Japan. </para>
          <para>In the sensitive textiles, clothing and footwear area, access to Australia is very high. Australia's imports on textiles, clothing and footwear from ASEAN countries alone represent $A2. 14 a head of Australia's population compared with 63c in the United States, 51c for the European Economic Community and 25c for Japan. If these three areas allowed imports to the same extent as Australia, on a per capita basis, ASEAN exports of these products would expand by $ 1 billion a year. The task before UNCTAD is a formidable and continuing one. In approaching it, we will all need to display moderation. But we will need also to display realism; we will need to display vision; and last, and perhaps most important, we will need to display the resolution to face formidable problems and surmount them. </para>
          <para>A useful aspect of the visit to the Philippines was the opportunity it afforded for discussions with the Prime Minister of Japan, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira,</inline> whom I earlier met in Japan but before he became Prime Minister. At that meeting we discussed important international, economic, political and strategic issues. The broad based dialogue between Japan and Australia is something which I believe both countries find useful. It is a recent development which took shape primarily following my 1978 talks in Japan with Prime Minister Fukuda when the Australian Government engaged Japan in a broad discussion rather than focussing on bilateral issues. We did it out of our concern- the common concern shared by Japan and many other countriesfor what was happening in the international environment. Domestic issues, important as they are, are not the only matters of concern to Japan and Australia. In discussing the forthcoming Tokyo Summit, we agreed that the strongest action against inflation is necessary, especially in view of the link between inflation, world trading opportunities and the North-South dialogue. It was plain from our discussions that Japan and Australia have common views on many matters including the Common Fund, co-operation in the peaceful uses of energy and the continuing importance of the United States role in world affairs, and in particular with respect to the AsiaPacific region. </para>
          <para>One particular point of interest raised in the course of our discussions was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> 's concept of a Pacific Basin Community in which there would be closer regional co-operation and dialogue amongst Pacific nations. The idea has considerable potential and merits further discussion and consultation. At the moment the concept is tentative and exploratory and requires a great deal of thinking and consultation, and I have asked the Foreign Minister to develop ideas and approaches to this subject. The discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> confirmed that Australia and Japan have close economic relations, a growing political understanding and shared perceptions about the Asia-Pacific region. We now have a broad and mutually accepted framework for constructive dialogue with Japan across the range of bilateral and more general issues which can only be to the advantage of both our countries. At the conclusion of the meeting, I expressed the hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> would be able to visit Australia at the earliest possible date. He would certainly receive a warm and friendly welcome in this country. </para>
          <para>Finally, I turn to my visit to Indonesia. I had earlier enquired whether  President  Soeharto would, like Prime Minister Ohira, be visiting Manila for UNCTAD V, in which case we could have had an opportunity to meet there. As an alternative, he suggested having talks on my way back, an invitation which I readily accepted because it provided an opportunity for constructive forward-looking discussions on a wide range of international, regional and bilateral matters. Our talks made it perfectly plain that Australia and Indonesia recognise that, living together in one part of the world, we need to work closely together. A strong relationship between Indonesia and Australia is a fundamental foreign policy objective of this Government and, I believe, of  President  Soeharto 's Government also. The talks confirmed the strength of our relationship and served further to advance it. They revealed a high degree of common interest and common understanding on the many political and economic problems facing the region. There have in the past been some strains between our two countries. Those difficulties are now firmly behind us, and we are determined to look to the future constructively and realistically. </para>
          <para>The  President  and I reviewed developments at UNCTAD including the debate on the Common Fund, and the renewed instability in Indo-China and its implications for the region. Australia welcomes Indonesia's current efforts to strengthen its relationship with Papua New Guinea. On the issue of the Australia-Indonesia seabed boundary negotiations we were both hopeful that they will be brought to a speedy and successful conclusion. Progress has been made in the reunification of Timorese families and there was agreement that this program should be continued as rapidly as possible. The problem of refugees from Indo-China is a human problem of vast proportions which affects all of us. It is a problem which needs to be tackled at the international level. Indonesia's co-operation in the IndoChina refugee problem is of importance in maintaining an orderly intake of refugees into Australia. Indonesia's continuing help in forestalling unheralded arrivals of refugees is very much appreciated, for it is much easier for Australia to take in a significant number of refugees, I believe, when this is done in an orderly way and under proper immigration procedures and not arriving unheralded on our coastline. Indonesia's generous and constructive proposal to establish an island processing centre for refugees was discussed. Shortly after my return, we made a decision to support this proposal firmly. It is welcomed and supported by Australia. We will be contributing towards the cost of the centre. The Government urges other nations also to make financial contributions. </para>
          <para>Finally, we discussed the possibility of  President  Soeharto visiting Australia before too long. The Government looks forward to offering  President  Soeharto the hospitality of this country. I discussed the new Australian low air fares scheme with both  President  Marcos and  President  Soeharto. I believe that tens of thousands of Australians are voting with their dollars and tickets to show the success of that particular policy. We both welcomed the progress made at the recent meeting of Australian and ASEAN officials in Kuala Lumpur where, as a result of considerable goodwill on both sides, agreement was reached to recommend to Ministers a package proposal for settlement. As General Romulo, the Philippine Minister for Foreign Affairs said to the UNCTAD delegates, the joint communique on civil aviation agreed by ASEAN and Australian officials at Kuala Lumpur was 'an example of the way in which differences can be reconciled in the spirit of compromise'. The Australian and Philippines Governments are to discuss arrangements covering routes between Australia, the Philippines and countries to the north. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> and I agreed that lower air fares between Japan and Australia are necessary and we urged that the negotiations that are already underway between Japan Air Lines and Qantas Airways Ltd should be concluded as quickly as possible. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, this brief visit to nearby countries was a particularly valuable and effective one. It advanced our bilateral relations with the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia. It advanced Australian-ADEAN understanding. It allowed Australia's views on major international economic issues to be put at the world forum of UNCTAD V. The visit allowed a warm and friendly exchange of views between Heads of Government on a range of issues which can only lead to better international co-operation and understanding on bilateral and on world issues and to enduring relationships between the peoples of our countries, our region and the world. </para>

            <para>- by leave- Let me say at the outset that the Opposition generally supports the objectives of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. However, we are under no illusion about the enormous difficulties that confront the culmination of those objectives. We are under no illusion about the difficulties of arranging accord among the various nations which have to be involved in the discussions and negotiations and finalisation of matters associated with the objectives of UNCTAD, but also the very real and very large practical problems of making the general purposes behind UNCTAD, behind the Common Fund, and behind the new international economic order work successfully. These difficulties are very large. They are daunting in many ways. But the fact that they are daunting is not sufficient justification for retreating to a commitment to try to wrestle successfully with the challenge that UNCTAD lays before us. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I say that with some stress because it seems to me that there is a tendency in some quarters to approach this great and very important challenge with rosy spectacles, to gloss over the difficulties and to understate the real challenges which still lie ahead of the development of UNCTAD before we can conceivably regard it as being in the final stages of culmination. I regret to say that the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> tonight, for whatever else it did say- it did not say much- certainly left the impression that he was approaching the challenge of UNCTAD with this rosy spectacled view. He ought to recall that in the course of UNCTAD V discussions at Manila there was a considerable and disconcerting display of disagreement, if not conflict, between a number of the countries participating in those discussions, not on a bilateral type of dichotomy between the developing and the developed countries but on the basis of a breakup between several distinctive blocs within the countries participating. </para>
          <para>It would be most unfortunate if this important undertaking were to fail, as have so many other idealistically motivated concepts which have been put forward in the past designed to try to assist the development of" developing countries. There is clear evidence in the community todaynot just in the Australian community but in the community of developed countries- that a certain cynicism is seeping through about ideas which are put forward to assist developing countries develop. It is cynicism based first of all upon grave doubts as to the genuineness of the credentials and motivations of the leaders of developed countries putting forward these views, and secondly, as to whether there will be enough drive, enough will and enough guts to really make these programs succeed. I recall clearly the enormous disillusionment that many people of my generation suffer today because of the very large investment they made in the decade of development during the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Honourable members will recall that in that period- within a decade- the developed countries of the world were each to contribute one per cent of their gross domestic product towards the development of the lesser developed countries. It never came off but in theory it was grand and we were all sold on the commitment. It was not that the people of the developed countries failed in the commitment; it was that the governments failed. I would hate to see this sort of thing happen again. </para>
          <para>Another important aspect of the Prime Minister's speech, which I wish to come back to a little later, concerns a fundamental conflict between the principles he has put forward in this speech and the principles to which he commits himself so doggedly in this country. It appears that overseas, especially on an international platform where there is a widespread audience provided from developing countries, he prefers to exemplify the qualities of free trade and of open markets and of much greater liberal access to the markets of developed countries for developing countries. He is against protection. He is against not only tariff protection but also non-tariff forms of protection, all of which exist in this country. More significantly, according to the Industries Assistance Commission, Australia has the second highest level of average protection of any country in the world. </para>
          <para>There is no evidence that the Prime Minister has determined that he will reduce that level of protection in any effective way over any reasonable time span which would be consistent with the role he prefers to adopt when he strides onto that international stage before the representatives of developing countries seeking to exemplify the qualities of free trade and of greater market access. In Australia the Prime Minister adopts the grim and dogged role of an unrepentant protectionist. He cannot have it both ways. I want to come back to that point because there is a serious fundamental conflict between what he is stating to the developing countries of the world, what he has reported to the House tonight and what is generally his position in this country- specifically in this Parliament- when enunciating Government policy in this area. </para>
          <para>Before I launch into the main thrust of what the Prime Minister had to say- it does very much come down to an interest in some of Australia 's regional neighbours but essentially in the recent UNCTAD V discussions in Manila- I have to comment on his references to the role of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the AsiaPacific region. I am not clear what the implication of his statement is when he endorses the view that a constructive role by the USSR in the Asia-Pacific region would be welcome. If it is a departure from the frenetic behaviour of the Prime Minister and his Government in 1976-77 when they discovered that Russia was about to provide aid for some of the small island developing countries of the south-west Pacific, the change is welcome. I would agree with him. Russia can contribute valuably not just in our own region- the south-west Pacific and the south and South-East Asian area- but throughout the world and ought to be encouraged to do so. That is not the same as saying that one should pardon the shortcomings, defects and wrong doings of the USSR, but it is adopting a simple proposition, that it will be more helpful to world accord to encourage a greater participation and involvement of the USSR in world affairs. </para>
          <para>To the extent that the USSR can be encouraged to contribute to the development of independent countries while preserving thenindependent development, a most valuable contribution will have been made not just to those countries but to a more harmonious relationship between the super powers and the major powers of the world. If that is the purpose of the Prime Minister, it deserves commendation. But if it is meant as some sort of implied hectoring, some sort of implied lecturing to Russia, that because she has now conceivably a great deal of influence with Vietnam she has to behave herself and to train Vietnam to behave herself, that is ludicrous. To take that attitude is to take a particularly blinkered view of the complex relationships in the world today and within our region. </para>
          <para>If the Prime Minister is genuinely concerned about stability in our region, instead of implying lectures in this way he ought to adopt immediately firstly, for Australia, the reintroduction of an aid program for the peaceful development of Vietnam. </para>

              <para>-Of course, but the obverse side of the proposition is simply that the debilitated state of Vietnam today leaves it almost exclusively dependent on the USSR for aid for its development. The more Vietnam is isolated from the industrialised countries of the world, the more those countries refuse to provide aid for Vietnam, the more Vietnam will be forced into the embrace of the USSR and the more its dependency will move towards total dependency and, accordingly, the more it will become a prisoner of the policies of the USSR. Australia ought to adopt a sensible attitude. A great deal of stupidity was spoken in this House in the 1960s from the Government side, from people who may have been different to those who are now here but whose views were no different to the views held by those here now. They were people who objected to the proposition that Vietnam could become an independent communist country within the world order of nations, that there are countries such as Yugoslavia which have established beyond any doubt that that is possible- not only possible but desirable- in the interests of the Western nations of the world. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>That is the objective at which we ought to be aiming. Vietnam has made it clear that she requires about $5,000m of aid to rehabilitate the country after the damage caused by the extent of the Vietnamese wars. If we encourage the provision of that aid we will be making a far greater contribution to stability in the area and the independence of Vietnam. We will also be diminishing the possibility of an outbreak of super power tension in our region. Honourable members should remember that the only military super power bases that are established in our region at the present time apart from communication bases in Australia are American bases in the Philippines. There are no permanent Russian military bases in Vietnam yet, not at Cam Ranh Bay and not at any of the air bases. As the trend is now developing there is a very real likelihood that this could change. Accordingly, it was a matter of great disappointment for me to find that the Prime Minister made no reference to this issue at all. </para>
          <para>What he did refer to on another topic was the improvement in Australia-Philippines trade. I think that we ought to put the record straight on that. The Australia-Philippines trade agreement ratification was deferred for four years. It was deferred for four years as a demonstration of dissatisfaction on the part of the Philippines with the terms of trade which it experienced with Australia. Accordingly, it applied discriminatory actions against Australia and it is only recently that trade has been allowed to develop again. So to say that exports to Australia from the Philippines have been growing by something like 45 per cent a year is meaningless. It is meaningless in the light of those experiences. Those experiences reflect an underlying problem that just has not been attended to by the Prime Minister in the comprehensive and broad framework that is needed if we are to talk about enhanced reciprocal trade relations between countries in our region and Australia. </para>
          <para>Another topic that the Prime Minister has raised from time to time as an issue of some compassionate concern to him is that of human rights in countries within our region. It is an issue of such paramount importance to him that he made not one mention of it in his half-hour statement to the Parliament tonight. He made no mention about this fundamental principle of the freedom of man. Not one reference was made to this principle which is implicit in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. There is not one country in the South East Asian region where serious and extensive breaches of fundamental human rights do not take place. I recognise the limitations on a country such as Australia seeking to lecture developing countries on the issue of human rights. Indeed the proposition is, and I accept it, that it could be counter-productive to do this in a strident public way. But that is no excuse for not taking up the issue in any way at all. My own very strong impression, formed as a result of an extensive visit through most of South East Asia in the middle of last year, is that the Government really does not care to take up this issue but, to the extent that it may, it does it in a very off-handed manner. </para>
          <para>The International Commission of Jurists and Amnesty International have documented the extent of the repression of human rights in these various countries. The Prime Minister at least should have signalled a concern about these matters and then indicated clearly that wherever the opportunity had arisen he had taken it to discuss this matter with the leaders of these countries. I did this with the leaders of every country that I visited in the middle of last year. Some of them do not care for the matter being raised, but there is no doubt that in raising it and putting the point of view of countries such as Australia clearly but courteously, some helpful impact is made. </para>
          <para>Let me deal with the main thrust of the Prime Minister's statement. The Prime Minister spoke of the need for freer trade in the world order today and condemned those countries which deal in such nasty practices as protection by way of tariffs or non-tariff forms of industry. Everything that he condemned applies to this country. One wonders what he is trying to pull off with this brittle moralising, this hollow posturing and this unconvincing hypocrisy. A man cannot adopt one suit in Australia and change in to another on a different platform as the whim takes him, although this often happens here. Only a few weeks ago when he was speaking to the national conference of his party in Perth, the Prime Minister asserted that since he had become Prime Minister disruptions through industrial disputes had fallen dramatically. The same night he went on national television and condemned the trade unions for industrial action and accused them of seeking to destroy economic recovery. He is doing exactly the same sort of thing here. In Manila he proclaimed his commitment to free trade and in Australia declared that he is an unrepentent protectionist. </para>
          <para>The latest case of the bottom lip policy making of the Prime Minister is in UNCTAD V. We had a classic case of this arising from the conflict about cheaper air fares between Australia and Great Britain, a conflict which arose because the ASEAN countries resented the way in which this matter had been handled by Australia. It was remarkable that the Government should allow such a sensitive issue of foreign relations to be handled by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> He may be very successful at negotiating toughly on butterfat subsidies, but he cannot understand the sensitive cultural differences between South East Asian countries and Australia. There was plenty of warning that difficulties were going to arise. I recall that well before these negotiations got under way, and whilst I was in the South East Asian area in the middle of last year, the leaders of those countries, especially Singapore and India, were signalling their concern. They felt that there was a sleight directed towards them in the foreign policy attitudes of the Australian Government. Here we have in relation to the air fares conflict a classic case of bottom lip impulsive policy making by the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will recall that for several days in the discussions on the cheap air fares there was a stalemate. No progress was being made by the negotiating parties because of the intransigence of the Australian delegation led by the Minister for Transport. Then, unexpectedly, in the closing hours there was a last-minute switch. It is now known why there was a last minute switch. The Minister for Transport had been discharging his instructions given to him from Cabinet. The change came at the direction of the Prime Minister who suddenly realised that he could not very well go to Manila to moralise about freer trade, about our respect for developing countries, our commitment to assist them, and at the same time be excluding them from the benefits of lower air fares. That was a clear case of economic and political discrimination. I refer also to the Prime Minister's presence at UNCTAD V. Right up to the last minute the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> was going to handle this matter in the usual sort of way, in the proper way and, I might add, in a confident way. The Prime Minister interceded at the last minute and he went to Manila instead. From the statement that he made there and from some of the comments that he made here tonight, I have no doubt at all that Australian industry will be experiencing great concern over the implications of the Prime Minister's commitments for Australian industry. The simple fact is that the businessman's government, the government allegedly of Australian industry, has not discussed these matters at all with Australian industry. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Madigan</inline>of Hamersley Holdings Ltd has told the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that there could be serious implications for Australian industries, but more particularly mineral processing industries, which might otherwise have established themselves in this country, arising from what the Prime Minister has been saying. It may be preferable that these changes take place, but what will their effects be and what will be the losses and advantages to us as a result? Those are not things that the Prime Minister dealt with. He has indulged in empty, generalised rhetoric, but in none of the hard details which are necessary at this time of economic crisis in this country. In his statement the Prime Minister stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Australia is developing a resolution on inflation . . . </para>
          </quote>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I will not read the rest of the statement. I believe that Australian industry and the Australian community has a right to know what specifically is proposed in relation to protectionism and structural adjustment and what implications those proposals have for Australian manufacturing industry. Following on with this theme, the Prime Minister has not explored with us the implication of a so-called north-south dialogue which is essentially for the redistribution of resources and resource development opportunity from wealthy countries to developing countries. It is a very proper objective, but the implications have not been spelled out for us. </para>
          <para>In case it is felt by honourable members opposite that I have been unfair in criticising the Prime Minister on these matters, let me point out what the people in Malaysia think about the Prime Minister's brittle posturing overseas. Michael Richardson, an Australian newspaper correspondent in South East Asia, published an illuminating remark from a Malaysian Government official. He quoted the official as saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It would have been great if Australia were blameless. But any ASEAN country could have written the same speechand used it against Australia. </para>

          <para class="block">That is obvious to anyone who understands the economic conditions in this country and the protectionist policies practised by the Government and who has read what the Prime Minister said overseas. The Prime Minister has approached this matter too glibly. Let me quote some remarks attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oliver</inline> Long, the Director-General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a few days ago. An Australian Associated Press telex reports: </para>

            <para>The safeguards code would establish the scope and limits of temporary import restraints governments could impose to protect their domestic economic interests against a surge of imports of particular products. It was the only major element of the Tokyo round negotiations that has not yet been concluded. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that the Australian community is entitled to some detail about the implications of these matters. My argument, very simply, is that the Government is not approaching this matter in any constructive or practical light at all. Glib, empty, generalised rhetoric is no blueprint for the process of development and change we have to go through if the Government is genuine about providing greater access for the exports of developing countries. The implications of providing greater access for the exports of developing countries is that we also will have to develop our exports to a much greater degree than we have been prepared to do so far. We have to encourage Australian manufacturing industry to be much less inward looking than it has been so far. That process of change is dislocated, and it will develop all forms of tough political resistance if it is not understood and accepted. To be understood it must be explained in its comprehensive detail; to be accepted there must be programs which make it quite clear that the process of change will be a gradual one and one which will provide various forms of support for people who would be affected by it. We are not in the business of creating a painful process of change which uses human beings or Australian industry as sacrifices to some greater common good which is not understood by anyone except a limited few, such as the Prime Minister. If he understood it, only a limited few would understand it. </para>
          <para>Let me give an example of the way in which we have been exploring this matter. We must bear in mind that we believe the problems we have in the economy today, both short term and medium to longer term, can no longer be left to market forces. There has to be government intervention- physical government planning, not command planning. We need indicative planning. Governments need to indicate to business, which desperately wants economic planning of this nature, what its programs will be over the medium term. It is no good introducing export incentives this year because the balance of payments are weak and whipping them away the next year because the balance of payments are picking up. Business engages in expensive investment programs which involve periods of several years of amortisation and which are based on calculations related to those investment allowances. If the allowances are withdrawn unexpectedly the whole economic viability of a business could be undermined. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> have developed in conjunction with their colleagues a program for a textile and clothing authority which is designed to ensure better long term planning and certainty within the industry. Its purpose will be to replace the functions of the Industries Assistance Commission and the Industry Quota Review Committee in respect of clothing and textile industries. It will involve representatives of employers and employees. It will monitor the industry and recommend policies. It will suggest measures to improve efficiency and will aim to provide a base for confident investment and development. Very importantly the authority, on behalf of government, will consult and plan with our trading partners so that Australian production of clothing and textiles is integrated to the greatest extent possible with the production of countries exporting to us. </para>
          <para>The simple facts are that if there is to be any future for this country in its economic development and if we are to sustain relatively our per capita living standards in relation to other developed countries in the world we have to explore ways in which we can integrate our economic development with other nations' economies. It is clear that the European economies are closing off from us. It is equally obvious that the opportunities available in America are limited and will continue to be so. It is therefore quite apparent that our greatest opportunities are going to lie in our own region- in east, south and South East Asia. But they will not be easy markets to tap. Already the volume of manufacturers in our total exports to ASEAN countries has dropped from 5 1 per cent less than 10 years ago to 39 per cent. This has occurred under this Government, which claims to be concerned about promoting these matters. </para>
          <para>Let me outline very quickly some of the things that have to be done. A national trading corporation has to be set up with specialised negotiating skills and facilities to trade with countries like East Europe and China, and Third World nations where this sort of trading arrangement is understood and preferred. Payroll tax reimbursement for exporters ought to be re-explored. Such a system applied some years ago and was an excellent financial incentive for the development of exports. A research and development corporation ought to be established with the funds available to allow it to patent, develop, market and promote Australian inventions. Perhaps we should consider increasing the total volume of aid by exploring other forms of aid rather than making all aid exclusively untied aid. Many countries provide tied aid through the application of export credits. </para>
          <para>I am not suggesting that we reduce the volume of aid in any relative sense but rather that we top up on that. It is far better to increase the total in this way than not to increase it at all. We will have to establish a financial institution to provide longer term credit with accommodating interest rates for developing countries so that we can sell our exports more successfully and more easily. </para>
          <para class="block">Other developed countries, especially Japan, do so. We will have to adopt a set of policies designed to influence the export policies of multinational corporations in this country and also to encourage them to invest a greater proportion of their profits in research and development in this country. We will also need a much more effective arrangement to follow up trade development missions that go to developing countries. The most persistent criticism I experienced last year in south and South East Asia was that Australia sent trade development missions to these countries, but there was never any follow up. </para>

          <para>The Government has no room at all for complacency or satisfaction in the area of aid. There has been a 20 per cent cut in relative terms in aid for developing countries, a reduction of some $200m under the inspired leadership of the small 1' liberal Minister for Foreign Affairs who may know a great deal about Gucci toothbrushes but who does not have anywhere near as great a commitment towards the development of developing countries. Aid to developing countries as a proportion of gross domestic product went from 0.6 per cent in 1975 down to 0.45 per cent in 1977. In 1978 it was indisputably even lower than that. That is the sort of priority the Government allocates for aid to developing countries. Instead of money being spent on spectacular investment programs and perhaps expensive electronic communications for developing countries, which very largely benefit the middle class of those countries, the whole set of concepts behind aid for developing countries needs to be reassessed and new principles and priorities established. For instance, within our region the two greatest needs fall in the areas of literacy and health services. We are eminently equipped to provide specialists- for instance, educationalists, health workers and nurses- who could work in those areas. It is a matter of properly designing a program, carefully selecting people because of their maturity, measured in terms of their personality, judgment and balance rather than necessarily their age, training them in the appropriate languages and developing grass roots literacy and health service programs, preferably at the village level. This is a far more effective and sustainable way of helping the development of these countries. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Prime Minister should explore what I believe should be a high priority for the developed countries of this world, that is, a marshal aid type development program, funded by the developing countries of the world for the development of the lesser developed countries of the world. The marshal aid type program was outstandingly successful at the end of the Second World War in restoring the war ravaged economies and social systems of Germany and Japan, among many other countries. They were the main countries. It is indisputable, on that experience, that this sort of concept can and will work successfully. It is a two way benefit. Not only does it help the developing countries but also, at a time of depressed economic activity internationally, it can assist the restoration of economic activity in the developing countries. </para>
          <para>In short, the Prime Minister's statement is interesting very largely because of the conflict it reflects in the fundamental principles he has espoused, proclaiming the virtues of free trade overseas when, in fact, at home he does anything but that. It is disappointing because of the empty rhetoric and the brittle posturing which are part and parcel of his statement. It is most discouraging because it failed to face in any detailed way the complex problems which confront developing nations today and the implications of the various programs associated with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development V discussions, how they will affect Australian industry and how we will respond. The Prime Minister's statement is interesting only for the questions it should have raised and should have answered. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition is totally opposed to some clauses of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. Those clauses to which we are opposed aptly reflect the hostile attitude of this Government to the Public Service. Indeed, one can take a line through the Government's policy on staff ceilings in looking at its general attitude to the role of the Public Service in providing a proper service to the community of Australia. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I had pointed out that this attitude had been applied throughout most departments but in particular to the Commonwealth Employment Service at a time when this Government has brought about a record unemployment figure of 450,000 people. Yet it still seeks to cut back the service offered by the Commonwealth Employment Service by reducing the number of staff available. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That is not the only issue at stake. I draw attention to a letter which was sent to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> yesterday, a copy of which has been sent to me by a constituent in the Australian Capital Territory. It draws the attention of the Parliament to the irrational staff cuts that have taken place and how they are affecting people in the community. The letter states: . </para>
          <para class="block">Dear Prime Minister </para>
          <para>I write to draw your attention to a situation which has arisen at my daughter's school (Malkara Special School, ACT) as a direct result of your Government's policy in relation to Public Service staff ceilings. </para>
          <para>In short, the situation is that speech therapy services that once were provided at the school have had to be withdrawn because of starring constraints placed on the Capital Territory Health Commission. As the attached letter from the Commission says in part, 'The Speech Therapy service of the Mental Health Branch does not have enough staff to service all areas or groups within Canberra which desperately require it.' In the other copy of correspondence attached, the  Chairman  of the ACT Schools Authority acknowledges that  . . a recognised need is not being met' </para>
          <para class="block">As I said, one can take a line through the Government's policies on staff ceilings to see what it would do with the new power which is made available under the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. People generally would not be opposed to the redeployment and the proper and efficient use of the resources of the Public Service. But giving it wide powers for the dismissal of people for any reason which is provided for under clause 7 of this Bill is something to which we on the Opposition side of the House and to which people who will be subject to the provisions of this Bill are opposed. </para>
          <para>In New South Wales alone at the end of March this year a fully staffed CES office would have required an additional 279 people. On average that is three staff per office. Let us examine the administration of the export development incentives which this Government supposedly regards as so important. In the Export Development Grants Board there have been delays of up to two years in processing claims because this Government has not provided sufficient professional staff to cope with the expanded work load. Senior officers of the Board have had to work as receptionists and clerical assistants because the Government could not be bothered to hire any of the hundreds and thousands of school leavers it has relegated to the dole queues. For instance, in the last year of the Labor Government 3,226 school leavers were recruited as permanent employees of the Public Service compared with 1,430 in the first year of the Fraser Government. These examples of false economies could go on and on. In the 1978 annual report of the Public Service Board the Board warned the Government that its rigid and inane application of staff ceilings had grave implications for standards of service. Staff ceilings, the Board said:  . . reduced mobility between departments countering the best usage of skills and talents available; diverted resources away from the training and staff development programs and activities relating to the achievement of long term economies. </para>
          <para class="block">Let me continue with the views of the Public Service Board. One can see from the comments made in its annual report from which I have read and from which I will quote again, how far this Government is going. The philosophy behind the Government's move for termination of employment of people less than 55 years of age parallels its mad thinking in relation to staff ceilings in the Public Service. Again I quote from the Public Service Board annual report 1977. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There are also indications that the restrictions are adversely affecting the efficiency of the Service in the longer term. </para>
            <para>In order to meet immediate commitments, some departments have considered it necessary to divert resources away from training and staff development programs thus impeding the development of essential knowledge and skills. </para>
            <para>In a number of areas in the Service it has been necessary to curtail review activities directed towards the achievement of long term economy. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This Government states that the Bill is directed to more efficient use of resources of the Public Service. But its previous decisions which were aimed at greater use and efficiency of the Public Service do not stand up to scrutiny. If the Government took time out to sit down with the peak councils and discuss these matters it would find that many reasons would be given by the peak councils as to why this legislation ought to be withdrawn. Greater negotiation ought to be taking place between Government and the employee representatives because some of the past arguments used by the Government have not turned out to be factual. The Public Service Board annual report also states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In current circumstances, it is the Board 's view that any further general reductions in staff ceilings would call for corresponding decisions by the Government to forego functions or reduce standards of service. </para>
            <para>During 1977-78 a large number of representations was made by departments and authorities for increases in their  staff ceilings. The main increases sought were in the context of: </para>
          </quote>
          <quote>
            <para>Increased numbers of people served by unemployment benefits administration in the Departments of Social Security and Employment and Industrial Relations. </para>
            <para>The need for newly established bodies to consolidate their activities, for example, the Special Broadcasting Service, and the Industrial Relations Bureau, and </para>
            <para>An increased emphaiss on some existing activities, for example, in the area of import controls. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One could go on quoting what the Public Service Board said or even what the Coombs inquiry said in relation to some of these matters upon which the Government has acted. But it has acted, as I have said, with false economies. The consultant's report to the Coombs inquiry had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Substantial evidence exists that the vast majority of Cabinet Ministers are completely unaware of the impact of ceilings upon their departments and hence have paid them only lip service. Ceilings have assumed too much of the aura of a euphemistic political ploy. They have produced breakdowns in various parts of the government administration in the long term, and they have proved incapable of handling short term crises. They have proved incompatible with public sector planning. Although exerting some controlling influence over numerical movements in staff they have produced minimal influence upon efficiency and resource allocation in departments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think the Government would have to put forward a far more substantial argument in support of the Bill for this House to agree to it than the case put forward in the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner).</inline> The Minister argues that all is done for the proper, efficient use of the resources of the Public Service. But that is exactly what the Government argued when it put forward the view that the Public Service should be smaller numerically than it was when the Government came to power. But all the Government has done in reducing the number of staff in the Public Service is ensured that the community has a worse service and that the people in the Public Service cannot carry out their duties. </para>
          <para>These reports make it plain that standards of service are falling. Activities are being curtailed and the structure and capacity of the Public Service are being undermined. Such results, testified to by the highest bureaucratic authority, indicate that the policies that this Government pursues are policies of false economy. At the same time as the Public Service is being starved of human resources, the number of unemployed is growing. In the name of efficiency, this Government justifies its irresponsible failure to staff adequately those parts of the bureaucracy providing services to or finding jobs for the unemployed. In marked contrast to the Fraser Government's savage repression of employment in vital areas of the public sector, stands its extravagant use of committees of inquiry and task forces whose reports are usually commissioned to enable the Government to pass the buck for its disinterest in positive and compassionate proposals in the areas of employment, health and social security. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister, since his election, has set up some 80 inquiries at enormous expense to the Australian taxpayer. The Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training, whose report was unique in that it failed to produce one positive proposal to alleviate youth unemployment, cost approximately $lm. Over the past three years, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, as it was called before it was broken up, has placed before Cabinet numerous submissions relating to job creation, education and training. All were rejected. During this time, the Government spent $lm on a cosmetic inquiry which produced a document renowned for its concern for privilege and inequality. Consultants, lawyers and university professors have profited from generous handouts while public servants are expected to grin and bear unfair staff ceilings, government vilification and disinterest. They are now threatened with the ultimate humiliation- management initiated retirement. </para>
          <para>The problem with this Bill is not that it is concerned with efficiency and economy but that, given this Government's record, it will be used as an instrument for pursuing further false economies, for justifying staff cuts in areas such as social security, employment and health. A Labor government, in its approach to these matters, would not want to see the numbers employed in Australian government areas run wild. What we would want to see would be staff numbers that were adequate to carry out the functions of departments at the standard that the public is entitled to expect. We would adopt the Coombs inquiry recommendation for the abolition of staff ceilings and would substitute the manpower budgeting system recommended by the inquiry. The advantage of that system is that it gears staffing levels to work requirements and standards of service. We would also expect the public sector to make some contribution to the easing of unemployment. </para>
          <para>Nowhere in the Minister's second reading speech did he make any attempt to explain why the Government has not followed the blueprint offered by the Coombs inquiry in respect of the matters to which the Bill relates. That blueprint was based on the existing and well understood provisions of sections 20, 67 and 85 of the Public Service Act. In relation to permanent staff, those provisions give the Public Service Board power to retrench staff excess to requirements, to retire persons who have reached minimum retiring age and to retire persons who are inefficient for reasons within or beyond their own control. The basic framework was already there. All it needed was some modifications such as the development of an appeal and review system, in which case we would not have the Public Service in the uproar it is in now. Instead, we have this piece of legislation which is woolly in its thinking, sinister in its possible means of application and open to arbitrary extension by administrative regulation and procedures effectively outside the scrutiny of Parliament. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party acknowledges that there are some worthwhile facets of the Bill. Voluntary early retirement is one such provision. The redeployment provisions are much needed, but are ill-conceived. On the other hand, the manner in which the Bill is framed makes it difficult to bring forward amendments. There are some questions which require considerable thought and further investigation. There is a lot to suggest that the provisions of the Bill have not been adequately thought through. In the circumstances, the Opposition moves: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to incorporate- </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">
              <item label="(a)">
                <para>specific reasoning for termination of employment; and </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(">
                <para>b) a comprehensive appeal system relating to termination of employment and redeployment'. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para>If, as will be the case, our amendment is defeated, we intend to fight in the Committee stage several clauses of this Bill. We join with members of the Commonwealth Public Service who believe that the manner in which this Bill is drafted leaves open to a government which has shown no sincerity at all to its own employees, powers that will politicise the Public Service in a way which is totally unacceptable to the Australian community, and a way which was never intended by the people who formed these parliaments that the Public Service should be used. It will leave open to the Government the opportunity to treat the Public Service in a manner which it is not able to treat any other section of the Australian work force. It is important that the Parliament does not treat the public servant as just another member of the work force. If the Fraser Administration politicises the Public Service in the standover way in which this Bill is drafted, it will be a very dark day indeed, not just for the public servants of Australia but for the whole Australian community. </para>

              <para>- I believe that if this House were to accept the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Port Adelaide to withdraw this Bill with a view to redrafting it in certain ways, thereby delaying still further its passage through this House, the greatest scream of protest we would hear would be from the many public servants who are looking forward to the introduction of this Bill and its passage through this Parliament so that they can take advantage of the number of early retirement provisions contained in this Bill. Indeed, the members of the Opposition who are putting forward the suggestion that we delay the introduction of this Bill to enable further consideration would find that they would reap the wrath of many rank and file members of Public Service unions who are looking forward to this Bill. The Bill makes provision for the introduction of a scheme of redeployment and retirement in the Public Service and, where prescribed, in other areas of Commonwealth employment. The main features of the Bill are along similar lines to the scheme proposed in the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill 1976. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Bill before us imposes an obligation on managers in the Public Service to identify staff who cannot be efficiently utilised and to declare such staff as eligible for redeployment. The grounds for such action relate, firstly, to excess numbers of staff, secondly, to invalidity on the part of employees and, thirdly, to other reasons such as loss of licence where it is relevant to the performance of particular functions or limited efficiency in performing the functions of a position. The Public Service Board is required to attempt to redeploy such staff in other areas of the Public Service. In the event that staff cannot be so redeployed, provision is made for retirement with compensation in some cases. Discussion and negotiation with Public Service unions have resulted in improvements to the 1976 Bill, particularly with respect to the right of appeal against some of its provisions. </para>
          <para>Under the Bill before us, staff have the right of appeal at three stages of the process of redeployment and retirement. They have the right of. appeal, firstly, at the stage when they are identified as a declared employee under the Bill, secondly, where action is taken by way of redeployment and, thirdly, where action is taken by way of retirement of certain employees. An appeals tribunal set up to hear appeals is required to have regard to procedures and principles notified by the Board or relevant authority as applying to such actions. The Bill incorporates significant amendments to the earlier Bill in the area of appeal rights following discussions with staff organisations, as I have outlined. It also makes provision for the introduction of voluntary retirement at age 55 with reduced benefits under the Superannuation Act. In some of the comments that they have made members of the Opposition and some Public Service union leaders are misjudging the mood of members of the Public Service. Members of the Public Service want the early voluntary retirement provisions. They are not afraid of the compulsory retirement provisions. Anyone in the Public Service of reasonable ability is confident of his or her ability and does not fear the provisions for management initiated retirement. Where such involuntary retirement occurs from the age of 55 onwards, an officer obtains significant additional benefits to compensate for that early retirement. Let me refer to the scale. If someone is retired one year before the age of 60- that is, at the age of 59- he or she receives an additional two months' salary as a lump sum. At the age of 58, the benefit is an additional four months' salary. At the age of 57, it is six months' salary. At the age of 56, it is eight months' salary. At the age of 55, it is 10 months' salary. In other words, there is lump sum compensation for service foregone at the rate of two months' salary for every one year's retirement before the age of 60. </para>
          <para>Not only are such persons paid a lump sum; they may also convert it into a pension entitlement. The lump sum may be converted to a pension which will provide significant additional benefits. Let us look at the example of a Clerk Class 5 retiring at the age of 55 years at a salary of approximately $14,000 after 30 years' service. Under the provisions contained in this </para>
          <para class="block">Bill, if he uses the option to take out additional pension rights with his lump sum he can retire at 55 on a pension of $8,062 per annum. It would not take a great deal of effort to get some part time position to make up his total income to the level of the salary which he was originally earning. Some people on my side of the House have suggested that officers might even be tempted to try to get retirement under those provisions in order to qualify for the additional lump sum benefit which would not be available to a person who chose voluntarily to retire and simply took the option. </para>
          <para>We have to take many of the protestations of members opposite with a grain of salt when they purport to say that members of the Public Service do not want these provisions and that they fear them. That is not the impression that I get. When those provisions are compared to the sorts of provisions available in private enterprise, they must be regarded as very attractive. In private enterprise generally, there is no guarantee that a person whose employment is terminated well before normal retiring age will get any additional lump sum benefit beyond whatever superannuation entitlement he has accumulated to that date. Certainly, with many of the larger companies in private enterprise, it is standard practice for an appropriate compensation to be made, for several months' salary to be paid or for certain benefits to be extended to a person to compensate for the fact that he has been retired early and at an age when it might be difficult to find equivalent employment at an equivalent salary. However, many smaller and medium sized companies- probably most of them- would not be able to afford to provide those sorts of additional benefits in the case of employees who had their employment terminated at an age several years before normal retirement age. </para>
          <para>The question has been posed: Will the Bill allow the Government to get rid of politically unacceptable employees? That is the sort of suggestion that has been floated by some members of the Opposition. They have suggested that the Bill will allow us to get rid of employees whom we deem to be politically unacceptable. That is just not on under the provisions of the Bill before the House. It does not provide for the Government to play any part in selecting individual personnel who will be affected by it. That role is in the hands of departmental heads and the Public Service Board itself. In the interests of maintaining an independent and impartial Public Service, the Bill continues the Westminster tradition of not involving the Government or Ministers in internal personnel matters. The Government's general decisions might have an impact on the numbers of staff required but the Government cannot specify the individuals who will be affected under the provisions of the Bill. </para>
          <para>There has been a suggestion also that the Bill gives excessive power to the Public Service Board to interfere in departments through the redeployment powers. Ultimately, the Board will have the power to redeploy staff in departments. That will happen at the end of the process spelt out in the Bill. But this general power is already given to the Board in the Public Service Act which is on the statutes at the moment. The more detailed provisions in the new Bill are consistent with the role recommended for the Board by the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in handling excess staff cases. It is important to note that it also conforms closely with what some unions have wanted in excess staff situations- for example, in the Health Insurance Commission. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the extent of the application of this Bill. It will apply to all staff of the Australian Public Service and prescribed statutory authorities except those on probation and fixed contracts and temporary employees with less than one year's service. Initially, the Bill will extend only to staff of the Australian Public Service. But there is provision for it to be extended by regulation to cover employees of Commonwealth authorities but only where each particular authority agrees to be so covered. </para>
          <para>Let me repeat the specific and specified grounds on which staff can be identified for redeployment or retirement. They are, firstly, where an employee is one of a class of employees excess to the efficient operating needs of their organisation. Secondly, they apply in the case of physical or mental incapacity; thirdly, they apply for any other reason prescribed in regulations under the Bill. Let me talk about these proposed regulations. Regulations prescribing 'other reasons' can be made only after the Public Service Board has consulted with employee organisations and reported to the Governor-General on the result of those consultations. The 'other reasons' that the Government at present has in mind proposing are, firstly, limited efficiency or an incapacity to perform work at a standard consistent with the efficient working of the organisation and, secondly, loss of an essential licence or qualification which is necessary of the performance of certain functions associated with a position. I suggest that they are very reasonable and limited provisions. Certainly, in private enterprise if someone was of limited efficiency or had lost an essential licence or qualification which was necessary for the performance of the functions of a certain position, there would not be much question about redeployment. In many cases, there would be direct termination of employment and there would be no rights of appeal or guarantees of compensation which are provided for under this Bill. </para>
          <para>Another question which arises and which has been repeated is whether the Bill will allow for the arbitrary sacking of public servants for capricious reasons. The answer is, not at all. The Bill provides for the identification of staff whose services are not being used in the most efficient manner practicable. Staff can be identified only on specified grounds, in accordance with criteria and procedures to be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Government Gazette.</inline> Before retirement can take place, alternative employment opportunities must be thoroughly explored and all staff have rights of appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions taken under the legislation. As I have said before, that is far in excess of the guarantees that would apply in private enterprise. </para>
          <para>Another question is whether the Bill will affect the concept of the career service. We have been used to the concept of the Public Service offering permanency of employment. In the past that permanency of employment has been accepted, at least partly, in compensation for a lower rate of remuneration than would apply in private industry. That certainly has not been the case in recent years because we know that to a large extent the Public Service has been a pacesetter in remuneration and other conditions of employment while still retaining the conditions of permanency of employment subject to the termination provisions which exist under the Public Service Act. </para>
          <para>Under this Bill the concept of a public service with security of tenure for career officials will be preserved. The concept has always been subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act relating to termination of employment of surplus officers, retirement on the grounds of invalidity, inefficiency or incompetence, and dismissal on disciplinary grounds. Indeed, the disciplinary grounds provisions have been used very rarely. I could probably count on the fingers of one hand the number of occasions on which such grounds have been used. This Bill does not effect the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act. It modifies the other provisions which have been described in the past as being of too summary a nature by providing a more extensive range of appeal rights available to staff affected and by setting out more clearly the framework within which decisions are taken. </para>
          <para>As I have said, I believe that this Bill is looked forward to with anticipation by a great many people in the Public Service. The great majority of public servants does not in any way fear the provisions for compulsory retirement. Officers who are confident of their own ability and their own contribution have no reason to fear this legislation. Those officers who might be affected by these provisions have very extensive rights of appeal and in many cases they will obtain extensive additional benefits which are not available to other officers retiring voluntarily or to people in private industry whose employment is terminated for various reasons. I believe that the Bill deserves the support of this House. I believe also that it deserves a speedy passage and that its speedy passage is being looked forward to by a great many public servants who are not being represented by honourable members opposite who are seeking to delay its passage through the Parliament. </para>

            <para>-I would like to deal with one or two matters raised by the honourable member for Casey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Falconer).</inline> The honourable member put to the House that public servants would be angry if the Opposition saw fit to use any of the forms of this House to delay the passage of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. The honourable member guaranteed that the passage of this Bill would not ring the death knell for career public service. He also pointed out that there are comprehensive appeal provisions in the Bill. That is a load of hypocritical claptrap. In the first instance, if the Government were serious about the principle of a career public service, it would have introduced the voluntary retirement provisions as a first measure. It would have done that if it felt that the Public Service was not keeping pace with the availability of employment either now or in the future. In effect, that would have been the way to go about it, but the Government is not fair dinkum. It wants to apply the same philosophy it has applied in endeavouring to bring employees to heel both in the private and public sectors of the community. </para>

              <para>- The Minister took money off the unions for years and he sent them down the drain; so much for maintaining the principle of permanent career service recruitment. A person had to qualify for employment in the Public Service. Employees were guaranteed a career, a service they would render in the interests of all citizens of this country. But following the passage of this Bill a whole range of other conditions will apply in retrospect which were never anticipated by people who sought a career in the Public Service. This Bill will affect not only those who are sick or those who can no longer carry out their jobs. Efficient officers of the Public Service will be dismissed. A rose by any other name; call it what you may. This Bill is called a redeployment and retirement Bill but it is the sack in anybody's language if the end result is the same. I will illustrate the effectiveness of the so-called appeal provisions and the fallacy that is involved in them. The provisions demand that an employee dob in his or her work mate for the sack. It is a competition of toe the line, be a noncontroversial, non-original officer in policy and administration work. The philosophy in this Bill is in keeping with the philosophy in other Bills that has been spelled out and spat out by individuals on the Government side of the House. Deceit and deception have been served up to the trade union movement and other employee organisations in this country.

I refer to Telecom Australia, Australia Post and other authorities which have quite coincidentally adopted the staff levels that the Government has applied. </para><para>In the event of industrial disputation, such as we have in Australia Post, the philosophy of the Government applies once again. It is not left to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to resolve the dispute because by instruction and pressure from the Government the dispute is taken out of that area. I have often thought that the mateship principle, that great Aussie characteristic, has been overplayed in this country. I rather believe that the basic selfishness engendered by pressure from the Government, rather than the sugar-coated myth of mateship, operates when people are competing for jobs. If I am wrong and the spirit of mateship is a driving force in Australian life, in our homes and work places, then this Bill can be seen as a monstrous attempt by the Government to destroy that force. I am now referring to the great appeal provision in the Bill. Here we have a Bill which forcibly redeploys and, I suggest, in practice will forcibly retire public servants whose only means of saving their jobs, saving their careers, saving the income which maintains their families and lifestyles, is to appeal against the declaration which renders them redeployed or retired. But in an appeal, the victim must involve his or her work mates by seeking an alternative employee in the same section to receive the declaration. The only way an employee can escape the arbitrary powers of this Bill, as I indicated before, is by dobbing in his work mate. We have to realise that this is a disgusting and disgraceful position for a government to put its workers in. It is callous, brutal and insensitive- three words which appropriately sum up what this Government is all about- and is carried out very effectively by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> who is seated at the table. I will return to this point later. </para><para>I would like to analyse the motivation for this Bill. It is motivated by the basic philosophy behind the Government's inexorable aim since it stole government in 1975 which simply put, is to put endlessly increasing profits into the pockets of people who own and control and to ensure that the Public Service is going to be the 'whipping horse' of all the people whom the Government represents on that side of the House. So far as the Opposition is concerned, profits are soaring not only in the private sector but also among our authorities for Telecom also is in the business of making a profit. When we seek to analyse what is happening in both areas, we find once again a tax on the employees who are making those profits. The Government has been dedicated to this philosophy since it took office of applying pressure to the Public Service. It seeks to make it the 'whipping horse ' and to hold it out as the scapegoat for the Government's incompetence. Since this Government took office it has handed out investment allowances and massive profits to Government friends and sacked hundreds of thousands of workers whose place in the economic cycle has been taken by technology; but it has totally disregarded where we go from this point. </para><para>So far as the Public Service is concerned, surely the Government has a responsibility not to enlarge the ranks of the unemployed. The Government has a responsibility to the young people of this country to create training facilities and employment opportunities in the Public Service but not by throwing on the scrap heap those who are 55 years of age or thereabouts. In the climate that has been developed through the application of the economic policies of this Government, there is nowhere that a sacked 55-year old person can go. The question of taking away the livelihood of people in the work force and pressuring them into a situation so that they become one of the large group of people out there, hanging out like granny's tooth, suffering the indignity - </para><interjection>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I am asking for your protection from the interjections of the Minister. From the outset the Government has abandoned all its promises to people. I have just read a promise by the Prime Minister to maintain stability in the Public Service. The Government abandons indexation by arguing for no wage increase at all and yet workers who find their wages falling behind are threatened with draconian measures unless they abide by the guidelines. The same philosophy applies in the Bill. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>All that I have said is relevant to the Bill before us because this Government has seen the Public Service as an albatross around the neck of private industry, a drain on the profitability of its friends. It has gone against all the principles of government spending in an unemployment environment by cutting back consistently in the public sector. </para><para>The next Budget strategy will spell out the same approach with the Government putting the squeeze on departments and, by utilising the provisions of this Bill, giving away efficient officers so that it can apply the staff ceilings in the way they have been applied in the past. At a time when the Public Service should be increasing, when money should be made available to local authorities to provide employment on works of public benefit, the Government is forcing its Public Service to operate at skeleton levels and it is undermining the initiative and morale of its work force. </para><para>The Government has imposed staff ceilings on departments, many times arbitrarily, and claimed that these levels can be reached by natural resignations and retirements. But obviously the rate of natural resignation and retirement has not been enough for the squire of Nareen and the other wealthy gentlemen opposite. They have decided to put the screws on their workforce even harder and in the most malicious way imaginable. I cannot think of a better way in which to destroy the morale of the Public Service, whose employees are those for whom the Government ought to have most concern. </para><para>One of the great attractions of the Public Service is destroyed in this Bill. As I have indicated before, the attraction of permanency has been removed. Let us be honest about it; there are many boring jobs in the Public Service, particularly in the early years, and one of its disadvantages is that promotions never really take aptitude and interest into account. A public servant conceivably could go through the normal promotional processes of a career and never do a job which he or she particularly liked or which fully utilised that person's particular talents. Naturally I believe that that does not apply to all public servants. I do not suggest that it' applies even to the majority. However, I do believe that one of the driving forces which leads a person to decide on a Public Service career is the security of permanency. That security, as I said, is destroyed by this Bill. </para><para>The Government is applying in a retrospective way a set of rules that will affect the lives of thousands of people who are working in the Public Service. The effects of compulsory retirement as set out in this Bill will shatter many of the individuals who have budgeted for their future. It is not a question of whether they are efficient or have the capacity to do the job; it is a question of whether they have become redundant by virtue of the fact that there are just too many people in a department or in a particular area. </para><para>The Bill refers to redeployment, but I believe the thrust of the Bill is to reduce the number of public servants. Surely that cannot be denied. I contend that, in a huge mapority of cases, it will be found that no suitable vacancy will be found elsewhere and the employee will be sacked. The euphemism used in the Bill is 'retired'. I have seen exactly the same situation occur in the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. There we saw the same circumstances and the same processes, and the same sugar-coated operation was laid down in regulations that were provided for the purpose of retrenching people when the power houses in Victoria began to shut down to give way to changes in technology. The same sort of situation applied at that time. In the SEC in Victoria a person was confronted with two alternatives. Either he retired or he accepted a job many hundreds of miles away from where he was brought up, had his stakes or lived with his family, in which case he would have to pick up stakes and move to a place where one would not send his worst enemy. I refer to the coalfields around Yallourn. </para><para>The principle in this Bill is the same. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has been champing at the bit to talk about this wonderful system of appeals. We heard the honourable member for Casey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Falconer)</inline> spell out what a wonderful system it is. But it contains that very philosophy of a person having to toe the line, be non-controversial, non-original and prepared to barter with the individual alongside him by saying: 'I should not be sacked; it should be you'. That is a great state of affairs. That builds up a great sense of comradeship and mateship in a work situation which is supposed to be a public service. The power to declare that employees are in excess of requirements is frightening, both <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> the viewpoint of the employees who become its direct victims and for those who remain. Those who remain then have the pressure applied to them. </para><interjection>

              <para>- The honourable member for La Trobe will not be here after the next election so he will not have to worry about anything. Those who remain in the Public Service will find themselves working under increased and unfair pressure, working excessive overtime under the continual, morale-draining strain of wondering when the next round of cuts will be ordered and, again, when the department or section will be declared 'in excess'. It is an arbitrary power against which there is no appeal. The appeals tribual established in this Bill gives the employee the right to appeal only against his or her personal declaration. The result is that we have this sad state of affairs when one individual has to compete directly against another. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>Clause 7 also gives frightening powers to the Government and its permanent heads. It outlines the reasons under which an employee may be redeployed or retired and lists, first, the 'in excess' clause and, secondly, physical or mental incapacity. It then lists the most terrifying news for public servants: 'for any other prescribed reason '. Fancy putting that power in the hands of individuals like the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baillieu),</inline> the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs or the honourable member for Casey. For God's sake, it would be like making friends with a rattlesnake. That power, along with the basic motivation of this Bill, means the end of permanency and the end of the capacity of public servants to see themselves as rendering a service without the fear of people applying undue pressure on them throughout their careers. They should be able to look forward to the end of their working life and not be forced into a situation of premature retirement. People may like all the sop that is being put to them, but if the Government is serious about voluntary retirement it should have introduced that provision in the first instance and given it a trial. If that had worked out there would have been no reason to include the other provisions now contained in the Bill. </para><continue>

            <para>-Before discussing the matters which have been raised by the honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes)</inline> I think it would be worth while going through the details of the Bill so that we know what we are talking about. It seems that both he and the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> have read only the letters from the union secretary and have not read the Bill. On many occasions members of the Public Service have come to me complaining about what they see as inefficiencies in their departments. Some have suggested that they have insufficient work to do. More often they have come complaining of others in their department who are not being fully utilised. I think this latter problem is one which can be deleterious to the morale of any worker, be he in the Public Service or within the private enterprise sector. People who are doing a normal day's work but who are consistently in the company of others who have little to do may feel distracted by the other person's obvious free time, or may become concerned about the apparently inequitable work load or be genuinely embarrassed by the waste of public funds. Of course, depending on the nature of the person involved, they may even feel jealous of those with little or nothing to do. This sort of problem can arise in the Public Service because of the nature of the work involved, where the work load can change dramatically at different times throughout the year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Another feature of the Public Service which concerned me was the lack of independent advice given to those responsible for the efficient working of the various departments or sections. I have spoken before in this House of the need for efficiency audits. I am pleased to say that these have now been implemented by this Government. These audits should enable an independent assessment of the means by which the objectives of the section or department are being met. I believe that this Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill will be of assistance in both areas which I have mentioned. The Bill aims to increase the efficient and economic use of staff within the Public Service. </para>
          <para>Clause 9 of the Bill states that the permanent head of a department is responsible for ensuring that the department operates in such a manner as to make efficient and economical use of the services of the persons employed in that department. It then sets out the means by which this aim is to be achieved. Surely the role of government is not only to provide programs to serve the needs of the Australian population but also to ensure that those programs are carried out efficiently. After all, it is the general public, the taxpayer, who is paying for such programs. </para>
          <para>This Bill enables employees to be redeployed. The objects are set out in clause 7. I think these objects are worth reading out to the Parliament. Clause 7 reads: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1">
              <para>) The objects of this Part are- first, to ensure, to the greatest extent that it is practicable, that each Department and each prescribed Commonwealth authority operates in such a manner as to make efficient and economical use of the services of the persons employed in the Department or by the authority; . . . secondly, to ensure, to the greatest extent that is practicable, that each employee in a Department, and each employee of a prescribed Commonwealth authority, whose services cannot, consistently with the achievement of the first object of this Part, reasonably be used in the department or by the authority . . . </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The clause then sets out the various grounds upon which employees may be declared to be eligible for redeployment or retirement. I think these are worth listing. They relate to people who, because of a physical or mental incapacity, are incapable of performing their duty or, secondly, to people who are excess to the number of employees required in that department or, thirdly, to those who come within the areas to be prescribed. The Government has already made it clear that it will be looking to prescribe those persons who no longer have an essential licence or qualification to be able to carry out the job, or those with limited efficiency or an incapacity to perform work at a standard consistent with the efficient working of the organisation. It is important to note that regulations prescribing these other reasons can be made only after the Public Service Board has consulted with employee organisations and reported to the Governor-General on the results of those consultations. </para>
          <para>Take the case of a person who falls within one of these categories and becomes eligible for redeployment. Clause 10 of the Bill makes it mandatory for the departments and the authorities to notify the Public Service Board that an employee or group of employees has been declared under this Bill. The employee also must be informed. The Board then has a responsibility to endeavour to redeploy the declared employee or employees within another area of Commonwealth employment. Included in clause11 is the obligation on the Board to look at the feasibility of retraining any declared employee. The honourable member for Melbourne had not read the Bill. He knew nothing about that; he was saying: 'Why do we not put it in?' Under this Bill the employee also has rights of appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions taken under the legislation. Appeals can be made against the decisions of the department or authority to declare any employee to be eligible for redeployment. The employee can also appeal against a particular redeployment action proposed to be taken by the Board. For example, where a reduction in salary would be involved he has the right of appeal. Similarly, a decision by the Board that redeployment is not practical can be appealed against. Clause15, sub-clauses (5) and (6) of the Bill allow for other employees to be joined as a party to the appeal where they may be affected by the result of the appeal; for example, in a case where a department head decides that he has excess numbers in his department. </para>
          <para>It is these provisions which the Public Service unions have criticised. Newspaper reports suggest that the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association is to strike over the passing of this Bill. I have read all the documents which were sent to me by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Blunden,</inline> who I think is the Australian Capital Territory branch secretary of the ACOA, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Munro,</inline> the federal secretary. An example of the contents of that information which was sent to members of parliament was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Munro</inline> 's statement, which reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There will now be machinery potentially capable of being used to dismantle or discredit any element of the Public Service which offers objective and independent advice to a nonreceptive Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those same words were used by the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Port Adelaide, who, as I have said, read the letters but did not read the Bill. I can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Munro</inline> 's position as secretary of his union. Obviously he would want to obtain Utopian working conditions for his members if he could. However, members of this Parliament have a wider responsibility, both to the Australian public and to the Public Service. We must maintain a balance between the efficient management of Government programs while ensuring proper pay and working conditions for those in the employ of the Government. This Bill enables departments, authorities and the Public Service Board to adjust the staffing resources of the departments to meet the changes in policies or priorities that the Government might make. In taking policy decisions, in creating or doing away with certain departments, the Government is continuously accountable to the Parliament and ultimately to the Australian public at elections. If the Government does not like the news reports emanating from the Australian Broadcasting Commission, it can pass legislation to abandon the ABC, or just the news section of the ABC. However, I suggest it would be a brave Government which undertook such a move on a purely political ground. </para>

              <para>-I was saying that the Government could undertake a move on political grounds to abandon the ABC or abandon the news section of the ABC. Obviously it would take a brave government to do that. Certainly this Bill does not make such a move any more practical than the current situation allows, despite what the honourable member for Port Adelaide and the honourable member for Melbourne, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Munro</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Blunden,</inline> might try to suggest to certain elements within the Public Service. </para>

          <para>I now move to the retirement provisions of the Bill. I understand that a number of people are looking forward to the implementation of clause 1 7 of the Bill, which will allow those who have given their service to the people of Australia in the Commonwealth Public Service to retire at 55 years of age. Some may feel that after many long years of service they have done their job or they may wish to move to other areas. Clause 17 of the Bill provides that they will be entitled to retire on a pension which is less than that which they would obtain if they retired at a later date. In general terms, a person retiring at the age of 55 will receive approximately 36 per cent of final salary as compared with about 45 per cent for a person retiring at 60 years of age. We now have the situation that if a person on a standard government financed superannuation pension retires at the age of 65, he will receive 50 percent of his final salary plus a refund of accumulated contributions with interest, which reduces to 45 per cent of salary at the age of 60 and 36 per cent of salary at 55 years of age. In those examples I have assumed that the person involved has had a service of about 30 years. Of course, he would get additional benefits for the number of years served. </para>
          <para>Clause 23 of the Bill provides the basis for making regulations for those employees who are being retired by management; that is, nonvoluntarily. It is intended that the regulations will provide benefits to persons who are retired by reason of their loss of qualification or limited efficiency of persons between 55 and 60 years of age. To them will be provided a lump sum payment equivalent to two months salary for each year of forgone service between 55 and 60 years of age. The other cases of management initiated retirement are already covered by the provisions of the Superannuation Act and determinations of the Public Service Arbitrators. Thus, a person who is compulsorily retired at the age of 55 could obtain up to 10 months salary as a lump sum compensation for service forgone. It is important to clarify this point because at first sight it could appear to be unduly beneficial to those who are compulsorily retired compared with those who voluntarily retire at 55 years of age. The person who is compulsorily retired gets this lump sum compensation which is not available to those who retire voluntarily. </para>
          <para>I telephoned a number of the larger Australian employers and, having discussed the matter with them, I was satisfied that these provisions did not fall into the pacesetter category, bearing in mind the size of the employer and the job prospects of the employee. It ought to be remembered also that those who voluntarily retire at the age of 55 or later presumably do so for reasons best known to themselves. They may have greener pastures to go to whereas those who are compulsorily retired at the age of 55 or above may well not have many job opportunities open to them. I wish to deal briefly with some of the points which were raised by the honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Port Adelaide in previous speeches. They were clearly political speeches based on the letters that they had received from their union bosses in the Public Service. </para>

Somebody said that he was a lawyer. I thought: 'Well, that cannot be right after that performance here tonight. No lawyer could make so many mistakes in reading a Bill and so misunderstanding a Bill as the honourable member for Barker did'. He spoke of political speeches in this chamber. For goodness sake, if this is not a forum for political speeches where is there such a forum? Like members of the Liberal Party, he likes to walk away from the fact that these matters are motivated politically. He even denies that the Bill itself is motivated politically. I have the great honour this week, to be acting Whip for the Australian Labor Party. As such I have the honour to preparing the speakers list for this debate and others. It came to my attention on reading the Bill that the member of this chamber who has greatest contact with the Public Service, the honourable member for Canberra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Haslem),</inline> is not listed to speak. He is not in the chamber. He has not been in the chamber. When there is a division called on this matter I will be interested to see how he votes. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Barker is trying to deny what I am saying. If he really knows about public servants- I have grave doubt in my mind that he does after his speech tonight- then he would know that the people in those areas are really worked out of their minds because this Government, with your indulgence, sir, if I can engage in a bit of politicking at the risk of offending the honourable member for Barker, has done a most curious thing. The Government has increased the number of unemployed people in Australia. It has brought hardship to those people who are trying to collect their unemployment benefit. It has pressed down on those who are receiving their social security benefits. For goodness sake, with the highest unemployment rate that we have had in this country for 40 years or more, with more people seeking social security because of the actions of this Government, how does this Government solve the situation? It seeks to resolve the situation by decreasing the number of people who are providing a service. What sort of rationale is there in that? Only the honourable member for Barker could justify such a situation. I cannot, no member of the Australian Labor Party can and, I might say, more than half of the Australian community cannot. If the Government wants to test that assertion then let us have an election and find out. It will not pick up that challenge. </para>

              <para>-I hear the mouth from the north of Melbourne speaking. I was not sure whether it was the honourable member for Holt or his bees speaking. It was one or the other. They both make the same sort of sense. The honourable member for Barker spoke about the appeals tribunal. He made some great play of the fact that clause16 of the Bill sets up an appeals tribunal and he then read out that clause. I will repeat it because I want the House to understand how this appeals tribunal is loaded against the employee; how the employee has not got a hope in hell with such a tribunal. I spent a life time dealing with such tribunals. Let us see what clause 16 says about the first person to be appointed, the  Chairman.  Sub-clause (2) (a) states that the tribunal shall be constituted by a  Chairman  who: </para>

So he would seek the advice of his Minister as to whom he should appoint as Chairman. That is the practice, is it not? Nobody denies that. There is no demur. It is accepted by the House that that is the practice. That is one against the employee. Clause 16 (2) (b) states that the Tribunal shall also be constituted by: </para>

          <para class="block">So the person who sacked him then becomes part of the tribunal to whom he appeals against his sacking. That is quite a fair proposition, is it not? At this point we have two people against the employee. The third person, the only one of those three who will fight for the right of the employee, is one person nominated as provided in the regulations to represent employees. The honourable member for Barker used more than once the expression 'their Public Service union bosses'. Of course, the honourable gentleman is renowned for hislack of astuteness in the field of politics. Of course, if he were awake in that field and aware in that area he would know that the public servants of Australia did not give the Labor Party particularly great support in the last two elections. As a consequence, I think it is most incongruous that the honourable gentleman should talk about our Public Service union bosses. In fact, I find it offensive, but then I find the honourable member for Barker offensive too. But at least he is honest. </para>
          <para>He then went on, and I was curious about this. It really got to me. Things seldom reach me, but this really did. After saying that there is a need for this Bill, he gave us all sorts of tendentious reasons why the Bill should be in existence. Goodness gracious me! The Minister referred to sections 20 and 67 of the Public Service Act. He told the House- I have no reason to dispute the honourable gentleman; he is quite noted for his honesty and straightforwardness- that those two sections of the Public Service Act are the same as the provisions of this Bill. Such a statement makes my mind all the more suspicious. I was suspicious the moment that this legislation was brought in. I do not trust the Liberals. In company with about 90 per cent of the people of Australia I do not trust the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I do not trust the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> who introduced the Bill either. </para>

              <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. I</inline> am glad of your protection. I really need it. Let me refer to the language that is used in the Bill and to Division 2 which refers to 'compulsory retirement'. Why cannot members of the Government be honest and use words such as 'dismissal' or 'sack'? That is what 'compulsory retirement' means. It is a mee comfortable expression, but why does the Government not have the courage to say 'sacked'? </para>

          <para>I bring honourable members now to clause 7 of the Bill which is contained in Part II- Redeployment of Employees'. I note that the issue has already been canvassed. It needs canvassing deeply. When we speak about the rights of employees to appeal, we are talking about individual employees only. If the honourable member for Barker and other Government members read this Bill they will find that there can be no appeal against a declaration that a class of people is redundant. The declaration will stand. The only thing that can happen is that those who are declared to be within the class have a right to appeal against their dismissal because they are redundant. They can appeal individually. If 1 9 people in a department make up a class and a declaration is made those 19 people will be disposed of. They will be sacked. So, if the class comprises 19 people and one person appeals against himself being included in that 1 9, the only action he can take is to say, 'It shan 't ' be me; it should be him'. He has to dob in one of his mates.  His  only right of appeal is against being included in the class of people about whom the declaration is made. If his appeal is successful, somebody else has to be dragged into the breach. The class comprises a number of people, and that number of people, irrespective of who they are, must go. I do not think many Government members understand that aspect, but that is the clear intention of the whole question of redeployment and retirement. </para>
          <para>The most offensive part of clause 7 ( 1 ) (b) (hi) is the terrible expression 'for any other prescribed reason'. We are talking about people. The prescription is not laid down. The expression is as broad as the horizon itself- it is 360 degrees broad. Nothing could be more offensive than that provision. Nothing could be more all embracing. In fact, the Government need write nothing else in that clause except that expression. I believe there is a need to delete that expression altogether. The clause loses nothing by the deletion of those words. If the Government were sincere, it would realise that the clause loses nothing by the deletion of that expression. The Government is not being sincere. It wants those words in the clause so that it can be used as a last resort. If the Government cannot get a fellow under clause 7 (1) (b) or (a) or paragraphs (i) or (ii) of sub-clause (b) it can rely on paragraph (iii) to clean him up 'good and proper', to use a colloquialism. The provision is so wide and all-encompassing that it allows the Government to do all things to the employee. Irrespective of what the honourable member for Barker says, they do not include the sorts of things against which the employee has a right of appeal. It is a most offensive provision. I suggest, in line with the amendment that has been moved, that there is a need to withdraw this Bill and redraft it. </para>

              <para>-No chance of it! How will the honourable member ever be persuaded by reasonable and rational argument if he has already made up his mind. This is the sort of reaction that we have to put up with. Honourable members opposite are intransigent. They will not listen to common sense. They are hopeless! The proposition really concerns two matters in the Bill. If the Government is really talking about reducing the size of the Public Service even further, I would not quarrel with the early retirement provision. As I understand it, the unions have no quarrel with that provision. Why does the Government not give that proposal a go and see how many people will take advantage of it before it uses these draconian measures and takes people out and puts them into stocks- that is virtually what it is doing. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I support the amendment that has been moved. I cannot see that there is a need for such a draconian measure unless the Government is of the view that it needs these sorts of broad brush open-ended clauses in the Bill so that it can do things that I believe should not be done. I am not putting public servants in a special position. I believe that they are employees of the Parliament. They are not the exclusive servants of the Government but employees of the Parliament because they do the work that the Parliament says ought to be done. I am very much afraid that the Bill leaves the whole matter in the hands of the Executive- that is the Government and Ministers. It gives no voice to the Parliament in this matter. The honourable member for Barker placed these people in the same category as, I suppose, the Ford Motor Co. Pty Ltd factory employees. There are peaks and troughs in their periods of employment. The Government wants to rub people out. The honourable member has misunderstood the fact that the Public Service is part of the political bureaucracy of this country. Anybody who denies that is misunderstanding the situation. There is a need for the Public Service in this country to work unafraid of pressure from the politicians. Yet, because of these provisions public servants will be forever terrified of the pressure of the politicians. It is an area to which no public servants should ever be exposed. They should be able to give advice to the government of the day on questions asked by that government and matters confronting that government without the fear of retribution should there be a change of government which, of course, will occur at the next elections. This aspect is misunderstood by Government members. They believe that they were born to rule. They believe that they will sit on that side of the House forever more. I have news for honourable members, and none of it is good. Honourable members will not. After the next elections, honourable members opposite who survive will be over here and we will be over there. Our numbers will be greatly swelled. We will sit on the Government benches. We would not want to see - </para>

              <para>- I meant the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner).</inline> I emphasise the word 'affairs'. The honourable member for Macquarie and the Minister quoted selected sections from the transcript of an employment conference held recently at Penrith which gave an incorrect impression of what the honourable member for Prospect intended to convey to that conference. I thought that this was rather an unseemly attack upon his neighbour. I would not have commented on this matter tonight or referred to another transcript which I have of an employment conference if that attack had not been made. In fact, I have sat on the transcript for a long time- for over a year. I was not going to use it but I now feel that in view of that attack I must bring the facts before this Parliament. If I recollect correctly, there was an employment conference early last year. It was held at the same site as this recent employment conference. The honourable member for Prospect attended that conference in the morning. I attended it in the afternoon. I raised the need for Commonwealth assistance for the promotion of industry in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. That is a very vital need. I was advised that the honourable member for Macquarie had already given a statement to the conference that morning that these funds were available from the Commonwealth Government. As I knew nothing of that matter I asked for a copy of the transcript of that conference. I quote from a letter I received from the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils. It states: </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-My remarks tonight are, I hope, the first in a series of some 10 adjournment debate speeches which members on this side of the House hope to make over the next couple of weeks on various aspects of the economic situation facing the Government and the policy options open to the Government in tackling these situations. I will attempt to couch my remarks in non-technical language because I believe that one of the problems the Government has in its communications with the Australian public is some lack of explaining its policies in simple terms. Tonight I want to talk about the effects of Budget deficits. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The deficit is simply the gap between the amount a government spends and the amount it raises in taxes and other charges such as excise on petrol, cigarettes and the like. This gap has to be financed by borrowing. Like any other organisation, such as a company, the Government's books must, in simple accounting terms, balance. With a Budget deficit the gap is filled by borrowing. The Government can borrow in one of three ways: It can borrow from overseas; it can borrow internally from the non-banking public; or it can borrow internally from the banking system, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. </para>
          <para>A Budget deficit has two effects: A fiscal effect and a monetary effect. Although both can be considered separately they are in fact closely interwoven. It used to be assumed in the Keynesian economic literature that a Budget deficit was automatically expansionary in a fiscal policy sense. Therefore, in an economy where there was a lack of sufficient overall demand to employ people in the work force and to keep industry working at a high level of capacity, the theory ran that government should add to overall aggregate demand by running a Budget deficit. Conversely the theory said that at a time of excessive demand, the Government should reduce its net call on resources by running a Budget surplus. </para>
          <para>This theory assumed a world in which we no longer live. In particular, it assumed that the prices of the factors of production, including labour, would move upwards or downwards in real terms depending on the demand for them. This is no longer so- if it ever was. For one thing, the strength of the trade union movement in protecting real income ensures that. The theory also suffered from the major weakness of largely ignoring monetary effects of a Budget deficit. These monetary effects appear to have assumed increasing importance and significance in recent times. </para>
          <para>Nowadays, the rate of growth of the money supply is generally regarded as being of great importance- although not necessarily of sole importance- in influencing the level of inflation. It is also, nowadays, generally accepted that a high level of inflation leads to increased unemployment and a reduced level of economic growth. A reduced level of economic growth in turn makes it more difficult for the community as a whole, generally working through the Government, to provide those welfare, education, health, and other services that modern communities seem increasingly to demand. The larger the Government deficit the larger the rate of increase in the rate of growth of the money supply, other things being equal. To maintain an increase in the money supply sufficient to provide for economic growth without at the same time being inflationary, if the Government's contribution- via its Budget deficit- to the money supply increases, the less must be the contribution by the non-government, or private sector. </para>

              </talker>
              <para>- If the honourable member were to listen, he would learn something. For example, if the desired increase in the money supply in a particular year is say 10 per cent and the Government is contributing say 6 per cent of this 10 per cent, then that only leaves 4 per cent increase for the private sector. On the other hand, if the Government's Budget deficit contributed only 4 per cent of the 10 per cent increase, then this would leave 6 per cent for the private sector- in other words, 50 per cent more for the private sector than in my first example. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Therefore, if the Government pre-empts a large amount of the increase in the money supply to itself, this tends to starve the private sector of funds unless highly inflationary conditions are created. The result is a squeeze on the private sector and an increase in the rates of interest to be paid for money by the private sector. This in turn has serious adverse effects on private sector activity and, therefore, on employment. It must never be forgotten that it is the private sector in Australia which provides 75 per cent of all jobs. </para>
          <para>The simple fact is that over the past five years successive Federal governments in Australia have been running very large deficits which have had major detrimental effects on the private sector. It may be thought, and, indeed, this may be so, that a policy of returning to a situation of healthy and economic private sector growth in this country through severe restraint on government spending, through increases in taxation or a combination of both, may have short-term difficulties, but the long-term difficulties are much more significant. </para>

              <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>perhaps I had better speak to you because government members do not choose to listen. As I see it from an examination of the figures, there is a very great difference in the relationship between the growth in the money supply from country to country in relation to the gross domestic product and the actual money supply itself in relation to the trading position. The same applies to deficits. What does the honourable member mean by deficit'? As I understand it from looking at the figures, this year the Government's current expenditure will be about $25,500m and its revenue will be about $26,000m so that on current account there will be a surplus of about $500m. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">The other $2,000m or $3,000m or whatever mess the Government has made of the situation is to meet the capital commitment of the country. I am with the honourable member, if I gather correctly what he said at the beginning of his speech, that we ought to be looking at methods of getting that money other than from taxation. That is the Middle Ages approach to the economic system and it will not get us anywhere. </para>
          <para>I rose tonight really to speak about a matter that has come to my notice as a result of a recent safari, one might say, that I made to Rhodesia. I am not making a report on that tonight; I am just making a retort. A Nigerian High Commission news release of 3 May 1979, issued in the Australian Capital Territory and entitled 'Nigeria Government Statement on the April 20th Election in Zimbabwe' came into my possession. I will not read it all, but I will read some of it: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Federal Military Government has no desire to dignify the sham elections that have just taken place in Zimbabwe with even a statement of condemnation. </para>
            <para>The elections, even if they were free and fair, which they were not, failed to meet the objective criteria established by Security Council resolutions . . . The elaborately contrived confidence tricks that characterised the elections were a deserving insult to the intelligence of those international meddlers and the institutions which sent them . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I regard that as an insulting remark by the Nigerian High Commission to the members of this Parliament who went to Rhodesia to make an objective survey of the situation. Since returning to Australia we have made no statement about whether we should or should not recognise Rhodesia or whether we should or should not lift sanctions. I suggest that honourable members get hold of this document and read it because it is simply a diatribe against the whole system. It bears very little relationship to the facts and it is issued by the high commission of a government that has not held an election for at least 13 or 14 years. Under its military government, Nigeria has suffered disastrous civil wars. There has been  no freedom in the country. Its people would not know what an election was. I wish Nigeria well in its proposed elections in October of this year, but I hope that the Nigerian High Commission will understand what I am saying. I intend to ensure that, as far as possible, the people of Australia understand what the Commission has said about the representatives of this Parliament who visited Rhodesia. </para>
          <para>Later in this diatribe one notes that threats are made against any country which chooses to lift sanctions or accord recognition. I do not think international relations will prosper while that attitude is adopted by one of the significant countries of Africa- indeed, its largest country- a member of the Security Council, and one upon which we rely to prevent wars. The great difficulty with the Security Council at the moment is that those countries which are supposed to be preventing war are sponsoring it. Britain and America are by their attitude sponsoring the Patriotic Front and the Chinese and the Russians are supplying it with arms. If tonight the Rhodesian forces were overwhelmed by Cuban and Libyan infantry, if Salisbury were invested and its people slaughtered, other countries would rush in and recognise the new government tomorrow.

            <para>- I want tonight to deal with something much closer to our homes and our families than the wider field that has just been discussed. If possible, this debate should be reserved for matters that concern electorates. The number of instances of breakdown in family life, of people suddenly, for some unknown reason, finding themselves thrown out of a home, of the collapse of family life, or of some such serious incident occurring in households, is now on the increase. Indeed, it is on a scale that has never been known before. We are supposed to live in a society which is infinitely prosperous, in which human relations are better understood than ever before, but my experience has been that our social services are not yet geared to deal with the tragedies that occur following family breakdown; that we do not know quite how to handle that situation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>For example, only a week ago a local newspaper published a photograph of a boy aged 13 who had nowhere to go. He had been found by a police officer sleeping out, and did not know what to do. There had been an upset in his household and he had virtually run away. I am very worried as to whether our welfare organisations are capable of handling the situation that we face. We all accept that the Uniting Church and the Catholic Church- indeed all the churches in our electorates- do their very best to assist broken families; but when it comes down to employing permanently people who can help, to finding a refuge for these people, or to these people being told what they should do in these circumstances, I am sorry to say that members of our society still seem to say: 'Well, it is hard luck for them; it does not happen in my family'. I am sorry that I cannot accept that. Both the church community and the welfare authorities in my area have said that there seems to be some misunderstanding as to who is responsible for action in this field. Does responsibility lie with the governments of Victoria or New South Wales, or is the responsibility in such tragic circumstance that of the Federal Government? As long as this malaise occurs I believe that those who work in the welfare field will be at a disadvantage. </para>
          <para>Therefore, I would recommend to the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> the Government and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that upon the agenda of the forthcoming Premiers Conference there shall be placed without fail, at my request and that of this Parliament, an item requiring that a decision be taken as to who is in fact responsible for the support and funding of family welfare organisations in the States. Until this is done some people will say that the responsibility to support family welfare lies with the Federal Government. Other people will say that the responsibility to assist these organisations lies with the State Government. I am sorry that as a Liberal I simply cannot allow the situation to go on any further. Therefore, I call upon the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom),</inline> who is at the table, to take note of my speech tonight and communicate to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Premiers that I am not prepared to countenance a situation in which there is no proper support, either State or Federal, where there has been a family breakdown because the State and Federal authorities are quarrelling amongst themselves about who is primarily responsible. I hope this matter is put right without any further delay. </para>

            <para>- I rise tonight to discuss an issue that is very important in my electorate. It concerns a matter that has reached the front pages of most newspapers in New South Wales over the last few days, that is, the safety of the Mount Ousley pass which is the main road into Wollongong. Last Friday a runaway coal truck claimed five lives. I believe there have been 13 fatalities on that road in the past two years. This raises the whole problem of the transportation of coal by road haulage in New South Wales, particularly in my electorate. We have a coal loader which at present loads about 6.3 million tonnes of coal a year, of which 4.6 million tonnes per year is currently transported by road. I should like honourable members to consider what that means. It means that there are at least 600 round trips per day to the Port Kembla coal loader on 350 days a year. When one counts the return trips that means 1,200 trips. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We are now considering the construction of a new coal loader which will export 14 million to 15 million tonnes of coal per year, mostly to Japan. It was proposed that 10.8 million tonnes be transported by rail and about 3.5 million tonnes by road. If that were the case it would mean that coal from mines such as Westcliffe, South Bulli, Avon and Yellow Rock would still be transported by road. I am pleased to note that the Minister for Public Works in New South Wales is saying that he will restrict the road haulage to 2 million tonnes. That will mean that the coal from the major mine at South Bulli will have to be transported by rail, probably by a rail link to the Illawarra line or a conveyor belt. It will also mean that all the coal from Burragorang Valley will have to be transported through the metropolitan rail system. </para>
          <para>The point I make is that this will mean that coal from the Westcliffe mine and any excess coal from the Burragorang Valley will still come down the Mount Ousley road. Certain members of the Liberal Party in the Federal and State spheres have seized upon the recent deplorable accident to make the point that the coal loader should be constructed at Botany Bay. That is not the point. If a new loader is constructed elsewhere in New South Wales, coal will still be hauled by road from Westcliffe and the Burragorang Valley. Some 3.5 million tonnes per year would still come down Mount Ousley. A new coal loader is required. However, in my electorate we also say that the coal trucks must come off the road. That means that a rail line should be built between Douglas Park and Helensburgh, or a conveyor belt system constructed from the Illawarra line to the South Bulli line, thence over the escarpment to Westcliffe. </para>
          <para>We then come to the question of who pays. That is surely the fundamental question. Should it be the taxpayer or should we apply the good old capitalist principle that the buyer or the user pays- in this case, the Japanese? I now want to protest about the fact that, while we were battling to get funds in the electorates of Cunningham, Hughes and Macarthur to get the coal trucks off the road, we saw the spectacle earlier this year of the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> being unwilling to force his own parameters on export tonnages. The industry lost some $4.5m from two mines- $9m in total- over two years. That could have provided the tax or levy base to raise funds to construct railway lines or conveyor belts. The Federal Government should have taxed that tonnage and returned the funds to New South Wales to get the coal trucks off the road. </para>
          <para>Many things can be done in the short term regarding Mt Ousley. We could put a weighbridge at the top, which would at least make the trucks stop at the check station. We could make the truck drivers use low gear or drive in one lane. But the fundamental question will still remain: Until we get an adequate tax base on coal and until the Federal Government plays its role and returns money to the States to provide the proper rail transport for a vital export commodity, lives will continue to be lost in my electorate because of the unwelcome coal haulage monsters carrying coal down the escarpment to the Port Kembla coal loader. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- Tonight I want to talk about the difficult problem of making Australian industry, and particularly manufacturing industry, more competitive. This problem has been the subject of two major inquiries in recent years- those of Jackson and Crawford- in addition to innumerable lesser studies by government and private bodies. It has also had the continuing attention of the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary Assistance Authority. One often hears the question: 'When are the inquiries going to stop and action begin?' Implied in that question, of course, is 'action by government'. It overlooks a wide range of government measures designed to assist manufacturing industry, but also overlooks the more fundamental requirement for action by industry itself. Fortunately many businesses have taken action to put themselves into a more competitive position, thus protecting their long term investment and the jobs of thousands of Australians now and in the future. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Basically the message of Jackson, repeated by Crawford, is that the Australian market is not big enough for Australian industry to nourish, and that it can do well in the future only by exploiting carefully selected world markets. In other words there must be a switch from products and services designed essentially for the domestic market to new products and new services designed for export markets. The conundrum, of course, is that the process of change causes disruption of employment, but if change does not occur, employment prospects in the medium to long term suffer. I do not believe that the change is occurring rapidly enough for our longer term comfort. How many firms in Australia have as a major component of their business strategy, under the close surveillance of top management, a serious export marketing program? How many are devoting at least as much effort to product or service development and market analysis for exports as they are to the domestic scene? Not very many, I believe. If one asks each firm as one visits it about its research and development and export marketing functions, one will often find them only in embryo, or as a sideline to the main business activity. </para>
          <para>I am convinced that this vital fundamental shift in business strategies will not occur until it becomes demonstrably more profitable to make the change, and demonstrably more dangerous to avoid it. This means a combination of carrot and stick- the carrot of export incentives, as recommended by Crawford, and the stick of progressive tariff reductions, as wrapped in cotton wool by Crawford. Half of our industry is owned by overseas business, established to exploit the Australian domestic market. We welcomed it; we encouraged it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley</inline> encouraged it. We are grateful for it. It has made a massive contribution to our managerial and technical skills. </para>
          <para>Let us now take the steps necessary to harness this powerful machine to our new objectives, by making it more profitable to export and perilous to rely solely on the Australian market. It is essential that, if Australia is to swing the bulk of its manufacturing industry in the direction which is essential for our future survival, we ensure that the overseas-owned half of it plays a major part in that change. The way we can do that is to make certain that those who make the decisions in those companies, be they the Australian managers of them or the overseas investors in them, are required to examine where the future of their investment lies. They must be given the incentive to do that and to export. They run the peril of losing the investment by progressive tariff reductions, making it unprofitable to continue to exploit only the domestic market. </para>

              <para>At the Sixth Preparatory Meeting on Cooper (26 February to 2 March1979) the US delegation tabled a paper described as a contribution to efforts to develop a workable approach to stabilisation in the copper market. The delegation emphasised that its presentation should not be construed as committing the U.S. to a negotiating conference for an international agreement for cooper. The Meeting decided that an Intergovernmental Group of Experts, which will meet in Geneva in the period 25 June to 6 July1979, should examine the implication and effectiveness and the costs to both producers and consumers of copper, of an international arrangement for copper. The Group will be expected to take into account a number of proposals and statements which appear in the documents of the various Preparatory Meetings that have discussed copper, including the US paper. </para>

              <para>The US paper outlined the framework of a possible buffer stock stabilisation scheme that would have as principal objectives the reduction of copper price fluctuations and the stabilisation of copper prices around the longer term trend. The scheme would be based on a substantial international buffer stock, with a reference price to be adjusted according to maket price trends and the activity of the buffer stock. Supply and demand would determine market prices within ranges or bands above and below the reference price, these bands to be sufficiently wide to moderate cyclical price movements without interfering with seasonal or day-to-day fluctuations. </para>

            <item label="(4)">
              <para>No. The Australian Government supports multilateral action involving producers and consumers to overcome international commodity problems. The US proposal is one of a number of measures that has been put forward as a possible means of stabilising the world copper market. The Australian Government, in consultation with the Australian copper industry, is examining closely the implications of developments at the UNCTAD meetings on cooper, with a view to determining what measures, if any, would be practicable and feasible. </para>

Passengers wishing to travel to points not currently served on services from Australia would be able to combine these pointtopoint fares with normal add-on fares. In this way, it should be possible to travel to all points in the Middle East at fares lower than those currently available. </para>

              <para>No. The Aboriginal and Islander Commission appointed by the Queensland Government in 1977 recommended in its report issued in November 1978 'that full award wages be implemented for those people working on reserve communities'.

          </list>
          <para>In 1975 the Commonwealth Parliament enacted the Racial Discrimination Act and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act in order to supersede certain provisions of the Queensland legislation which had the effect of discriminating against Queensland Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. These laws are available for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to use and legal advice is available to those wishing to do so, in particular through the Queensland Aborginal and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service. </para>
          <para>When the Queensland Government announced its intention of imposing direct official management by the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement on the reserve communities of Aurukun and Mornington Island in March 1978, the Commonwealth Government introduced the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act. When the Queensland Government revoked the two reserves the Commonwealth negotiated an agreement whereby the Queensland Government undertook to legislate to provide both for the self-management of the two communities within a local government framework and for the grant of long term leases over the former reserves. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Government has recently entered into discussions with the Queensland Government on policy issues relating to the management of reserve communities and land tenure. These discussions are continuing. </para>

The following is in answer to the honourable member's question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>American Medical International, (AMI), the company to which the honourable member referred, entered the Australian health care market in1978 through the acquisition of The Avenue Hospital in Melbourne. </para>
            <para>I have been informed that the Victorian Government is currently considering a proposal for AMI to participate in the ownership construction and management of a hospital associated with the proposed Queen Victoria Medical Centre at Monash University in Melbourne. I understand that the AMI proposal is that it will provide a teaching hospital on the campus of Monash University at no capital cost to the University itself. </para>
            <para>I understand that the proposal involves the construction by AMI, on land owned by the Crown, of a 200 bed private hospital at a cost of approximately $20m. The basis of the use of the land is that it will be provided at a nominal rental and will revert to the Crown at the end of 30 or 40 years. I am also advised that a complement of beds will be provided for public sector patients at per diem rates guaranteed not to exceed the average cost of health care delivery to the Government in a representative cross-section of Government hospitals in the State of Victoria. </para>
            <para>I have previously pointed out, in my reply of 3 April1979, that as long as the firm concerned meets all the requirements of the Foreign Investment Review Board, I can see no reason why it should not enter this field subject to any constraints imposed as a result of the rationalisation discussions presently taking place between the Commonwealth and State Governments. </para>
            <para>AMI is said to be aware of the problems of overbedding in certain areas of the capital cities and is therefore looking very closely at where it should locate its hospitals. </para>
            <para>The company is also said to be aware that private hospitals in Australia today usually provide only limited services, mostly of the 'quick throughput' surgical type. However, I understand it is its intention to provide a totality of services similar to that provided in a balanced public general hospital in Australia and similar to those provided in its hospitals in America. </para>

As mentioned in the pamphlet to which the honourable member refers, the establishment of the National Labour Consultative Council means that for the first time effective statutory tripartite machinery is available to provide a continuing forum for consultation between the Government, employer organizations and the trade union movement. Its members are required to meet at least once each quarter to consult together on industrial relations and manpower matters of national concern. </para>

            <para>Although OECD statistics are available which enable the information sought by the honourable member to be calculated, it should be noted that the statistics are not generally comparable because of deficiencies in their scope and coverage. For example, the OECD statistics for Australia exclude persons attending teachers colleges and technical and further education institutions, while those for several of the other OECD countries are based on an incomplete coverage of between 80 and 90 per cent of tertiary education. Statistics for Japan are estimated. The different emphasis placed on part time education is also of considerable importance when interpreting the data since the OECD statistics refer only to full-time students, as are the general differences in education systems. A description of how the education systems in each country are classified is contained in 'Classification of Educational Systems- Summary Volume' OECD Paris1 975. </para>
            <para>Bearing the above cautionary notes in mind, the table below shows the proportion of the population aged from1 7 to 22 inclusive undertaking full-time tertiary education according to the most recent available OECD statistics. </para>

In reaching a decision to close a non-official post office, Australia Post takes into account a variety of factors, including the volume of business handled at the office, the likely level of business in the future, the general trend of development in the area, the effect the closure is likely to have on the local community and the non-official postmaster and the capacity of the postal network and the alternative facilities in the area to meet the needs of local residents. </para>

              <para>) As a public trading enterprise which endeavours to recover the total operating cost of the services it supplies by levying direct charges on the users of those services, Telecom Australia employs cost benefit analysis to evaluate the financial impact of potential investment projects on Telecom and users of the services. Financial evaluation is only one input to overall consideration of a project. Other inputs are availability of resources, the effect on other programmes and social implications. </para>

          <para>Telecom does not regard social cost benefit analysis, as generally understood, to be the most appropriate method, in its circumstances, of evaluating the social implications of a proposed course of action.

There have, however, been a dumber of initiatives taken to improve the application of the techniques and to assist in their uniform application throughout Telecom. For example, regular training courses on investment appraisal techniques have been established and a number of guidelines and instructions have been issued which specify various inputs which are to be used in any appraisal and the way in which the techniques are to be applied. </para>

            <para>Beef prices in New Zealand and Australia are heavily dependent on prices received on overseas markets and have both risen steeply over the past six months in response to high export prices, especially on sales to North America. As both Australian and New Zealand exporters receive essentially the same price on export markets it is usually not profitable for the New Zealand exporter to ship to Australia as he is faced with additional freight costs. From time to time export of particular cuts to Australia can be profitable but this trade is relatively small and in the eight months ended February 1979 beef and veal imports from New Zealand totalled 527 tonnes. This is equivalent to 0.06 per cent of Australian producton or 0.1 per cent of Australian exports over the same period. </para>

The honourable member will be aware that on 3 November 1978 the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs announced that the Prices Justification Tribunal had been asked to conduct an examination into the prices of processed foods. This enquiry is now proceeding. In announcing the enquiry, the Minister noted that, should it be felt necessary to do so, a separate public enquiry could be instituted into any company subject to the jurisdiction of the Prices Justification Tribunal. </para>

              <para>and (3) The Budget reduced the rate of sales tax on motor cars and station wagons from 27.5 per cent to 15 per cent. The purpose of this action was twofold. Firstly, it removed an anomaly which was distorting the competitive position in the market between passenger motor vehicles and commercial vehicles. Secondly, the reduction in sales tax was intended to permit price reductions to consumers and so stimulate demand for motor vehicles, both locally produced and imported. Overall, available registration figures indicate that the passenger vehicle market has benefited significantly from the sales tax cut. The market in 1978 was 451,000 units compared with 430,000 units sold in 1977. </para>

          <para>The intention of the 12.5 per cent special additional customs duty was to raise revenue from the monopoly profits which accrue to importers of goods subject to quantitative import restrictions, including motor vehicles. Some dealers in imported cars may be reflecting the duty in their prices, but notwithstanding any attempt to pass on the special duty, the net effect of the Budget measures should not have resulted in a price increase for imported cars. </para>
          <para>There are, however, other considerations, independent of the Budget, which may have influenced the prices of imported cars. One such factor is the appreciation of the Yen. </para>
