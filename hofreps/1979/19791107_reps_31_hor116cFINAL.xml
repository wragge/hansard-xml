              <para>-I have referred to a court case. It is public knowledge. It could have been reported in any newspaper in Australia. To that extent I would not think that we are doing any further damage to a person by referring again to what is already known and what could have been made public in any newspaper or on television. I fail to see the distinction. This is a matter of public interest. It relates to a government department. Evidence has been given to a royal commission. I am quoting from the transcript and giving the page reference. If I may ask the question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you will see the relevance of it. It does no damage to the person concerned but is aimed directly at the Minister. </para>

Secondly, it is important to place on the record that both at the beginning of the Royal Commission and on several occasions during the period of the Royal Commission I did impress upon the permanent head of my Department the fact that there was to be close co-operation with the Royal Commission and that we were to provide whatever information, orally or in writing, was requested. In short, the clear instruction from me to my Department was that there was to be full co-operation with the Royal Commission. </para>

The Minister is doubtless aware that the international usage of Tullamarine, as measured by aircraft movements, is less than half that of Sydney. In view of the peaking of flights into Sydney in the early morning immediately after the curfew is lifted at that airport, will he continue to press his Department to encourage airlines to schedule more of their flights into Melbourne as the first port of entry into Australia?

            <para>- It will be a quite objective view, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I am able to confirm that the number of international flights into Sydney is much greater than the number into Melbourne. That is something I have never understood, having regard to the beauty of both places. The last weekly figures I have seen show that there were 180 international flights into Tullamarine. That compares rather unfavourably with the total of 363 flights into Sydney. The Treasurer has suggested that market forces ought to be allowed to operate in these matters. I can tell the honourable member quite seriously that recently the Department wrote to all international airlines encouraging them to use Tullamarine. There has been quite a response to that over a period. That is why there has been a build-up over the last couple of years in the number of flights into Melbourne. I will certainly take notice of the honourable member&#39;s quite responsible representations on this issue and encourage my Department to go around again. </para>

The Minister will recall saying in his answer that he instructed the Narcotics Bureau to extend full co-operation to the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Williams. Was that full co-operation extended? More specifically, did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Williams make any complaint to the Government about difficulties in obtaining information or the forthcomingness of witnesses from the Bureau who appeared before the Royal Commission? Did he make any complaint about the compilation and presentation of evidence by Bureau witnesses before the Royal Commission? Is the Minister satisfied that those witnesses from the Bureau who appeared before the Royal Commission in all cases appeared unfettered, unrestricted and uncautioned in any way by senior officials of the Bureau? </para>

            <para>- I repeat what I said a moment ago. I issued clear instructions that there was to be full co-operation with the Royal Commission, both in relation to the tendering of oral evidence and written evidence and in relation to any other material that might have been sought by the Royal Commissioner. I also point out to the House that some of the evidence was given in private. Obviously I am not aware and could not be aware of that evidence. Therefore, there would be no capacity to make any assessment as to whether it was considered adequate or inadequate. Obviously a lot of the information has been provided on the public record. That material is available to all honourable members, and indeed to the public. So far as the Royal Commissioner&#39;s observations are concerned in relation to the adequacy or otherwise of the evidence, and whether he believes that the officers of the Department and the Bureau have cooperated, I suggest to the House that we should await the final report because if the judge believes that there was a lack of co-operation on the part of the Department or the Bureau I would expect that he would cover that in the report. </para>

He has since told me to take it up with the Minister for Administrative Services.

            <para>- It is a fact that very early in the period of both the Commonwealth and New South Wales royal commissions into drugs an arrangement was established by the two commissions, and certainly approved by this Government, for information to be passed from the Commonwealth to the State Royal Commission if information was sought. It is important to remind people, particularly honourable members opposite, that at that time the Commonwealth Government indicated that it believed there ought to be one royal commission inquiring into all drug and drug related matters throughout Australia. The Commonwealth expressed that view publicly and also in correspondence with the Premiers. The Commonwealth sought a situation in which there would be one royal commission and one royal commissioner looking into all these matters right across Australia. </para>

          <para>We sought a situation whereby that commissioner would have a commission from the Commonwealth and also a commission from each of the State governments. Four State governments agreed to provide a commission. </para>
          <para class="block">Those States were Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. New South Wales decided to set up its own royal commission and, of course, South Australia had a royal commission running at that time in relation to certain aspects of the drug problem. Because the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs had been established, the Commonwealth believed that the method referred to by the honourable member for Chifley was the best way to provide information to the State Royal Commission. </para>

            <para>- I have received a statement from the National Health and Medical Research Council regarding the report to which the honourable member for Cowper has referred. It indicates that the total intake of lead, whether derived from water, air, food or other ingested substances, remains of concern. It also indicates that further efforts to effect overall reductions are required. The Council recommends that 30 micrograms of lead per 100 millilitres of blood in the Australian population be taken to represent a level of concern. A geometric mean level of 15 micrograms of lead per 100 millilitres of blood would ensure that the majority of the population at risk would not exceed this level. The Council accepts that 20 per cent of the total body lead burden could be contributed by lead in air, particularly in areas subject to heavy pollution. Consequently, of the geometric mean level of 15 micrograms of lead per 100 millilitres of blood, up to three micrograms of lead per 100 millilitres of blood could be attributed to lead derived from the air. </para>

              <para>- I concede that this sounds rather complicated but this is how the report has come to me. To ensure that the uptake of&#34; lead from air is not excessive, the Council recommends that the maximum permissible level of lead in air in the urban environment should be 1.5 micrograms of lead per cubic metre of air, averaged over three calendar month periods. I intend to place a copy of the report in the Parliamentary Library. The NHMRC has indicated goals, not standards, and the goals will be subject to further review in the light of other material that could come to hand. The Government will be studying the implications of this report presently in regard to its energy policy. </para>

            <para>-The New South Wales Royal Commissioner&#39;s report has only just been tabled in the New South Wales Parliament and I have not yet had an opportunity to study it. However, my attention has been drawn to certain published statements purporting to come from that report. The Commonwealth has obtained, or is in the process of obtaining, copies of the New South Wales Royal Commissioner&#39;s report. I give the House an undertaking that that report will be very carefully studied. It will be carefully studied in every respect but, in particular, it will be studied in relation to any reference that is made to a Commonwealth area of responsibility. If the New South Wales Royal Commissioner has been critical of some aspect of Commonwealth administration or if he suggests remedial action in relation to Commonwealth administration or involvement, those suggestions or assertions will be very carefully considered. Like the Premier of New South Wales, we will not be rushing into immediate decisions in relation to the contents of the New South Wales Royal Commissioner&#39;s report. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The decision announced last night by the  Deputy  Prime Minister indicates this Government&#39;s desire to react quickly and to make changes in accordance with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Royal Commission. It is obvious, of course- I said this last night and I repeat it now- that the Commonwealth established the Royal Commission to inquire into all aspects of drug trafficking and drug-related matters because it was concerned about the position that had developed and it was concerned to take whatever action was necessary to improve the position. I also repeat something I said yesterday in relation to the interim report. Because time was moving on and because of the growing criticism that was being levelled at the Narcotics Bureau, the Government felt that it needed to review the lines of communication between the Government and the Bureau and the Bureau&#39;s responsibility. Because the Royal Commission had been in operation for so long and because the Bureau&#39;s operations and responsibilities were within the terms of reference of the Royal Commission, the Government believed that it should not take any action without having the advice of the Royal Commissioner. It was for that reason that the Government sought an interim report. The Royal Commissioner obliged and provided that interim report. That report has been received and acted upon promptly by the Government. </para>

            <para>- My attention has, of course, been drawn to the decision of the United Kingdom Government, announced about two weeks ago, to abolish all exchange controls operating in respect of the outflow or inflow of funds out of or into the United Kingdom. I regard that decision by the British Government as a very bold and courageous break with regulation. I think it highlights the need for any government periodically to ask itself whether regulations introduced decades ago are any longer serving the purpose for which they were originally introduced. I say to the honourable gentleman and to the House that that is one of the driving forces behind the Government&#39;s decision to establish an inquiry into the Australian financial system. We have not looked in earnest at our system for the past 40 years. The time has long since come for that to occur. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Specifically the honourable gentleman wants to know whether that decision will be of any help to Australia. Australia has always been, as he would know, a favoured place for British investment. I would think that there is a strong possibility that the decision will result in an increase in portfolio investment in Australia by the United Kingdom. Just how much investment will result I find impossible to quantify in any way. I believe that the consequences of the decision will be beneficial not only in relation to the United Kingdom economy but also, more particularly, in relation to the level of British investment in Australia. </para>
          <para>In regard to the chop war, which I gather is a reference to the apparent breach of the covenants of the European Economic Community by France in relation to exports of United Kingdom lamb, and which relates in some way to the unwillingness of the French Government to acknowledge the arrangements the Community has made regarding New Zealand lamb, ministerially I had better stay out of that war. I will refer the honourable gentleman&#39;s question to my colleague, the Minister for Special Trade Representations, who knows some of the ins and outs of chop wars in Europe. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs whether the Bureau of Customs, in its submission in November 1977 to the Williams Royal Commission, acknowledged a staff turnover of almost 25 per cent in the Narcotics Bureau. Did the interim report tabled in Parliament yesterday indicate that more than 50 per cent of police officers recruited by the Bureau had resigned since 1970? Did the head of his Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Besley,</inline> tell the Royal Commission that he was unsure whether any investigation had been made of the high staff turnover within the Bureau? When did the Minister become aware of this staff loss and what did he do to correct it, in view of the clear warning it gave of poor morale and administrative inefficiency within the Bureau? </para>

            <para>- A great deal of the information contained in the honourable member&#39;s question is, of course, on the public record. One would need the papers concerned to be able to confirm the accuracy of his remarks, but I accept that the information that the honourable member has supplied is accurate for purposes of the question. Let me say again to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and to the House that the Government was aware of the need for changes and upgrading generally in law enforcement. At the beginning of 1978, soon after the Royal Commission was established, I announced on behalf of the Government a series of new initiatives that would be taken. I emphasised at the time that those new initiatives were not to be seen as the Government&#39;s final answer to the needs in this area. We said that maybe changes would need to follow the close and detailed investigation by the Royal Commissioner. I regard the transferring of the responsibilities of the Narcotics Bureau from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to the Federal Police as being a major change. For that reason that kind of decision, if it was to be taken, should properly await a full examination of all that was involved in the Royal Commission. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In regard to staffing, I was aware of the problems in the Bureau, particularly in relation to numbers. I remind the House that the Bureau was formed in 1969. It was a new initiative by the then Government to come to grips with the problems of the day. The Bureau has been developed over a period under successive governments. When I became the Minister responsible the number of staff was around ISO; it might have been 154 or 155, but it was around 150. Notwithstanding the staff ceilings that are in effect throughout the Public Service generally, I sought the approval of the Government to increase substantially, in terms of relative numbers, the staff within the Narcotics Bureau. The staff was increased by approximately 50 to try to overcome in some measure the staff problems that were being experienced. I repeat what I said earlier: We believe that any major reorganisation of the Commonwealth&#39;s efforts in drug law enforcement had to await the outcome of the Royal Commission. </para>

            <para>- Because of the growing world concern about energy supply, the United Nations held a special symposium last month in Poland, where some 360 delegates from 45 countries around the world, including Australia, presented papers. Most of the conference &#39;s attention centred on steaming coal. Some staggering figures came out of this conference. People at the conference talked about a renaissance for steaming coal, about a new demand being created because of oil prices and the uncertainty of supply. They spoke in terms of the demands of countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development increasing from 519 million tonnes in 1976 to a potential of 1,400 million tonnes or more by the year 2000. This sort of increase is very much in Une with the International Energy Agency figures which projected that Australia would increase its steaming coal exports from virtually nil at the moment to about 120 million tonnes by the year 2000. I believe that if we can respond to the situation by developing mines and the necessary infrastructure to be able to handle such large tonnages, those figures could be conservative. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Enormous interest is being shown by countries all around the world in developing Australia&#39;s steaming coal resources. For this development to take place a number of things will have to happen. Firstly, I believe the price will have to be at a higher level than exists at the moment. Mines cannot be developed at present prices because there is not sufficient attraction in the returns to miners for them to put in the massive capital that is necessary to undertake this development. However, I believe that the international price situation will respond. It will be necessary also to have very close co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in looking at how we are to meet the requirements for railroads, port handling facilities and ports to handle these very large tonnages. I re-emphasise that the world is looking a second time at steaming coal as being a major source of energy for power generation and for many other industrial purposes. </para>

I also saw the departmental submission which was provided to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs in response to the letter before the submission was presented in evidence to the Commission by the Secretary of my Department. The Secretary of the Department had provided a brief to me outlining the action which the Department had taken and which it proposed to take concerning the matters raised by the Royal Commission, </para>

          <para>Bearing in mind that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter contained generalised statements about the Narcotics Bureau and did not refer to any specific evidence or the source of such evidence that the Commission may have received, the departmental submission endeavoured to answer the assertions made by the Royal Commission. One would presume, of course, that the role of the Royal Commission was to assess the departmental evidence against evidence that it received from other sources. I have no doubt that it did that. The Royal Commission&#39;s considered opinion on this issue was made available to the Government in its interim report. The departmental submission is, of course, a public document. So all that information is available to the honourable member for Grey and, indeed, to other honourable members. </para>

            <para>- The European Economic Community has a system of greatly subsidising the exports of a number of products which affects the markets of many countries. This practice is of most concern to Australia in respect of dairying and sugar. As honourable members know, the EEC declined to join the International Sugar Agreement although there is some evidence that the United States of America may shortly do so in spite of the failure of a Bill to pass through <inline font-style="italic">Congress</inline> the other day. The Australian Government decided to set in motion a challenge to the Community&#39;s practices in the selling of sugar and its subsidising of such sales, commencing with the request for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva to set up a sugar panel. The report of that panel was received by the GATT Council last night Australian time without dissent. In fact, many countries participating in the debate spoke against the EEC&#39;s trading practices in respect of sugar and, for that matter, in respect of other commodities. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The report made three points which I think are of interest. It first of all said that serious prejudice had been caused to Australia, that if the EEC&#39;s export subsidy system as it is presently operated continued it would ultimately result in its getting more than an equitable share of world trade and that it already constituted a source of uncertainty in world sugar markets and was a threat of prejudice in terms of GATT Article 16. The Government believes that this is a very serious matter for us and for world trade. It is a matter that needs constant exposure. </para>
          <para>There is a number of other avenues where the Government can press the EEC to adjust its sugar policies in order to remove prejudice to Australia and to other efficient exporting countries. </para>

As I said earlier, he invited the States to provide the Commonwealth Royal Commissioner with a commission so that there would be one royal commission operating throughout Australia backed by all of the governments. The decision taken by New South Wales and South Australia not to provide a commission to the Commonwealth Royal Commissioner was a matter for those governments. I regret it very much but I level no criticism at them for doing that. They are sovereign governments and they took that decision. I still think it is a matter for regret. </para>

          <para class="block">The interim report of the Williams Royal Commission into drug trafficking in this country is a catalogue of failure of unparalleled dimensions in relation to law enforcement and a law enforcement agency in this country. More than that, it is a devastating indictment of the incompetence of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Let me repeat what I said earlier. The Minister today at Question Time, in a series of answers which he supplied in response to questions directed to him from this side, sought to erect a veil of vagueness and deception in this House. </para>
          <para class="block">Having had the opportunity to consider not only the interim report but also the attachments to that report which have not been made public, because I am limited by the restraints of confidentiality imposed by the Government I can say only that I felt distinctly uncomfortable with the nature and quality of the Minister&#39;s answers. They were in an enfeebled state. They will not stand up on the full facts of the circumstances as known to the Minister and the Government now. The House will be aware of that when those facts are made public. </para>
          <para>The Minister has to accept ministerial responsibility in this matter. The fact is that the Narcotics Bureau has been stigmatised by a royal commission established by the Government as, I repeat, an unparalleled failure as a law enforcement agency in this country. Accordingly, that report becomes a devastating indictment of the Minister&#39;s administration of the Bureau. The Bureau does not have the independence, standing or authority at law or in common practice of a police force. It is a part of the Public Service. It is a part of the Minister&#39;s responsibility.  His  responsibility sinks down to the lowest grades within his Department for any shortcomings or defects of a nature which concern the community as extensively and greatly as do the shortcomings of the Bureau. He is responsible. The Minister knew as early as June 1978 that there were serious shortcomings in the way in which the Bureau was functioning. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> wrote to the head of his department in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Apart altogether from what has been properly said about the inadequate surveillance of the north of Australia, Sydney Harbour would appear to provide an obvious but not unique case where surveillance is also defective. </para>
            <para>There is reason also for thinking that containers present opportunities for the illicit entry of goods, the problems of which have not yet been faced up to, much less grappled with. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Last night the Minister, among a number of matters to which he addressed himself in this House, sought to respond to those remarks. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Besley</inline> in his rebuttal of that view by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We do not have available to us a clear indication of the strength or source of the issues raised, which the submission attempts to answer. This has not made our task easy. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is not the response to the remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> which I quoted yesterday and which I have just repeated. It is not the response of an honest man. It is not the response of a responsible Minister seeking to fulfil his accountability to the Parliament. In response the Minister should have quoted directly from the transcript of evidence from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Besley</inline> to the Royal Commission six months after he had received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> in a period during which, presumably, there was no action by the Bureau or the responsible Minister- more appropriately, the irresponsible Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Besley</inline> said this: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission has commented that Sydney Harbour appears to provide an obvious but not unique case where surveillance is defective and that containers present opportunities for the illicit entry of goods. </para>
            <para>The comments are applicable equally to other parts of the coast, such as the Whitsunday Passage, Moreton Bay and Port Phillip and to other classes of imported goods such as bulk timber cargoes, air cargoes and the generality of sea cargo. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The devastating significance of those remarks is that in his defence <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Besley</inline> did not seek to repudiate the challenge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson.</inline> The implication is that he said: &#39;So what? It is true of many other parts of Australia&#39;. Six months later nothing had been done. Eighteen months after the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> we find, from the Minister&#39;s answer to the House today, that apparently no attempt has been made to shore up this serious shortcoming in the anti-narcotics law enforcement operation in this country at the federal level. The Minister knew as far back as 23 June 1 978 of those shortcomings. </para>
          <para>Let me move on to another matter where the Minister is responsible, or should I say &#39;irresponsible&#39;. It is one of the matters of even more grave concern. It arises from a question which was asked in the House on 6 June 1979 by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding).</inline> I shall condense it to the essential parts of the question and answer. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>When did the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs first raise with the Federal Narcotics Bureau the question of the serious allegations contained in an article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun News-Pictorial</inline> of 28 May? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I repeat that these serious allegations first came to my notice early in the morning of last Monday week when a reporter from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> telephoned me at my hotel . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister went on to say that the reporter had asked certain questions. That is the record; that is correct. But this is the significance <inline font-style="italic">of it on</inline> two alarming scores: First of all, on the basis of the chronology established from that answer one can next establish that the Minister knew on the Monday night he referred to, which was the Monday night before the Wednesday on which legislation proposing an extension of telephone tapping authority to the Narcotics Bureau was guillotined through this Parliament- guillotined by the Minister because at that stage the Parliament did not understand the implications or, indeed, the detail of this disclosure. The Minister sought to embark on a cover-up of a very serious dereliction of the responsibility and adequacy of operation of the Narcotics Bureau. That is the first thing. The second thing in relation to that is that he is guilty therefore of complicity in this serious matter. </para>
          <para>The second point on this matter arises in this way: The Minister rushed that legislation through, guillotined it in the House, because he knew full well that there were serious allegations from State police forces that his Department had been penetrated to the extent that information within the Department on a number of things, including informants, was being leaked to criminal drug offenders. The Minister effectively embarked on a cover-up instead of undertaking a process designed to shore up this shortcoming and to advise the Parliament of what had happened. So what! It means that any informer available to the Bureau at that time, well before it- that is established- and it seems since, was placed in jeopardy.  His  life and wellbeing were at serious risk because the Bureau had been penetrated by a criminal organisation in this country which was able to obtain information. The price of that is measured in murders- the murders of a number of the people who were couriers or who were in some way associated with illicit drug operations in this country, people like the Wilsons. That is the sort of cover-up that the Minister embarked on and that is the sort of gross irresponsibility for which the Narcotics Bureau is responsible. I repeat that the Minister, instead of seeking urgently to shore up this shortcoming and deferring the legislation, rushed it through, opened up another access point to the Bureau so that even further information available to the Bureau presumably became available to the infiltrators from organised drug crime in this country. </para>
          <para>The illicit narcotics industry in this country is an illicit industry of death. It is an industry of destruction to the mind, body and soul. Yet we have been told repeatedly in this Parliament, we have been reassured by the soothing words of the Minister, that the people of Australia can sleep easily at night because they have the protection of a faithful and effective watchdog- the Narcotics Bureau. It is a watchdog with a peculiar form of night blindness. I put it squarely to the Minister- he must have known this if he was discharging his responsibilities properly- that in fact the Bureau made very few seizures of large quantities of drugs, that in fact the Bureau was largely responsible for very small-scale operations, one presumes operations which involved addicts rather than organised crime. </para>
          <para>I challenge the Minister to table in this Parliament statistics on seizures so that we will know the number of seizures within each quantity designation of hard drugs. I ask the Minister to indicate to us how many seizures were made for the latest year available of hard drugs, such as heroin, in excess of a kilogram. The Minister, of course, sought again in Question Time today to reassure us that the Bureau was a successful organisation and that it operated effectively. Nonsense! The organisation took the easy way out all the time and scarcely put a scratch on really organised drug crime in this country. </para>
          <para>Let me go on. The Minister spoke in the House today, as he did last night, about co-operation and co-ordination. Last night he said that the committee he had set up has, as one of its tasks, to improve the co-ordination at operational law enforcement level and between States. He said that it has been successful to this end. That is just not true. That has been made abundantly clear by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Williams, as it has been made abundantly clear by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward today, not only in terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s condemnation of the failure to extend co-operation to his inquiry but also his assertion that he had established on the evidence available to him, the hard facts presented, that there was an absence of co-operation between the federal authority and State law enforcement authorities. </para>
          <para>The Minister said last night, to reassure us, that often there have been successful conspiracy prosecutions in respect of which there have been absolutely no seizures at all of drugs. I challenge the Minister to produce hard evidence on that. If the Minister wants to stand by that, I challenge him to table all of the documentation that is attached to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Williams&#39;s report. The Minister knows as well as I do that that is deceiving the House, that that is misleading the House. I repeat that I find myself placed in a very uncomfortable position if I am to be provided with confidential documents and then have to sit down and bite my fingers and listen to the Minister providing answers to questions and informing the House on matters allegedly of substance which I do not believe can stand up. These are some of the matters that the Minister must be made accountable for. He shares the obsessive defensiveness of the Bureau. He is bitten by the same bug when criticism comes his way. Last night he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block"> I must say that officers of the Narcotics Bureau and my Department have been subjected to an almost unprecedented constant attack through the media. Allegations of corruption, leaked documents and personal attacks have been paramount. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">And why not? On the basis of the Williams report, every one of them is justified. What has happened is that a multi-million dollar organised drug crime syndicate in Australia is better equipped and financed than is the Bureau. In the 1977 work value hearing at which employees of the Bureau gave evidence it was divulged that there were full time cover agents or groups only in Sydney and Melbourne. Presumably one had to undertake a logistics operation to move full time cover operatives to other parts of Australia with all of the problems that involved, not the least of which were inhibiting, suffocating Public Service restraints. For instance, agents are restricted as to where they can operate. They cannot go across regional boundaries to function in another area without Public Service approval. One presumes that if a person can get across the regional boundary he can get away scot free if he is quick enough of foot. The members of the Bureau had problems about overtime and travelling allowance. </para>
          <para>Let me quote the situation in relation to some of these matters- for instance, training. The Minister responsible for all of these matters has done nothing to shore them up. He was advised of them 18 months ago. Six months after that the head of his Department was giving misleading evidence, stigmatised as such by the counsel assisting the Royal Commission. Still nothing was done and still there was no explanation to the House either yesterday or today as to what might have been done. The Minister&#39;s indifference is chilling. It will fill any reasonable, concerned parent in this country with fear- fear to know that this irresponsible man has been administering one of the most significant, one of the most important, law enforcement authorities in the country. </para>
          <para>As to the training for which the Minister is responsible, this illustrates the standard of the agency which was operating: One officer who was with the Bureau almost from its inceptionhe joined in March 1970- told a work value hearing that he had attended only one investigatory course in seven years. He admitted he was virtually one of the original members of the Bureau. The course was conducted by the Bureau itself. He thought that notes were distributed to him. The notes were never reissued in a handbook or manual. He attended the course in 1 974. Another course of two weeks duration was held in 1976. He said: &#39;This program was more an indepth look at law and crime scene investigation and things like that&#39;. The officer- one of the founding fathers, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Polden-</inline> admitted he did not attend this course and did not have any notes from the course. He did not receive any notes from the course, nor did he have a copy of the basic handbook. In fact the policy manualsigned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bates,</inline> the Director- had no date anywhere on it. In fact, it was entitled &#39;Australian Police, Narcotics Bureau&#39;. Because of Senate obstruction from the conservative majority of the coalition when Labor was in Government, that body never came into operation, but if it had it would have fulfilled the recommendations as early as 1975 of the Williams report. The Narcotics witness added: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>With your permission I might be able to assist you here. We had an original policy drawn up at the initial starting of the Narcotics Bureau back in 1970. This policy manual became- with many revised editions to it- unreal. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the condition of training. That is the standard of investigatory skills which are imparted to the people within the Narcotics Bureau. Regrettably, I do not have time to read the several more pages of devastating disclosures of shortcomings in the functioning of the Narcotics Bureau under this Minister. What it boils down to is that the preoccupation of the Prime Minister with law and order and security is unmasked for all its amateurishness by the Williams report. The fact is that the drug industry deals in death. Yesterday the New South Wales Royal Commission into drugs pointed out that heroin was about to flood into Sydney. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reported yesterday that heroin use had increased by 24 per cent in two years in New South Wales, that the danger of exposure to overdosing had gone up from 7,000 to 9,250 between 1977 and 1978 and that there are 26,300 hard-drug users in the country. The significance of that is that heroin is imported to this country. This Minister and his Department are responsible for effective law enforcement functioning in this area. But how effective are they? The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward is reported in the Royal Commission report as finding: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Illegal importation of heroin required &#39;no special intelligence or ingenuity&#39; and the Bureau of Customs intercepted probably less than 10 per cent of the heroin imported. </para>
            <para>New measures to make saturation checks of selected aircraft and to continue random checks were not likely to reduce the supply of heroin to the illegal market. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In the considered judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, the Narcotics Bureau did not measure up to the task. On the figures he produced the Narcotics Bureau was not notably successful in controlling the flood of hard narcotics into this country. So much for the past claims of the Minister. Those claims are empty shells, they are hot air and are nothing more than myths which have been fabricated to delude the public and the Parliament The absence of cooperation was damned today. As a result of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s criticism of the lack of cooperation by the Government, by its agency, with the Royal Commission, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But I did receive first-hand experience of the unfortunate effects of a total failure of inter-agency co-operation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So much for the interstate co-operation that is supposed to take place. The Minister seeks to defend himself. He says that he took a number of initiatives to get things going on a more stable and more substantial keel. Last night, and again today, he said: </para>

          <quote>

            <para>- I second this motion of censure. I do not enter the debate with any relish, but as the shadow Minister responsible in this area I want to put it on record that I have bent over backwards to co-operate in this very sensitive sector. While I continue to have any responsibility for policy formulation in this area I shall continue to work for bipartisanship, for co-operation between the political parties, in order to fight a common foe, namely, those enemies of our society who peddle drugs to the weak, making huge profits on the way. That having been said, there is no excuse for mistakes on the part of those who are in positions of responsibility. In fact, the responsibility is so great that the Opposition would be failing in its duty if it did not highlight the shocking errors of judgment which have damaged an important area of social concern. In this competitive Westminster system of Government in which we operate we have a duty to draw attention to the errors to ensure to the greatest extent that we possibly can that those errors are not repeated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the cornerstones of this system that we operate is ministerial responsibility. How can there be proper accountability to the people through this Parliament unless this doctrine of ministerial responsibility prevails? This Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> is responsible for grave weaknesses of administration and, therefore, he must be censured. If anything other than the crude numbers game were played he would be censured, but the message of this debate is that whatever the result in terms of votes he will be censured for the grave weaknesses of the administration over which he has presided. </para>
          <para>Let me outline some of the reasons why this censure motion is so justified. I will not even draw attention to the reasons that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has mentioned. There is a whole new set of reasons which I can outline. For instance, on 5 June- five months ago- the Opposition moved a motion in this House to discuss a matter of public importance on this very subject. That subject was the Fraser Government&#39;s incompetent handling of the Federal Narcotics Bureau. In fact I moved that particular motion. This should have been a warning to the Government, if there had been no other warning. But of course there had been other warnings, and I will come to that in a moment. If there had been no other warning, that matter of public importance which was moved in this House on S June should have been a sufficient warning to this Minister and to the Government to clear up this area of slack administration. </para>
          <para>The debate on 5 June arose out of what I have described as the Eric Robinson-type resignation of the Commissioner of the Federal Narcotics Bureau. One day he was out, resigning, and next day- or was it the day after- he was in again, kissing and making up. </para>

              <para>- Yes, forgiven. That was the sort of thing that happened which gave rise to that debate on a matter of public importance. The episode was a bizarre one, to say the least. That episode has been repeated, and I suppose it will be repeated again. On that occasion the Opposition sought to persuade the Government to change its course.

          <para class="block">I was referring to the administration of the Federal Narcotics Bureau. What clearer message could there be? We wanted change. We do not live in a vacuum, even though a cloud of secrecy surrounds the work of such a law enforcement sector as the Federal Narcotics Bureau. Although I have received no confidential briefings on the subject generally, sufficient information was available to me and to other members of the Opposition to make us extremely uneasy and to move for the discussion of that matter of public importance. In that debate there was firstly reference to the law enforcement agency being penetrated by the very people it was expected to police. There was the related allegation that the Bureau had been infiltrated by organised crime. By all accounts there was a suspicion that a multi-million dollar drug ring was better equipped than the nation&#39;s Federal Narcotics Bureau. </para>
          <para>Secondly, we raised the matter or our nation&#39;s relationships with overseas narcotics agencies. With such grave charges on public record and with such suspicion relating to the inadequacies of the Bureau, how <inline font-style="italic">could the</inline> international agencies, with whom we deal in this sensitive area, have confidence in our nation&#39;s efforts to deal with what is essentially an international evil? I am referring to drug crime. How could these international agencies be expected to have any confidence whatsoever in us when the strong suspicion was, and frankly still is, that the drug underworld had access to the secret records and files of the Federal Narcotics Bureau. All of this is information that came out in this debate in this chamber on 5 June- five months ago. We said then, and I repeat it now, that Australia may well be cut off from receiving information ordinarily supplied by overseas police forces and international drug controlled policing programs. We still have this allegation of there being access to the Narcotics Bureau computer hanging over our heads. The access enabled- it may still do sodrug criminals to keep one step ahead of the police authority. </para>
          <para>These were the harsh facts that the Australian Labor Party drew to the attention of this Parliament on 5 June. Those facts were not properly answered and the Government failed to face up realistically to that problem at that time. This inept Administration confirmed that it would go along for a further five months with the fiction with which it was surrounded at that time. For three and a half years before that time, nothing was done to ensure that there was proper drug administration in this country. We have suffered for a long time. Even in those last five months since that debate very little has been done. </para>
          <para>Before moving on let me remind the House of the details of the most serious allegations which were abroad then and which have still not been properly answered. On Friday, 1 June the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs- this Minister under censure in this debate todayannounced that the New Zealand couple, Isabel and Douglas Wilson, had passed information to the Queensland Police in June 1978, a year earlier- nearly 18 months ago now- that an unnamed Narcotics Bureau officer had been involved in giving information to drug traffickers. The Minister&#39;s response to this most serious allegation was to set up an investigation of police officers from the Commonwealth and from some State police forces. The subsequent resignation of the head of the Bureau, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bates,</inline> the Minister&#39;s frantic attempts to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bates</inline> withdraw his resignation and the touch of farce to the whole affair when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bates</inline> withdrew his resignation all contribute to this being a matter of public notoriety. </para>
          <para>Early in June the Opposition charged that the whole matter had been handled ineptly and incompetently. Five months later that charge still stands. Five months ago I substantiated the charges by giving further details, and I repeat those details here: Two people are dead. Those were and are the most recent deaths known to me. </para>

              <para>- A lot are missing, as the honourable member for Hunter says. There are charges that related to the drug ring. There have been five deaths in recent years. In relation to the two deaths that I have just referred to, the belief stated in this Parliament- it is not denied by anyone as far as I am aware- is that the Victoria Police Force not only leaked the intitial disclosures to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> but also claimed that the Narcotics Bureau had sat on allegations made by the Wilsons for a year without conducting proper investigations. It also charged that the Bureau&#39;s data on the people at the top of the drug distribution tree is seriously defective. Those were charges which came out in this Parliament five months ago. What was the Government&#39;s response to all those charges that were being made? It only set up that unsatisfactory police inquiry, which apparently is still sitting. That police inquiry includes a representative of the Victoria Police Force. In effect, we have Victorian police as prosecutors and as judge and jury on that inquiry which was set up to look at those charges at that time. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The story becomes even more bizarre when we read recent reports in a number of newspapers. I have here a quotation from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 2 October 1979 which states, in effect, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harvey</inline> Bates himself was claiming that the inquiry into the Narcotics Bureau was taking too long. What sort of Administration is it that allows the head of the Narcotics Bureau, which is supposed to be working in secrecy, even to pass comments on an inquiry which is set up to look into that same Bureau? That is the sort of sloppy administration that we are censuring in this debate today. Did not the Minister claim in the House last night that the Federal Narcotics Bureau did not like publicity? How can he reconcile that claim with the report that I have just referred to in the newspaper of 2 October? Why should the head of the Federal Narcotics Bureau be getting publicity on the matter of whether the report of the inquiry is running late? </para>
          <para>Whilst on this subject of recent newspaper reports and just to build up this picture of inept administration, which after all has given rise to this censure debate, let me draw attention to the equally extraordinary recent story about the leaking of information- accurate information as we learnt yesterday from the statement from the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)concerning</inline> the take-over by Compol- the Commonwealth Police-of the Federal Narcotics Bureau. I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of 27 October and to the article headed, &#39;Alleged leak to be investigated &#39;. The article states: </para>
          <quote>

          </list>
          <para class="block">Once again we get <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harvey</inline> Bates responding to that. The same article goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The head of the Narcotics Bureau, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harvey</inline> Bates, was quoted on last night&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">ABC</inline> &#39;PM&#39; program as rejecting the allegations, describing them as inaccurate and in many cases totally false. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Surely it is now seen that what was stated in that report is absolutely correct. Yet as recently as 27 October we have the head of the Narcotics Bureau going public on a matter like that. What sort of confidence can the people of this country have in our drug enforcement administration when this sort of thing is going on? It is not something that is years old; it has been going on in the last couple of weeks. Who is responsible? Under our system of ministerial responsibility, of course, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, who is the subject of this censure debate in the Parliament today is responsible. That is why the Opposition is being responsible and moving this censure motion. But the ramifications of these affairs extend well beyond the points I have made to date. </para>
          <para>I have referred already to the debate five months ago, roughly at the same time as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harvey</inline> Bates&#39; resignation. I refer now to a Bill which passed through this Parliament about that time. It extended the powers of telephone tapping to that same Federal Narcotics Bureau. At a time when we on this side of the House, with lesser information, were uneasy about such powers going to such a Bureau, how much more uneasy should this Minister have been at that time? Yet he defended it in the sort of closed circumstances of a legislation committee. He defended those extra telephone-tapping powers for the Federal Narcotics Bureau in that Customs Amendment Bill in May 1 979 at the same time as this uneasiness was being raised in this House. Not only the Minister should be censured; all Government members should be censured. I have only a few seconds left to draw attention to the fact that five years ago the then Labor Government sought to bring into this House an Australia Police Bill which would have done just what is being done now belatedlybring the Narcotics Bureau and the other police agencies under one roof. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> said towards the end of his speech that the Opposition was acting responsibly in moving this censure motion. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that some time ago the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> wrote to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> seeking to establish a bipartisan approach to this drug matter. The Leader of the Opposition obviously had in mind that this was an important matter, a matter in the national interest, and that there ought to be a bipartisan approach. The Prime Minister responded and accepted the proposition brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition. The Opposition&#39;s handling of the Commonwealth Royal Commission&#39;s interim report represents, in my view, an abuse by the Leader of the Opposition and the members of his Party of this bipartisan approach.

              <para>- I shall be brief on this point because I just need to make it once. The Leader of the Opposition simply seeks to make political capital out of the Government&#39;s responsible action over this particular matter. If the Leader of the Opposition needs other words than those used by me- he has been very busy quoting from various documents, on many occasions out of context- let me quote from the interim report of the Royal Commissioner in relation to this particular approach and the damage that I believe that the Opposition is doing to law enforcement in this country as a result of the way in which it is handling this affair. The Royal Commissioner said: </para>

            <para>Strong criticisms publicly made of the Commonwealth&#39;s only specialised drug enforcement agency will compromise the national effort against drug abuse. In addition, many hard-working and dedicated officers of the Narcotics Bureau inevitably but incorrectly will be thought to be the subject of criticism.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">In relation to the present structure I remind the House of some of the things that I said during Question Time and during my statement to the House last night. I was appointed to this portfolio on 17 July 1977. On 19 August 1977 the Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers indicating that the Commonwealth intended to establish a royal commission and inviting the Premiers of every State to provide a commission to the Commonwealth Royal Commissioner. This was a government decision; I do not claim the credit for it. But <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do say in this House that I played a major role in events leading up to the decision that was taken by the Government to establish the Royal Commission. We were concerned and we are still concerned. We wanted to have the best advice that could be obtained. We believed that the best advice could be obtained through the medium of a royal commission. The terms of reference were laid down in this House by the Prime Minister on 5 October 1977. Those terms of reference are very wide. They gave the Royal Commission an opportunity to inquire into every aspect of this sinister matter. But today we are talking about the administration of the Narcotics Bureau. I draw the attention of the House to term of reference (e). In part it states that the Royal Commission should look at:  the adequacy of existing laws (including the appropriateness of the penalties) and of existing law enforcement (including arrangements for co-operation between law enforcement agencies). </para>
          <para class="block">That is a specific reference and direction to the Royal Commission to focus on the law enforcement agencies of the Commonwealth and to recommend any changes that it thought necessary. On 24 January 1978 I indicated on behalf of the Government that, despite the fact that the Government had established the Royal Commission, we felt that we ought to take some initiatives in this particular area although obviously the major changes would have to await the outcome of the Royal Commission. In a statement that I issued on 24 January 1978 I said, in part:  it can be expected that the Government will take further steps following full consideration of the findings of the Royal Commission. </para>
          <para class="block">However, I went on to say:  it may be some time before the Commission can reasonably be expected to report, since it has only been operating for two months. </para>
          <para class="block">It was because of that that the Government decided to take the new initiatives that I enumerated in the House last night. Events took place over a period of time. Some have been referred to in Question Time and by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Adelaide. Criticism built up. I, of course, was kept advised of the flow of material between the Narcotics Bureau and the Royal Commission. I did not see it all and, indeed, I was not advised about all of the oral evidence that was given because some of it was given in confidential hearings. I was not privy to that information. No doubt when the Royal Commissioner reports towards the end of the year his final report will contain all his comments and criticisms and, importantly, his recommendations. I give an assurance to the House that the Government will consider that report as expeditiously as possible and, in particular, those recommendations. </para>
          <para>Because of the events, particularly the need to establish what has become known as the Hall inquiry and the allegation of leaks from the Bureau of Narcotics which followed the establishment of the Hall investigation team, I felt that the Government could not wait and should not wait until the Royal Commissioner reported. But I also believed that the Government would be completely irresponsible to take firm decisions, particularly major decisions, affecting the law enforcement agency of the Commonwealth so far as doing matters are concerned without knowing what the Royal Commissioner thought ought to be done and without knowing what his findings were in this regard. So it was that I discussed with the Prime Minister the possibility of the Government seeking an interim report. An interim report was sought from the Royal Commissioner. He agreed to provide an interim report dealing with the Narcotics Bureau. That report was received by the Governor-General on 18 September of this year. Seven weeks laterthere was not an inordinate delay- it had been studied by the Government, submissions had been prepared for Cabinet and Cabinet had taken the decision. That decision was announced yesterday. The Government acted decisively and the Government acted responsibly. </para>
          <para>Much of the Opposition&#39;s attack today and yesterday has been based on a confidential letter of 23 June from senior counsel assisting the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cedric</inline> Hampson. On 28 June 1978 the permanent head of my Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr M.</inline> A. Besley, advised me of receipt of this letter and told me of the action that the Department proposed to take to respond to the issues which it raised. This was to be by way of a submission to the Royal Commission at its sittings scheduled for later that year. There was no criticism of the delay. The sittings were scheduled for later that year. Those sittings were, in fact, held in Brisbane in September of that year. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Besley</inline> told me he had received the letter I instructed him to ensure that the Department co-operated fully with the Royal Commission in providing the information which it sought. At the time of my becoming aware of the letter it was clear to me that it contained general rather than specific assertions about the efficiency and effectiveness of the Narcotics Bureau. There was no indication of the source or credibility of the evidence which the Commission had received and which led to the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> to the permanent head of my Department. </para>
          <para>As I mentioned in this House yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Besley</inline> &#39;s evidence to the Commission, which was by way of response to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter, pointed out the Department&#39;s difficulty in responding to the points which it made. Nevertheless, the Department&#39;s third submission to the Royal Commission which was made in September 1978 was as much a commentary on the points which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter had raised as was possible in the circumstances. Apart from the submission itself senior officers, including the permanent head of my Department, spent several days under examination by the Royal Commission at its Brisbane sittings. During that period no effort was spared to provide the Commission with all of the information which it sought. </para>
          <para>Perhaps it is appropriate that I comment on some of the issues that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter raised. At the outset, the letter requested a considered statement by the Department. As I indicated, this in fact was done by way of the Department&#39;s third submission of September 1978. As to the substance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter, I make the following comments. First, it raises the question of whether narcotics agents should be public servants. This, of course, is not a matter for the Department. It was by government decision that the narcotics function was in the Customs area of its administration- such decisions, I might say, go back to Federation. Secondly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark&#39;s recommendation that investigators from the then Compol be seconded to the Narcotics Bureau. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> made the point that this would be difficult if the narcotics agents did not have police status. Thirdly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter referred to the narrowness of the career structure in the Narcotics Bureau and the fact that its officers had limited opportunity for gaining experience and were more susceptible to corruption because of lack of mobility between different functional areas. The Department went to some lengths to explain that there were wider career opportunities in the Department and dealt at length with the training arrangements. I mention these points to indicate that the Department sought to respond to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter. </para>
          <para>Finally- my time is running out- the submission refers to what has been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition in this House, namely, the openness of Sydney Harbour and the potential container problem. In responding to those matters, the Department indicated that </para>
          <para class="block">Sydney Harbour was not dissimilar from other ports. It said, however, that in terms of its assessment of priorities, it did not have any evidence to suggest that these were wrong and told the Commission that if it had any specific evidence the Department would be glad to receive it. The Department has not received any such evidence. No doubt the Royal Commissioner will make observations if he has observations to make and he will make recommendations in relation to containerisation when his final report is presented. </para>
          <para>I have traversed in some detail some of the contents of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter of 23 June which, as I have said, was brought to my attention within days of its receipt by my Department. I cannot accept the view put forward by the Leader of the Opposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hampson</inline> &#39;s letter raises issues of the kind which he suggested. Certainly the letter raised points which require full and frank answers. This the Department did in its submission in September 1978- a submission which was made available to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Besley,</inline> the permanent head of the Department, before it was made available to the Commission. No doubt the Royal Commissioner will make his own observations on the content of that report. That is why the Royal Commission exists. He sought and he had the right to seek and, indeed, the Government wanted him to seek, evidence from government departments and from any other person or group that could provide information that would assist him in arriving at the right conclusions. That information was supplied by the Department and it is a matter for the Royal Commission to judge its strength or otherwise. </para>
          <para>I want to make it perfectly clear in this House that the Government takes this matter seriously. The Government will take seriously the final report of the Royal Commission. It will take seriously the Commissioner&#39;s recommendations and we will act decisively as we have acted in relation to the interim report. It would seem reasonable to presume that the role of the Royal Commission was to assess all of the Department&#39;s evidence. I believe that that assessment will have been made and will be seen to have been made by the time the final report comes to this House and is made public. I conclude on this note. If any member of this House believes that I have not taken this part of my responsibility seriously let him stand. Let him stand if he believes that I have not taken it seriously. </para>

            <para>-I support the motion of censure because I believe that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> has, in fact, failed in his responsibility to this Parliament and, through the Parliament, to the people of Australia. I stress that he has failed in his responsibility to Parliament because the failures I will discuss relate not just to the Opposition but to information provided to all members of this House. It is important if ministerial responsibility is to mean anything that we as a parliament, not just one side of it, should consider whether Ministers are performing their duties. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I know it is easy to use the word &#39;responsibility&#39; in a rhetorical way. I want to show quite clearly what I mean when I say that the Minister has failed in his responsibility to this House. </para>
          <para>First, we would all accept, I believe, that the Minister is responsible to this House for the work and actions of his Department and for the major agencies within that Department. We would all accept that this House has the power of sanction for ministerial failure in those responsibilities; that is, it has the power of censure and the power of compelling his resignation. Of course, we would not want to say that he should be responsible for every minor action or misbehaviour by his Department. True, when we talk about the Narcotics Bureau there is a lot of minor misbehaviour and minor actions. We certainly would not want to make an issue of censure of minor misbehaviour by lesser civil servants. Nor do we want to say that the Minister is responsible in the sense that he could be censured for every action made by a bureaucrat in his Department, even though, in this case, a fairly notorious figure is involved who has been peculiarly active as a departmental chief. Next, I would not argue that the Minister should be responsible- though this is more debatable- for errors arising from deliberate disobedience by his departmental subordinates. That is not being alleged in this case. But a </para>
          <para class="block">Minister is responsible for the general maladministration of a department or of a major segment of a department. A Minister is responsible for those departmental faults and flaws which could have been avoided if he had exercised a reasonable diligence and a proper oversight. </para>
          <para>This is the issue that confronts us in the case of the Federal Narcotics Bureau and the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. The interim report of the Williams Royal Commission is an appalling indictment of the failure of the Minister effectively to oversee the Narcotics Bureau and to exercise a reasonable diligence towards that Bureau and the activities and behaviour for which he is responsible to this Parliament. If responsibility is to mean anything- it may be that Government members do not care about ministerial responsibility- it should be asserted clearly in this case. </para>
          <para>Let us look at what the Williams report is saying about this Bureau. It details a series of major aspects of sheer maladministration over at least a two-year period. I sometimes think the Minister wants to shift the blame further back, and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> may be prepared to accept pare of the blame, as the Minister responsible in an earlier period. The report states that the Bureau is inefficient. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Narcotics Bureau is not a highly efficient enforcement agency. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">To make the point quite clear, I quote again from the report. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Within the judicial system, generally speaking, the Narcotics Bureau&#39;s reputation for efficiency is lower than that of State police forces. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Comparatively, it has a low efficiency rating. Secondly, it is argued by the Williams Commission that it is over-centralised and poorly led. On this point the Commission&#39;s report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Too much centralised control impairs the bureau&#39;s operational efficiency. In this, the use of the Public Service structure for a police agency and lack of effective leadership are principally to blame. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those are the very points which the Opposition advanced in 1975 against this form of drug enforcement agency. Again, the report clearly says that the Bureau is obsessed with its image rather than with its task of drug enforcement. I quote again from the report, which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Bureau spends too much time defending itself and its image . . . </para>
            <para>The Narcotics Bureau has traded upon a flattering media image but has maintained great secrecy upon matters which might conceivably tarnish that image . . . </para>
            <para>Some of the largest seizures in recent years attributed in the media to the Narcotics Bureau have in fact occurred without any real assistance from the Narcotics Bureau. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Fourthly, the Bureau is distrusted by other law enforcement agencies. Again, the good judge says- this has never been challenged; apparently there is a volume of evidence to support this point; indeed, the Government accepted the report fairly quickly. The report stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is considerable and increasing distrust of the Narcotics Bureau among other law enforcement bodies. For some years past relationships between the Narcotics Bureau and COMPOL, especially at the top levels, have been bad but now relationships between the Narcotics Bureau and State police are bad in many places. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Fifthly, the morale of the Bureau is poor. On this point the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Narcotics Bureau is not a cohesive force with high morale and pride in its accomplishments. There is considerable frustration and bitterness among many Narcotics Bureau officers whom the Commission regards as dedicated and keen agents. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Its achievements- the very things that it was set up to do- are regarded by the Commission as disappointing. On this point the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Bureau&#39;s recent seizure figures reflect failure in its declared aim of detecting major traffickers, especially in heroin, and leaving lesser operations to the attention of State police. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report then states that the Bureau&#39;s agents are inadequately trained. </para>
          <para>Anyone looking at this as a departmental report would say that it is a fairly formidable indictment of the administration of a particular department. I believe it is an unchallenged indictment, though the whole basis of the material on which these conclusions are drawn is at the moment a matter of confidence; the arguments for them we cannot see. But it is apparently supported by extensive evidence in the unseen appendices, and the Government, for once, has acted rather quickly when it has had a problem in relation to the Bureau. </para>
          <para>Let it be said also that there are even graver charges hanging over the Bureau&#39;s head. These are not dealt with in the interim report. Firstly, there is the argument of deliberate noncooperation at times with State and Commonwealth police forces. We have had comment from the New South Wales royal commission today in relation to that. Secondly, there is the charge hanging over the Bureau that it has been penetrated by criminal elements. I know that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs said the other day: &#39;There was one bad apple we found&#39;. I suggest there is a real danger that that one bad apple may contaminate others in the basket. Certainly there is at the moment an investigation of alleged leaks from within the Bureau in the Wilson case. If it is true that there were leaks from inside the Bureau, then the machinery of the Bureau has been an accomplice to murder. I am going to leave aside those charges because they are only suspicions- </para>

              <para>-Right, I am not going to use them in the argument against the Minister. I am saying that we had better realise that there are these charges as well as the confirmed allegations against the Narcotics Bureau. But I am prepared to base my case simply on the established facts. The Minister has been responsible to this Parliament for this Bureau for over two years. He knows his responsibility. He knew it from the outset. In fact, one can find various quotations from him about how he recognised, as soon as he got this appointment, that one of his responsibilities was the Narcotics Bureau. He knew of the responsibility. He accepted the responsibility, though in the last couple of days he has said: &#39;I have been there for only two years&#39;. Perhaps the blame should be shifted a little farther back in time. Perhaps he is wanting to shift the blame to the Treasurer. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>When we look at the list of charges in the Williams report we have to ask ourselves these questions: Did the Minister know that the Bureau was widely believed to be inefficient? Why in over two years was it never suggested to this House by the Minister that there was a problem of efficiency within the Bureau? Why in the two years in which he has occupied this post has he never taken this House into his confidence about the problem of efficiency? Did the Minister know that there were allegations that the Bureau was over-centralised and poorly led? The only highlight there was his persuading of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harvey</inline> Bates to come back after he had resigned over what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harvey</inline> Bates took to be an affront. Did the Minister ever suspect that the Bureau was more concerned with its image than with its task of drug enforcement? If he did, he has never bothered to tell this House of that in the last two years. Did the Minister know that the Narcotics Bureau was distrusted by other law enforcement agencies? </para>
          <para>We originally raised this question in a bipartisan way. Why were the problems of the Narcotics Bureau not discussed in a bipartisan way? We raised the problem of distrust and the Minister said: &#39;Let us be bipartisan about this&#39;. One aspect of bipartisanship is to take the Opposition into the Government&#39;s confidence on these issues. Did the Minister know that morale was poor in the Bureau? Did the Minister recognise that the Bureau&#39;s agents were poorly trained? Did the Minister realise that the achievements of the Narcotics Bureau had been, to put it mildly, disappointing? </para>
          <para>None of those questions was answered in the Minister &#39;s speech. He never referred to any of the charges made against him. If he did know about those weaknesses, or some of them, it was his duty to inform this House. If he knew that the Bureau was inefficient, that morale was poor, that there were serious problems of relationships with other police forces, it was his duty to inform the House. If he knew and did not inform the House, he deserves to be censured. If, on the other hand, the Minister did not know about most of these major weaknesses in the Bureau, equally he deserves to be censured because surely it is the responsibility of the Minister- that is what we mean- to be on top of at least the major problems of the Department. Over two years the Minister has never told us anything at all about the problems of the Bureau. If he knew of them, he deserves to be censured by his attitude towards the House. If, on the other hand, he did not know of them, equally he deserves to be censured because it shows a lack of proper oversight. </para>
          <para>Only one hint has ever been given of the problem by the Minister. He referred to it on 8 March 1979 and repeated it last night when he said that the personnel and equipment of the Federal Narcotics Bureau had been substantially upgraded and that some SO additional narcotics investigators had been added to the Bureau in recent times. That is about the only suggestion this House has ever had that the Bureau has had a problem on its hands. We know now what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Williams said about that kind of solution to the problem. He said that the Narcotics Bureau claimed that the simple remedy for any deficiencies it may have is to increase its staff, power and resources. He said that the Commission rejected this cure, which, in the Commission&#39;s opinion, would compound the problem, not solve it. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Minister has no excuse for not being alert to the problem. He appealed to us a moment ago to be bipartisan. For the last year we have gone along with the principles of the Bills which he has introduced in the drug field, even though sometimes we have had doubts about them. We have gone along with them, we have tried to improve them. We have behaved in a bipartisan way and we have been betrayed. Never during those two years or during that period of bipartisan co-operation were we or this </para>
          <para class="block">House told by the Minister that, in fact, the Bureau to which we have been asked to give these enormous powers- powers related to listening devices and wire tapping- had a major question mark hanging over it. That is one reason why I think the Minister should have been alert to the problem. We have been talking about the Bureau constantly in this House. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the letters between his Department and the Royal Commission should have alerted him to this problem and should have led to more action. He said on the <inline font-style="italic">Nationwide</inline> program last night that he had acted decisively and positively by appointing a Royal Commission two years ago. We say that the problems that have been mounting in this Department, which the Minister has been increasingly alerted to, demanded swifter and speedier action than could be provided by the Royal Commission. It is true that in the end even the Minister began to realise that. He realised that after the Wilson affair. Let me say that the real problem about the Wilson affair is not the problem of the leak which is being investigated. I accept that the Minister is conducting an investigation. The real question is: Why was the Minister told nothing about the Wilsons until 10 days after their bodies were discovered? He knew nothing until 10 days after their bodies were discovered and then he learnt of the affair not from his Department, not from his Bureau, but from the <inline font-style="italic">Sun News-Pictorial</inline> in Melbourne. He has never answered that question. I hope that the Treasurer will explain to us why a Minister has to learn about an event of this kind in his department from the <inline font-style="italic">Sun NewsPictorial</inline> and not from his departmental head. That again should have alerted the Minister. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the censure motion that has been moved by the Opposition today is that the Opposition is inviting this House to censure a man whose very actions promoted the inquiry which exposed the deficiencies in a section of his administration. Quite apart from any highfalutin explanations of ministerial responsibility, it would seem to me to be an outrageous breach of common justice if this House were to censure a man who on three separate occasions initiated inquiries and investigations which led to the decision announced yesterday by the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> to begin the disbandment of the Federal Narcotics Bureau and its transfer in the first instance to the Commonwealth Police. I think it would be a very odd breach of ordinary, common justice for that to occur. That is precisely what the Opposition is inviting this House to do. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Bonython <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Blewett)</inline> put the case very well for the Opposition. I am going to nail the Opposition with the words of the honourable member for Bonython. He said that what he was really concerned about was the relationship between the Minister and the general administration of his Department. I put it to the House that what my colleague did within a short time of becoming Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in July 1977, what he did earlier this year in response to allegations about the Federal Narcotics Bureau, what he joined the Government in doing in inviting the bringing forward of the interim report which has triggered this whole debate and the decision of the Government to transfer the Narcotics Bureau to the Federal Police, were the actions of an honourable and responsible Minister. What he did was the action of a person acting immediately upon allegations having been brought to his attention. He acted not with delay or with inertia as has been alleged by the Opposition in this debate, but with decisiveness and, I believe, with considerable courage. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>This issue is of justifiable concern to every decent Australian. I accept and say immediately that many members of the Opposition are just as concerned about the drug problem as are the people on our side of the House. However, I am a little concerned about some of the odd approaches of some Opposition members to the legalisation of marihuana, but I leave that aside. I accept that there is a potential for a bipartisan approach to this problem. But I think it is a very odd sort of bipartisan approach when the day after a comprehensive report is tabled in the New South Wales Parliament and the day after the interim report of the Federal Royal Commission is tabled in this Parliament, all the Opposition does is to try to score a political victory in this debate by trying to impugn the responsibility, credit and honesty of my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife).</inline></para>
          <para>In essence, the Opposition has made three charges against my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Let us go through those charges. First of all, it has charged him with inertia. How can a person be successfully charged with inertia when within two months of being appointed a Minister a Royal </para>
          <para class="block">Commission is established with the widest possible terms of reference? Secondly, how can a person be charged with inertia following his actions earlier this year when doubts were raised about the integrity of people within the Narcotics Bureau and allegations were made of criminal conduct of the worst possible kind? What did this Minister do? Did he go to his colleagues and say: Look, we have to cover this up. We cannot have an investigation. We do not want this to get out&#39;? He recommended to his colleagues that there should not be an inquiry by the Narcotics Bureau into itself, that there should not be an inquiry by the Federal Police into the Narcotics Bureau, but that there should be a joint inquiry involving the State police. Anybody in this House who understands the relationship between law enforcement agencies in this country in relation to narcotics or at any other level will know that there is a certain degree of jealousy between the law enforcement agencies. One of the last things that a Minister does to make himself popular with his own law enforcement agency is to invite other law enforcement agencies to undertake an investigation of it. There is nothing more calculated, to put it bluntly, to raise the hackles of a law enforcement agency than to have it investigated by somebody else. </para>
          <para>Is this the action of a man who is having the wool pulled over his eyes by a section of his administration? Is this the action of a man who is asking his colleagues to bury the matter or to push it under the carpet? In other words, is this the action of a weak, irresponsible Minister? I put it to the House that clearly it is not. Furthermore, the Minister joined with the rest of the Government in inviting the Williams Royal Commission to bring forward an interim report. What happened specifically in respect of that invitation? Was there any doubt left in the mind of the Royal Commissioner as to what was wanted? Was any suggestion made that the Royal Commissioner should bring forward a whitewash of the Narcotics Bureau? No, there was not. Rather, as reported by the  Deputy  Prime Minister yesterday, the Williams Royal Commission stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In July 1979 following allegations of leakages of information from an unknown officer of the Sydney office of the Narcotics Bureau, the Government decided it was appropriate to consider general matters relating to the Narcotics Bureau, including organisation, recruitment, starling and control, lines of responsibility to the Permanent Head and the Minister, and relationship with other arms of government. Accordingly, on 7 August, with the approval of  His Excellency  the Governor-General, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> sought from the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs an interim report on those issues. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Is that the request or the injunction of a government that is trying to cover something up? Is that the request of a Minister who is running for cover and who is scared that there will be embarrassing revelations about the conduct of his Department? I put it to the House that that is the action of a responsible Minister in the best Westminster tradition. For the Opposition to suggest otherwise is to completely misunderstand the situation. I put it to the House that on the charge of inertia the Opposition has demonstrably failed to establish this censure motion. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and the honourable member for Bonython have tried to suggest that the Minister has showed a lack of responsibility in the discharge of his obligations. I put it to the House again that the Minister&#39;s track record in terms of taking action when matters have been brought to his attention, and his record in bringing forward to the Government and ultimately to this Parliament some recommendations to upgrade the performance and capabilities of the Narcotics Bureau early in 1978, is also evidence of a Minister discharging his duties with a high degree of responsibility. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition, who cannot seem to restrain himself on these bipartisan occasions, could not resist impugning the ordinary honesty of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I do not believe anybody who sat through Question Time earlier today and watched the stoney, unimpressed silence of the Opposition as its Leader and other people asked pre-arranged questions could have failed to have been impressed by the ordinary honesty and candour of my colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. On the score of honesty and candour, I also believe that the charge against my colleague has failed miserably. </para>
          <para>A couple of specific charges were made against this side of the House during debate to which I would now like to turn. The first thing that was made great play of was the question of what we did in 1975, the obstructionist tactics that were adopted by the then Opposition. I inform the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> that the Bill bringing about the changes of which he spoke was introduced into this House by the then Attorney-General on 30 October 1975; in other words, 14 days after the then Opposition had announced its intention to defer the passing of the Appropriation Bills in the Senate. In those circumstances can there be any charge sustained that the obstruction of the then Opposition held up that legislation? The Bill was introduced and, on the motion of the honourable member for Fisher <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann),</inline> debate was adjourned, and that was the end of the matter. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Adelaide should sit in his seat. Also, an allegation was made about deceit by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. The honourable member for Bonython tries to interject.  His  colleague, the honourable member for Adelaide, was talking in earnest and grave tones about hushed conversations at meetings of the Cabinet Legislation Committee earlier this year, allegedly when we were snowed into letting the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill go through in hasty fashion. Is the honourable member for Adelaide seriously suggesting that every time an allegation of criminal conduct is made against a section of the bureaucracy any Bill at all conferring additional power on or giving additional discretions to that section of the bureauracy ought to be immediately pulled out of the Parliament? That is the effect of the charge that he made. He is nodding his head; he is suggesting that every time somebody makes an allegation, everything should be suspended immediately. That is the effect of what is being alleged by the honourable member for Adelaide so far as the telecommunications legislation is concerned. Of course, that is an absurdity. The Government was required then to establish immediately an impartial and proper inquiry into those investigations. That has been established. It is the Hall inquiry and it was established in a most impartial and objective manner. For the honourable member for Adelaide or anybody else on the Opposition side to suggest otherwise is complete nonsense. </para>

          <para>I would hope that all members on both sides of the House would agree that successful prosecution of the fight against the drug problem in Australia is a matter of the first priority. I believe that during the time this Government has been in office, and in particular while my colleague has been responsible for the area, it has committed itself with great dedication and energy to that task. Of course, the Government appreciates those elements of bipartisan support that have been extended by the Opposition in respect of this. What the Government does not appreciate from the Opposition is this cheap, politically motivated attempt to discredit my colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. He has acted with candour; he has acted promptly, honestly and responsibly. The Government has &#34;&#34;acted responsibly and speedily. Upon receipt of the report of the Royal Commission, seven weeks ago, after studying it and announcing its conclusions last night, the  Deputy  Prime Minister indicated the changed administrative arrangements that would come into operation. </para>
          <para>I believe that this motion is ill-founded. It invites the House to come to the incredibly unfair conclusion that a man who invites an investigation into his administration must then be condemned and censured out of hand because of the findings of a royal commission into that administration. I believe that that is a manifestly unfair proposition. It is a proposition that has not been established by the Opposition and I invite the House to reject the motion. I move: </para>

Following a break during the summer recess the reviews are scheduled for completion next April. A similar review of the Department of the House of Representatives was conducted in 1977. The range of services provided by these departments is critical to the efficient functioning of the Parliament. The organisation of the departments has been adjusted over the years in a piecemeal manner to accommodate changing parliamentary needs.

          <para>-I present the official report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to France, the European Parliament and the Commission of the European Communities. From 28 May to 8 June this year I had the pleasure of leading a delegation representing both Houses of this Parliament to France, the European Parliament and the Commission of the European Communities. An important objective of the fact finding mission was to establish personal contact with parliamentarians, senior government officials and representatives of private enterprise to facilitate the future exchange of information and views on matters affecting Australia and Europe. The visit to France was in response to an invitation from the  President  of the French National Assembly, M. Chaban-Delmas. It was intended to increase goodwill between our two countries and our parliaments while also allowing delegates to study issues of mutual interest to France and Australia. These included agriculture, defence technology and nuclear energy. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As this report will show, the delegation is satisfied that these aims were achieved. It recognises that this was largely due to the excellent cooperation afforded us by the French Parliament and the various agencies involved in our program. In Luxembourg the delegation was received by M. Carlo Meintz, Vice-President of the European Parliament on the eve of the first European general election and delegates were informed of the exciting prospects and problems which face the new European Parliament. At the EC Commission the delegation was briefed on a number of issues of interest to the European member countries and Australia, including the economic climate in Europe and the Common Agricultural Policy. The visit ended with discussions with the  Chairman  of the EC Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roy</inline> Jenkins, at which constructive proposals were made to develop co-operation between Australia and the Community. These proposals are dealt with in the body of the report. </para>
        <para>On behalf of the members of the delegation I take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the hospitality, assistance and co-operation extended to us by the French Parliament, the European Parliament and the EC Commission as well as the various government, local government and private enterprise bodies which contributed to the success of our mission. We are also grateful to the Australian ambassadors and their staffs whose assistance was invaluable. I thank and congratulate the members of the delegation for the fine spirit in which they worked together to make the mission a great success. Their application and manifest interest were exemplary and a credit to the Parliament and Australia. I also express my appreciation to the secretary of the delegation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Bush, and my own private secretary who accompanied us on the expedition. </para>

          <para>-by leave-As one of the members of the delegation I think it is important to draw the attention of the House to the importance of direct communication between members of the Australian Parliament and areas in which we have a direct interest, politically, economically and socially. The matters that were highlighted for members of the delegation during the visit to France were the differences in problems which exists for the government and administration of France as opposed to Australia as well as the closeness with which the countries of Europe are integrated in the European Common Market, the Commission of the European Communities and the European Parliament which was engaged in its first direct elections during the period we were in France. France&#39;s position relating to energy and discussions which were held with the European Atomic Energy Community indicated the difficulties which confront a country or an area which is totally devoid of natural energy resources. The discussions indicated how fortunate Australia is to have very extensive reserves of energy on which it can draw and from which it can derive extreme benefit if those energy reserves are properly managed and are put to use for the benefit of the Australian people. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One of the matters which I think most delegates would have found of concern was the lack of any indication of real movement on access for Australian agricultural products. An area of concern which was expressed to us during our discussions with members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was the development of the world economy over the next five years. Certainly we in this Parliament tend to live in an atmosphere of unreality and quite often we have misleading sloganising rather than the facts in many matters. I think it would have been obvious to those members of the delegation and other members of this Parliament who visited Europe at about the same time that some of the world&#39;s problems are quite different from the way in which they are portrayed to this Parliament. </para>
        <para>The delegation had useful discussions on those areas which you mentioned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I hope that the links which have been established will be maintained by this Parliament in the future. Whilst it is important to maintain links with other parts of the world, it should not be overlooked at any time that Europe is important to Australia as a trading area, a commercial area and an area from which we have traditionally sought guidance on international affairs and in which we have sought to establish our right to trade. The visit by an Austraiian delegation was sought by the French Government over a long period. I think it is important in future not only to send delegations overseas but also to pay the country extending the invitation the courtesy of not trying to withdraw from any invitation we have accepted. </para>

          <para>-by leave-As a member of the delegation that visited France, the European Parliament and the Commission of the European Communities, I would like briefly to endorse your remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in tabling the report of the delegation and also the remarks of the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes). Mr Speaker,</inline> I wish to thank you very much, from my own point of view and I know from the point of view of other members of the delegation, for the tremendous leadership you gave to that delegation. It was an important delegation. I thought that the way in which you led it was extremely admirable and that that went a long way towards making the visit as successful at it was. I would also like to thank my other colleagues on the delegation from both sides of this House and the other place for making the trip as interesting and worthwhile as it was. I join you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in thanking the officers who accompanied us, particularly the secretary of the delegation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Bush, and the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs who helped us so much in the various centres that we visited. I also express my thanks to those members of the French National Assembly who took great care in arranging our itinerary in France and whose assistance to us while we were there, I think, went well beyond the call of duty. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I really do believe that the visit was important in helping further to forge closer links between Australia and France and with the other countries of Europe. As the honourable member for Corio has said, western Europe is still of enormous importance on the world scene. That certainly applies no less to Australia than it does to other nations. I think it is of great importance that we get closer to Europe by increasing our contacts with European countries. We already have many contacts, particularly at the ministerial level, the official level and in the private enterprise or business world, but there certainly has not been sufficient contact between parliamentarians. Our visit has helped at least in some small way to fill this breach. I hope it is the forerunner of further closer links being forged in the future- There is no doubt at all that European parliamentarians want closer contact with their Australian counterparts. It was very interesting to learn, for instance, that within the French Parliament the Australia-France Parliamentary Friendship Committee is the largest of all such committees. </para>
        <para>I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House, but there are just two matters that I would like to refer to briefly. The first is the strength of the impression that certainly I obtained from the visit as to the importance of the further development of the nuclear generation of electricity for the future standard of living in Europe. Time and time again the energy crisis was raised with us and time and time again those who raised this matter with us stressed the need for Europe to proceed with its nuclear development program. Europe is doing just that. For example, 25 per cent of France&#39;s electricity output is already provided from nuclear sources. Within five years this will rise to 50 per cent. Forty per cent of Belgium&#39;s electricity is already nuclear generated and within five years this will rise to 60 per cent. The same pattern is emerging in many other European countries. I think the point that should not be lost on us in Australia is that these developments will occur. No attitude of ours to oppose the mining and exporting of Australian uranium will change this. All that would happen would be that we in Australia would lose out on markets to the rest of the world, to the detriment of the living standards not only of the world but also of all Australians. </para>
        <para>The other matter I want to mention briefly relates to the new Mirage 2000 tactical fighter, which is one of the four remaining contenders as a replacement for Australia&#39;s existing Mirage tactical fighter force. The description of the delegation &#39;s visit to the Mirage test flight centre at Istres in the south of France is contained in the report. I commend a very careful reading of it to honourable members. I would like to place on record how impressed I was with what I saw at Istres and with the discussions we had with senior executives of the Dassault organisation, the manufacturer of the Mirage. I am not a technical expert in the area of military aviation but I would say that the effort and the quality of that effort which Dassault has put into preparing its tender to the Australian Government for the tactical fighter force replacement is highly commendable. I was particularly impressed with its proposals for Australian participation in its program. </para>
        <para>I conclude on the note on which I began, that is, of thanking you very much, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and all the others associated with the delegation for making the visit to France, the European Parliament and the EEC not only very enjoyable but also, I believe, very worth while. </para>

          <para>-by leave-Like the honourable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Short),</inline> I would like to thank you very sincerely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> for the leadership that you gave to the delegation and for the contribution that you made to the overall success of the delegation among not only the members themselves but also the many people of whom we were guests while we were in Europe. I would also like to record my thanks to the officials in France, in Luxembourg and in the European Economic Community in Brussels, to the Australian Ambassador <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rowland,</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Plimsoll and to the Foreign Affairs officers in Europe. I would also like to thank the French Embassy in Australia for the hospitality and interest it showed both before the delegation left Australia and after it returned. I also record my thanks to the secretary of the delegation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Bush, whose linguistic expertise made the delegation&#39;s trip such a useful, worthwhile and pleasant experience. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There are a few matters which have been mentioned by other honourable members upon which I will not expand. I would like to join totally with what the honourable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Short)</inline> said about the Mirage as a tactical fighter force replacement in Australia. I would like also to say how important it is for Australia to develop and maintain very close relationships with the European Economic Community. To me, one of the most interesting aspects of the delegation&#39;s visit was to see the other side of the argument. We in Australia tend to look upon the Australian point of view as being the only one, but obviously, as in so many other areas, there are two points of view, and the Europeans have one. One of the things which was very important was the fact that Roy Jenkins, on behalf of the EEC, stated his intention to see that the European Economic Community opened a mission in Australia. That will go a long way towards improving relationships between the European Economic Community and this country. </para>
        <para>The European Parliament is an institution which is growing in significance. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> its first fully representative elections were held while we were there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> did not mention this, but it should be mentioned that the Australian Parliament is making a gift of a gavel to the European Parliament. I think that is a very proper thing to do. We, as a Parliament, ought to give consideration to going further in this respect, and we ought to consider giving something to the European Parliament. I would like to see a gift of a work of art which is distinctly Australian and which could be displayed in some prominent position. It would be a constant reminder of the relationship between Australia and the EEC. </para>
        <para>I would like to speak about the uranium activities that we saw, which for me was the high point of the whole trip. The Tricastin enrichment plant in France is an investment amounting to something like $2 billion. The feed for that plant is about 18,000 tons per annum of natural uranium which assays at about 0.7 per cent. The production that comes from the enrichment plant is 10.8 million separative work units, which is equivalent to 2,500 tonnes of enriched uranium 235 which assays as 3 per cent to 4 per cent uranium 235. The tailings that come out of that enrichment plant consist of 0.2 per cent uranium 235. The enrichment plant has a power requirement of 3,100 megawatts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you will recall that in the uranium process the role of an enrichment plant is very similar to the role of an oil refinery in the oil industry. The uranium is taken to a stage where it can be used as a feed for the reactors, in the same way that an oil refinery upgrades the oil for feed for uses to which petroleum products are put. In this particular plant there is a seven year process from the selection of the site to full production, which has not yet been achieved and will not be achieved until about 1981. </para>
        <para>I would like to say something about the uranium process because I think it is very important to Australia, and it is something to which we should be giving very serious consideration. The process basically is a gasified uranium hexafluoride flow which goes through three stages, the first being a compressor, the second being a diffuser and the third being a heat exchange. There are 1,400 individual units involved in this plant. The process is such that the more units the gas goes through the purer it becomes. The gas goes into a compressor and flows from the compressor into the diffuser. The richer gas goes into the next compressor and diffuser process, ultimately going through all 1,400 units. The lower gas goes out through a heat exchanger and back through the compressor and diffuser stage again. From an initial grade of 0.7 per cent the rich gas gets richer and the low gas becomes poorer until the assays go from that 0.7 per cent up to 3 per cent to 4 per cent, which is the reactor feed level, and down to 0.2 per cent, at which stage it has become the tailings or the waste. </para>
        <para class="block">There are no problems with this waste. The amount of radioactive waste associated with an enrichment plant is absolutely minimal. </para>
        <para>Australia ought to be looking at this project. The requirements for an enrichment plant of this, nature are steel, of which Australia has no shortage, and energy. As I indicated, there is a need for a power source of 3,100 megawatts. The Tricastin plant is based on an electricity plant in the same vicinity. We have a choice of establishing such a plant, based either on hydro-electricity or on one of the coalfields in this country. We ought to be looking at that. There is an enormous requirement of nickel. In an enrichment plant, all the surfaces exposed to uranium have to be nickel coated. When this particular establishment was constructed an equivalent of two hectares of surface area was nickel plated each month. Obviously Australia has the nickel. The only other thing that is needed in an enrichment plant is the uranium, and Australia has that uranium. </para>
        <para>In 1990 there will be a world demand for 75 million separative work units. The European availability will be 22 million separative work units and the United States of America availability will be 38 million separative work units. That represents a total availability of 60 million separative work units with a shortfall of 15 million. An Australian plant producing 10 million separative work units would not create an oversupply of enrichment facilities in the world. Australia must act soon in this particular respect in view of the long lead time required and because we ought to signal our intention to the rest of the world, before other countries get into it, that we want to be in this field and satisfy the demand. </para>
        <para>There is a serious risk of Australia getting into exactly the same position with uranium as it did with wool. For the best part of a century all the wool from this country was exported and treated in other countries. We should not allow that to happen in relation to uranium. In this present energy situation Australia should not be just a mine or a quarry for the rest of the world. We should extract that uranium and convert it to yellowcake, as we intend to do, and we should also invest the $2 billion that is necessary to establish a uranium enrichment plant in Australia. I believe that this is something which is of vital importance to Australia. It is something which does not provide any environmental risk or waste hazard. It is something to which this Government should give very close and full consideration in the immediate future. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I conclude by thanking you for your leadership and your patience and tolerance in allowing me to say a few words on the tabling of this important statement. </para>

            <para>-The purpose of the Patents Amendment (Patent Cooperation Treaty) Bill is to amend the Patents Act to provide conformity with the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The consequence of this will be to permit Australian accession to the Treaty. This Patent Cooperation Treaty essentially is a mechanism for rationalising procedural features of the patent system of member countries through mutual co-operation. As such it has the potential- I emphasise the word &#39;potential&#39;- to assist Australian inventors to obtain increased protection in other countries. The development of the Patent Cooperation Treaty system began in 1966 when the United States of America suggested that a study be conducted by what is now known as the World Intellectual Property Organisation, to determine if some steps could be taken to reduce the duplication of search effort for applications filed in a number of foreign countries. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Those who have visited Geneva recently- I suppose that might include honourable members who have just spoken at length about their recent trip to that part of the world- will know that the World Intellectual Property Organisation has one of the most extraordinary buildings in Europe. The Organisation has spent millions of dollars on the building. I only hope that there will be a good return from it. The Organisation has spent thousands of dollars on transplanting a tree outside the building. As I say, I hope that the building itself will provide for a viable operation and that it has not been paid for out of subscriptions from member countries like Australia. After a number of drafts of the Treaty were published, the Patent Cooperation Treaty in its present form was concluded and signed in June 1970 by 20 countries, and subsequently signed by another 15 countries. It is noteworthy that Australia did not sign the Treaty at that time. </para>
          <para>The Patent Cooperation Treaty commenced operation on 1 June 1978 for the states which had deposited their instrument of ratification of, or accession to, the treaty. The Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> argued in his second reading speech when introducing this Bill that our accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty would be of significant benefit to Australian industry. However, in doing so, he based his case on two major assertions. I want to list these assertions and use the Ministers &#39;s words because I believe the assertions are questionable. He said:   the effectiveness of a patent system is in no way dependent upon the territorial origin of an invention or the nationality of a patentee and that those factors are essentially irrelevant to the operation  of a  patent system. </para>
          <para class="block">That is the first assertion which, I think is questionable. The second assertion from his second reading speech states:   the motivation provided by the economic rewards obtainable from a commercial monopoly makes the patent system, in principle at least, the most effective incentive devised to date for the exploitation of new technology by industry. </para>
          <para class="block">I go no further than to say that these assertions are questionable and I want to develop that argument. The Opposition questions, as I say, both of those points that have been made. Therefore, if our questioning is correct, the benefits of the Treaty are likely to be more imaginary than real given current circumstances and policies. However, the Opposition is not going to oppose the Bill because we question those assertions. We are not going to oppose it outright for a couple of related reasons. Before I get on to my questioning I will list those reasons, Firstly, there is our belief, as I shall explain shortly, that the disadvantages associated with our accession should be handled by other positive measures. They would not be resolved simply by rejection of the Treaty. Secondly, we are not opposing this because we have taken into account the Minister&#39;s foreshadowing, in his second reading speech to which I have drawn attention, of a review of the Australian patents system. We are informed that this review, to be performed by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee, will be oriented towards improving the patent system&#39;s practical effectiveness rather than the mere structure of its legislative framework. The Minister seems to accept the growing view put by, among others, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation which has stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Perhaps it is because the patent system is such a venerable institution with such a wide international acceptance, that it is commonly assumed to operate in this way. But its underlying assumptions and alleged benefits are open to serious question, particularly in small nations like Australia. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is acknowledged that most patents issued in Australia are &#39;bad&#39; in the sense that the scope of monopoly created is too wide and the cost of challenging a bad patent, once issued, is too frightening. However, while this review has potential, the Opposition is concerned that the arguments contained in the Minister&#39;s speech will unduly restrict the scope of the inquiry. Thus, it must be emphasised that our support for accession to the Treaty is qualified in several major respects. To make this explicit, I intend to move on behalf of the Opposition an amendment to the motion for the second reading which recognises that the benefits of the Patent Cooperation Treaty will materialise only if the Government acknowledges the broader issues, which I am about to develop, and abandons the present attitudes displayed in the Minister&#39;s speech. </para>
          <para>Let us examine more closely what I believe to be the two unacceptable assertions made in the Minister&#39;s speech which are crucial to his optimistic conclusions. Firstly, there is his view that the effectiveness of a patent system is independent of the nationality of the patentee. This view, I believe, ignores a very considerable body of opinion within the international community that patents have been used in the past to control imports and exports and to control the production of subsidiaries. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> had his trip to France, the European Parliament and other places, I have been very glad to represent this Parliament at not only a debate on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, to which I was accompanied by the honourable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hyde),</inline> but also at a seminar in Geneva run by the Interparliamentary Union, a seminar on the environment. So, on behalf of this Parliament, I was able to be in Geneva just recently. I visited not only the building to which I have just referred, owned by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, but also the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development organisation and talked to people in UNCTAD interested in the very subject of the transference of technology between nations. This is where the challenge to the old system arose originally. </para>
          <para>The international patents system, justified as an instrument to encourage creative activity, has occasionally been singularly unsuccessful in facilitating the transfer of technology to host countries. It has been found, for example, that the majority of patents registered in the developing countries are not exploited. Thus patents are registered which not only entitle their holders to produce the patented product directly or to license it to a third party, but also give the exclusive right to import the product into the country in which the patent is registered. This gives international corporations the possibility of controlling certain markets without having to make direct investments in the country concerned. This situation can result in frustration of the task of imitating, assimilating and adapting technology to that country. I believe that in this day and age, when we are interested in building up developing countries, we have to look at this subject, limited in interest though it may be, of the international movement of technology with much more seriousness than we have hitherto in this Parliament. </para>
          <para>Also, the system, by enabling restrictions to be placed on the licences to use patents, has resulted in some cases in restrictions being placed on the number of goods which can be produced, the numbers which can be exported and the destination of any exports. That these possibilities exist has been acknowledged by, for example, the OECD, which has incorporated guidelines covering technology transfer in its &#39;Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises&#39;, and UNCTAD, which is still in the process of drafting an international code of conduct on the transfer of technology, that same organisation to which I just referred. I spoke about my visiting the relevant officers in that organisation. The Minister&#39;s claim, I believe, ignores the informed views coming from these areas. </para>
          <para>But we do not have to go outside Australia for strong arguments about the dangers inherent in a patents system which ignores possible abuses by foreign patent holders. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, in its report on &#39;Industrial Research and Development in Australia&#39; dated May this year, has provided what I believe to be cogent and good arguments against the views which seem to be those of the Minister, if we deduce correctly from his second reading speech. The Committee&#39;s arguments are particularly relevant when considered against the background that, firstly, Australia is a net importer of technology. For instance, in 1974-75 payments for royalties and copyrights exceeded $75m whereas receipts amounted to  only $9m. Secondly, as the Minister himself admitted, over 90 per cent of patents registered in Australia annually are granted to overseas patentees- 10,000 out of 1 1,000 in 1978. That is a very sad situation. I want to repeat those figures: Of the 11,000 patents granted in 1978, 10,000 were granted to people overseas. I have already shown that I admire the work of the Senate Standing Committee in its report on this subject. I want now to quote from the Committee. It stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Much intellectual property covering new technology useful to Australia is privately owned by big national and multinational corporations. These naturally seek to limit, by patent licensing and other means, the use made of it by competitors. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Committee further stated:   . .. although a subsidiary may buy technology from its parent, the amount paid may not always relate to the intrinsic value of the technology. In some instances ... an unwarrantedly high price may be paid as a device for transferring capital, and /or reducing company taxes. </para>
          <para class="block">The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment also quoted from a paper by Professor Brian Johns, the Director of the Government&#39;s Bureau of Industry Economics, when he argued that it is: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. important to examine the conditions attached to contracts and arrangements for the import of technology. In many instances, these conditions include limitations on the exports which can be made by the local subsidiary of the licensee. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Senate Committee recognised that licensing can produce problems for countries like Australia. The Committee listed that attempts can be made by licensors:   . . to fix prices at which the licensee can sell the licensed products or goods made with a licensed process; </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. to impose tying clauses forcing licensees to purchase from the licensor unpatented raw materials that are freely available elsewhere;  to oblige the licensee to acquire certain technology, already freely available in the recipient country, as part of the larger package;  to require a licensee to use trade marks of the licensor under conditions that do not enhance the licensee&#39;s chances of succeeding in the local market;  to insulate the Licensee from reasonable export markets; </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">And the last of these limitations-   to charge a royalty, or otherwise provide for remuneration to the licensor, that is unreasonably high in the circumstances. </para>
          <para class="block">As a result of these possibilities, the Senate Committee argued in its report that: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It cannot be assumed that Australia is immune from the practices, which amount to restrictive trade practices in the broad sense of the term. </para>

          <para class="block">The Committee concluded that: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It may be that consideration should also be given to problems attendant upon foreign patents and licences with application of standards similar to those existing in the internal trade practices legislation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In another section of its report, the Committee commented on issues and problems relating to the patent system itself. It argued that legislation favouring the inventive citizen:   . . may be justified in order to stimulate domestic industrial innovation. However, it does not necessarily follow that it is also in the national interest to favour inventive, technology-exporting countries by extending monopoly rights to them. </para>
          <para class="block">The Committee also pointed out that: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is salutary to remember that the introduction of patent laws and the participation of countries in international patent agreements have a history of being determined by self-interest and nationalism. The USA did not put foreign and local applicants for patents on an equal footing until the end of the 19th Century, by which time its position as an industrial nation was assured. The British Patents Act was altered between the two World Wars to prevent patenting of chemical compounds. This was a deliberate effort to reduce the dominance of German technology in this field. Japan and Italy adopted similar policies for the same reason. The USSR did not join the International Patents Convention until it had technology to sell. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What I am stating categorically in supporting these attitudes in this Senate Committee report is that Australians have too often been too naive in areas such as this. We are an importer of technology. We are paying a high price for that technology. We need to display more nationalism in our attitudes to questions such as these which I am raising. </para>

              <para>-Of course nationalism affects the market. It affects jobs and the creation of jobs in this country. If the honourable member had been listening to the points that I have quoted from the Senate Committee report he would have noted all the restrictions that are put on job creation through Australia&#39;s being a little bit too naive in this sector. All of these considerations should lay to rest once and for all the Minister&#39;s apparent view- and I am only taking this view from the comments in his second reading speech- that the effectiveness of our patent system is independent of the nationality of the patentee. They lead us to the conclusion that the Australian Government should be actively taking steps to examine and to develop legislation in relation to the international relevance of present patent laws and agreements to Australian industrial research and development and the importation of technology. Australia has to be on the side of the developing countries in so much of what is going on in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development consultations when considering this subject. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The second major assertion made by the Minister- and I remind the House of it as I have already stated it- was that the patent system potentially is the most effective system devised to encourage the exploitation of new technology by industry. Once again I believe that we need not go past the Senate Standing Committee when considering this issue, although we could look at the views expressed in the reports of the Australian Science and Technology Council, ASTEC, and the Crawford study group on the sort of action necessary to resuscitate indigenous IR and D activity in Australia. All these committees argue in one voice that the cause of Australia relying very heavily on overseas technology is the lack of funds for indigenous industrial research and development- not on an imperfect patent system. It has been pointed out that Australia&#39;s overall commitment of resources to research and development puts it in the middle rank when compared with other countries and that a high proportion of Australian research is either provided for by the Government or is basic research rather than applied research and development. </para>
          <para>There are very strong grounds for believing that IR and D activities might not attract the degree of funding warranted if financing such activities were determined by private capital markets alone. For example, industrial research and development may give rise to significant economic benefits extending beyond those accruing directly to firms and individuals undertaking IR and D. All potential applications of particular IR and D activities cannot necessarily be anticipated or patented by the originators of new products and processes. Also, the risk that particular IR and O activities will not yield an economic return may be high from the viewpoint of individual businesses and investors whereas the risk to the community at large that resources devoted to IR and D will not yield an overall economic return may be substantially lower. </para>
          <para>Both the Crawford study group and the Senate Standing Committee generally concluded that the task of achieving a turnaround in industrial research and development activity in Australia is substantial and that additional resources should be applied to this area. The Crawford study group considered that there is also a problem associated with the financing of firms adopting new technology. For reasons I have noted earlier in this speech, private financial institutions can be reluctant to provide finance for the introduction or development of new technology or innovations, particularly when the commercial viability is unknown or still doubtful. Johns, </para>
          <para class="block">Dunlop and Lamb found that great difficulty is experienced by recently established and fast growing small firms in obtaining medium and long term finance to develop new products and processes. </para>
          <para>In proposing that an innovation authority be established the study group envisaged that such a body would have, in addition to its other functions, a role similar to the United Kingdom National Research and Development Corporation, the NRDC. In addition, while focusing on this point, it has been pointed out by the Senate Standing Committee that the short and medium term financial assistance offered by government under the industrial research incentives scheme was, and I believe still is, clearly deficient. For example, the Committee pointed out that the average project grant for a company after tax during the 1977-78 year was in the vicinity of $2,500. Whilst the figures for last year and this year will be higher, those figures are unlikely to be sufficient to overturn the Senate Committee&#39;s view that: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. such low levels of grants lead to a frittering away of public money without having an appreciable effect on the quality of the nation &#39;s technology. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Committee went on to recommend that the Government: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. establish policies designed to remove disincentives from, and give positive encouragement to, the systematic commercial adoption of research results. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The arguments I have put forward against the Minister&#39;s two assertions provide, I believe, powerful reasons why this House should reject the optimistic conclusions in the second reading speech. Only if this is done is it likely that Australia will give sufficient scope to the review of the patent system. Only then will the review be a true response to the Senate Standing Committee &#39;s call in its report when it said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australia&#39;s present patent system may well be acting against the country&#39;s best interests. Once again absence of any clear policy or plan for national industrial development makes it very difficult to know where our best interests may lie. Even so, a review of our patent system in the light of the situation with respect to IR&#38;D is clearly indicated. The Committee accordingly recommends that the Minister for Productivity undertake an examination of both the national and international relevance of present patent laws and agreements to Australian IR&#38;D and the importation of technology. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Only when the dimensions I have raised are recognised will the Government be in the position to devise policies which truly extract the potential benefits for Australia from the Patent Cooperation Treaty. We of the Opposition give notice that we are prepared to support the Treaty only if the conditions contained in our amendment to the motion for the second reading of the </para>
          <para class="block">Bill are given much attention. We cannot put qualifications on the Bill&#39;s going through as we do not have the numbers to do so, but we can use the time of the Parliament in debating this treaty to draw attention to the way in which the administration of patents and the legislation relating to patents can so properly stimulate research and development activities in our community and thus so properly be of enormous assistance to job creation. </para>

            <para>-This Bill is designed to allow Australian accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty which, of convenience, we can refer to as the PCT. To the motion for the second reading of this Bill we have just heard an amendment moved by the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford).</inline> It would seem to me that the amendment rests on some sort of misconception of what this Bill really is all about. It would seem that the amendment is trying to widen the ambit of this Bill to take in the whole general area of industrial research and development, which is really quite irrelevant to this debate. With that comment, I shall leave it to the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> to indicate the Government&#39;s attitude to the amendment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A couple of the points that the honourable member for Adelaide has made would seem to me to be casting more doubt about this legislation than needs to be cast. It is, of course, quite true that in the end result the real effectiveness of our accession to the Treaty will be known only after a trial period, after a period of usage. To that extent, I suppose it is valid to say that the Treaty may not do what we hope of it. On the other hand, it may well do all that is hoped of it. The honourable member for Adelaide made reference to the benefits being more imaginary than real. I would suggest that there are going to be some very real benefits which can and will flow from our belonging to the PCT. I shall indicate some of these in more detail in my speech, but, just putting it in a nutshell, our accession to the Treaty may well give Australia wider and quicker access to international inventions. It may well provide simpler and possibly more effective and less expensive international protection than currently exists for Austraiian inventiveness. The assistance that we can give undeveloped nations, particularly in the South East Asian region, is important from Australia&#39;s point of view. Finally, I refer to the point the honourable member for Adelaide made about the low level of Austraiian patent applications; indeed, this accession can provide a stimulus to Australian inventiveness, research and development- by no means all the stimulus that may be needed but in itself it can provide a stimulus. </para>
          <para>I accept that there ought to be a more national approach, if you like, to industrial research and development. What the PCT can do and may well do for Australia is to provide one way of stimulating further and more inventive research and development. After the honourable member for Adelaide made that point he went on to discuss the level of industrial research and development funding as provided by the Government. It is a criticism that I do not accept. It is a criticism that does not really give a proper analysis of the Budget provisions last year and this year for research and development. Nevertheless, all that is really quite irrelevant to the main point, which simply is that we are seeking to accede to a treaty which I believe will give real benefits to Australian industry and to the part we can play in the South East Asian region in particular. </para>
          <para>The Patent Cooperation Treaty is, for the first time, providing a truly international service for the filing and processing of patent applications. Acceding to the Treaty was widely canvassed over the last year. The Minister for Productivity called for, and received, submissions from a wide cross-section of Australian organisations and the Australian community at large. Australian industry and research institutions were overwhelmingly in favour of acceding to the Treaty. </para>
          <para>There has been a measure of international collaboration and co-ordination in industrial property matters for nearly a century. I refer here to the first major international convention dealing with the protection of industrial property, the Paris Union. This Union was based on the principle of mutual recognition and recorded an agreement to develop domestic laws along certain established lines. Nevertheless, the industrial property system remained firmly based on the domestic laws, courts and procedures of individual nations. </para>
          <para>Certain other arrangements followed. For example, there was the Madrid Agreement, which gave some sort of international system for the registration of trade marks. But no supranational method of dealing with industrial property rights evolved until the creation of the Patent Cooperation Treaty. At times, various ideas have been tried out or proposed. For example, some nations in post- World War II Europe tried to harmonise procedures and formalities to achieve uniformity in law, but to little effect. The Scandinavians made a brave attempt with their Nordic system and an international searching centre was established at The Hague but still there was no really international system. </para>
          <para>Then came the Common Market in Europe and with it a recognition that nationally based industrial property laws were probably incompatible with the economic aims of the European Economic Community as expressed in the Treaty of Rome. One of the cornerstones of Community policy is the free movement of goods. It was therefore seen that a uniform and monolithic patent system was desirable and probably ultimately inevitable. </para>
          <para>Thus, in the early 1960s, we saw come into being the European Patent Convention, which provided a new style of international activity. That came, I might say, at an opportune time because at that time we found patent offices, patent users and patent applicants around the world bogging down in a mass of applications and patent literature. Patents were becoming more complex, applicants were seeking wider geographical protection and there was generally some upsurge in the number of applications being made. A more universal system than the European convention was therefore seen to be needed to solve some of the problems, which included multiple searching and separate filings in countries in which protection was sought. After intense argument the PCT came about. It was the first serious attempt to marshal the resources of the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the great examining patent offices of the world. It provides for the first time an international service for filing and processing patent applications. By this Bill, Australia will accede to the Treaty and take advantage of its benefits three months after the Bill has been assented to. </para>
          <para>I turn now to consider some of the benefits that I believe will flow to Australian industry as a result of accession to the Treaty. The procedure under the Treaty presents great advantages over the present procedures for the user of the patent system. Firstly, the PCT proposes an optional procedure for the international filing of patent applications. Secondly, it will simplify procedures for obtaining a patent for the same invention in several countries. Thirdly, it will facilitate and accelerate access to technological information disclosed by patents. </para>
          <para>Austraiian industry applicants will find it easier to obtain protection for inventions in foreign countries. The PCT procedure allows the applicant to file one application in one language in his own country, even at the last moment in the priority year, obtaining at the same time a filing effect in all the foreign countries which are party to the Treaty. In this situation the applicant gains two important benefits. First of all, he gains more time for the making of his initial applications for protection in other countries. Under the Paris convention, international applications must be made in other countries within 12 months of application in the home country. Under the PCT there will be a further eight months within which these applications can be made internationally. Secondly, because of the greater time that will be allowed and the international search that will ensue as a result of the filing of an application, the applicant will have more time to consider whether he ought to undertake the expense of seeking wider protection internationally and whether he should go to the trouble of all the documentation that will therefore be necessary. Indeed, an international preliminary report, if requested, will put the applicant in an even better position to judge the validity of his application and the usefulness of incurring the expense of a national or regional procedure before the offices concerned. </para>
          <para>Austraiian industry, as a competitor, will profit from the PCT procedure, particularly in view of the early publication of international applications. Whereas it is now rather difficult to get a complete picture of all the patent documents published in many countries and languages, and of the most recent state of the art they disclose, Australian industry in future will have earlier access to those inventions for which applications are filed under the Treaty. Those applications will be published by the international bureau 18 months from the priority date and with them will be an international search report. This publication, in one of five world languages, including English, will provide knowledge about important inventions at quite an early date. The international search report published together with the application will make it easier to evaluate the chances of one&#39;s competitor to obain a valid patent. </para>
          <para>Those engaged in Australian industry, as exporters, should derive benefits from the PCT. Australia is a major trading nation. Our industry is based on advanced technology and we therefore have a special interest in ensuring that the international patent system operates efficiently and economically so that it may act as a stimulus to the further growth of international trade. </para>
          <para>If we want to encourage the export of goods and technology and to promote greater innovation within industry, there is a need for an international patent protection system capable of providing a stimulus to the development and flow of trade and technology. The Patent Cooperation Treaty will assist here by improving the international legal recognition and enforcement of patents, by simplifying lodgment procedures for applicants seeking multi-country protection, by reducing the current high level of legal costs involved in securing adequate protection in a number of countries and by facilitating a free flowing exchange of information on technology, which is the subject of patent applications. Strong patent protection is, of course, important to the exporters of manufactured goods, because one of the reasons sales are obtained is that products and productive processes are more technologically advanced than those of competitors. If an exporter believes that his patent might be copied by an unscrupulous importer, there is a real reluctance to export at all, with obvious implications for international trade. </para>
          <para>I turn now to look at Australia&#39;s role as an international searching authority. It is in this area that Australia can be of assistance to undeveloped nations, particularly those in the SouthEast Asian region. Australia&#39;s role as a searching office would enhance our commercial and trading interests and improve our overall image in the South-East Asian region if, firstly, through the Austraiian Patent Office, we were to provide patent services at cost or thereabouts for the developing countries of Asia. This is something that most of those countries are not capable of providing at present because of their lack or scarcity of technical expertise and the drain on financial resources. Such a step would also demonstrate Australia&#39;s sincerity in facilitating their economic and industrial development. This course of action is one that I would commend to the Government. </para>
          <para>Secondly, Australia could help the South-East Asian region if we explored the possibility of regional co-operation in industrial property matters. This sort of move should foster closer trade ties between Australian industries and those of Asia. A uniform- system for protecting patents would ensure that countries in the regions recognise and do not infringe upon the patents held by Australians, with obvious advantages for Australian exporters. Furthermore, Australian investors and licences would have the benefit of operating within a patents system they fully understand. In this way, trade in goods, as well as transfer of capital and technology with their consequential linkages with trade in goods, would be further developed. The overall effect could be to focus Asian attention on Australia as a technology information centre for the whole region. This would undoubtedly enhance the role of Australia&#39;s patent profession and possibly the industrial research industry in Australia. It should also facilitate the flow of technology within the region, thereby giving Australian industry greater opportunity to participate in the development of these countries. </para>
          <para>This Bill should be seen as but one step in a continuing program over the last couple of years to improve the Australian patent system. During the life of this Parliament we have seen what was substantially the amendment to section 54a of the Patents Act. That was the amendment which, in effect, brought forward the publication date of patents. We have seen the introduction of the petty patents system. We now have this Bill to give accession to the PCT. The Minister has foreshadowed in his second reading speech- the honourable member for Adelaide has already referred to this- a review of the Australian patent system to be undertaken by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee. This could well be a major, wide-ranging, most significant and important review. </para>
          <para>So we come to the PCT, marking the beginning of the end of the age of complete isolationism in industrial property legislation and procedures. It has already triggered off a whole series of other proposals, some of which have led to other international arrangements and some of which are still under discussion. It has provided the impetus to revive the European patent system, which became an effective patent system, on the same day as the PCT. It represents the beginning of a truly international system which is already being further explored. </para>

            <para>- I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dean)</inline> for having done his homework thoroughly, as he always does on these matters. He is one of the few members of the House who takes a deep interest in the patent reforms which have gone on in the past year or so. I am indebted to him for the remarks he made. Likewise, I would like to compliment the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> who again has been constructive, as he always is in these debates. The Government has endeavoured to make this as bipartisan a subject as it can because it ought to be. It is technical but it has enormous ramifications for the benefit of our industries. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Adelaide raised two points. I would like to assure him that each of the points which he has raised will be examined in the course of the inquiry into the patent system which I mentioned in my second reading speech and which I will formally announce, together with the terms of reference, next Thursday. I have discussed the terms of reference with the Industrial Property Advisory Committee and the reason for announcing them next Thursday is that there will be in Canberra a conference attended by the heads of patent offices from all Pacific nations and member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. If the honourable member for Adelaide has not been invited because he was overseas, I will make sure that is rectified. I am sure he would find it a worthwhile conference to attend, at least during the parts of that day when Parliament is not sitting. </para>
          <para>I assure him that in the light of his contribution today I will look again at the terms of reference and if I do not believe they cover the areas about which he has genuine misgivings then I will make sure that they are rectified. My recollection of them is that they are broad enough to encompass those parts of his amendment which are based on valid concerns. I say that because I believe some of the honourable member&#39;s comments were based on a misunderstanding of some of the concepts underlying the patent system, at least as it is currently administered. There is no denying the fact that in the past there were occasions when patents were taken out and sat upon, and inventions were not fully exploited. I think the honourable member for Adelaide was referring to those. However, there are mandatory provisions in our system and in those of most industrialised countries now which oblige people to exploit the patent. Indeed, the essence of the Australian patent system is that inventions must be exploited in Australia regardless of their origin. That is the error which the honourable member has made; he misunderstood a point made in my second reading speech. </para>
          <para>For the purpose of our patent system, the origin of the invention is irrelevant; what is relevant is that it is exploited in Australia for the benefit of Australia. We cannot invent everything and we cannot re-invent everything. We have to apply as quickly as we can to Australian industry the kind of technology which is available overseas, hence the reference by the honourable member for Herbert to the other amendments that the Government has made to the Patents Act in the last couple of years. In other words, we have to exploit it in Australia. The reference to developing countries is another point that I should correct because, notwithstanding the views that have been expressed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, most developing countries have joined or are joining the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. That is the principal international treaty on patents. The Paris Convention is to be examined for revision at a diplomatic conference in Geneva in 1980. The principal proposals which will then be considered are those which are being submitted by developing countries. </para>
          <para>In conclusion there are 350,000 new inventions in the world which are patentable each year. I think I am correct in saying that only Japan has a larger number of local inventions than foreign seeking registration under the patent system. Inevitably, foreign inventions will out-number local inventions in most countries and we have to make use of those as well as developing our own industrial research and development capabilities. I have said a lot elsewhere about this subject but in the interests of time I will confine my comments and leave that matter for the present. </para>

            <para>-The original Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in 1 974 for a three-year period by the then Minister for Social Security, the present Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden.</inline> The Act provides for capital grants to be made to eligible organisations which are defined as non-profit organisations, local governing bodies and charitable or benevolent trusts towards the full cost of purchasing, constructing or renting buildings, including the purchase of furniture and equipment. It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social welfare worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre. Approved organisations may also be paid a daily subsidy at prescribed rates for each homeless person to whom both food and accommodation are provided at a daily rate of 75c and a subsidy of 25c for each meal supplied to nonresident homeless persons. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The introduction of the original legislation in 1974 followed the 1973 report of the working party on homeless men and women. The report&#39;s recommendations highlighted the need to concentrate assistance on upgrading existing facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and women. It also suggested that the program be reviewed after its initial three years. The amending legislation deletes the reference to a prescribed period. In total 113 centres are approved at present. These provide overnight accommodation for about 3,600 men and women. During 1978-79 a total of 947,000 persons was accommodated. Over one million meals were made available to non-residents. It is important to note that the program is not directed exclusively towards chronically homeless men. A number of centres cater exclusively for single homeless women. The Labor Party&#39;s attitude to the legislation is one of support but we feel that we should draw the Government&#39;s attention to the lack of increase in the subsidies. I move: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That all words after &#39;That&#39; be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of opinion that the payment of 75c per day for accommodation and 25c per meal paid to those who provide assistance to homeless persons should be increased to a more reasonable level taking into consideration cost increases since 1974&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">No new capital projects are approved in this legislation. As I said, all it does is extend the duration of support for the existing programs. In fact, the level of individual support remains at 75c for board and 25c for meals. These are exactly the same amounts as were provided when the legislation was introduced in 1974. The amendment which I have moved does no more than request the Government to do something about the level of these payments. A considerable problem is faced by people who are assisting homeless persons. The food and accommodation subsidies have remained the same since the scheme was introduced. No allowance has been made for improvement or expansion. </para>
          <para>I draw the attention of honourable members to the debate on this legislation in the Senate. It was pointed out that in every year since 1976 amounts have been allocated but not expended. In 1976 over $4m was allocated but only $ 1.6m was expended. In 1977 $5.5m was allocated but only $1.73m was expended. In 1978 $3.8m was allocated but only $2.08m was expended. For four years in a row during the occupancy of this Government only half the moneys appropriated to provide assistance with shelter for the homeless has been used, despite claims by existing organisations for more help with emergency assistance particularly but also with extensions to existing programs. Needs have risen each year but moneys voted by the Parliament have been unused and returned to revenue. </para>
          <para>I see no virtue in such a situation when the need and the opportunity to use such funds are obvious to anyone who is interested in the subject. We are not talking about expenditure which would cripple the nation. We are talking about relatively small amounts. There is no virtue in cutting expenditure in these socially important areas where people are in great need. In four years, of the $ 1 7m allocated only $ 1 Om has been spent. That is a reflection of either appalling estimating on the part of the Department or a lack of willingness actually to spend the money. When the legislation was introduced in 1974 the then Minister for Social Security, Bill Hayden, pointed out the contrast between the millions of dollars which are spent in this country enforcing laws such as those relating to vagrancy which harass the homeless persons who are assisted under this legislation, and the pittance spent in providing shelter, rest, nutrition, rehabilitation and counselling for the heterogeneous group of people whom we conveniently label homeless, although it is purely a label of convenience. </para>
          <para>In summing up, I point out that the Opposition has moved the amendment to draw to the attention of the Government and the community the utter inadequacy of the food and accommodation subsidies available under the program in 1979. The subsidies are the same as were available in 1974-75. In view of the costs and the increasing size of the problem it is quite ludicrous to find them at the same level today. This community can and must afford to increase them. I know that other Opposition speakers will deal with more specific problems relating to homeless persons. I think we are all aware that one of the major problems, which is probably a relatively new phenomenon, is the large number of young people who are homeless and unemployed and therefore unable to afford the accommodation which would otherwise be available. I think there is a real risk for these very young people. For one reason or another they are not living with their families and they have not got enough money to look after themselves properly. This applies to both girls and boys. I think there is a tendency for them to get involved in what we consider to be illegal behaviour whether it be the drug use which we were talking about this afternoon in another connection, prostitution, both male and female, or all kinds of other unpleasant things. Vandalism, which is fairly prominent in the community, in many cases is associated. I do not think it is a political issue in the strict sense of the word. I think we all basically agree, even from a financial point of view, that the cost to the community may well be less in the long run if we can help the most vunerable people in the community and prevent them becoming involved in a life of crime, drug addiction or whatever. It is very important that we use institutions such as those I mentioned earlier which are able to take advantage of the money provided by legislation and which in many instances provide cheap labour because they are charitable institutions or the people who run them have a strong motive to help others. We should take the fullest advantage of those institutions and support them to a greater extent on running costs and capital expenditure than we are doing at the present and than we have been doing for the last few years, especially since the problem has become so immense. </para>

            <para>- I support the Homeless Persons Assistance Amendment Bill because it secures the future of the homeless persons welfare program. Until now there has not been any guarantee that this program would be an on-going one, which has meant that neither the Government nor the organisations delivering this welfare have been able to undertake long term planning of programs designed to assist homeless men and women. Many church and charitable organisations have spent a good deal of time and energy in raising their own money and utilising their own resources to deliver programs under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act. Some valuable government assistance also has been provided through capital grants, food and accommodation subsidies, rental subsidies and subsidies for the salaries of social welfare workers, but until now the Act has required statutory extensions following periods of evaluation and review. By removing from the enabling legislation reference to a prescribed period the status of this Act and of those organisations and individuals operating under it has been enhanced and the Act can now be given the long term welfare priority which it rightly deserves. I say that because this is an area of real need. In previous speeches in this Parliament I have referred to the findings of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and to departmental surveys which have highlighted the tragic dimensions of this problem at both the individual and the community level. The Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> in introducing this Bill in another place, said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The allocation of funds for new capital projects will, of course, be decided at the appropriate time. Other subsidies under the Act, in relation to salaries, food and accommodation and meals, continue independently of this Bill. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Now that the statutory authority of this legislation has been firmly established by this Bill, the Government should try to restore an appropriate level of funding to eligible organisations under the Act if the intent of the original legislation is to be achieved. </para>
          <para>The extent of the problem of homelessness or of the skid row population is very difficult to quantify and no census has been taken to gauge its incidence in Australia. It is a geographically and socially mobile population. The Minister, in her second reading speech, said that at present there are 113 approved centres and these provide overnight accommodation for something like 3,600 men and women. Point-in-time estimates would place the number of homeless persons in Australia at many times that figure. Numerically these figures may not be substantial but the number of people who move into and out of homelessness throughout a given year may be many times this figure. I refer again to the Minister&#39;s second reading speech when she said that a total of 947,380 persons were accommodated in 1978 while 1,056,832 meals were made available to non-residents. Those figures highlight the problem of trying to put an exact figure on the incidence of homelessness. I do not know how much double counting is included in those figures and just how many individuals were looked after at homeless persons hostels but I suspect it is a growing problem. Qualitatively the social and health problems of many of these people place them in a position of hardship which is far more severe than that of many other categories of disadvantaged people in the community. </para>
          <para>This matter has been examined by the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into poverty in Australia and several departmental surveys have been carried out. Some of these findings show that the homeless people have experienced a disrupted and discontinuous process of care in the formative and vulnerable years of their childhood. A high proportion never attended school. There has been a history of family alcoholism and a strong relationship existed between parental alcoholism and drinking problems early in their lives. For many there has been a significant childhood experience in a corrective institution. As to social contact, there has been a high usage of church or welfare centres and a virtual absence of family ties. Surveys have shown that one in four people have been homeless for more than 10 years and for most the incidence of previous illnesses was far higher than that for the general population and that as a group homeless men appear to be prematurely aged. </para>
          <para>A number of other surveys have shown that the percentage of epilepsy and venereal disease among them was 10 times as high as that for the community at large and the incidence of tuberculosis was four times as high. The publication <inline font-style="italic">A Place of Dignity</inline> put out by the Department of Social Security in June of last year also found that there was a high rate of illness and disability among the homeless persons surveyed. This really is an area of significant need in Australian society, but in terms of the total federal Budget this program is not significant. I think that substantial improvements could be made to government funding in this area of need without having a significant effect on Budget aggregates. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt in my mind that there is an urgent need to increase the food and accommodation subsidies payable to eligible organisations under the Act. I hope that, within the context of the next Budget, the Government will give every consideration to that. These subsidies, which are paid at a daily rate of 75c for each homeless person to whom both food and accommodation are, provided and at 25c for each meal supplied to non-resident homeless persons, have not been increased since the inception of the Act in 1 974. Over the past six years of relatively high inflation the value of these subsidies therefore has been gradually but substantially eroded. </para>
          <para>I raised this matter during an Estimates committee examination of the estimates for the Department of Social Security in September of this year and it was stated quite specifically that the failure by all political parties and governments to adjust these subsidies has caused some financial difficulties for organisations operating under the Act. I keep in close contact with some of the organisations in Perth which look after homeless men and women and youths and their experience certainly shows that there is a need to update these subsidies. In one 35-bed hostel the food bill comes to $1,100 a month but the subsidies received amount to only $400 a month. This calculation does not include other expenses, such as building maintenance and the administrative costs which inevitably arise in any substantial organisation. </para>
          <para>In the particular institution to which I referred, providing the linen service for one man for one night costs 40c. With the meals, accommodation and overhead expenses it is little wonder that a subsidy rate of 75c per day for one man leaves many of these institutions in a difficult financial position. Yet it is the church and other charitable organisations which the Government, under this Act, is trying to encourage to stay in this field of welfare to help the homeless and destitute people in this country. Organisations such as the Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Jesus People- which is a uniquely Western Australian group who look after the homeless group in Western Australia and do an excellent job- must remain in this field of welfare because the people they are helping are those who are often referred to as &#39;skid row&#39; people. These people do not need financial assistance only; they need compassion, sympathy and, basically, a friendly hand. </para>
          <para>The publication <inline font-style="italic">A Place of Dignity</inline> summed it up well when assessing the kinds of organisations which should be eligible to receive grants. The publication affirmed: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That organisations currently in the field are the best friends and allies that homeless people could have, and that any defects are due mainly to lack of money and staff. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not believe that governments should provide all the finance required to care properly for this area of welfare. If this were done much of the essential spirit and dignity which comes from the church and charitable and other non-profit welfare organisations would disappear. But I do believe that the capital and recurrent funding of these organisations needs to be upgraded substantially if these organisations are to be able to stay in this field. If this does not occur, sheer financial necessity will force the entire program back into the hands of the Government. This would be against the best interests of homeless persons who would be cared for by an impersonal and bureaucratic structure, rather than by, say, the church organisations. It certainly would increase the overall cost of caring for these homeless people. </para>
          <para>The cost of upgrading the program, as it is presently structured, would not be great. In the evidence given to the Estimates committee of this House on the Department of Social Security I was told that the cost of providing food and accommodation subsidies in 1979-80 was $1,160,000. In other <inline font-style="italic">words, by</inline> spending an additional $1.1 6m we could double that level of assistance. If we do not do so, the agencies in the field will have to devote more of their valuable time to fund raising than to looking after these needy people. This may well result in some of these organisations being unable to continue their work. It might mean also that the organisations will have to charge the users of their services a much higher percentage of their present pension or benefit than is charged at present. This may mean that these men, women and youths will be discouraged from entering homeless persons&#39; hostels and will be forced back into the streets and on to the park benches. So an additional $1.1 6m would go a long way towards helping to solve these problems. That figure represents 0.01 per cent of the Budget outlays for 1979-80 which are classified as social security and welfare payments. Yet, on the other hand, this would represent a 100 per cent increase in the very important recurrent capitation subsidies which are paid to those organisations eligible under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act. Following this catch-up adjustment, indexation of these subsidies also would be a desirable and necessary policy initiative, as soon as the Government was able to do so. </para>
          <para>I would like to refer also to the salary subsidies, which amount to 50 per cent of the salary of a social welfare worker employed at a homeless persons&#39; assistance centre. According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> at present subsidies valued at $320,000 are being provided for 44 social welfare workers at 40 different homeless persons&#39; centres. Social welfare workers need formal qualifications in order to be eligible for this subsidy. They need experience in the field, and they have to furnish duty statements. That is quite reasonable. Organisations in the field have informed me that some liberalisation in this area would be beneficial. In considering the nature of the people seeking the refuge of these centres a total reliance on formal qualifications is considered by some to be too restrictive. The Minister should also look at this matter closely. </para>
          <para>If the purpose of these centres is to provide some scope for rehabilitation rather than just to mount a salvaging operation, additional suitably trained staff, quite apart from social welfare officers, may be required. Further, there is a need particularly in the larger centres, for supervisory and administrative staff. In Perth I refer to the Tandara Hospital, which is administered by the Salvation Army. Organisations which operate on a large scale like this certainly have a need for supervisory and administrative staff. Taking all these factors into account, I would suggest that more than one salary-subsidised person may be required at a number of these centres. I am advised by departmental officers that there is no maximum limit to the number of salarysubsidised staff which can be employed at any one centre, although in practice usually no more than one person per organisation is in receipt of a salary subsidy. I make this point because these centres are generally open for 24 hours a day. A lot of man hours are involved and much of their most urgent work is done during the late hours of the night. This requires the employment of many people. One 35-bed hostel in my electorate employs nine welfare workers. If the hostel is to offer a responsible 24-hour a day service, it is deemed necessary by the organisation to have salary-subsidised staff. This area warrants further attention when the Act eventually comes before the Government for review. </para>
          <para>By all standards the annual appropriation for capital and recurrent grants under this Act is not significant in terms of the overall Budget. Yet there seems to be a great reluctance to preserve the real value, particularly of the recurrent funding. I urge the Government to re-assess the financial aspects of this Act when it is being considered in the context of the next Budget. This problem is an almost inevitable consequence of the conflict which occurs in determining welfare priorities when universal payments assume a significance, both political and budgetary, which precludes a flexible approach in appropriating funds to emerging areas of need. The more we rely upon universal payments in the social welfare field, the more that prevents a total concentration of scarce resources in areas of need. It does not permit flexibility in responding to emerging areas of need. It certainly precludes the possibility of offering general tax cuts which, in the long term, would be of great benefit to the whole community and more particularly to the unemployed. </para>
          <para>I know that the Government is seeking to stress the criterion of need as the basis of disbursing welfare funds. I acknowledge also that Australia has a better record than most countries in concentrating on anti-poverty measures. I would like to quote from an article which was recently published by Professor Henderson in a publication <inline font-style="italic">Public Expenditures and Social Policy in Australia.</inline> It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Several countries which spend 8 to 9 per cent of gross domestic product on income maintenance only directly spend 2 to 3 per cent on the relief of poverty, because so much income maintenance consists of pensions, or benefits related to past earnings or contributions to a pension fund, not to needs. In Canada, Norway, Sweden, UK and USA only 30-40 per cent of the income transfers go to the poorest 20 per cent of the population. In Australia, on the other hand, a very large proportion of income transfers do go to the poorest . . . Unless the means test is abolished for all old age pensioners, or the system replaced by a national superannuation scheme, it seems probable that the Australian income transfers will continue to be directed to the poor to a much greater extent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Notwithstanding this desirable method of administering a welfare policy, I think that we have a long way to go and the homeless persons assistance program highlights that fact. I find it strange that in a country of 14 million people, strongly endowed with the world&#39;s most valuable resources, enjoying one of the highest standards of living in the world and spending $14.7 billion annually on health, welfare and education, areas of real need involving minuscule appropriations remain relatively ignored. I do not think that it is the fault of the economy. Any economy that is able to produce $14&#39;A billion worth of transfer payments is healthy and strong. It is rather a question of priorities between universality and selectivity in welfare payments, which I have debated time and again in this chamber. </para>
          <para>Perhaps there is a tendency for policy makers in democratic systems to listen to the highly organised and highly articulate welfare groups, which leads mainly to income transfers being made from middle income earners to other middle income earners. Homeless persons are certainly neither organised nor articulate and others have to speak on their behalf. Whatever the reason, I strongly suggest to the Minister for Social Security, who has constantly advocated a needs approach to welfare, that she give a top priority to re-examining the present funding levels under this Act which services a very needy section of the community. I support the Bill. It certainly elevates the status of the Act and gives continuity to the program. It will assist long term planning by all organisations and individuals involved in this program. </para>

            <para>- I would be the last one to disparage the enduring interest that the honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLean)</inline> exhibits on matters of this kind. I have been involved with him in efforts in this area. But from what I have heard tonight, the honourable member would be a good candidate, if we were looking for one from the Government, to support the Opposition in the amendment that has been moved. It is not an overreaction, it is a sensible amendment to move and it is very much in compliance with the terms of his own speech. There has been no increase in any of the provisions under this legislation since it was first introduced in 1974. It is reasonable to assert that there should be an updating of those provisions. Regrettably, the Homeless Persons Assistance Amendment Bill does not do anything like that. It does nothing more than remove the time limits on the major grants under this Homeless Persons Assistance Act 1974. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A range of grants has been spelt out already. There is an urgent and increasing need for additional assistance for the expanding army of homeless people of Australia. Once we used to think of them as old swaggies and derelict old men, but now the army has taken on a different type of characteristic. It now involves a large number of young people. Sometimes they are young people who have fallen out of favour or an effective relationship with their affluent families. Sometimes they are just young people who cannot get started in the modern, technological world. If there has not been sympathy for homeless people before, there could well be reason for people to generate such sympathy in the future. </para>
          <para>The principal Act, of course, is very laudable in all its objectives. It is one of the surviving initiatives of the Whitlam Government. It survived the unrelenting vendetta of the Fraser Government which has taken the form of a devolution program aimed at destroying the Australian Labor Party social reforms. Of course, this whole area of homeless people is taking on such dimensions that although it was contemplated to put those original initiatives into the incinerator with the introduction of the devolution program, the Government dare not do that now because it would be criticised on many fronts. It is interesting to look briefly at the history of this matter. Following a working party on homeless men and women set up by Bill Hayden in February 1973, which reported later in the year on the feasibility of a program to assist them, legislation was foreshadowed by the then Prime Minister in the 1974 election campaign and introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> in November 1974. Grants were made available to organisations for existing and new hostels, day attendance centres, detoxification clinics and work centres. They would cover rent, furnishings and equipment with subsidies for welfare staff members and a subsidised meal allowance. The then Minister for Social Security, the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> in his second reading speech said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The measures proposed within the Bill are based on a compassionate understanding of the needs and very real problems of homeless men and women and of their alienation, their loneliness and their despair . . .

              <para>-He was a Liberal member. This was before his defection from the Liberal Party. I suppose that was one of the reasons why he defected; he was out of step on matters of this kind. He said those words on 3 December 1974. I must try to cut back my remarks because a number of people would like to share the limited speaking time. The main provisions of the principal Act which the Labor Government initiated were to support organisations and agencies catering for homeless men and women. It has been mentioned by the two preceding speakers that this Bill is about a salary subsidy of 50 per cent of the salary of approved staff, an accommodation subsidy of 75c a person a day and a meal subsidy of 25c a meal in respect of a non-resident homeless person. It is probably sufficient to say that none of these subsidies has been altered or increased since the last Labor Budget in 1975. Obviously, the Government is remiss about that. Any fair person would contend that. I am sure that the honourable member for Perth was making points to that effect. That is why the Opposition has moved this amendment which is in simple terms. I will read it to the House. It is reasonable. It says in part: </para>

              <para>-The honourable member is out of his seat to start with. My colleague, the honourable member for Wills, has a great involvement in this matter. I do not think that anyone could quell his enthusiasm regardless of where he sat at any time. When the program was approved by the Labor Cabinet in 1974 it was expected to cost about $20. 15m, including $ 14.5m in capital expenditure over the three-year period. In 1975-76- the year of the Hayden Budget-$4.4m was allocated. But the Fraser Government has cut the allocation harshly and in the two financial years from 1975 to 1977 has spent only $3.8m altogether. The funding goes on from there. In 1977-78 the actual expenditure was $2.7m; in 1978-79 it was $2. 8m; and this year the Budget allocation has jumped to $5.6m. Even if the Government spends the Budget allocation it will have contributed only about two-thirds of the resources intended when the scheme was launched by the Labor Party. </para>

          <para>One of my complaints is that there has been vacillation and uncertainty about the program. This Bill is simply extending the period. The agencies and the organisations dependent on this legislation have been disadvantaged. They have been destabilised. I think that we have slowed momentum by failing to make the position clear at an earlier time. The Government has been carried away by budgetary constraints and so on, by this philosophy that it incessantly imbues and indoctrinates into the Australian community. It has no regard for priorities, even the most humane priorities. It has vacillated right up to this time about telling these agencies and organisations that are right in the frontline of the greatest devastation we can see in our own country. It is the closest thing to a Kampuchean situation that we are experiencing. It is the closest thing to a Timorese situation in Australia. The Government has vacillated right up until now and has slowed down the organisations, has caused them to lose their momentum. That, I think, is a great shame. It is a reflection on the Government. It is not a thing we want to score about politically. It is a damned shame that it has been allowed to happen. </para>
          <para>This Bill, as innocuous as it is, represents a green light that this scheme is going to go on in the future even though no money is involved in its passage. The message should have come through earlier because many of us have been inundated with expressions of concern by organisations in many States. I have correspondence here, to and from the Minister, on behalf of the organisations. I know that if they had been aware that the Government was going to carry on with this scheme they would have had their plans prepared for other buildings and all sorts of other things. An internal report within the Department of Social Security some time ago stated, in part: </para>

          <para class="block">That kind of information is available in great quantity and volume at present. The Government&#39;s great obsession is to protect the taxpayer, which is a fair enough proposition. But if it thinks it is going to win more votes by requiring people to exercise less conscience about their fellow man, if it wants them to be their brother&#39;s keepers to a diminishing degree in the future than has been the case in the past, it is operating in a fool&#39;s paradise if it thinks it can do this on the cheap to the advantage of the taxpayer. The Government has to tackle these fundamental problems and start looking at the whole man, not just his accommodation. While this program must continue, there should be less emphasis simply on beds and meals, important enough as they are. I suppose they are primary resources in the circumstances. But there ought to be greater emphasis on attention to health problems, and even on legal injustices, which often drive these people into this kind of circumstance, and civil liberties. Certainly there should be a new range of conditions laid down about the operation of homeless men&#39;s institutions and doss houses about which there have been scandals from time to time. Honourable members will remember the headlines about slave conditions in Queensland. Some people have exploited this unfortunate group of people. </para>
          <para>I did not mean to go on as long as I have on this matter. However, a restricted document compiled by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, Directorate for Social Affairs, Manpower and Education was referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> just a few days ago.

          <para class="block">The article goes on to indicate how much worse that is than is the case in other countries and how much worse it will become in the future. It indicates beyond doubt that we have to give a lot more attention to these matters. </para>
          <para>I have before me tonight an account of the activities of the Smith Family, the Salvation Army and the St Vincent De Paul Society in terms of all the meals they serve, how many people they accommodate and so on. I do not have time to do anything more than make a cursory mention of the work of one of those organisations. The St Vincent De Paul Society estimates the number of homeless people at between 8,000 and 10,000. According to the national report 1978-79, the increased demand on services provided can be estimated by the following for the 10-year period 1968 to 1978: Persons assisted, that is given food, cash or accommodation, have risen from 218,000, in round figures, in 1968 to 708,000 in 1978. This represents a 224 per cent increase. Assistance to families increased in round figures from 45,000 people assisted in 1968 to 259,000 people assisted in 1978. In money terms in 1968 $430,000 was provided. That amount increased to $ 1,500m in 1978. This was the amount spent on food vouchers, fares and assistance to homeless persons. </para>
          <para>If one looks at newspaper cuttings from the Parliamentary Library indicating the extent of devastation of homeless people, especially in respect of the emerging homeless group- the young people in every State in Australia- one can say only that this legislation, as timely as it is and as wanted as it has been, is inadequate in that it does not give sufficient priority to these people. It exhibits the indifference which this Government has displayed for far too long about a growing cancer in our community. There would be something wrong with all Australians if we allowed this very seriously deteriorating problem to go as unattended in the future as it has been in the lifetime of the Fraser Government. </para>

            <para>-No government should be afraid to face the truth of a situation and the facts of life. The FraserAnthony Government in particular has never sought to flee from the truth. There is a concensus in the Government, the Opposition and the population at large that much remains to be done in the area of helping the poor and the unfortunate in our society. I am delighted to know that there is a sense of agreement with the thrust and aims of this piece of legislation. True it is that some of the speakers in this debate have given positive examples of how improvements can be effected. But in the final analysis, the Government has a responsibility to ensure that the taxpayers&#39; money is spent to cover the whole length and breadth of human endeavour. I suppose the facts are alarming. There is no pleasure in finding that we have more people who are homeless and to realise that last year one million beds were used by the various charitable organisations to try to bring some peace and comfort to these people by providing them with shelter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of course, the cause for concern is that we have seen an alarming change, a shift in emphasis. Ten years ago the average age of homeless people was in the order of 41 years. Now it is 29 years. That is a reason for concern. Many people do like to blame a government for causing all these ills but I suspect that a detailed knowledge and faithful analysis of the position would indicate that governments cannot legislate for attitudes. Attitudes are moulded and chiselled into shape by the personality of the individual, by the quality of family life, by the existence of a conscience in all strata of society and also by the lead given by government. I suspect that in a debate like this, one does not have the latitude to analyse all of those different attitudes. However, I point out that the problem that we are facing today is not caused by government. It is caused by society. No government can change society by itself. I know that statistics can be confusing but the real fact of the matter is that it is young people who are now creating the greater problem. </para>

              <para>- It was an interjection by the honourable member for Hughes that has given me an opportunity in a debate like this to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the workers of Australia are exporting jobs out of this country. The honourable member for Hughes came in with an interjection and I had to answer it in charity to my mind. In Brisbane this year the Government has allocated the sum of $4m for the purposes of providing residential accommodation for the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Salvation Army. Last Monday in the St Vincent de Paul shelter in Brisbane 182 people sought accommodation. At breakfast time that number increased by 92. Six hundred people came in for lunch. It is true, as the honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLean)</inline> and the honourable member for Hughes have said, that the amount of subsidy is inadequate to provide the essentials of even one decent meal a day. I would hope that the Government in its budget decisions next year will be able to see its way clear to increase the amount of subsidy that will be made available in this most worthwhile area. I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Hughes in that respect. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I make a request to the Government to consider three very important matters. It should consider not only the need for shelter and accommodation and the provision of food, but also it should consider the absolute necessity to increase the number of social workers. How disappointing it is to find that in January this year eight suicides were committed in Brisbane by people jumping off the Story Bridge. The eldest person was 31 and the youngest 18 years of age. These people need counselling. They need something to invigorate their spirit as well as to sustain them in the everyday mortal requirements. The second point I make is that people who use these homes in many instances come from interstate areas. Even in this day of the computer it takes up to three weeks to process these people&#39;s cheques. Surely it is not unreasonable to expect that some small portion of the staff who work in the social security area could be allocated to look after interstate transfers so that these people can get their cheques quickly and do not have to wait for three weeks. </para>
          <para>The third point is that a huge percentage of these people are what we term runaways. Something has to be done to make a better home life for these people so that they will not want to opt out and run away from home. I am talking about people of 14 or 16 years of age. They have no shelter at home because their homes were not places of peace and quietness. That is a very essential area for counselling and the provision of social workers. I have been allowed only five minutes in which to associate the National Country Party with this piece of most necessary social welfare. Finally I wish to indicate that we applaud the initiative of the Government in positively displaying that there will be a continuation of this scheme. It will not be cut out. </para>
          <para>I remind the people of Australia that notwithstanding the need to spend much more money in this area there are parallel schemes in existence: $3m has been made available on a dollartodollar basis with the States for the provision of youth support schemes; various family support service schemes, the community health programs and the welfare housing programs are operating. The need for this support is indicative of the fact that there is a problem. I suspect deep down that none of these problems will be solved unless we adopt an attitude of answering positively the question: Am I my brother&#39;s keeper? If not, I suspect that we are really sowing the seeds of our own destruction. </para>

            <para>- I support the amendment moved by the Opposition in relation to this legislation, the Homeless Persons Assistance Amendment Bill, which refers particularly to the levels of subsidy of 75 cents a day for accommodation and 25 cents a meal for those institutions that provide accommodation or meals for homeless people. I think all of the previous speakers have referred to the inadequacy of this subsidy. There ought to be considerable support on the Government side when that amendment is voted upon. If the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> does not accept the amendment we would expect to see a number of people crossing the floor. The legislation was one of the initiatives of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden ) when he was Minister for Social Security. He set up the working party which did the initial investigation, resulting in the draft legislation and its enactment for a three-year period. Originally, as suggested earlier, it was intended that the total expenditure on the program would be of a rather larger order.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the disturbing features in terms of the trend in financing has been the difference between the allocation and the amount spent in each of the years. I recognise that to some extent that is related to the fact that the capital side of the program has not proceeded as quickly as anyone would have hoped. Nevertheless, no new projects have been approved, as I understand it, since 1977. All of the applications that have been considered were submitted prior to that time. So there have been considerable delays and there has been very little initiative on the part of the Government to seek additional projects apart from those that were approved, two of which will come into the building stage, as I understand it, this financial year. </para>
          <para>The plight of homeless people is a very important subject. It is important that some time be set aside by the House for debate on this subject, although unfortunately this debate has been foreshortened to some extent. I wish to reply to some of the matters that, for example, the honourable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McVeigh),</inline> suggested, which seem to me to echo something of what has been the conventional wisdom in terms of homeless people. I refer firstly to the suggestion that these people are somehow the product of family conditions, personal attitudes and perhaps their immediate social environment, rather than their being in any sense the victims of larger social forces. That tendency has been present. I guess that is the reason why most of the services that have been provided to homeless people in Australia in the past have been provided by charitable organisations. No group in the community has been more subject to charity, had its spirits aroused so often by the singing of hymns at breakfast timevery often in return for breakfast- or been so embedded within perhaps the more extreme and even right-wing sections of religion than this particular group, namely, homeless people. I think that is unfortunate. </para>
          <para>It is also unfortunate that in this legislation the major subsidies continue to go to the traditional providers of services to homeless people and that the notion of co-operatives which is embedded in the legislation and the possibility of funds being provided for local government to establish services has not been developed. The tendency throughout the life of this legislation has been for the traditional pattern of providing services for homeless people, particularly for social derelicts, to be provided by the religious and charitable organisations that historically have been in the </para>
          <para>Held.  If there has been a benefit from the program it has been that at least there have been some additional resources, although, as other speakers have suggested, certainly not adequate resources, and that to some extent the services have been upgraded. </para>
          <para>The new accommodation we built in Brisbane at least will be new accommodation. Presumably it will provide for more single room accommodation rather than the dormitory accommodation that traditionally has been provided for homeless people. A proper diet may even be provided. Anyone who knows anything about this area would know that homeless people as a group very rarely have access to an adequate diet. A lot of their health problems flow from that situation. That is another reason why the meal subsidies and the board subsidies ought to be upgraded. It ought to be seen that the people who are receiving subsidies for the provision of these meals are in fact providing a more adequate diet for homeless people. </para>
          <para>To get closer to the nub of the matter, I think that the tendency has been to interpret homelessness very much in terms of what I might describe as a Durkheimian model or a notion of people who suffer primarily from social isolation. The prime characteristic of these people is that they do not form enduring relationships; that they are not part of the larger social structures and value systems which are dominant in our society; that they are, in a sense, people who have been cut off and are adrift from society. Often that is seen very much in the terms of the honourable member for Darling Downs, who saw it very much as their responsibility, that they or their families have been living in such a way that they have cut themselves off and therefore society itself is not responsible. I think that belief flows from two misunderstandings. I shall refer to them very quickly. </para>
          <para>It is historically true that homeless people have lived by necessity within the inner areas of large cities. Living in those areas, they very often have lived in a situation which is extremely unstable. I refer to one aspect of that, namely, the housing situation. We all know that the inner areas of large cities go through constant processes of change. Those processes of change are not simply the result of a number of individual decisions. In part, they flow from the forces of the capitalist system as it operates the private property market. As homeless people are people who are able to pay only the lowest price for rent, invariably they tend to be provided by the community under a free market system with the very poorest of accommodation. This is true irrespective of whether they are living privately or within institutional accommodation. That accommodation had traditionally, historically, been the poorest accommodation that is provided for people within the urban areas. </para>
          <para>I believe that the problem of homelessness has been exacerbated by the kind of major changes which have occurred more recently in the inner areas of Australian cities. In the past few years we have seen major programs of urban renewal and the tendency for office areas within a city to expand into neighbouring suburbs and for properties that have been used for perhaps 30 or 40 years as rooming houses to be taken over for commercial purposes or sometimes turned into large family homes. The net result of that process of gentrification- the process of change in use and change in values that has occurred in property markets, whether at Redfern, Fitzroy or the inner suburbs of other cities- has inevitably resulted in the expulsion of many homeless people from what may have been fairly primitive accommodation but which was, on the whole, relatively low rent accommodation. The dispersal of homeless people has resulted in a situation arising in which the traditional services are located greater distances from them. I believe that the trend in terms of the property market, with its insensitivity not only to homeless people but also to many other groups of people who live in the inner city areas, is one of the trends that people who are analysing homelessness ought to be looking at. </para>
          <para>The other factor which I think is important is related to employment. Traditionally, the homeless person not only lives in marginal housingvery often the poorest housing- but also is a marginal worker. It is not true to say, as many people do about homeless people, that they are people who either do not work or rarely work. Most of the people I have known in the homeless group, in the social derelict group, have been in fact in a working situation, for most of their lives, but it is also a working situation which is quite marginal. By that, I mean the casual workers who move from city to country to follow the seasonal work in rural areas or casual workers in the sense that they do any kind of work that is available, for example, in the railway goods yards where there is loading to be done from time to time or in major transport interchanges for bulk transport where again there has always been a demand for casual labour. </para>
          <para>The homeless person who is part of this group suffers because not only is he marginally housed but also he is marginally employed within industries where traditionally there has been a demand for casual labour but where people are taken on often for very short periods, where the pay is extremely poor and where they can be laid off on more or less a moment&#39;s notice. It has suited the community to have a group of people who form, in Marxist terms, a kind of reserve army of labour. They are the people who are available to be exploited at more or less a moment&#39;s notice and who form a group that to some extent maintains pressure on those who are employed because of their need to accept the lowest wages. They are the people who can be drafted from a situation of unemployment into employment. At a time of extremely high unemployment, it is quite clear that the homeless population has expanded and that the poverty of that homeless population has also expanded. </para>
          <para>In a sense, one could say that what the Government does in terms of this legislationwhether it provides an extra million or so dollars or whether it raises the allowances by a certain amount- is not the crux of the problem. The crux of the problem is related to the housing policies of this Government and the kind of housing that is provided. Firstly, I might point out, seeing the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom)</inline> is at the table, that historically public housing authorities have literally refused to provide accommodation for people in this group. We negotiated in Melbourne for the construction of a new building to replace the old Gordon House, which I might say is now highly gentrified and is one of the better restaurants in Melbourne for the accommodation of the soul. All the capital appreciation associated with that property has gone to the new owners. A new building was constructed in South Melbourne, which is certainly a major development for this group. When the directors of Hanover Welfare Services were negotiating in relation to Gordon House, the State Housing Commission refused to be part of that deal. It refused to use its money, which was provided mostly by the Commonwealth Government, to house this particular group. It did not see it as appropriate to house this group and it still does not. </para>
          <para>Despite the flexibility in terms of the new Commonwealth-states housing finance agreement, it is not sufficiently flexible for public housing authorities in this country to house the people who everyone would agree, are amongst the very poor. When we have this talk about the need to introduce market rents, paradoxically in order to get the people who are not so poor out of public housing accommodation, I am reminded of the fact that the people in this group- the homeless men and women of this country- as a matter of policy are not housed, as far as I know, by any of the State housing authorities. I think that is very unfortunate. Not a cent went into the Gordon House building in Melbourne which was conceived well before the introduction of this legislation, that came from the State housing authority. Admittedly, the State Treasury contributed substantially. I think that says something about public housing and its administration in this country. It is not a real solution for the problems of homeless people simply to reinforce the traditional 19th century pattern of charitable houses and accommodation for the undeserving poor. Insofar as this legislation has reinforced that charitable pattern, I think one ought to regret it. </para>
          <para>Secondly it is also important, if one wants to be serious about this group of people, for the Government to develop employment policies that guarantee the right to work, create employment and maintain high standard conditions for unskilled, seasonal and casual workers. I do not have time to develop that theme, but employment policies are extremely important in relation to this group. One ought not to think of these people as being somehow outside the work force. Most of the time they are in the work force and they are amongst the most exploited members of the work force when they are in it. Thirdly, and finally, it is unfortunate that even though the legislation has been amended to make it permanent legislation, there is not associated with it any rethinking of the whole approach that might be developed by the Government to homeless people. I take, for example, the definition of homeless people which I have been discussing. I think there are substantial groups within the population that might be brought within the purview of this legislation. I am not referring simply to homeless youth. There are other groups of people- for example, migratory, seasonal and casual workers- which need adequate housing, very often close to their employment. They might well be provided for in this legislation. </para>
          <para>There has been no emphasis in the administration of the legislation on the rights of homeless people. We know that there is no group which is more offended in terms of its rights within the population. That is reflected in the fact that at any one time homeless people represent a substantial proportion of the population in the nation&#39;s prisons. Very often they are there for having committed offences which are quite minimal and for which they have been undefended. For example I refer to acts of vagrancy. They have had their legal rights completely overridden. The rights of homeless people would seem to me to be an area on which much greater emphasis might have been placed by the Government. I refer not only to legal rights but also to rights to receive basic care. I know of a number of cases of people who, for want of urgent treatment in casualty sections of hospitals, have died, simply because others have made a judgment that they represent a class of people which has to be given second rate treatment, and which is not to be treated in the same way as ordinary people in the community. I think that in terms of the funding of voluntary agencies there needs to be a rethinking of that relationship. The Government might think in terms of some kind of deficit funding approach to the gap between the budget presented by an agency and its expected receipts. </para>
          <para>Very little research has been done on housing in Australia generally. Certainly, not very much work has been done in relation to this particular group. Some of the work that has been done, of course, includes the finest research of a sociological character that we have had done in this country. But there has not been much of it and certainly there is not a continuing program. It is good that the legislation has been made permanent. It is unfortunate that there has not been a strong indication from the Government of a decision to upgrade the subsidies that are provided. It is also unfortunate I believe, that the Government has not in terms of policy, sought to use State agencies. Perhaps the legislation could have been amended for that purpose, and also for the purpose of developing more activities on the part of local government in the homeless field. </para>

            <para>-The Crimes (Aircraft) Amendment Bill 1979 is a Bill of a short nature. It extends the present operation of the Crimes (Aircraft) Act by creating new crimes relating to aerodromes and air navigation facilities. Under State and Commonwealth law there already are provisions relating to offences such as those being created by this legislation but the Government quite properly feels it is appropriate to create specific Commonwealth offences. The Opposition supports the Bill. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The provisions in the legislation can be briefly summarised. Clause 3 contains an amendment to the title of the Act so as to extend its operation to aerodromes and facilities. Clause 4 provides for two new crimes, the first of which is the crime of deliberately endangering the safety of airports, air navigation facilities or people at airports. That is punishable by seven years&#39; imprisonment. There are then the crimes of threatening to destroy or damage airports, or kill or injure persons at airports, or make false statements that there is a threat to forcibly take over, destroy or damage airports or to kill or injure persons at airports. This clause, which will become section 20C, carries a penalty of two years&#39; imprisonment. </para>
          <para>Aerodrome&#39; is defined as an area of land or water that is owned by the Commonwealth and used, or intended to be used, for or in connection with the arrival, departure or other movements of aircraft. It includes any building, structure or installation. The term &#39;air navigation facilities&#39; means buildings or other structures or installations or equipment at any place in Australia that is provided by the Commonwealth for use in connection with the navigation of aircraft. It does not include any building or other structure or installation or equipment in the area of a Commonwealth aerodrome. A wide area is affected by the legislation. Of course, the crimes dealt with by the legislation are serious. It is obvious that everybody would agree that there should be the severest of deterrents by way of penalty whether a legitimate threat is made or whether it is a hoax when someone suggests that there will be danger to an aircraft, people or facilities. As much mischief, distress and turbulence can be created by a false threat as by a genuine threat. That point is encompassed in this legislation. </para>
          <para>Proposed new section 20c contains provisions which make it a crime to make a statement from which it could reasonably be inferred that a crime would be committed. The term &#39;reasonably be inferred &#39; involves a subjective judgment. It is not always justice to say that everybody would draw a reasonable inference. It is to be hoped that all inferences will be reasonably drawn. Finally, I refer to clause 5 which amends section 26 of the Act. This enables the provisions relating to searches to apply to the new Part IIIA which is to be inserted by this legislation. A search will be authorised where there is a suspicion that an offence has been, is being or may be committed in respect of Commonwealth aerodromes or facilities. This clause provides for searches of any person, luggage, freight or vehicle found within the limits or in the vicinity of an aerodrome or any area in the vicinity of the aerodrome or its facilities. I think that this provision is understandable in the circumstances. Everybody in Australia would see this type of legislation as being necessary. The Opposition supports it and wishes it a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition welcomes the concept in the Defence Amendment Bill and the associated measures. The position of servicemen in respect to the passing on of changes to their salaries and their actual salary structure has been unsatisfactory over a long period. The practice of requiring that regulations be drafted in order to change that salary structure is one which has become extraordinarily cumbersome. It has caused dissatisfaction and extreme delays in some areas of the Services with respect to the passing on of increases in salaries and changes of conditions of that nature to serving members of the armed forces. The other portion of the Bill, that which empowers the appointment of acting chiefs of staff to the Defence Force or an arm of the Defence Force, is a clarification of what would be a necessary appointment in the absence of the person who for the time being held that position. The Opposition welcomes the change and congratulates the Minister on having made a long overdue reform to the manner of fixing Service salaries. The Opposition, however, intends to move an amendment which expresses an opinion on the method by which that change should take place rather than the method which is being adopted in this legislation.

          <para class="block">The difference between the amendment and what is, in fact, in the Bill is that the tribunal which is to all intents and purposes structured similarly to other wage determining bodies, which operate within the various areas of the Public Service and government employees, and would formulate determinations which would have the force of law and would be disallowable only by a resolution of either House of Parliament. That is a situation which applies to all Public Service determinations and those which are fixed under other forms of tribunal which fix government salaries. It would in effect mean that if the Government decided not to adopt any of the decisions of the tribunal the Government would be required to seek disallowance in the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Under the terms of the legislation set out in the Bill disallowance can take place by the Minister withholding his signature. Therefore it is not necessary for any public act to take place in order to disallow, although provision is made for a determination made by the Minister to be disallowed by Parliament, which I think is a highly unlikely event. I think it is equally unlikely that the determinations of the tribunal will not be given force of law by the Minister of the day or the Government of the day. It would be very difficult for the Government to disallow services and conditions for members of the armed forces where they were adjudged to be entitled to those increases by a tribunal. The Opposition moves this amendment because it believes that the defence forces should be substantially on the same ground and have their pay fixing made in the same way as other government employees. They are as dependent on and are entitled to expect the same consideration in respect of wages, salaries and conditions as other persons. The tribunal as it operates at the moment has as its members a presidential member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, a commissioner of that body and one other person. It is an independent body capable of fixing or judging salaries and certainly well able to fix or judge salaries on the same basis as applies to other government employees and the community in general. </para>
          <para>The last paragraph of the Opposition&#39;s amendment indicates that the tribunal should operate in a similar manner to the Remuneration Tribunal. That, in effect acknowledges the fact that there are at this time no associations or organisations which in fact represent members of the armed forces. Therefore, the making of submissions and the giving of evidence to the tribunal by individuals, as is the case with the Remuneration Tribunal which deals with the salaries of members of this Parliament, academics and senior public servants, would appear to be the only method by which members of the Services or persons with an interest in the salaries and structures of members of the Services could make representations to the tribunal, give evidence to the tribunal or seek to refute any submissions which may be made or any decisions which may have been made by the tribunal at other times. I reiterate- I do not intend to labour the point-that I believe that it should be that the tribunal is an independent body that fixes conditions by determination and that the Minister, who is the administrative head and in fact the head of the defence forces should not be seen to be the person who ultimately makes the decisions which in all other areas of the Public Service, except the Parliament if I may say so, are reserved for independent tribunals. The Minister should not be seen as having the power to disallow merely by withholding his signature. The power to disallow exists in the Parliament. A government can take that step at any time it wishes, although it is a most unusual step. To my knowledge it has been taken only once, and it was not taken by the present Government. The Opposition&#39;s amendment which I have outlined, expresses an opinion and a principle which I hope will ultimately be drafted into the legislation. It is certainly not the Opposition&#39;s intention at this time to delay what is a welcome reform. </para>

            <para>-This legislation may be regarded as purely a machinery measure but I think it goes a little further than that. My brief speech will be taken up with an expression of appreciation for the concern which the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> has shown. The presentation of these Bills to the House exposes the concern which he has for trying to remove not so much the disciplinary environment of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force but the many tedious and antiquated machinery matters. After all, when we are dealing with the Defence Act of 1 903, the Naval Defence Act of 1 9 10 and the Air Force Act of 1 923 we are probing pretty deeply into history. I think the most important of the measures which are now before the House is, as the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> has pointed out, that measure which removes the tedious necessity for the approving of financial benefits generally by regulation, which involves the promulgation, withdrawing and revising of regulations and so on. The Minister and the Department of Defence have seen fit to remove these very tedious procedures. There is little doubt that the defence force will greatly welcome these measures. The purpose of my contribution is merely to pay tribute to the Minister and the Department not only in respect of this legislation but also in regard to the way in which they have been examining the whole system of benefits for the participants in the defence force. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We hear a lot of talk about resignations and so on. It is interesting to note that the rate of resignation in the defence force is very much less than the rate of resignation in the Commonwealth Public Service. Recently I put to the Minister at an Estimates committee a question on how we were attracting people to train for the new generation warfare and he was able to tell me- I am sure that everybody who is interested and involved in defence matters would be delighted to know this- that the interest in participation in that terribly important section of our defence requirements is very high. These people are being trained in the new generation warfare and the <inline font-style="italic">weaponry</inline> that goes with it. I am sure that every honourable member fully supports this legislation. As I have said, the legislation is only a machinery measure but I did feel that something should be said in regard to the progress being made in doing away with tedious procedures. </para>

            <para>- I will take just a moment to thank my friends the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> and the honourable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> for what they have had to say and also to say to the honourable member for Corio that I resist the Opposition&#39;s amendment. I am sure the honourable member understands the reasons. Acceptance of the amendment would require a very radical change to be made to the existing structure. The committee which is presided over by  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Coldham would need to be set up on a statutory basis. It would require the reception of all of the characteristics of advocacy. In short, it would mean taking the Defence Force into the whole ambit of industrial legislation. I am not prepared this evening to offer any extensive views on that proposal other than to say that I would find it a thoroughly unacceptable one. Possibly at some time in the future my honourable friend and I may have an opportunity to consider all of the ramifications of such a concept. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. It provides some changes to the Act which will benefit a limited number of pensioners who, because of a lowered classification, have lost the right, under the existing Act, to seek reclassification to higher grades. Under the amendments which are proposed in this piece of legislation, in future those persons will have a right of appeal for reclassification from Class C to higher classes of pension. This change will make a difference to some pensioners, although it will not be an extensive change. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Bill provides also that persons who are in receipt of class C pensions who in the future are invalided out, may choose to take a lump sum payment by commutation of future pension benefits. However, the legislation does not permit those people who have already retired to accept that course of commutation for that portion which would be available to them if they were to make that choice. The reason for that is that the amounts which would be involved are extremely low and, therefore, would most likely be disadvantageous to the serviceman. I am not sure that that is a judgment that this Parliament should make; rather, the serviceman, if he chooses to take a very small lump sum for the remainder of the commutation period- provided he is fully aware of the consequences- should be entitled - to make an independent judgment. However, the Bill does not have that provision. It seeks to protect the serviceman from an error of judgment on his part. The Bill is basically beneficial to a limited number of servicemen. It removes a couple of anomalies from the Act and extends commutation to servicemen who currently are denied access to it. </para>
          <para>There is one other matter I wish to raise- I do not intend to detain the House for long- and that is the continued failure of the Government to give any indication of its consideration of what is known as the Bonnett report on the anomalies between pensions under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Fund and others under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. This report has been in the hands of the Government for a considerable time. I understand that it was given the status of an official reort by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> The concern being expressed by a considerable number of DFRB pensioners who have been retired for a long time at least indicates the need for a statement from the Government of its intention as to whether it will take any action as a result of that report. The expectations of those pensioners were created by the Government permitting the setting up of a committee and indicating that it was prepared to consider the recommendations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bonnett</inline> in that report. The committee was set up by the present Government and was approved of by the present Prime Minister. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bonnett</inline> still has not been recompensed for the expenses involved in preparing and presenting the report which the Government appointed him to undertake. The Government obviously has not accepted financial liability for this task. The anomalies to which I have referred are a matter of some concern to a number of fairly senior retired Service personnel, who are significantly worse off than people who retired shortly after them. The Government created an expectation and it should indicate to those retired pensioners whether their expectations are real or imaginary, and it should do so fairly soon. The report has been in the hands of the Government long enought for it to have an indication of any action that it intends to take. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </para>

          <para>-by leave- During the debate on the censure motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> in one respect I might have inadvertently misled the House when I was speaking of the circumstances under which the Hall inquiry was established by the Government a few months ago, and in particular the role played in the establishment of that inquiry by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife).</inline> In my speech I indicated that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs had not only recommended an inquiry but in fact also had recommended the form that the inquiry should take. On checking further I have established that this is not the case. The Minister recommended that there should be an investigation. The form the investigation should take was agreed to by Cabinet and the specific form was not adopted on the recommendation of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. But it is thoroughly correct to say that the Minister agreed fully with the decision of Cabinet that there be such an investigation and he enjoined his Department to cooperate fully in that investigation. He himself cooperated with it in every way. I just wanted to correct what may have been an inadvertent emphasis. </para>

            <para>-As it has been a little while since the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill was introduced to the House, I remind the House that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act to provide certain new exemptions from sales tax, which new exemptions were announced either in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> or in the energy policy statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 27 June. The Bill falls into a couple of categories. The first category covers the new exemptions announced in the Budget. Those exemptions relate to goods for use by blind or deaf persons. They relate also to antiques and to player-piano rolls. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As in the past, the Government&#39;s decision to exempt new aids for the blind and deaf is commendable and is thoroughly supported. The decision to abolish the 15 per cent <inline font-style="italic">sales tax on</inline> piano rolls is expected to save Australia&#39;s only piano roll manufacturer from extinction. Of course we have to support that as well. The Treasurer justified this measure by describing the particular company- there is only one company that falls into this category- as &#39;undertaking valuable work in preserving the works and playing styles of many great pianists&#39;. This measure is estimated to be a cost to revenue of around $15,000 per year. The Opposition opposes none of these measures. I gather from what the piano roll manufacturer concerned has said that she will not be increasing employment opportunities. So this industry will not join these only two growth industries under the Fraser Liberal-National Country Party Government in Australia. I list those only two growth industries as massage parlours and Chinese restaurants. We cannot add even piano roll manufacturers to that rather impressive list. </para>
          <para>The second category of sales tax exemptions is of much greater importance to the Opposition. </para>
          <para class="block">That category covers the exemptions relating to the Government&#39;s so-called energy policy. The remaining provisions in the Bill give effect to the sales tax area of that policy by exempting from sales tax goods used in the conversion of internal combustion engines to liquified petroleum gas or natural gas operation to non-oil burning domestic space heating appliances and to <inline font-style="italic">various</inline> solar energy appliances. At this point it is worth noting some of the differences between the measures announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 27 June and the Budget measures announced on 21 August. The Prime Minister announced the dropping of sales tax on kits used in vehicle conversion to liquified petroleum gas only. Yet this Bill extends this exemption, happily, also to compressed natural gas coversion kits and to conversion kits for all internal combustion engines. The Opposition welcomes these extensions but it does make us wonder just how well prepared and considered the Prime Minister&#39;s original policy announcement was. This is relevant because we said at the time that that energy statement was introduced in an enormous hurry. It would seem in many respects that that is so and that a lot of aspects of that so-called energy statement were hastily and ill prepared. </para>
          <para>There is another variation which the Opposition does not welcome between the Prime Minister&#39;s announcement of that date and this Bill. The variation has not been explained. Clearly, the Prime Minister announced the exemption from sales tax for solar appliances &#39;of all kinds&#39;. Yet the Minister Assisting the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> qualified this when introducing the Bill on behalf of the Treasurer, who is now at the Table by stating that the sales tax exemption would not apply to household air-conditioners. This excludes the advanced systems now available which use solar power for hot and cold airconditioning. We would like to ask the Government why this particular decision was taken. I hope that the appropriate Minister replying to this debate will give me an answer to that question. To make matters worse, it has been reported that when some manufacturers have sought clarification from the Taxation Office, they have found that the Prime Minister&#39;s original intention has been modified even further. </para>
          <para>It appears that they have been advised that where installations consisting of a number of separate components are not sold as a unit, sales tax exemption will not extend beyond the solar device which actually collects, absorbs or concentrates the solar rays. I am informed that the results of this very narrow interpretation will be that the simplest solar hot water systems are largely covered, but more complex systems which incorporate water heating, space heating and air-conditioning are discriminated against, although the energy savings they effect are likely to be far greater, particularly in industrial and commercial applications. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the reasons for the narrowing of the Prime Minister&#39;s intentions with respect to these other solar units? Can he confirm the Taxation Office&#39;s narrow interpretation of the definition of &#39;solar unit&#39;? What action does the Treasurer propose to take to ensure that the more complex and often more efficient units are not discriminated against, they being the units which are relevant in the industrial context? </para>
          <para>The other curious aspect of the Prime Minister&#39;s energy policy statement in June is the decision announced in the Budget to supplement the measures with two income tax concessions relating to the conversion of oil-fired industrial equipment to other non-oil energy sources. Why were these proposals not included in the much heralded energy policy statement of the Prime Minister? Are these additional proposals a reaction to a hindsight realisation that the energy policy package contained no measure which encouraged energy conservation in the industrial and commercial sectors? Is that the explanation? The Opposition notes with disappointment that the Government has not been able to present to this House legislation which gives effect to these additional measures. The Treasurer announced on 25 October: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>These proposals are all matters of substance and considerable complexity which require the most careful attention. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This does not disguise the haste with which these measures were put together before their public announcement. What this proposal really does is to indicate either the Government&#39;s cavalier attitude to this vital issue or its inability to design policies properly. Having said all this, I must repeat that the Opposition is not opposing the sales tax exemption measures contained in this Bill relating to energy conservation. They are all reasonable measures in themselves. The errors are ones of omission, not of commission. The most significant aspect of the Government&#39;s measures in respect of energy conservation is its failure to implement other vital energy conservation measures. </para>
          <para>I would like to devote a little attention to these errors of omission. Energy conservation means not only using less energy but also using energy more efficiently. Existing living standards can be preserved with a lower level of energy consumption. Since 1976 Australian oil policy has been dominated by questions relating to supply. Emphasis on supply means that society is likely to continue developing an economy and lifestyle dependent on an eroding, non-renewable resource base. This also means more pollution and a growing commitment of scarce capital to the energy industry. Despite the costs associated with increasing supply, the demand control option has been largely neglected. Although the decision to increase the price of crude oil is a measure which has been heralded as a conservation measure by this Fraser Government, overseas evidence indicates that for most petroleum products, price increases are ineffective in the intermediate term in achieving any significant reduction in petroleum demand. In Australia the concentration of private motor vehicle use in residential and recreational lifestyles and the difficulty of moving to alternative transport forms, means that the price elasticity of demand, particularly for gasolene, is likely to be very low. In other words, putting up the price will not necessarily reduce the demand, in the medium term anyway. If massive price increases are required before automobile demand is significantly affected, the question arises as to whether such price increases are worth the cost in the redistribution of wealth they cause. That redistribution is, of course, from the have-nots to the haves. In other words, the people who are being mostly hit by these cost measures, price increases, and petrol taxes are ordinary Australians on middle and lower incomes. Because over half of liquid fuel consumption in Australia is in the transportation sector- over 60 percent of this being for private motor vehicle consumptionconservation measures should be directed at this sector. Scope exists for conservation in the transport sector because energy costs have not previously been a significant factor in transport planning. The Australian Institution of Engineers believes that in time it is possible to save about 30 per cent of transport energy consumption without any serious inconvenience to transport users. </para>
          <para>I will list some of the possibilities for demand control: Firstly, mandatory fuel consumption standards on automobiles should be implemented. The United States of America has done this. Because of the restriction on time in this debate I will not go into as much detail as I originally intended. A second alternative is a selective tax on large cars, as proposed in the Carter energy plan and which exists already in Sweden. Thirdly, speed limits could be reduced, as has been done in the United States. We have a lot of evidence on that. Fourthly, emphasis should also be placed on energy conservation in traffic management, traffic planning and land use planning. Increased efficiency in energy use can also be brought about in the industrial sector of the economy. The industrial sector covering manufacturing and electricity generation accounts for approximately 60 per cent of Australia&#39;s energy consumption. The Australian Institution of Engineers believes that energy consumption in the manufacturing sector can be reduced by between 15 per cent and 25 per cent without loss of output, and that between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of oil presently used in industry can be replaced by coal and natural gas by 1990. So there is this alternative to the pricing policies of the Government, to the fuel taxes which the Government has imposed on the Australian people. If these savings are to be made, a national program for energy conservation in industry needs to be implemented now. More than just lip-service is needed. Among the bodies which have recommended such an active program is the Government&#39;s own National Energy Advisory Committee. It did this in its first report, dated September 1977. 1 repeat that time prevents me from reminding the House of the Committee&#39;s recommendations for immediate action, but they are on public record. </para>
          <para>I could go on and on with examples of hard advice to the Government from other committees, not just that one. It is sad that very little advice has been accepted and that the price mechanism solely is being relied upon, with enormous hardship to ordinary Australians. It is not satisfactory for the Government to come back and say that the measures it has announced, including some of these in the Bill, are sufficient. Clearly these measures are not sufficient. So, whilst not opposing this Bill, the Opposition takes this opportunity to call upon the Government once again to adopt a comprehensive package of conservation measures relating to the transportation, domestic and industrial sectors and not just use the price mechanism that is being used in this Bill. The price mechanism in some cases, of course, is excellent but where it puts up costs it is far from satisfactory. I repeat that the Opposition does not oppose this Bill. It reduces the sales tax on certain energy-using goods and that is excellent but we would like other measures supplementing those in this Bill. </para>

            <para>- I support the Government&#39;s sales tax proposals in this Bill which provides for exemptions in the areas that have been discussed by the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford).</inline> While I am pleased, naturally, to see his support for these measures, my concern relates to his apparent lack of comprehension of the significance of the Government&#39;s very, very impressive and wide-ranging policies relating to energy conservation. I find it extraordinary that, presumably as some part of a political stunt aimed at what will happen in 12 months time, he should have fallen into the trap of simply attacking the high price of petrol, something introduced by this Government as a conservation measure, in the terms that he used. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Adelaide pretended that there is an inelastic demand situation for petrol. That is not true. He has confused his time scales. There is no doubt that someone with a piece of equipment like a six cylinder or eight cylinder motor car will continue using that motor vehicle, because he has a capital investment in it, even though the price of petrol continues to rise. But the honourable member for Adelaide fails to understand that when the time for re-equipment comes, when the decision is made about the next motor car to buy, the energy conservation impact of higher petrol prices will have a serious effect. Honourable members can see, from looking at the size of engines in motor vehicles in Europe where the price of petrol has been so high for so long, that the point the honourable member for Adelaide has made can be demonstrated to be utter nonsense. </para>
          <para>High petrol prices lead to the use of more efficient motor vehicles and smaller engines. The facts demonstrate this incontrovertably. So it is extraordinary to hear a man with the capacity of the honourable member for Adelaide to see issues as clearly as he usually does to make this basic simple error. I can only assume it is made because this is going to be a vital part of the cheap set of policies, if I may say so, that are going to be introduced by the Labor Party in an attempt to convince people that they should vote Labor at the next election at the end of next year. If the honourable member for Adelaide is doing nothing else he is, at least, being consistent in maintaining what his masters in the Caucus have required him to do, even though it is so obviously nonsensical. </para>
          <para>I want to make one more point about the higher petrol price. There is no doubt that not only does the higher petrol price lead to conservation, even though a time lag may well be involved in the re-equipment; it is also resulting in a massive increase in the resources of oil available to Australia. This is happening not only as a result of new discoveries, but also because some existing fields which may not have been recoverable in economic terms are now economic propositions. It has also brought about the situation that shale, for example, is now on the borderline of being an economic resource for conversion into liquid fuel. The honourable member for Adelaide represents a city seat and probably does not see things with the same clarity as those of us who represent country seats. It seems extraordinary to me that the honourable member should consider that Australian motorists should have an unlimited right, at a false phoney price, to waste a resource which costs a fortune in the international market. Its international price will continue to rise and Australian production is limited to something like 70 per cent of our usage. The honourable member for Adelaide apparently wants us to have a false price for petrol in Australia in order to buy votes at the next election. I regret his decision to take that position. </para>
          <para>Returning to the specific matter of sales tax, I naturally welcome the Government&#39;s decisions. I understand that some further changes are to be made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> this evening. There is no doubt that the humanitarian approach that the Treasurer has shown in these sales tax exemptions is to be commended. Like the honourable member for Adelaide I must say that I am overjoyed to see the Australian piano roll industry given assistance, particularly after hearing the outstanding results that can emerge from stimulus to that industry. No doubt the honourable member for Adelaide has had the opportunity of listening to an Australian piano roll of the late Percy Grainger playing the Grieg piano concerto, backed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. It is not the late Sydney Symphony Orchestra; it is very much on time in that recording. It has been done by merging an orchestra with a piano roll. It is a remarkable achievement. I know that any member of the House who listened to it. would be grateful for having had the opportunity. I trust that the piano roll industry in Australia thrives to achieve other such outstanding results. </para>

              <para>- It is not even in my electorate. I now wish to proceed to the general question of sales tax. This is a matter of some significance. There is no doubt that the Government&#39;s sales tax policies and reductions in the incidence of sales tax have resulted in a significant fall in sales tax collections by this Government as compared with the previous Government. In fact the level of sales tax collections in Australia, as a result of the current Budget, will be down about 7&#39;/i per cent in real terms compared with sales tax collections in the Hayden Budget. We hear continual attacks on this Government for being a high tax government which, of course, is patently untrue. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">It seems to me to be unfortunate that the people who make those attacks do not have the decency to concede that as a result of the concessions that we are discussing tonight sales tax has fallen in Australia under this Government, particularly in industries such as the motor industry where there is a serious employment sensitivity. It seems to me that the Government&#39;s policies on sales tax are humanitarian and sound, although of course, there is a view to the contrary which suggests that there should be a great increase in indirect taxes. </para>
          <para>While examining the declining sales tax collections under the present Government- and of course, these are significant- I stress that under the previous Government this was not the case. Under the previous Government there was a considerable&#39; increase in real terms in sales tax collections. Despite the massive rise in income tax collections during the previous Government&#39;s regime, the situation existed where the proportion that sales tax made up of total tax collections was about 8.5 per cent. In the present Budget sales taxes make up only about 7 per cent of total tax revenue. This is interesting, particularly in view of the continual claim by the Opposition that this Government attacks the low income earner. Surely a government which has introduced continually lower sales tax collections is, in fact, not following the course that the Opposition alleges. Let us face it, the people with the highest propensity to consume are, of course, those with the lowest incomes. Therefore, sales tax collections which have been diminished surely would benefit proportionately those people with the highest propensity to consume. They are, of course, the lower income earners. I think it is vital that the people of Australia recognise that this Government is a low sales tax government and the record proves it. The record is in stark contrast to the high sales tax style of government of our predecessors. </para>
          <para>I just mention in passing also that it is unfortunate that those who attack us on the matter of taxation in general fail to recognise that last year, for example, real income tax collections by this Government actually fell by one per cent. We are the low income tax Government. Income tax collections fell by one per cent despite the fact that many thousands more people were at work. I stress, and I conclude on this point, that even though there has been a continual and untrue campaign against this Government as a high tax government, the facts clearly demonstrate that this is a low tax government. The amendments that are being introduced tonight and this Bill itself clearly demonstrate and clearly underline the facts of the matter. Once again reductions in  sales tax are occurring in various areas. I join in congratulating the Treasurer on the continuation of this policy and I commend it to the House. </para>

            <para>- I thank the Opposition for the general support it has given to this Bill. I also thank my colleague, the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume),</inline> who is secretary of the Government members taxation sub-committee, for his contribution. I take this opportunity of thanking that sub-committee for the continued, practical, intelligent and pragmatic support it has given to me in considering the complexities of tax legislation throughout this year. The honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> raised one specific matter to which I will reply concerning the extent to which the undertaking to exempt solar appliances has been given effect. I believe that it has been effected and I will try to explain why. The original announcement was to exempt from sales tax all solar appliances. This does not mean and was not meant to mean that everything that benefits, for example, from solar heating, would get the benefit of the exemption. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Adelaide mentioned air conditioners. The ones that he mentioned are air conditioning systems which use solar energy to pre-heat water which is in turn boosted by electricity, oil or gas heating to the desired temperature for piping to separate appliances such as a heat exchanger for winter, air conditioning or a chiller unit for summer cooling. The chiller unit contains a chemical which uses heat to provide a  refrigerative  effect similar to gas-powered refrigerators. Several separate appliances are linked as a system in the examples that I have given. </para>
          <para>Air conditioning systems are not as such exempt and it was never undertaken that a collection of appliances would be exempt merely because one of the appliances is a solar appliance. The intention always was that the solar appliance itself would get the benefit of the exemption. The Government once again thanks the Opposition for the support and the speedy passage that it affords this legislation. </para>

(1) Goods designed and manufactured expressly for use by persons suffering from sickness, disease or disablement (whether sickness, disease or disablement, generally, or a particular kind, or one or more particular kinds, of sickness, disease or disablement), being goods of a kind not ordinarily used by persons who are not suffering from sickness, disease or disablement </Para>

                <Para>For the purposes of this item, &#34;disablement&#34; includes blindness and deafness </Para>
                <Para>The principal purposes of the amendments are to extend the range of sales tax exemptions applicable to goods for use by the handicapped and to raise turnover levels for the exemptions applicable to craftsmen and other small manufacturers. The Bill being amended provides in clause 3 (d) for exemption for goods designed and manufactured expressly for use by blind persons or deaf persons where the goods are of a kind not ordinarily used by persons who are not blind or deaf. Since the Bill was introduced the Government has received representations from many concerned with the care of the handicapped urging that sales tax exemptions should be provided for aids used by persons suffering from other disabilities. The Government recognises that there are a great many people in the community who suffer from serious physical disabilities in one form or another. It has every sympathy for these people in their striving to cope with these handicaps in their daily living. I am sure that all honourable members will be glad to know that the Government has decided to propose that this Bill be amended to extend the exemption to be provided in proposed new item 123 for aids for the blind and deaf to aids for all classes of handicapped people. </Para>
                <Para>The exemption, as it will read when amended, is set out in paragraph (dg) in amendment No. (4). It will apply to goods designed and manufactured expressly for use by persons suffering from any type of sickness, disease or disablement provided that the goods are of a kind not ordinarily used by persons who are not suffering from sickness, disease or disablement. Exemption is proposed also for medical or surgical appliances of a kind used exclusively or principally by persons suffering from sickness, disease or physical impairment for the purpose of alleviating or treating the sickness, disease or impairment or its effects. This new exemption will complement existing item 42 which exempts a wide range of specified classes of medical and surgical goods. The proposed new exemption item 42b is set out in paragraph (ab) in amendment No. (3). This exemption will overlap to some extent the exemption I referred to earlier for goods for use by persons suffering from sickness, disease or disablement. However, that provision is restricted to goods that are of a kind not ordinarily used by persons who are not suffering from sickness, disease or disablement. Proposed new exemption item 42b will apply to goods in the nature of medical or surgical appliances where they are of a kind used principally by the sick or disabled even though they may have some use by persons who are not sick or disabled. </Para>
                <Para>A further exemption proposed in the amendments which have been circulated will apply to wigs and hair-pieces for persons who are clinically bald. Certain diseases, or the drugs used in their treatment, cause complete or partial loss of hair. This can have a severe psychological effect, especially on women and children. It can be countered by the wearing of wigs or hairpieces. As the exemption will be restricted to persons who are clinically bald as distinct from those with naturally occurring baldness it will be conditional on the certification by a legally qualified medical practitioner that the loss of hair by the person concerned was due to sickness or disease or the effects of its treatment. </Para>

          <para>- The physically handicapped will benefit from two further exemptions proposed in amendment (3). These will apply to battery chargers for use exclusively or principally in recharging the batteries of electric wheel chairs and invalid chairs and to motor vehicle hand controls and similar devices which enable disabled persons to drive motor vehicles. Other measures proposed in the amendments circulated will benefit craftsmen and other small manufacturers. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There are at present two exemptions based on annual turnover levels. One exempts goods made in the manufacturer&#39;s own home if the average annual turnover from his or her sales of all goods does not exceed $1,000. The other exempts sales by retail of products made otherwise than in the home by a person whose average annual turnover from sales of all goods does not exceed $ 1,400. These turnover levels have remained unchanged since 1941 and the Government has decided that they should be raised to a level more commensurate with present day prices. It is accordingly proposed by paragraphs (d), (da), (db) and (dc) of amendment (4) that these exemptions be replaced by a single exemption for goods produced by a person whose average annual turnover from sales of all goods does not exceed $12,000. The distinction between home and other small manufacturers will be abolished. </para>
        <para>The definition in the present provision of &#39;average annual value of sales of all goods&#39; which lays down the rules to be followed for the purpose of determining the average annual turnover will remain but it is proposed in paragraph (dd) of amendment (4) that a further definitional provision be included in the item. This provision will enable the annual turnover to be determined by reference to arms length prices where sales are made at depressed prices between parties not at arms length. </para>
        <para>Another provision, exemption item 103, which applies to those who are manufacturers in a small way, is based on annual tax liability. If the sales tax that would otherwise be payable by a manufacturer would not exceed $100 per annum, the products are exempt. The figure of $100 was set in 1957 and it is proposed that it be raised to $250. Under the proposed amendments, the exemptions related to goods for use by the sick and disabled are to be effective from 22 August 1979. This is the date already specified in the Bill as the date of operation of the proposed exemption for goods for the blind and deaf. The changes in the exemptions in favour of small manufacturers are to be effective from the date of royal assent. A memorandum explaining in more detail the amendments which I have now moved is being made available to honourable members. </para>

          <para>- I have some bad news and some good news for the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard).</inline> The bad news is that when amendments are being made by the Government at the last moment, I believe that the usual courtesies are for a copy of what is virtually a second reading speech to be delivered to the relevant Opposition spokesman in advance so that there is some warning of the matters that are to be debated. I could be at fault here because I am standing in at short notice for the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> and he may have received such advance notice, but I do not think so. I think he would have passed it on to me if he had received it. I raise this matter not in anger but in the hope that if it is not a normal courtesy now it will become a normal courtesy in future and that such an explanation of detailed amendments will be delivered to the office of the relevant spokesman. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The good news is that we too are enormously glad that these extensions are being made to the exemptions from sales tax. However, I do believe that the application to wigs has an element of self-interest in it as it applies to the Treasurer and the he should declare his interest in this matter. I wonder whether he is waiting for the report of the Bowen committee, which is looking at pecuniary interests of members of parliament, before he decides what form his declaration of self-interest should take. Nevertheless, I think something might be said about that at an appropriate occasion. The Opposition supports the amendments. We on this side of the chamber are glad that these extensions are being made. I know that the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>

          <para>- I seek clarification of some of the remarks made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard).</inline> During his outline of the additional items being exempted from sales tax he referred to goods which are used by the sick or persons with certain diseases and which are substantially or exclusively for the use of persons in that category. I raise the situation of the diabetics who are very large users of low sugar or non-sugar products. At one time those products were manufactured significantly for that restricted market. At this stage I think it is fair to say that they are goods which are used substantially by other sections of the community for dietary and other reasons, but this does not alter the medical requirement of persons who have a diabetic problem. I ask the Treasurer Where medical certification is involved, will the amendments cover persons in that area with regard to sugarfree or low sugar products? It would appear that, because other people use similar products for other purposes, the diabetic section of the community will be unfairly disadvantaged if those products are not included. </para>

          <para>- In answer to the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford),</inline> the Government announced some weeks ago the changes that are embodied in the amendments. The general outline of the amendments themselves was given to the Opposition this morning, but I accept the honourable gentleman&#39;s stricture that that is not quite good enough. I accept that it is a preferable practice for that information to be made available earlier. I answer the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> by saying that the example he used could well fall into a grey area. I do not think it is possible for me to say in advance all of those things which would be held or regarded as being required substantially for the use of sick or disabled persons. I appreciate that there can be cases like that in legislation of this character when descriptions of the type I have outlined are used. I give to him and to the chamber an assurance that the Government will monitor pretty closely the operation of this legislation. Whilst we clearly do not wish to open the legislation for use by people who do not fall within the category I have mentioned, quite obviously we would not be unsympathetic if the legislation appears to be working in a way which is against the policy behind the change. </para>

          <para>- It has come to my ears that Squizzy Williams of the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers Union is slandering me with statements that my charge that he presided over an unlawful manipulation of union funds was a libel and that he will take me to court if I repeat the truth outside the Parliament. I am concerned that I should be falsely charged with committing a libel, but when I examine Williams&#39; court record I remain unmoved by his threat to face me in open court. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Squizzy Williams is notorious for using stop writs to prevent people from telling the truth about him. Some years ago he issued a writ against Leo Lorimer of Perth for truthfully accusing him of masterminding unlawful alterations to AWU rules, but then withdrew his complaint and paid all of Lorimer &#39;s costs rather than face Lorimer &#39;s charges in open court. Before that, on 12 December 1965 to be precise, he served a writ on Trevor Alexander of Goondiwindi, claiming &#163;5,000 damages for the fact that Alexander had repeated a very serious criminal allegation made against Williams by John Mulkey and Roy Devin of Goondiwindi. But right on the doorstep of the court, so to speak, he dropped his claim for damages and paid his own costs in return for an unpublished statement which merely said that Alexander did not believe the criminal allegation made by Mulkey and Devin against Williams. He did this rather than face Alexander&#39;s witnesses in open court. Significantly, he has still taken no court action against Mulkey and Devin. I know the nature of those charges. I challenge Williams to disclose to his associates the charges made against him by Alexander and by Mulkey and Devin and to explain to his associates why he squibbed a court hearing of those charges. He might also expand on what was known in AWU circles as the quarry affair. </para>

            <para>-Tom Foley, who once served as Queensland Minister responsible for home affairs and had ministerial control of the Queensland Police, gave me certain information from police files. This information, together with certain documents, is kept in a locked vault to which I hold the keys. Also inside that vault are certain instructions which, among other things, direct that if I should predecease Williams those documents are to be handed to a named Labor member of Parliament with my full authority to use them as he thinks proper in the circumstances. This means that there is no such thing as the final solution in this matter. In conclusion, I want to say this: I shall continue to defend my good name against the lies of my defamers.

          <para>- Queensland industrial affairs have always had a unique attraction for the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron).</inline> I am not going to join him with respect to those matters. Brisbane airport has a unique attraction for me. I want to say a few words about it because of a quite mischievous and incorrect article which appears on pages 45 and 46 of this week&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> The honourable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peter Johnson)</inline> made the article available to me. It is replete with errors which should be corrected. It would be a tragedy were Australia&#39;s airline policy and airport development policy to be decided by an oligopolistic duopoly. It is quite clear that that is what Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia intend to do with respect to the development of Brisbane airport. Let me deal with one particular point which is made in the article. It states that clearly from evidence TAA and Ansett do not like the proposal for the development of Brisbane airport because the estimated increase in passenger through-put has been overstated by the Department of Transport. That is nonsense. The honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> would realise that it is nonsense because he heard the evidence last week. TAA and Ansett say that they are opposed to the development of the airport at this time, even though it is firm government policy, because they say that the through-put in the year 2000 is likely to be something over six million passengers instead of the nine million passengers that the Department of Transport estimates. The interesting point is that TAA and Ansett have never made 20-year forecasts before. If one were to look back to any occasion when they made a 20-year forecast- for example, from 1950s to the 1970s- one would find that they have consistently understated the increase to the extent of 60 per cent to 100 per cent. They both state that they always rely upon the Department of Transport estimates of what passenger throughput is likely to be. They grasped on this occasion because I believe that they do not want the development of Brisbane Airport for their own reasons. The reasons are quite clear. The airlines would prefer international passengers arriving in Australia to land at airports in Sydney and Melbourne and to be transported to the north by the two domestic carriers. They, of course, have a monopoly of the air travel facilities available to domestic travellers in Australia. That is a scandalous position. Australian citizens should realise that our airport development policy ought not to be in the hands of either TAA or Ansett. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Let me make one other point in the few minutes that are available to me. It is quite fascinating that over the last 18 years from 1960 to 1978 the rate of growth of through-put at Brisbane airport has been in excess of that which applied to either Melbourne or Sydney airports. Yet TAA and Ansett persist in their attitude. TAA and Ansett fell over themselves in promoting the development of Tullamarine airport, even though in the three years before they agreed to that development there had been actual negative growth at that airport. Their sense of justice is to differ in the kind of judgment they would make in respect of Brisbane airport compared with that which they made in respect of Tullamarine airport. At the hearings for the development of Tullamarine airport they were persuaded to contribute 10 paragraphs of induced comment. Yet in respect of Brisbane airport they went in hard and for their own reasons, which are full of bias and which relate to their having better traffic by transporting people from the south. They decided to oppose the airport development. I am very much emboldened and supported by the fact that we know it is firm government policy to develop Brisbane airport. I believe that TAA and Ansett realise that also. One other point ought to be made. It is quite clear that over the 20 years between the late 1950s and the late 1970s the growth of traffic at Brisbane has been in excess of the growth of traffic at all other capital city airports in Australia except Perth airport. Perth is the exception. Yet the airlines want to raise barriers to the development of Brisbane airport greater than those which they have raised in respect of the development of any other capital city airport in </para>
        <para>Australia. I suggest to. the House that that is a clear reason why two airlines which have a monopoly of the domestic air traffic in Australia must not be allowed to dominate what is a very important source of traffic growth and development that ought to apply around the capital cities of this country. </para>

          <para>-When the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> in his capacity as shadow Minister Tor Transport yesterday asked a question of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> about the possibility that the present  Chairman  of the board.of directors of Qantas Airways Ltd might not be reappointed, I was surprised to note the ambiguous nature of the Minister&#39;s reply. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt is one of Australia&#39;s outstanding public servants. He is a very great administrator and a great protector of the Australian aviation industry. The fact of the matter is that there have been disclosures to the effect that a back bench committee has commenced a conspiracy. I am saying that there is a contention that this committee has decided to develop a conspiracy designed to have <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt replaced as  Chairman  of Qantas. It is undoubtedly a fact that there are people in this Parliament and out of this Parliament who, as upholders of an open sky policy and of a private and free enterprise system, would be prepared to jettison Qantas and all the great benefits that accrue to Australians as a result of its successful operation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I believe that we ought to have regard to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt has been upholding a policy of attaining cheap air fares subject to sustaining the highest level of service, safety and employment in the Australian aviation industry. It is important to make sure that that policy continues. I hope that the Minister will repudiate these people who are pursuing this vendetta against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt. I hope that he will give an assurance that no change in the administration of Qantas will occur which will put any of the policies of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> Hewitt at risk, because if that happens there will be dire consequences for the air travelling public in this country. </para>
        <para>I remind the House of the outstanding service given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox.</inline> He has been  Chairman  of Qantas since 1975 and his term is due to expire next year. He is 63 years of age, and he wants to be reappointed. It is significant that the insidious attack started to emerge when he was leading Australia in its talks with the five Asian nations that were seeking access to the Sydney-London air route. There is no doubt that those Asian nations have some entitlement but it is most inappropriate that the position, status and standing of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lenox</inline> should be undermined at that time. This man has been a senior public servant since 1955. He has been  deputy  secretary of many departments. I cannot take the time to mention them all. To mention some salient positions, he was  chairman  of the Australian Universities Commission, Secretary to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, Secretary to the Department of the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, a member of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission,  Chairman  of the Snowy Mountains Council, and Secretary to the Department of Minerals and Energy. As I mentioned, his current position is one of very great achievement and distinction. </para>
        <para>Only this week we have heard of the operational profits of Qantas. I think all Australians are proud of this institution and are very concerned that there are Liberal members in this Parliament, apparently in a committee of a conspiratorial nature, seeking to undermine a man doing a great service. I hope that the Minister will come clean in the near future. I am attempting to flush out the opponents so that we can see the insidious nature of their objectives. They are upholding people from overseas who do not give a damn about what happens to Australians employed in Australia&#39;s own airways industry. </para>

          <para>- I have received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> Finnane expressing disappointment at a remark I made about him during a recent debate in this House. In part, his letter reads: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>I have known you for approximately fourteen years and until that debate have always held you in high regard. I admired your work in earlier years in bringing about changes to the system of Articles of clerkship and your contribution as President of the Sydney University Law Society. </para>
          <para>My regard for you formed during university days was not diminished by your membership of the Liberal Party and until that debate I had always felt myself to be on reasonably good terms with you. </para>
          <para>I took strong exception to your suggestion that I had carried out a &#39;Gestapo hatchet job &#39;. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline>continues that he does not like the reference to Hitler&#39;s secret police, and that he is disappointed in these statements. The first thing I want to say about this is that I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> and told him if an opportunity arose I would make a clarification in the Parliament. Secondly, I want to point out that I do not view any of these matters on a personal basis. These were matters of public interest; matters that had to be raised in this Parliament in accordance with the public interest. The statement that his regard for me was not diminished by my membership of the Liberal Party clearly implies political bias. What other meaning can there be other than that ordinarily a person who is a member of the Liberal Party is, in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> &#39;s eyes, to receive diminished regard? However, in this particular case, because of prior knowledge of me, he does not adopt that view. The point I make is that any person reading that paragraph will see it in the appropriate light. </para>
        <para>The other thing I must say is that I believe his claim is over-sensitive. I do not think any reasonable person would have understood that interjection in a time of debate to imply that he had carried out his work in the way that Hitler&#39;s secret police had done. I think it was fair to point out what had happened during the proceedings; it was fair to point out, as it had been pointed out in debate, that the proceedings were secret and that certain undertakings had been broken. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane,</inline> in other court proceedings that have now ended- this happened some months ago when there was an action between himself and certain newspapers- admitted that he had sought to drive a wedge between two parties, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Walsh</inline> and their solicitor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Torok;</inline> that he had tried to get them to leave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Torok;</inline> that he had gone to a place called Sunshine to interview them, knowing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Torok</inline> would not be present, and that he had tried to stop <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Torok</inline> from being present. There is also no doubt that he promised to furnish a copy of his report to the right honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> an hour before it was published, and that was not done. It is clear that that matter was discussed with the New South Wales Attorney-General. It is also of note that he has taken almost a month to complain about the statements that I made in the House. I would like to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane,</inline> whom I have known for some years and for whom, on a personal level, I have had regard, would rehabilitate himself by resigning from the Labor Party and show to the world at large that he adopts a new approach to matters. </para>
        <para>This matter should be taken one little step further. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marcus</inline> Einfeld wrote a very lengthy defence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> and attacked members of this House who debated the matter some weeks ago. That defence appeared in page 7 of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 6 November. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Einfeld</inline> makes very trenchant criticisms of politicians. He says that politicians should keep out of this matter and should not even have made any comments on it. All I want to say is that before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Einfeld</inline> attacks members of this House, let us have an open and public statement by him that he will never seek political office. It is open knowledge in New South Wales that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Einfeld</inline> is jockeying for a seat in the New South Wales Parliament and hopes to be the Attorney-General. Of course, he is carrying favour with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walker</inline> with his kindly article about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane.</inline> He says that no substantial criticisms of that report have been made. Let me give one very substantial criticism. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> sought the advice- this is known- of another barrister during those proceedings. According to all principles, he fettered his own discretion. </para>

The Public Service Board is unable to answer categorically but the answer to questions (4) and (5) indicates the infrequency of action under the relevant sections of the Public Service Act. The Board &#39;s views on the rights of public servants to comment on public issues are set out in Chapter 4 of the Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants. Chapter 5 which deals with political and industrial participation by public servants is also relevant. Much of this material is concerned with issues relating to conventions and propriety rather than to law. Copies of the Board&#39;s Guidelines nave been lodged with the Parliamentary Library. </para>

              <para>No. Following an increase over recent years in invalidity retirement rates, the Public Service Board conducted a study in 1978 which indicated that the increase is related to a number of factors, including the changing age structure of the Service, the number of ex-servicemen approaching retirement, changing community attitudes towards health and arrangements for age and invalidity retirement As part of a program to manage the incidence of invalidity retirements from the Service, the Board, in conjunction with the Department of Health, the Department of Finance and the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office, has now completed an examination of procedures for reviewing an officer&#39;s fitness for duty. As a result of that review, it is proposed to introduce some changes to current procedures to provide departments, examining Commonwealth medical officers and the Board with additional information to assist in determining an officer&#39;s fitness for duty and whether invalidity retirement or other action, such as redeployment, is appropriate. Consultations on the new procedures are being held with peak councils of staff organisations. Details of the new procedures are contained on page 50 of the Public Service Board&#39;s Annual Report for 1979, which was tabled on 12 September. </para>

            <para>-The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) Joint Australian/foreign fishing ventures which have been approved or which are being actively considered to operate in waters off South Australia involve either squid jigging or fish trawling. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Squid Jigging </para>
          <para>Safcol Holdings Ltd in conjunction with Chuo Gyogyo Kosha Ltd and C. Itoh and Co (Japan) have concluded the first year of an approved two year feasibility fishing project which involved 11 Japanese squid vessels operating in waters off South Australia and Victoria with port access to Port Adelaide, Port Lincoln, Melbourne and Portland. The operations of this project during the second and final year are now being reviewed in the light of results to date aud conditions to apply for the forthcoming squid season. </para>
          <para>A number of new additional proposals have been received involving feasibility fishing operations off South Australia. Three proposals based in either Fort Lincoln or Port Adelaide involve Australian interests operating in conjunction with Japanese and Korean companies with a total of 17 foreign vessels. These proposals are currently under consideration by the Commonwealth in conjunction with State fisheries authorities. </para>
        </answer>
        <para class="block">Fish Trawling </para>
        <para>Mauri Bros and Thomson (Aust) Pty Ltd in conjunction with Dalmor Deep Sea Fishery and Fishing Services Enterprise (Poland) have been approved to undertake Stage 1 of a feasibility fishing project which will involve mid water trawling in waters off South Australia when specifically approved by the SA and Commonwealth fisheries authorities. Two Polish trawlers of 88m in length will be used to investigate the extent, distribution and commercial potential of fish species which are not currently being exploited by Australian fishermen. In addition to operating off South Australia, the vessels may midwater trawl off the west coast of Tasmania on specific approval of the Tasmanian and Commonwealth Governments and may operate in waters off Macquarie Island and Heard and McDonald Islands. Port access has been granted to the ports of Hobart, Burnie, Melbourne, Geelong, Portland and Port Adelaide. Stage 2 of the project which involves an extension of the project&#39;s approved area of operation, is currently being considered at Commonwealth and State levels. </para>
        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(4)">
            <para>The operations of all foreign vessels approved to operate in Australia&#39;s 200 mile fishing zone are strictly controlled to ensure there is no conflict with local fishing operations and to ensure benefits accruing to Australia from these operations are maximised. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>With respect to feasibility fishing projects, approvals are conditional upon the companies concerned conforming to strict requirements with respect to areas and methods of operation, access to ports, disposal of catch and species to be taken. In addition, participating companies are required to provide detailed information on the project&#39;s operations in order that the extent, distribution and commercial potential of the fisheries and areas in which they are active can be assessed by Commonwealth and State fisheries authorities and local fishing interests. This information will assist the Australian industry to make investment decisions and thus encourage an expansion of Australian fishing and fish processing activities where commercial viability of operations is demonstrated. The operations of foreign vessels engaged in approved feasibility fishing projects are also subject to the oversight of authorised Government observers. Feasibility fishing projects have only been approved for a maximum period of two years and are reviewed at the end of the first twelve months operations. Participation in feasibility fishing projects does not entitle the companies concerned to any exclusive or preferential rights in any future commercial fishery that may develop. </para>
        <para>With respect to joint commercial fishing ventures any approvals are conditional upon the participating companies phasing out foreign vessels and crews in addition to satisfying strict requirements with respect to areas and methods of operation and disposal of catch. There are no joint fishing ventures currently operating. </para>
        <para>Vessels operating under government to government agreements are only approved to operate for a 12 month period and foreign vessels will only be permitted access to fisheries resources surplus to Australia&#39;s harvesting capacity. International practice requires that we allow foreigners access to surplus resources in the 200 mile Australian fishing zone but on terms and conditions we determine. These conditions include frequent reporting of position and movement in the zone as well as catch reports every six days to assist in managing and conserving the resources. </para>

Both Australia and Canada are parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Convention is designed to regulate trade in endangered species and their products to ensure the survival of species of wild fauna and flora that are or may be threatened with extinction by uncontrolled trade. </para>

          <para>The Convention provides for the listing of species endangered through trading on one of three Appendices depending on the degree to which they may be endangered. Neither the harp seal, nor the hooded seal which is also taken during the Canadian seal hunt, are listed on any of these Appendices. Should evidence be forthcoming that either species is endangered by continued hunting the Prime Minister has said that the Australian Government would seek to have the species included in one of the CITES Appendices. </para>
