            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Health. The Minister recently announced the first change to the domiciliary nursing care benefit scheme since its introduction by a Liberal-Country Party Government in 1972. Will the Minister endeavour to have the $2 a day benefit, which has remained unchanged since 1972, increased to a more realistic level before the 1 November starting date of the expanded eligibility criteria which now includes patients 16 years of age and over? </para>

            <para>-I do not think I need tell the honourable member for Murray that the Government strongly supports policies that are designed to minimise the high cost of institutional care. The Government&#39;s strategy generally is to encourage the development of policies that will minimise illness in the community. The prime aim of the health promotion campaign that will be launched in the next financial year will be to improve the quality of health of the Australian people. At the same time, the Government believes that it should give incentives to people to provide domiciliary care when it can provide a satisfactory alternative to high cost institutional care. It was in that context that the Government took the decision to reduce the age eligibility criterion for the benefit from 65 years of age to 16 years of age in the amendments to the National Health Act which were debated in this place only this week. However, the increase in the daily benefit will be a matter for Cabinet&#39;s </para>

The observations of the honourable member for Burke are not incorrect. They require me again to draw the attention of the House to what I have said on a previous occasion, that is, that our practices have tended to drift from the Standing Orders. Many things are accepted by practice which in fact are not consistent with the Standing Orders. In this situation the Minister for Defence took a point of order and I had no alternative but to uphold that point of order because it is consistent with the Standing Orders and not with the practices which in many respects have become somewhat questionable.

Under Standing Order 142 it is quite clearly provided that questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible. I recognise that the question raises a very serious matter. It is a matter which is being discussed rather widely in the community at the present time.

              <para>-My question is directed to the Minister for National Development. I refer to questions I asked the Minister on Monday and yesterday concerning the lunch he had with representatives of oil companies in Western Australia. He said yesterday that he wanted to go back and check his correspondence concerning the question I asked him yesterday. I now ask: Did the Minister attend a lunch at the Parmelia Hotel on 20 April at which representatives of various oil companies were present. Prior to going to the lunch was he told that the finance committee had had support from some of the companies represented but wished to impress the overseas groups especially of the necessity to support the Government and free enterprise? </para>

            <para>- Let me begin by saying that there is absolutely no doubt that the honourable member for Fremantle is trying to make mountains out of molehills. Let there be no question about it: I did go to a luncheon at the Parmelia Hotel. Let me also make the point- although it has now been taken to a point of order- that it was not a secret lunch. Let us have that clear. I was invited to go to that luncheon by the  President  of the Liberal Party in Western Australia to talk with a group of businessmen, amongst whom there were people from oil companies, of course, who were interested in the area covered by my portfolio. The  President  of the Liberal Party was the only person with whom I had any discussions on the proposed luncheon. </para>

              <para>- All of the administrative arrangements were handled by my personal secretary in accordance with the usual practice in my office. I might mention that my secretary handled approximately 200 invitations and appointments during the month of April. In the conversations I had with the  President  of the Liberal Party the question of fund raising was not raised. My personal secretary has informed me that in the arrangements that were made advice was received that there would be no discussion regarding fund raising at that luncheon. I addressed that meeting on various aspects of my portfolio and I received questions about what I said to the meeting. I might say that during that meeting there was no discussion on fund raising at all. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Prime Minister or the Minister acting for the Minister for Education. Is it a fact that generally most non-government schools are at Level 6 according to the Schools Commission, which is the lowest physical resources level? Does he appreciate that attempts to lift these Level 6 schools through public expenditure assistance cannot be accomplished by the Commonwealth alone, and that some States have dragged their feet for years? Will he therefore seek the co-operation of these States to accomplish this task in both recurrent and capital expenditure fields and ensure that the Commonwealth&#39;s effort is made known to those schools, the students and their parents, and will he make known the fact that the States dragging their feet are New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania? </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman is correct when he indicates that the Schools Commission has pointed out that the Level 6 schools have resources far below the national average and that the Commonwealth has introduced policies to try to redress that. As the honourable gentleman will know, the payments from the Commonwealth to independent schools are linked to a percentage of what it costs to educate people in a government primary or a government secondary school. Obviously Level 6 schools get a higher percentage from the Commonwealth than those independent schools that are better endowed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In addition, of course, the Commonwealth has, in recent times, been providing some capital expenditure so that independent schools can have an opportunity to establish themselves in new and growing areas so that they might continue to provide educational opportunities for the children of those parents who would prefer their children to go to independent schools of one kind or another. I think that under these policies, for the first time in many, many years, independent schools of these categories are looking to the future with a much greater degree of confidence and with a capacity to expand of a kind that they have not had and would not have had without the Commonwealth&#39;s policies. </para>
          <para>Even in this year of financial stringency, of course, the payments to the lower level schools are going to be increased to provide some additional support in real terms. That is quite plainly justified on the resources comparison between independent schools and government schools. </para>
          <para>It is also true, as the honourable gentleman points out, that there is a very great difference between the resources provided by States to independent schools. I do not think any of the States enter into the capital arena. If they do, they do so in a very, very modest way. I would like to see all States supplementing what the Commonwealth seeks to do in that regard. It would certainly expand educational choice and possibilities for a wider section of the Australian community. The dual system of government and independent schools is a very important part of Australian life, something to be maintained and very much to be encouraged. </para>
          <para>A number of States do provide recurrent support to independent schools. In the last Victorian Government election policy speech, for example, a commitment was made to move from 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the costs of education in government schools to be paid on account of children in independent schools. But the States that the honourable gentleman mentioned do lag very far behind in this matter. They discriminate positively against children in independent schools. I do not believe that they meet their general responsibilities to that section of the community. </para>
          <para>Governments have a responsibility to all children within their general boundaries. They ought to match that by making sure that some taxpayers&#39; dollars not only go to government schools but also are paid on account of children in independent schools. The States concerned could certainly do very much more than they do. </para>

Does this minute claim that Japanese anti-nuclear activists are alleged to be in the country to train local activists in antinuclear activity? What evidence is there to support this claim? Are establishment employees or local residents under any threat or danger? Are any local activists being investigated as possible threats to the reactor or is this an unjustifiable innuendo, probably prompted to provide some justification for telephone tapping or some curtailment of civil liberties? </para>

            <para>-There is obviously a correlation between wages that rise too fast and unemployment. At one point at any rate that was the bipartisan view of this House because a former Labor Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Crean, had made it perfectly plain that, in his view, one man&#39;s wage rise was another man&#39;s job. That remains very true. If we return to the time under Labor when in one year wages for males increased by over 25 per cent and for females by over 35 per cent, I think, that was also the time when a very significant rise in unemployment of approximately 200,000 occurred in one year. It is worth noting that under the Labor Administration, Ministers for Labour were encouraging wage claims within the Commission and outside the Commission. They were doing that in a way which was totally irresponsible and destructive of jobs and job opportunities in Australia. </para>

          <para>Over the last two to three years the degree of compliance with the wage indexation guidelines has been quite high- about 90 per cent. However, there have been a number of work value cases which have been judged to be within the guidelines but which many would judge to have been outside the guidelines in the sense of being phoney work value cases. That might tend to depreciate the degree of compliance if a different view were taken of those work value cases. Most of the wage increase that has recently been recorded and which attracted some publicity yesterday would have flown through from the last six-monthly decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. That decision granted 100 per cent indexation, which the Government believed to be totally irresponsible and totally destructive of general efforts to achieve a better balance between wages and profitability and to establish circumstances where firms can be encouraged to take on more people. I heard of a number of firms which had been planning very directly to take on more people but had deferred that decision or postponed or cancelled it as a result of the Commission&#39;s decision. </para>
          <para>I think it is worth noting that not only the Government but also many sections of the Australian community regarded that decision as being one of very great irresponsibility in the circumstances of the time. We are to be faced shortly with another Arbitration Commission decision. It would be quite wrong to try to prejudice that decision, of course, but I hope the Arbitration Commission and trade union leaders will pay greater regard to the need to encourage greater employment. I do not believe that the industrial relations consequences of an economically more responsible decision are anything like as great as the Arbitration Commission fears. 1 believe it has been deterred by threats that have been made time and time again by a number of union leaders about what would occur if a responsible, economically based wages decision were made. </para>

            <para>-One of the virtues of having <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gundelach</inline> in Australia was for us to be able to impress upon him our concern at the attitude of the EEC towards the International Sugar Agreement. This matter was raised in discussions that he had with the Cabinet, and also in personal discussions that I had with him. I know that, when he visited Queensland, members of the Queensland sugar industry took the opportunity of impressing upon him their concern at the implications of the EEC&#39;s dumping of large quantities of sugar on the world market and thus depressing it, and undermining the operations of the International Sugar Agreement. I was pleased with his reaction. He was more responsive than I had expected in that he expressed his point of view that the EEC should be a member, but he was having great difficulty in getting member countries to accept the recommendation of the Commission that they should look towards becoming members and making some quota arrangements under the International Sugar Agreement in order that some discipline might be imposed upon them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As a result of comments that he made to the sugar industry and to the Government, I have written to ask him to confirm those remarks and to ask that they be brought before the Commission so that action can be taken as promptly as possible for the EEC to become a member. He has repeatedly said that he will have difficulty in getting the Commission to move on this matter until the United States ratines the International Sugar Agreement. There has been a longstanding dispute between the United States Administration and members of the Senate regarding the domestic pricing arrangements for sugar in the United States. I am hopeful that that situation has been resolved. They have said that it has been resolved on a number of occasions and yet they have failed to have it ratified by Congress. However, Congress has only another month to go before it rises and I have been given firm assurances that during this latter period of its session this will be ratified. Once that has been done, I hope that the EEC will live up to its undertaking and that it will commence negotiations with the International Sugar Council and work out an arrangement which is acceptable to the members of the ISA which will impose also some limitations on the amount of sugar which the EEC is dumping onto the world market. </para>

            <para>- Following the record wheat harvest in Australia, I think everybody is extremely gratified to see that the international wheat prices are firming up. In fact, the export price for Australian standard white wheat is now $A135 a tonne compared with $121 a tonne in February this year. Whilst I am not one to try to predict the future as to what the price for wheat might be, all the indications are that for the balance of this year the price will remain at these levels, or it might even strengthen. This year the world wheat crop seems to be down about 5 per cent or 10 per cent on the record crop of 441 million tonnes last year. Whilst stocks are at high levels around the world they are not considered to be exceptionally high in view of the food needs of the world. In fact, stocks in the United States of America, which has the major influence on international prices, tend to be down this year on what they were last year. Some other countries, such as Canada, which have substantial stocks have severe limitations on their capacity to export that stock. They have limitations on their transport systems, both rail and shipping. We have a similar problem in Australia, particularly in New South Wales, where disruptions to the loading of wheat have severely reduced our capacity to meet some of our export requirements. In fact, it seems as though we will be able to export only about 10 million tonnes of wheat this year, which means that we will have a carry-over of probably about six million tonnes. I think it is most unfortunate that these delays in the movement of wheat occurred in the earlier part of the year because they will deprive us of the very good market and price opportunities that exist at the moment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Regarding the International Wheat Agreement, negotiations took place under the auspices of the United Nations. These negotiations did not result in unity. I visited Canada in April this year with a view to getting together all the major wheat exporting countries. There has since been a meeting of officials of those countries so that there can be a degree of co-operation and coordination in selling programs. It has been agreed that all these countries will meet together regularly to monitor the market situation and to see that there is no undue competition on the market which would depress prices. There can be unfair competition by countries trying to get a bigger proportion of the market which leads to traditional markets of countries being taken away by other countries. This only jeopardises the overall international price situation and, in the long run, does not in any way benefit any of the major exporting countries. Whilst I would not say that this is a price fixing arrangement, I believe that there is an understanding that people who have traditional markets will maintain them. I hope that the pricing arrangements that are now fairly stable can be maintained in the future. </para>

The debate on this matter continued on the Tuesday, which was the day following the allegations.

By that time, the report of the allegations had appeared in media other than the <inline font-style="italic">Sun News-Pictorial.</inline> Secondly, consideration was being given to what kind of investigation should be carried out. </para>

            <para>- My attention has been drawn to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> this morning which does cast some doubt on the airworthiness of the Nomad aircraft. The article makes reference to a fatal accident which occurred at Avalon in 1 976. 1 might say that that accident occurred during an experimental flight with a tail-plane which had been modified and was different from that which is in the production aircraft in use around the world. The modification was designed to improve the short take-off capability of the stretched version of the Nomad, the N24. This modification work was not proceeded with as it has been established that the excellent short field characteristics of both the N24 aircraft and the standard N22 aircraft amply meet the requirements of operators. Honourable members on both sides of the House have long been proud of the Nomad and rightly so. The last three governments have given financial support to this aircraft.

          <para>Nomad aircraft are now flying in regular passenger carrying services and in a range of other applications in a number of countries including Australia. They have been certificated by the Australian Department of Transport and the United States Federal Aviation Administration as well as a number of other airworthiness authorities. All of these authorities regard the Nomad as meeting their airworthiness requirements in both the regular public transport and normal categories. These certifications were granted after critical and intense evaluation by the Department of Transport Flying Operations and Airworthiness Division of the aircraft&#39;s flying qualities and design characteristics with particular attention to safety aspects. The certification process means that the design and manufacture of the aircraft, as well as its operation, are strictly controlled by the relevant national airworthiness authorities. The Nomad meets all relevant flight safety standards laid down by those authorities in the countries where it is operating. Nomads are in use by seven government departments and instrumentalities. </para>

              <para>-It is most interesting that the Opposition spokesman on transport is not interested in setting the record straight about a very great Australian invention. Nomads are in use by seven government departments and instrumentalities, both at home and abroad, and by 1 1 commercial companies. Several of the aircraft sold to date have been repeat orders from satisfied customers. Nomads are in use in Australia, Europe, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, the Middle East, South America and the Pacific. Nomad has a very good operating record. Without exception, Nomad users around the world have given testimony to their satisfaction with its operational handling, maintainability - </para>

              <para>-Within the responsibilities which I believe I bear, I will make my answer as short as possible. I have made it clear that there is testimony from customers to the Nomad &#39;s operational handling, maintainability, ruggedness and overall cost effectiveness in use. I spoke this morning to the head of the Department of Transport&#39;s Flying Operations and Airworthiness Division. He confirmed to me that the Nomad satisfies all the certification requirements of his Department and those of the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. He further informed me that the FAA test pilots flew the Nomad and did not rely upon the Department of Transport&#39;s certification when making their own certification. The Nomad has therefore passed all the standards laid down by two countries with outstanding civil aviation records. </para>

              <para>-The reason I oppose the motion is to make this comment: During Question Time today there have been two very important questions which have taken up a lot of time. One related to the future of wheat prices, to which the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> replied. It was a reply that the Parliament should have heard. The reply that the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> gave regarding Nomad aircraft was a reply that the Parliament was entitled to hear- but not at Question Time. Both of those replies should have been given to the Parliament by way of a ministerial statement. The two Ministers concerned, instead of sending their questions to the members who asked them, should have asked the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> whether he would be willing to grant leave to them to make a statement and, in so doing, indicated to the Leader of the Opposition the nature of the statement. Had that been done, and had the Leader of the Opposition refused to grant leave, there would have been an entirely different situation. That was not done. </para>

          <para>I believe that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> ought to talk to his Ministers about the way in which they are abusing the forms of the House to draw out Question Time, thereby preventing members from asking questions. Where statements such as the two to which I have referred today have to be made, they ought to be made by way of a prepared statement to the House. I have been trying to get a question in all this week and it is pretty obvious from the way in which the Prime Minister is jumping from his place that it is not likely that I will get the question in tomorrow either. That is about all I want to say. The Prime Minister ought to do something with his Ministers. If that does not work and if the Leader of the Opposition proves to be unreasonable in preventing the Ministers from making statements on matters such as the two subjects to which I have referred, that is an entirely different question. But that has not been put today to the Leader of the Opposition. It should have been, and I hope it will be in future. </para>

He has moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a procedure to take place. The Prime Minister is debating the issue that evolved out of the question that was asked and not the reason why the orders of the House ought to be suspended, and he is out of order. </para>

              <para>- It is perfectly plain that the Opposition, and the Leader of the Opposition in particular, do not want to allow this Parliament to be used as a proper forum for the defence of a very fine Australian achievement. If it had not been for false points of order and phoney points of order which have been taken successively by the Opposition, this matter could have been concluded long ago. </para>

            <para>- On a point of order, it is quite clear that we have passed a resolution suspending Standing Orders to enable the Minister to have his statement incorporated. But, the House having done that, you then gave the call to the honourable member for Shortland who moved that the Standing Orders be suspended for a statement to be made by him. </para>

            <para class="block">Testimonial from Royal Flying Doctor Service, NSW Section: </para>
            <para>At the handover of the first Nomad aircraft to the Royal Flying Doctor Service, NSW Section in mid 1978, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Golland,</inline> the  Chairman,  referred to the basis of selection of Nomad for this role. He indicated that the aircraft had been chosen entirely on its merits and the equipment selection did not have any relationship to the source of funding for the RFDS operations. A thorough evaluation was carried out of a large range of aircraft and the decision in favour of Nomad was made on the basis of economy of operation, maintenance record, the most suitable fuselage layout which was judged to be ideal for RFDS purposes and other capabilities available with Nomad. </para>
            <para class="block">Ken Simmelink, Vice President- Asia, Missionary Aviation Fellowship </para>
            <para>Our Nomad N22B has been in operation in Irian Jaya, Indonesia for just over 13 months. During that time it has flown more than 1000 hours in some of the most rugged terrain in the world. It has flown in and out of 400 metre mountain airstrips with payloads of up to 3000 lb. Well over 800 hours were flown in emergency earthquake relief operations carrying more than 900,000 lb of food and other relief supplies to earthquake victims in the remote mountains and canyons of Irian Jaya. </para>
            <para>I just want to report the Nomad has not let us down. It has, in fact, surpassed our expectations. Performance is all that you said it would be- and more. Our maintenance has been minimal. We in MAF salute the GAF. You have designed and built a truly rugged, high performing aircraft. It meets all our requirements. &#39; </para>
            <para class="block">Peter Brown, Managing Director of the Wewak-based Independent Air Transport </para>
            <para>The Nomad is basically an easy aircraft to maintain and, when necessary, repair. Most notable is its very good economy of operation. We mainly fly out of rough strips. Another plus for the aircraft is ease of loading. We don&#39;t use the STOL capability-very few strips need that. But we like the aeroplane essentially for its economy, and because, for the size of the aircraft, it&#39;s extremely easy to maintain. &#39; </para>
            <para class="block">Dennis Douglas, Managing Director of Port Moresby-based Douglas Airways </para>
            <para>This aeroplane is a good money maker now and will prove in time to be an excellent money maker. The Allison is an excellent engine. It&#39;s perfect in this aircraft in the hot and high environment we have up here. We&#39;ve had really big savings on fuel through its very low consumption, and we look forward to even more once avgas becomes even more scarce in remote areas. In the long term I think aircraft will all be powered by turbines, and the Allison&#39;s consumption is way down on the PT6 on the Twin Otter. I&#39;ve bought two Nomads and they are flying 1800 hours per year over all types of strips. I &#39;ve got two more on order. </para>
            <para class="block">John Laffan, Ferry Pilot, Superior Air Service </para>
            <para>I have delivered over 30 of the Nomads sold around the world- to Europe, the Philippines, South America and the USA, across both Atlantic and Pacific. I have not had one serious problem with the aircraft even at high ferry overloads, through severe turbulence, and in heavy icing during winter months around Iceland, Greenland, Northern Canada and Scandinavia. All delivery deadlines have been achieved on schedule. </para>
            <para>The aircraft is reliability and safety personified. &#39; </para>

            </list>
            <para>The following is an extract from letter to Mobil Oil, Libya. </para>
            <para> I would find it hard to convey my total appreciation of the aircraft as there are many aspects that I will not be able to mention. </para>
            <para>Although we have had a little trouble at the start I feel that the engine is in fact very reliable. We are conducting 12 sectors a day with one aircraft and after 700 hours we have had only two non starts. One was a faulty ignitor box and the second a faulty fuel control unit. I consider this very acceptable. The fuel control unit has caused some problem in the past, however, they now know what the problem is and it should be no real problem in the future (I might add that the problem is a slow start one and is evident a while before it fails totally.) Check valves also play up with the oil dripping out of the exhaust- we carry spares. </para>
            <para>Airframe. Once again what aircraft has not any faults. The aircraft is built like the proverbial Brick Barn with only a few areas that require attention. The use of pop rivet in some areas is of doubtful merit as these work and require replacement. Undercarriage will take anything and only the micro switches can be a problem (we have had two go because of water) however, the new production aircraft, I understand, have had these removed and resited on the actuator in the stubwing- no more problem. </para>
            <para>Pilot&#39;s Aeroplane- Beautiful to fly, remarkable performance. However, if you are asking me for my opinion- I have now purchased my second Nomad. &#39; </para>

              <para>- Honourable members opposite are attempting to intimidate me. The Nomad aircraft is the product of all governments and has the full support of the Opposition. It would not be in operation were it not for the actions of the Labor Government. The real question is whether honourable members opposite are to be allowed to continue to subvert and vandalise our parliamentary system and to obstruct the reasonable procedures that have been developed over the last 600 or 700 years to let all voices in this place be heard. The Minister for Productivity, who has been in this Parliament about five minutes, chooses to subvert Question Time to stop members of the Opposition asking questions. We know perfectly well that over the last two or three weeks every Question Time has been a time of great worry and anxiety for honourable members opposite. Every time Ministers, including the Minister for Productivity, answer questions, honourable members opposite sit there worrying about what sort of gaff&#34; they will produce next. Every time we ask the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to account for his behaviour, for the promises he has made and has broken, honourable members opposite all sit there in terror. The honourable member for Canberra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Haslem),</inline> who has now reached the stage where his party gets about 20 per cent of the vote in Canberra, may as well take his time now. If there are any nomads about, he is one of them. He is the first political nomad. </para>

          <para>This morning, about 50 minutes ago, we suggested that the Minister for Productivity should take the opportunity after Question Time to make a statement which we could then debate. We want to put our point of view about how we should support and sponsor the Nomad. We want to know why this Government has taken steps in various areas to prevent the Nomad from being accepted as the aircraft for surveillance in Australia. Why were the specifications deliberately written so that in all probability the Nomad would not be the aircraft used for this work? These are the questions we want answered. </para>
          <para>This Parliament is the debating chamber and the forum for all points of view. Over the last few months, and particularly the last two or three weeks, we have seen an increasing suppression of Opposition points of view in the House. I have been in this Parliament long enough to understand the Government and what it is doing. In all the years I have been here some pretty rough characters and people, who have been totally insensitive to parliamentary democracy and everything else, have sat on the other side of the House; but I have not seen a government behave towards an opposition in the way in which the present Government has behaved. From the Opposition side I have seen political censorship imposed on debates in this House. When the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> was talking a few weeks ago, two days before the election in Victoria, the Government moved to suppress the whole debate to silence him. Last year I remember that the honourable member for Scullin <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Jenkins)</inline> was silenced on an education question in the same area. On many historic occasions the Government has taken steps to silence political comment in this place when such comment was in order. When the honourable member for Reid spoke, points of order were raised by honourable members opposite and the  Deputy Speaker,  in accordance with his duty and with a proper understanding of the situation, said that the remarks were in order. Honourable members opposite- I think it was probably the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier)-</inline> moved that the question be put, and the whole debate was silenced. </para>
          <para>If that state of affairs is allowed to continue this place will become another rump of a parliament such as those that exist in other parts of the world. This is one of the few free parliaments left and we will fight to the last ditch to keep it that way. We will take to the people the remarks made by honourable members opposite. Their comments and the interjections on occasions such as this will be circulated around their electorates. We will let their constituents know how they are treating one of the most important institutions in this country. The honourable member for Canberra who is occupying his seat only temporarily is barking like a small puppy because he has to try to impress the Prime Minister. We will let his constituents know what he is doing. It is time that we told the people of Bendigo what sort of man represents them. These are the people who will subvert every parliamentary and democratic institution in the country. They are turning this place into a bear garden. Under the leadership of the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> who is a parliamentary disgrace when he gets warmed up, they did it when the Australian Labor Party was in office and they are continuing to do it now. Their time has come. </para>

              <para>- I am delighted to address myself to the question. A question was put to me at Question Time by a distinguished member of this House, who is a former airman, interested in a distinguished aircraft. It is legitimate for a back bench member, a private member of the Government parties, to ask a question at Question Time. The Opposition wanted to deny him the right to do that. When, in fact, the Opposition asked me to make a statement, the Government made it clear that I would be prepared to make a statement. We need not have gone through this charade that we have just gone through. I said at Question Time - </para>

              <para>- I have extolled the virtues of the Nomad aircraft on many occasions. Its versatility is well known to all honourable members of this House. It was designed to fill a gap in aviation, and this it did. The aircraft has a short takeoff and landing capacity. It has an Allison engine which has distinguished itself in helicopters. It has a great hovering capacity. As well as being a fast aircraft, it is able to hover in much the same way as helicopters were designed to do. Anyone who has seen the Nomad knows the capacity of the aircraft to land in difficult situations. It comes in several varieties which have been certified not only by the Department of Transport but also by the United States Federal Aviation Authority. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The basic certification for the Nomad N22 aircraft was granted in Australia by the Department of Transport in April 1975. The United States Federal Aviation Administration certification was awarded in May 1977. Certification in the Scandinavian countries will proceed as soon as the Department of Transport&#39;s de-icing certification is completed, which we expect to be in the very near future. The certification for the N22 version to operate as a regular passenger transport was granted by the Department of Transport in January 1978 and by the Federal Aviation Administration in November 1978. Australian certification of the stretched Nomad N24 was granted on 21 October 1977. The Australian Department of Transport certification of the N24A, the commuter version, was granted in May, and the Federal Aviation Administration certification was granted in November 1978. The floatplane version of the N22B is now with Wipline in Minneapolis in the United States of America and has completed FAA certification trials. The FAA certification is expected very shortly. </para>
          <para>I mention those certifications because they do indicate the versatility of the Nomad. I have referred to the floatplane version. Experiments are going ahead with an amphibious version. The Nomad is an aircraft of which we can be proud. I mentioned the hovering qualities, and the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> sought to construe that as meaning that it was like a helicopter. It is not like a helicopter but it has a remarkable capacity to slow down so that it can search the ground. It is, therefore, ideally suited for surveillance purposes as well as having a capacity to land on beaches or in rough terrain in a short distance. The important capacity of the Nomad for surveillance purposes has been recognised by this Government. We have made a decision that in respect of the experimental period there are three main roles of surveillance aircraft, and in each of those three roles the Nomad will be used. At the end of the experimental period, Cabinet will again consider the precise nature of our surveillance contribution and the precise role the Nomad will have in it. </para>
          <para>In respect of marketing the aircraft, I think it is fair to say that we have a marketing concept which has established a world-wide network of distributors and agents. Distributorships and agencies have been appointed in Australia and overseas countries. We cover New Zealand, South East Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Southern Europe, Pakistan, South and Central Americas, the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Scandinavia, India and the Philippines. We have a most extensive array of distributors. The Nomad has been exhibited at many overseas air shows, including a current one in the United States and one shortly to be held in Paris. The Nomad aircraft has aroused great customer interest from all over the world. I have mentioned before in this Parliament the number of countries in which the aircraft is operating. Time and time again the Government has showed its support for the aircraft. In fact, it has given approval to the production of a total of 145 aircraft, and we have arrangements in train for evaluating future requirements. </para>
          <para>One of the points I was trying to make in Question Time this morning was in relation to customer satisfaction. It surprised me that the journalist in question did not seek to talk to people who have had experience in flying the Nomad. Most people who have been in Papua New Guinea or elsewhere in the Pacific know that the mission pilots are very skilled and experienced pilots who really test their aircraft to the full. They demand a great deal from their aircraft. Let me quote the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Simmelink,</inline> who is the Vice-President for Asia, of the Missionary Aviation Fellowship: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Our Nomad N22B has been in operation in Irian Jaya, Indonesia for just over 13 months. During that time it has flown more than 1000 hours in some of the most rugged terrain in the world. It has flown in and out of 400 metre mountain airstrips with payloads of up to 3000 lb. Well over 800 hours were flown in emergency earthquake relief operations carrying more than 900,000 lb of food and other relief supplies to earthquake victims in the remote mountains and canyons of Irian Jaya. </para>
            <para>I just want to report the Nomad has not let us down. It has, in fact, surpassed our expectations. Performance is all that you said it would be- and more. Our maintenance has been minimal. We in MAF salute the GAF. You have designed and built a truly rugged, high performing aircraft. It meets all our requirements. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The only other comment I wish to make is to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Laffan, the ferry pilot of Superior Air Services, who says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I have delivered over 30 of the Nomads sold around the world- to Europe, the Philippines, South America and the United States of America, across both Atlantic and the Pacific. I have not had one serious problem with the aircraft even at high ferry overloads, through severe turbulence, and in heavy icing during winter months around Iceland. Greenland, Northern Canada and Scandinavia. All delivery deadlines have been achieved on schedule. </para>
            <para>The aircraft is reliability and safety personified. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that the confidence which this Government has shown in the Nomad is more than vindicated by those remarks. In addition, those remarks more than vindicate the certification granted to the aircraft by both the Department of Transport in Australia and the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. Each of those authorities has an excellent safety record, and Australian civil aviation can be very confident that the Nomad satisfies all of their criteria. </para>

              <para>-Might I also suggest that a short time ago the House supported a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Within that motion for the suspension of Standing Orders was a very important motion that the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> should explain the Government&#39;s action in initially drawing aircraft surveillance tenders in a form that excluded utilisation of Nomad aircraft. It is significant that the Minister did not touch at all on the very important thrust of the motion that had been adopted by the House. The Minister responsible not only got the Nomad confused with helicopters- he thought it could hover like a helicopter on the basis of its having the same engine manufacturer- but he also could not even get around to the substance of the motion. Here we get back to the real story of the Nomad aircraft with this Government. The Nomad has been an orphan, an unwanted aircraft with the conservatives opposite. It was the subject last year of desperate ministerial brawls between the Minister for Productivity, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline></para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As I recall it, the Minister for Productivity carried out backroom briefings of the Press on how he was losing out, and how the aircraft surveillance guidelines and the tender documents which were being drawn would exclude the Nomad aircraft. The Minister responsible was unable to persuade his fellow ministers to utilise the Australian product. At that very time I was at the Farnborough Air Show. I inspected the Nomads on display. I was there on the afternoon that the Belgium and Netherlands police forces were to be given demonstration flights in the use of that aircraft for police surveillance work. I returned to Australia a week later and learned that there was a solid campaign in this country by the senior ministers of the Government- not by the junior boy, almost the lowest ranking minister, but by the heavies- to exclude the use of Nomad aircraft in aircraft surveillance around the Australian coast. </para>
          <para>Let us put to rest the bleating and complaints of the Minister for Productivity about his Government&#39;s attitude to the Nomad aircraft. The record shows that it was an unwanted aircraft. It was an orphan aircraft. It was not until the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> got involved as a result of pressure by the Opposition and the public and media attention that a compromise was made. The record shows that the tender document guidelines were changed so that the aircraft could be used whereas under the original guidelines it could not have been used. I say that the Opposition from the beginning has always supported the development, manufacture, marketing and utilisation of this fine Australian-built aircraft. </para>

              <para>-It is quite clear that the Government is so sensitive on this issue that it does not want to debate it. That is why it is disrupting the debate on the statement. I return to the substance of the motion which called for an explanation of the Government&#39;s action in initially drawing aircraft surveillance tenders in a form that excluded utilisation of the Nomad aircraft. Can somebody from the Government side- obviously the Minister is incapable of doing so- explain to the Parliament why this aircraft has suddenly become the subject of so much attention and why the Minister answered a Dorothy Dix question in the House today when the aircraft was rejected outright by the Govern,ment only a few months ago? Why the contradiction? Perhaps when the Government has enough courage and expertise we will get an answer. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I refer to the facts. The first major air order for Nomad aircraft was placed by the Whitlam Government. Those aircraft were to be used in the Northern Territory medical and health services. There was no mention of that by the Minister for Productivity. The Minister in his statement sought, firstly, to elude the main thrust of the question and, secondly, to try to score some petty political point. The other matters referred to in the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders which I moved included the quality and the economies of the aircraft. No one doubts the quality of the aircraft. No one doubts its economies. Yet the Minister told us nothing of those matters. This is an important subject. A detailed statement should have been made setting out those matters. The Minister did not make such a statement. We heard only a smattering of information about the advantages of the Nomad for the varying types of tasks at hand. The whole exercise was a ruse to get a little publicity for a Minister who cannot make a proper ministerial statement on a very important subject. </para>
          <para>The crucial matter is the safety performance of the aircraft. I ask honourable members whether it is good enough when the safety performance of the major aircraft manufactured by Australian industry is under serious challenge in the media for the Minister to use a Dorothy Dix question to try to dismiss the matter. We say that that is not good enough. It underlines the cursory support of this Government for the Nomad aircraft. The Government did not want it. The Prime Minister forced the Government to order it and change the aircraft surveillance guidelines. Why did the guidelines change? That is the question that needs to be answered. We understand from the various statements and programmed leaks from the Government side that the Nomad was not considered fast enough. The Government wanted a faster aircraft to catch the baddies. When the baddies got a faster aircraft the Department of Defence would have asked for a faster aircraft still. As one writer who took this process to its logical conclusion said, we would have had to equip the surveillance force with Mirages. That would have been the only way we could have kept up. </para>
          <para>From that kind of idiotic argument we come back to the fact that the guidelines were suddenly changed overnight to enable the utilisation of the Nomad aircraft. Why? Who stood on whom? Who was brawling with whom? I have outlined the concern of the Minister for Transport. I neglected to mention the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> who should have been included. I also referred to the Minister for Productivity and some input from the Department of Defence. Again, on this very important subject about which the Government pretends it has concern, we have been given no explanation. The most ridiculous statement of all was that of the Minister for Productivity in describing the engine capacity of the Nomad aircraft. He said that Allison engines which are used in helicopters because of their hovering capacity are admirable for the Nomad aircraft. My rough recollection is that a Nomad aircraft has a stalling speed of about 100 miles an hour. Unless the Minister for Productivity and the whizz kids in his research section have developed some method by which the Nomad aircraft can hover at 100 miles an hour, I am very sorry for the Minister. I would like him to try to hover in a Nomad aircraft with Allison engines just like a helicopter. It is not good enoughfor him to say that that is not what he said. The record will show what he said. He did not know what he was talking about. </para>
          <para>I now refer to overseas marketing. I think it is a great feather in the cap of the Nomad aircraft and the Government Aircraft Factories that the certification of the aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States will open up new avenues for the sale of the aircraft. We welcome that. We also welcome the Government&#39;s efforts, although they were not as strong as they might have been, in developing a wider market acceptance of the Nomad aircraft on a global basis. We would have to agree with that. We would have to agree with the marketing of the aircraft abroad. But as I said earlier, it is a pretty poor kind of sales exercise to be trying to convince people at foreign air shows that they ought to use aircraft for the very purpose for which this Government has rejected them. Even though the Minister&#39;s statement, forced upon him as it was, is some addition to public knowledge on Nomad aircraft and to the claims made in today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> it is not a satisfactory response to the issue at hand. </para>

            <para>- by leave- In accordance with the procedure to be followed with respect to reports tabled by Parliamentary committees, as outlined by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to this House on 25 May 1978, 1 wish to make a statement on the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure relating to the Northern Territory forestry program. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This report was tabled in the House of Representatives on 2 June 1978 and there was a short but informative debate on the subject. The report was very critical of the Northern Territory forestry program and recommended that it be substantially reduced, particularly in relation to softwood plantings. </para>
          <para>As honourable members will know, responsibility for forestry matters passed to the Northern Territory Government on 1 July 1978 when the Territory gained self-government. The report has therefore been made available to the Northern Territory Government to assist it in the consideration of future forestry policies, and I am sure that it will find the report helpful. </para>
          <para>There are a few points of detail about the report that should, I feel, be mentioned. In relation to the activities of the Forestry and Timber Bureau of the Department of Primary Industry, it should be noted that, although the initial survey was undertaken by a Bureau officer in the late 1950s, the Bureau ceased to have executive responsibility for the program in July 1967. Thereafter, the Bureau&#39;s work in the Northern Territory was confined to research into the species that should be grown and the various problems that became evident. </para>
          <para>The Standing Committee recommended a substantial reduction in funding for the Northern Territory forestry program in 1978-79. As honourable members will be aware, expenditure priorities are now determined by the Northern Territory Executive within the limit of the funds available, including the grant from the Commonwealth. In fact, the Northern Territory Government in its 1 978-79 Budget has diverted a significant proportion of the operational expenditure of the former Forestry Branch to parks and gardens operations in Darwin, Alice Springs and other locations. I am also advised that the Northern Territory Government has taken action to incorporate the Forestry Unit into the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission in recognition of the major conservation role of forestry. </para>
          <para>The Committee also recommended that any future financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth for softwood plantation operations in the Northern Territory should be determined on the same basis as now applied to the States of Australia. The Softwood Forestry Agreement Act 1978 authorises loans to the States to cover maintenance costs of softwood plantations established with Commonwealth assistance under the three previous Acts. The Northern Territory was not a party to those agreements and does not qualify for assistance under the 1 978 Act. However, under the Memorandum of Understanding in respect of financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and a self-governing Northern Territory, it is open for the Northern Territory Government to seek a specific purpose payment for forestry from 1979-80 under similar conditions applying to the States. Under the Memorandum of Understanding such payments would be accompanied by a reduction in general purpose funds to the Northern Territory. Should further agreements be made with the States for financial assistance for softwood forestry plantations, the Northern Territory Government would have the opportunity to participate in the negotiation of those agreements. </para>
          <para>The Government appreciates the value of the Committee&#39;s report which, as such reports should be, was searching and, where it seemed necessary to the Committee, critical. In view of the highly technical nature of the matter, however, the then Minister for the Northern Territory considered it desirable to obtain further expert technical advice on some of the important matters raised. He therefore arranged through the Queensland Minister for Lands, Forestry and Water Resources for a technical evaluation to be undertaken by professional officers of the Queensland Department of Forestry. This report was duly received. It endorsed, with some qualification, findings of the Standing Committee regarding further research, but favoured the continuation of further plantings on Melville Island and some native forestry projects. The Government is grateful to the Queensland authorities for undertaking this task, and the report will be made available to interested parties on request. The Government believes that the two reports, although differing in certain respects, will form a valuable basis for consideration by the Northern Territory Government of its future forestry policies. Although, as I have said, the subject matter of the Standing Committee&#39;s report relates to functions and responsibilities of the Northern Territory Government, the Commonwealth Government is grateful to the Standing Committee for its analysis and recommendations. I present the following paper: </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-As Chairman</inline>of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure and of the Sub-committee which inquired into the Northern Territory forestry program, I will respond to the remarks of the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott).</inline> I know that the Vice-chairman of the sub-committee and a third member, the honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLean),</inline> also want to say a few words. The members of the Committee are very disappointed with the response that has been given to the work that the Subcommittee has carried out. First of all, we are disappointed that the urgency of the response has not been heeded by the Government or the Minister. The Minister mentioned that our report was submitted on 25 May 1978. He knows that the response to that report should be made within six months, according to the advice of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> The response came more than 12 months after the report was submitted to this House. The members of the Sub-committee feel that that fact deserves at least the barest of passing references, but it did not gain any from the Minister. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The history of the Sub-committee&#39;s attitude to the Northern Territory forestry program needs to be recounted. We were informed in late March 1978 by a former member of the Expenditure Committee that this matter should be investigated. We knew that substantial selfgovernment responsibilities were to be handed to the Northern Territory on 1 July 1978. So within a short period and with very expert advice we made a report, not one word of which is in dispute. Where there is a pretence at dispute, such as by the Chief Secretary of the Northern Territory Administration, that pretence is shot down by a report of his own officers. I will read the words of that report into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in a few minutes. </para>
          <para>The upshot of the Sub-committee&#39;s report is that, whilst its members are mollified with statements that the work of the Sub-committee was found to be useful, good, deserving of praise and so on, not one skerrick of our recommendation on financial restraint or financial consequence is to be put upon the Northern Territory Administration. That simply means that $25m to $30m has been wasted. In 1979 dollars terms that is not a small amount of money. All the circumstances exist for a waste of $25m to $30m to continue despite our report. That ought to concern this House. I know that it concerns all members of the Expenditure Committee, irrespective of the party to which they belong. </para>
          <para>It is true that in the middle of last year an investigation of our report was commissioned by two Queensland foresters, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawkins</inline> and another gentleman whose name escapes me. That report has been relied upon by the Northern Territory Administration to justify its attitude. I want to read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the results of the investigation of that report by officers of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Everingham</inline> &#39;s Department in the Northern Territory itself. They are significant. This has not yet been disclosed. In a five-page report they very substantially supported all the work that the Expenditure Committee had performed. I will quote from the report: </para>

          <para class="block">It states that &#39;still large amounts of research are required before doing anything else&#39;. Yet funding is to continue from the Commonwealth Government for doing something else. One principal example is 400 acres a year of plantation on Melville Island for which there is no justification whatsoever from any scientific or rational authority. I will speak for only a few more minutes because I think this is a significant matter. The Forestry and Timber Bureau of the Department of Primary Industry cannot escape responsibility. There is the reference in the Minister&#39;s statement to the fact that the Bureau ceased to have executive responsibility for the program in July 1967. That carries with it the impression that what has happened since that time is not of the Bureau&#39;s doing. That is not quite correct. I want to deal with this at some length. A letter was written last year to the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> discounting that disclaimer. I do not want to seek to incorporate that letter in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but I want to say this: The big leap forward in terms of Northern Territory forestry occurred from the late 1960s to 1975. The Director of the Forestry and Timber Bureau was on the interdepartmental committee which recommended that big leap forward. I suggest that the Minister ought to ask for the minutes of that IDC on that leap forward which is the time period which principally accounts for the appalling waste that has occurred. The disclaimer cannot be accepted. It was unanimously supported - </para>

              <para>- The IDC on the Northern Territory forestry program on which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cromer</inline> sat and which accounts for the expansion of activities in the period up to 1975-76. There was unanimous support for that recommendation and he was involved with it. I will comment on only one or two other points because the other members of the Sub-committee want to make some remarks as well. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The plain fact is that there was a forestry department in the Northern Territory. That department has now been incorporated into what is called the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission. Very little work was done and a lot of cover-up was involved. On our information the Forestry Section of that Commission consists of a larger number of personnel than worked in the Forestry Department which has been scarified and lacerated by our report, and justifiably so. How can governments claim a program of some austerity under those circumstances when there was one rule for some parts of Australia and apparently another in respect of the Forestry Department of the Northern Territory Administration? It is a ludicrous set of circumstances. </para>
          <para>We agree with the report that if there is to be a commencement of activities it ought to be after adequate research. That is not the case now. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is carrying out research which should be appropriate to the situation. We believe that expansion or maintenance of softwood plantation activities should be pursued under the Softwood Forestry Agreement and that financial assistance should be provided at rates of interest which are acceptable to the Australian Forestry Council. </para>
          <para>Nothing that has been said this morning, nothing contained in the report of the Queensland foresters and nothing discovered in the investigation of both reports by the Northern Territory Administration disputes the substance of what was submitted to this House over one year ago. Every skerrick of the sub-committee report is correct, and the members of that subcommittee are not inclined to retreat from it one iota. If every skerrick of that report is correct, there has to be and there should be financial consequences that flow from that fact. There is no point in saying: &#39;What you said is correct, what you said is true and what you said is right, but let us ignore the economic, financial and money consequences that flow from it and pretend that nothing has occurred &#39;. That is contrary to common sense, contrary to the procedures of this House and contrary to what we present to the Australian people. </para>
          <para>The funding for the Northern Territory forestry program should not be included in the general grants for the Northern Territory so that we do not know how much it is. A waste of $25m to $30m has occurred. We should not allow this to continue. There is a sense of some anger. I know the honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLean)</inline> has a welling, although subdued sense of anger about these matters. The same sense of anger wells up in the honourable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John Brown),</inline> who has a stoic-like face. I know those honourable members want to say something. We have the abiding impression that there is a sense of co-operation between bureaucracies trying to maintain themselves. </para>

            <para>-In speaking to the response that the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> has made to a report of the Standing Committee on Expenditure I would like to start my remarks by suggesting to the Minister that the whole response leads me to wonder what parliamentary committees are for. I wonder whether they are set up only to be a sop to the back benchers on the Government side to keep them busy or whether they are really set up to provide objective, rational, critical analysis of government programs, their aims, objectives and performances. The Expenditure Committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and formerly under the  Deputy  Chairmanship of our late lamented colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Stewart, exemplifies the real reason for the Parliament&#39;s existence. Surely bipartisan investigation of public expenditure is one of the real reasons why all members are sent here by our electorates. We believe that the results which this Committee has produced in a number of subjects have been nonpolitical, bipartisan, honest assessments of expenditure of public funds. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Northern Territory forestry examination was a classical example of that rationale being implemented. The three members of the subcommittee, the honourable member for Lilley, the honourable member for Penh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLean)</inline> and I, had the complimentary advice of Australia&#39;s most eminent forester, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kel</inline> McGrath, who is the former Dean of Forestry at the Australian National University and who has been decorated by the United Nations for his work in the forests of Brazil. There is nobody in Australia with a higher degree of expertise in the forestry area than Kel McGrath. We were very lucky to have his services. </para>
          <para>I would like to reacquaint members of the House with the history of the project. The investigation into Northern Territory Forestry was promoted by a report which was made to the Parliament by the honourable member for Scullin <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Jenkins),</inline> who suggested that there might be some scope for forestry in the Northern Territory. The history of the report is that the Committee, after its short investigation, discovered that there had been a $30m waste of public money over 20 years. I would think that the report we issued should be a salutary warning to governments, and particularly to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, of how governments can be seduced and fooled by devious officials. The original Cabinet submission of 1959 which promoted the scheme was an exaggerated assessment of the Northern Territory&#39;s forestry potential. These reports were provided by people either blatantly dishonest or lacking in the technical expertise they were supposed to possess. Their error was probably a combination of both factors, that is, poor advice provided by mediocre foresters with a more than acute sense of potential empire building. Over the years this web of deception and/or ignorance, inexcusable from highly paid people described as experts, has been allowed to spread until a pathetic situation revealed by our inquiry 20 years later was ultimately reached. </para>
          <para>The sub-committee, on its visit to the Northern Territory, was appalled not only by what it found but what it did not find. The gentleman to whom I referred earlier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kel</inline> McGrath, spent days in the forestry areas looking for what he aptly described as the mythical tree, even one that was worth harvesting. The professional sense of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McGrath,</inline> a world renowned forester, was assailed and offended by what the Department was exhibiting as its precious resource. The native eucalypts have practically no commercial value and the pine plantations exhibited growth rates well below accepted levels. The scheme was originally set up with three high-sounding ideals; preserving the natural resource, providing youthful employment for Aborigines and conserving the soil, water and wildlife. On each count it has been a splendid failure. </para>
          <para>In 1955 a report was published by an eminent forester named <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bateman</inline> which stated in unequivocal terms the limitations on forestry development in the Northern Territory. This report was a realistic assessment of the Northern Territory forestry resources and its little potential for development. The report gave due recognition to the realities of the Northern Territory environment. Despite the truth of this report a large forestry organisation was developed. The organisation was significant in terms of Northern Territory expenditure and personnel employed. This organisation completely overshadowed the meagre forestry resource. The forest itself had always offered mute protests. Despite paper expectations and peoples&#39; opinions, the resource remained as it was and always will be, a very poor and primitive one. </para>
          <para>The simple figures of this 1955 report illustrate the overstatement of the Department&#39;s view of its resources. For example, the Maningrida area had, according to the Department, a projected output of 2,245 super feet an acre. The real production and what was eventually produced was accurately nominated by the 1955 report as 100 super feet an acre. The 100 super feet an acre is a much different result from a projection of 2,245 feet an acre. That figure is something we cannot accept. </para>
          <para>There are a few other interesting statistics which come from the report, but I will not bore the House with the lot of them. A few of them are these: The Department of Aboriginal Affairs admits to spending $870,000 since 1971 for Aboriginal enterprises in forestry. The total return has been $33,000. At Umbakumba, $45,000 was spent with no return. At Maningrida $370,000 was spent in 1 975-76 for a return of $ 1 ,500. Even that does not include a quarter of a million dollars spent on a defunct sawmill which we saw rusting away. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has spent $948,000 in less than three years on forestry research with such a significant lack of results that it is now withdrawn from the Northern Territory. One of the answers to one of the sub-committee &#39;s questionnaires suggested that surveyed areas of natural timber on Melville Island totalled 695,000 hectares. As the total area of Melville </para>
          <para class="block">Island is only 570,000 we wondered where the area to plant the rest would be found. Overstatements like these are fairly typical of the figures that were quoted to us. </para>
          <para>One simple fact emerges. Despite the idealism of the original concept, despite the great efforts over the years of many of the more devoted forestry staff to conquer the myriad of problems, the grant dream is in tatters. One telling statistic fully illustrates the history of this ill-conceived and disastrous venture. The Department in 1974 informed the Forwood Conference that the anticipated production of hardwood sawlogs in the Territory in 1980 would be 58,000 cubic metres. Despite criticism from foresters, this figure for 1980 production was raised again in 1977 to 82,000 cubic metres. The Committee is now informed that the figure has been revised in 1978 to zero. </para>
          <para>The Minister, in his response to our report, does less than justice to the amount of work which went into the investigations and ultimate report of the Standing Committee on Expenditure. The Minister has virtually said: &#39;Thanks for your trouble but the Northern Territory now has self-government and may use the money it gets anyway it likes&#39;. This reply to the Committee&#39;s report is certainly not good enough. The Committee was well aware of the approach of selfgovernment in the Northern Territory when it started the investigation. The Minister virtually tells us now that the Committee&#39;s report is superfluous. Although the Committee&#39;s investigation did not commence until 26 April, the report was tabled on 2 June, for the reason of the approach of self-government. That was stated, in fact, in the introduction of the report. Indeed, as the inquiry proceeded, the need for urgency became startingly evident so that necessary Commonwealth action could be taken before the Territory obtained self-government on 1 July. </para>
          <para>As the Committee began to find, an estimated $30m in expenditure had been wasted. It was essential, the Committee decided, that the conditions under which the Territory obtained the money from the Commonwealth should be clearly understood by the Northern Territory Government to exclude the possibility of the continuance of this profligacy. In contrast, the Minister saw no urgency at all in the matter. Instead of treating it as one demanding immediate action, the Minister has not even observed the procedure outlined by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> The Prime Minister promised that all committee reports would be answered within six months. I refer the House to the fact that the Committee &#39;s report was tabled on 2 June 1978 and the response has been made on 7 June 1979. Meanwhile the Northern Territory Government has comfortably settled into the new order which in the absence of any action from the Commonwealth relative to the Committee&#39;s report is, in this matter of forestry, merely a continuation of the old order to which the Committee tried to apply the brakes. </para>
          <para>The Minister&#39;s statement indicates incorrectly that the Northern Territory has diverted a significant proportion of the operational expenditure of the former Forestry Branch to parks and gardens operations in Darwin, Alice Springs and other locations. He does not indicate that the expenditure of public funds has been reduced to the extent of a curtailment in forestry funds, but merely that they have found an additional way of spending the money. Surely the Minister does not imply that he believes this is compatible with the austerity the Government is attempting to impose on practically every other avenue of government expenditure? </para>
          <para>The intention to continue planting on Melville Island is one of the more unjustified examples that the Northern Territory Government is now showing of its absolute lack of faith in our report. A decision to continue planting would rank with the decision to spend millions of dollars on resource inventory in the hope of a woodchip export, for which there never has been any possibility because of the constant burning of forests by the Aborigines in the Northern Territory. Since the Minister&#39;s statement appears to accept the Queenslander &#39;s rejection of the report for the cessation of Melville Island softwood afforestation, as was instanced by the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns),</inline> it is pertinent to examine this aspect of the report. It is worth noting that the Chief Minister s investigators asked the interesting question: If it truly believed that forestry can be an economicaal proposition in the Northern Territory, &#39;why not try to attract private enterprise to undertake forestry production?&#39; Why not, indeed? Private investment in afforestation has been established elsewhere in Australia for half a century. Why should it not be established near Darwin, which is starved for local supplies and entirely dependent on costly imports? Perhaps private afforestation would make a killing there, although one should examine the rationale under which the Northern Territory forestry operates. </para>
          <para>There are a number of cautions which private enterprise would consider before it put money into a forestry venture. It is justifiable that governments would expect to make less profit on their revenue than perhaps private industry would make, but when we look at the problems involved I do not think that stands up to examination. The Melville Island prospects are too low for even a government to accept a combination of impossibly low productivity, Northern Territory termites, floods, fires, climate problems, soils, cyclones, Aboriginal ownership and Aboriginal burning traditions. All of these add up to a formidable parcel. All but the last two are not unknown elsewhere, but each hazard is extreme under Northern Territory conditions. In combination, they add up to a pretty disturbing prospect. </para>
          <para>The Queensland foresters saw three other ways of spending forestry money in the Northern Territory, and the Committee rejected all three without reservation. Particularly in relation to softwood afforestation, we felt that here was just another example of what an increasing number of expert examiners have concluded to be the reason for failure after failure in the Northern Territory, namely, the idea that all one needs to do is transplant the technology of the temperate regions to the Northern Territory and it is bound to succeed. Despite early promise, it has always failed when it develops to the point of putting stress on the slender resources of the site. This has been fully documented time and time again. As Heatley, who is a very eminent author, concludes in his scholarly work <inline font-style="italic">&#39;The Government of the Northern Territory&#34;:</inline></para>
          <quote>
            <para>Neither should the lessons of Territory history be ignored; too many failures have occurred in the past to discount the likelihood of others in the future. In that event, however, there would be one significant difference; for the first time (Le. since self-government) the responsibility for failure could not be attributed so easily to the shortcomings of a remote administration. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I hope the people of the Northern Territory bear that in mind, because so it has been in Northern Territory forestry- both failure and the passing of the buck to Canberra. Plantations of cypress pine on Melville Island were commended to the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science by the Northern Territory chief forester as the saviour of Darwin &#39;s dependence for its timber on costly outside supply. That was in 1 97 1 , but almost at once the cypress started to fail to live up to its promise. His expectation of a growth rate of 1 50 cubic ft per acre per year almost immediately started to slide as the plantations developed and began to stress the limitations of the site. That figure of 150 slipped to 100, to 60, to 50, and now, within seven years of the figure of 150 being put forward, the Queenslanders put the growth rate at about 20 cubic feet. </para>
          <para>Meanwhile, with the failure of cypress already recognised, the switch was made to pinus caribaea as the plantation species. Will it go the same way? The Queenslanders obviously hope it will not because they recommend that taxpayers&#39; money still go into it, despite all the risks and hazards. They estimate that hopefully it will grow 10 cubic metres per hectare per annum- a productivity figure one half of the figure that is still not good enough for afforestation in South Australia, the State with the longest and greatest development of plantations in the Commonwealth. Moreover, it is a figure which is only onefifth of that which pinus radiata plantations actually achieve on the average in that State. How the Commonwealth Treasury can now stop the Northern Territory Government spending Commonwealth money in a continuation of the practice that it inherited from its predecessor to statehood, which the Minister now defends, certainly poses a problem. As one rueful observer recently ruminated: &#39;Well might the taxpayer ask: &#34;When departmental expenditure has gathered full headlong momentum, can it ever be stopped?&#34; Perhaps the bureaucrat always wins&#39;. Certainly the Minister&#39;s cavalier treatment of the Expenditure Committee&#39;s report will not help. The Minister concluded that the Government believes the two reports will form a valuable basis for consideration by the Northern Territory Government. </para>

            <para>-I want briefly to support the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> and the honourable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John Brown).</inline> I also am concerned at the way in which the findings of the Expenditure Committee regarding the Northern Territory forestry program have been handled. As has been said, our report was brought down in May last year, over 12 months ago, and we have not had a response until now. 1 do not want to blame the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott).</inline> I am sure that he has many more urgent and important matters on his plate than this program, and he has had to await the result of other inquiries. But I do think that a serious precedent was set, in relation to the handling of our report, by a subsequent report being commissioned. If adverse findings of Federal parliamentary committees lead to the establishment of further inquiries by State or territorial officers, at the instigation of the Federal Government, then the integrity of our committees is being questioned with the obvious intention of justifying existing expenditure programs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think it should be said that our Committee had a detailed look at this program. We had expert advice available to us and we took a great deal of evidence. We inspected the program at first hand and brought in a very carefully considered report. It was not done off the top of our heads. It would appear, however, that the attempt to justify the expenditure of more than $30m over the past 20 years has failed. We know that the Northern Territory Chief Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Everingham,</inline> instructed two officers of his Department to examine the operations of the Northern Territory Forestry Service following the publication of our Committee&#39;s findings. Their conclusions, particularly as they related to the report of the Queensland foresters, were very interesting. They stated quite clearly: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It appears to me that efforts to question our original report have failed and that the Chief Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Everingham,</inline> has been misinterpreting and drawing wrong conclusions even from the report of the Queensland foresters, which was commissioned presumably to form a second and opposing opinion regarding our report. In answer to a question in the Northern Territory Assembly only a matter of days ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Everingham</inline> made a number of quite incorrect comments regarding the nature of our inquiry, the extent of natural resources in the Northern Territory, the viability of plantation growth rates, and the export potential of seedlings of pinus caribaea </para>
          <para>In my view, the findings of the Standing Committee on Expenditure remain valid. The conclusions from the Queensland foresters are very optimistic. In my view, if the grant to the Northern Territory is to continue on the basis of their recommendation to continue with further plantings on Melville Island, then I would suggest that this would be throwing good money after bad, even on the basis of a purely technical evaluation. It would certainly not be justified under any economic test. Page 6 of their report supports this planting recommendation, stating that such plantations would be capable of sustaining a mean annual increment of at least 10 cubic metres per hectare. Our advice is that this is just not an acceptable level of productivity. It is not commercially viable. The report of the Queensland foresters begins by admitting that it has not been possible to carry out an economic evaluation of the softwood planting programs. With regard to the Melville Island plantings, they also state that a detailed benefit cost analysis be carried out to determine the longer term future of this plantation project. I would have thought that the plantation business by its very nature was a long term project and should, therefore, not proceed until such an analysis was undertaken. The report of the Queensland foresters seriously understates the natural hazards of forestry in the Northern Territory. It ignores the fact that although these hazards may be separately and effectively countered elsewhere in the world, in the Northern Territory they occur together and with great intensity. We were told quite clearly that even billiard balls were not safe in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>The report concludes by simply stating that in the aggregate all these risks may involve some additional costs and it does not state their magnitude. In my view their disregard for commercial viability is serious and should not be discounted by referring to the social gains of the program. Our evidence clearly showed that this activity had not been a successful long term employer of Aboriginals, quite apart from the question whether it is wise to train people for noneconomically viable enterprises. In summary, I can see nothing in the Queensland Foresters report which changes any of the recommendations of the initial report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. There are differences between the recommendations of the Queensland report and the report of the officers of the Chief Minister. There are differences in the conclusions of the Queensland report and the statement of the Chief Minister in the Northern Territory Assembly. These inconsistencies only reinforced my confidence in our initial report. </para>
          <para>I am particularly concerned with the statement by the Minister that, in the 1978-79 Budget, the Northern Territory Government diverted a significant proportion of the operational expenditure of the former forestry branch to parks and gardens operations in Darwin, Alice Springs and other locations. I would like some additional information in this regard. I am concerned at the diversion of these funds. It seems to imply acceptance of our Committee&#39;s findings, but no reduction is made in the level of funding. I am not opposed to money being spent on parks or gardens. Street gardens have some value which is more than can be said of the forestry program. </para>
          <para>The point which I make is that if the Northern Territory wants to have a parks and gardens program it should certainly have one but this should be within its own assessment of priorities and from its own resources. It should not be funded simply because previous levels of funding were over generous in supporting a poorly conceived and administered forestry program. I therefore hope that the Minister, in acknowledging as he did that the Northern Territory expenditure priorities are now determined by the Northern Territory Executive within the limit of available funds- including the grant from the Commonwealth- will recognise that to some extent this limit has a false base and that no new evidence has come to light which disputes this fact. I think this whole question raises very serious issues about the principles of Federal funding and I hope that the Minister will have a very close look at the Government&#39;s funding response to this program and to our Committee&#39;s recommendations </para>

            <para>- The problem in this debate is that the members who have spoken, whose comments I value very much and with whom I do not want to get into a heated debate, are in fact members of the Federal Parliament and not members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I have not disagreed with these members at any stage because I believe it would be presumptuous of me to disagree with the findings of a committee that has gone to such a lot of trouble and has taken so much care in looking into this matter. Since 1 July last year, the Northern Territory has had self government and under that arrangement, in the practical sense, the Northern Territory Executive has control over what will happen to monies that are made available to that government the purposes of administering the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>- The fact is that those amounts of money are made available not in a tied way as the honourable member for Lilley well knows. They are made available as a lump sum which goes to the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly members are responsible to their electorate for the expenditure of that money. If the legislators are wise administrators they will get hold of this report and read it very carefully- as I have done- to take note of it and see what they can do. They should also take note of the report that was received from Queensland. As I said in my report to this House, the fact is that the responsibility does not lie with me, nor did it lie with my predecessor. As soon as this report was received and tabled in this place on 2 June 1978, he acted quickly. He sought a report from Queensland, because as it was his responsibility and his right he felt that it needed further investigation. </para>

          <para>On 1 July last year, the responsibility for these matters passed over to the Northern Territory Government. That is the complete answer to the questions asked by honourable members whose bona fides I do not dispute. Honourable members raise matters that they should have raised with the Northern Territory Government. Immediately this report was received, as I understand it, the report was sent on to that Government and I have no doubt that it took note of it. If it has not taken note of it, honourable members should tell some of the representatives in the Northern Territory to take it up in their Legislative Assembly in order to ensure that it is brought to the attention of that Government. So far as the Federal Government is concerned, the funds are not determined on the basis whether they should be put into forestry. </para>

He was not even involved in the negotiations with the Northern Territory. He knows quite well that those amounts are worked out on the basis of an overall sum. It has nothing to do with forestry.

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>tell the honourable member for Lilley that he will get the end of my tongue if he attacks me from the rear. Tell the honourable member for Lilley to be quiet. What I am putting to this Parliament is the fact, and the fact is that this money is not passed to the Northern Territory Government for the purposes of forestry. We have set up a self governing body to determine how those funds will be utilised. I can understand that the Honourable members who formed the subcommittee, having seen these things, felt disturbed about the fact that they were not able to press them upon a Commonwealth Minister. Needless to say, if I had the responsibility for these matters, I would be most disturbed if I had this report in my hand. I do not have it in hand as has the Minister who is responsible for forestry in the Northern Territory. I would like to make this clear to the House. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>On the question of delay, this matter has taken a little bit longer than it should have taken. I apologise to the House. This was partly due to the fact- if not largely due to the fact- that there had been this change in responsibility. There was not only a change of legislative responsibility because the governing body was set up in the Northern Territory, but also a change in ministerial responsibility because the Department of the Northern Territory was abolished. On 1 October last, the responsibility came over to me as Minister for Home Affairs, well after these events occurred. At the same time, I was endeavouring to find some way of meeting the needs or demands of these honourable members who came to see me beforehand and raised the matter in other ways. The fact of the matter is that I cannot find a way as there is no way of achieving this end. It may be that at some stage the Northern Territory may seek a grant through the Grants Commission process. It could seek a grant for forestry purposes. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Else Mitchell is still the Commissioner, I would hope that he would take this report and the report of the Queensland officials into account. Before a grant is made for a special purpose, all these relevant matters should be taken into account. May I conclude on a pleasant note. </para>
          <para>I reiterate that at no stage have I wanted to dispute either the bona fides or the judgment of the honourable members who formed this subcommittee. I do not dispute those things. I appreciate very much the work that they have put into the report. They would not be getting up in this place today unless they felt very strongly about it. I understand that, but I want the honourable members concerned to know that I, as the Minister who is responsible in the sense that I have been handed this report, do not feel any sense of conscience in relation to it. I cannot do anything about it, nor can the Government unless it stands over the Northern Territory Government and tells it that it will deduct say $20m from its grant because that money was provided for forestry purposes. In other words, it would have to pass some judgment on how the funds should be disbursed in the Northern Territory. As I understand it, that would quite contrary to the memorandum of understanding. Therefore, with all the goodwill in the world, I feel that the Government, through me as the responsible Minister, has dealt with this report- a little late I concede, nevertheless bona fide- with a view to trying to do our best with it. </para>

I did say that the honourable member for Chifley, a  Deputy Chairman  of Committees who is charged with maintaining the dignity of this House, was using a technique of continuing to talk while the occupant of the chair was speaking. </para>

It was alleged that I had said something improper and that I had in fact made an insulting remark. I think it is vital that the record be restated so that you can see that there was no such insulting remark, that it is offensive to me that I should be accused of having made one.

            <para>- In the debate last night I took exception to the remarks of the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume).</inline> As far as I was concerned, his remarks were insulting in that they imputed improper motives to my activities in this chamber. As such, I asked for them to be withdrawn. It was so ordered and they were withdrawn. Unfortunately, they have been compounded today by the honourable member for Macarthur, particularly in his reference to me as a  Deputy Chairman  of Committees. I would say that when I am in the chair I conduct myself with the utmost impartiality. That is my position whether I am acting as an Opposition member representing the Opposition or as a  Deputy Chairman  of Committees or  Deputy Speaker.  When I am in my place in the House I am in a different position altogether from that which applies when I am acting as  Deputy Speaker.  When I am no longer in the chair, I am the member for Chifley and, as such, it is my job to represent the electors of Chifley. I do that with whatever little ability I have. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 to enable certain of the Governor-General &#39;s powers under that Act to be delegated to the Treasurer, or a delegate of the Treasurer, so that new arrangements for marketing Commonwealth securities, as agreed to by the Loan Council, may be introduced later this year. Honourable members will probably be aware of these new marketing arrangements, which were the subject of a Press statement issued following the Loan Council meeting on 2 April 1979, and have commonly been referred to as the &#39;tap&#39; issue of bonds and the issue of Treasury notes by tender. Essentially, these new arrangements are designed to modernise the marketing of Commonwealth securities in a way which is appropriate to the changed funds markets in this country. Ultimately interest rates can only be determined in accordance with market forces. The increased sophistication of capital markets makes this more apparent. The arrangements introduced in this legislation facilitate the selling of Commonwealth securities at rates more in accordance with the forces of supply and demand. </para>
          <para>In outline, the proposed new arrangements are as follows: Treasury bonds and associated inscribed stock, which are referred to simply as bonds&#39;, are to be made available on a &#39;tap&#39; basis, that is, with one or more securities available to investors on a more or less continuous basis throughout the year, in contrast to the past practice of issuing new Commonwealth bonds through periodic cash loans. Bonds will be offered to investors by the Reserve Bank of Australia acting as agent for the Commonwealth. The Loan Council will continue to determine the maturity date and coupon rate of the securities issued in the tap and will, from time to time, establish the limits within which the yields on the approved tap stocks on issue may be varied by the  chairman  of the Loan Council without further consultation with Loan Council. Treasury notes and associated inscribed stock, referred to as &#39;notes&#39;, are to be sold by periodic tender, through the Reserve Bank acting on behalf of the Commonwealth. This will replace the present system whereby notes are available on continuous issue at predetermined prices. </para>
          <para>The advantages of selling bonds through a tap rather than through the occasional cash and conversion loans of the present system include the following: Firstly, having bonds on sale for longer continuous periods, with different stocks being issued from time to time and adjustments being made to prices to reflect market movements, will offer greater flexibility and scope for greater control over the quantity of securities issued and the maturity spread. Secondly, it should minimise the disadvantage of the present system of encouraging speculation associated with good and poor loan results, thus contribute to an unwelcome instability in bond rates and difficulties in marketing debt. Thirdly, the issue of bonds on a more or less continuous basis should also be more satisfactory from the point of view of institutional investors. Even with the instalment facility, the take-up of securities has in the past tended to be concentrated into a very short period which, given the large size of some past cash loans, and the large borrowing programs to be financed, itself contributed to instability in money markets. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>
          <para>I repeat that the third advantage of the new system is that the issue of bonds on a more or less continuous basis should also be more satisfactory from the point of view of institutional investors. Even with the instalment facility, the take-up of securities has in the past tended to be concentrated into a very short period which, given the large size of some past cash loans, and the large borrowing programs to be financed, itself contributed to instability in money markets. </para>
          <para>Fourthly, sharp swings in liquidity, for example, as are associated with tax payments can mean that the maturity dates of existing bonds, which normally coincide with new cash loans, can be quite inappropriate for trying to raise large sums in cash loans, though of course, cash loans can be, and have been, held at other times. </para>
          <para>The advantages of selling treasury notes by tender include the following: Firstly, the amount sold can be more precisely determined by the authorities but with the price more fully reflecting market views. Secondly, the advantages of that situation will be that the authorities will be in a better position to ensure that adequate volumes of treasury notes are taken up by the private sector in accordance with policy objectives, including the need for the private sector to be adequately equipped to finance seasonal contractions in liquidity. </para>
          <para>For the new arrangements in respect of the marketing of bonds and notes to operate effectively, it may be necessary to make changes at short notice to the prices at which the securities are issued. It may also be necessary to make changes to the maturities, interest rates and other conditions of issue at short notice. With notes being offered by tender, the prices and hence the yields at which notes will be issued will, of course, depend on the terms bid by those participating in each tender. The tap issue of bonds will also entail adjustments to price in order to change yields so as to reflect market conditions. In addition, technical adjustments to prices will be required to maintain the existing pattern of yields as the period to maturity of the tap stocks shortens. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, which I note is a very old Act, presently provides for the prices and other terms and conditions of issue of Commonwealth securities to be determined by the Governor-General. To allow for the flexibility required for dealing with these matters under the new arrangements, it is proposed that provision be made to enable the Governor-General to delegate his relevant powers, and it is the essential purpose of this Bill to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act accordingly. It is to be emphasised that these amendments to existing legislation will, if passed, in no way reduce the powers of the Parliament to authorise the borrowing of money by the issue and sale of stock, bonds or other securities. Such borrowing would continue to require the authority of an act of Parliament. The new arrangements for marketing Commonwealth securities represent essentially a modernisation of procedures in relation to the issue of Commonwealth securities in line with developments in capital markets which have become increasingly sophisticated since existing methods of marketing treasury bonds and treasury notes were introduced. </para>
          <para>Finally, I mention that, whilst certain details of the arrangements in respect of bonds are to be the subject of further discussion with the State Premiers later this month, the new marketing schemes have been endorsed by all the State governments as well as the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>The Bill does not in any way pre-empt further consideration of marketing techniques in the Loan Council. Rather, it provides for flexibility in adopting methods of marketing of Commonwealth securities as agreed to by the Loan Council. </para>
          <para>I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para>Honourable members will recall the legislation introduced earlier this year to increase penalties for breaches of the Quarantine Act. This Bill now provides for the amendment of the Quarantine Act 1908 principally to enable compensation to be paid when it is necessary to destroy certain goods or animals in order to prevent the introduction or spread of disease, and to give to quarantine officers powers of entry and search in carrying out their duties. This legislation provides a comprehensive range of legislation to ensure that the quarantine service meets the needs of the times. It is an unfortunate fact that the successful eradication of exotic diseases introduced into this country involves, in many cases, the destruction of animals, plants and goods of innocent persons. In some instances this could result in a primary producer losing his entire stock through no fault of his own. I am sure honourable members would agree that a person who has suffered losses under such circumstances should be entitled to compensation. </para>

            <para>-The honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> was not in the House a few moments ago when I made a statement on the conduct of the business of this House today. I know that the honourable member for Hughes, in calling the attention of the Chair to the state of the House, is well within his rights, but I did say earlier, while the honourable member was out of the chamber, that the business of the House has been frustrated today. This creates a reaction on the other side of the House and it does not help the Federal Parliament generally. I suggest that in future all of us endeavour to see that the business of the House proceeds without interruption as far as possible. </para>

              <para>- The present compensation provisions of the Quarantine Act only cover animals which are diagnosed as diseased, but which after destruction are found not be be diseased. The present limitations are unreasonably restrictive. For example, they provide no compensation where Australian animals are destroyed in a quarantine action to eradicate an exotic disease, nor where imported animals are destroyed after becoming infected through unavoidable contact with infected animals in a quarantine station. Similarly, there is no provision for compensation where it is necessary to destroy goods or plants of Australian origin. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I regard the lack of adequate compensation provisions unacceptable when the destruction of livestock or goods is undertaken in the national interest and where the owner of the goods or animals, birds, et cetera, is not guilty of any misconduct. The Bill now before the House will remedy these deficiencies. </para>
          <para>Every effort is made to prevent the illegal entry of animals, plants or goods which could introduce exotic diseases. Our determination in this matter is reflected in amendments recently made to the Quarantine Act which substantially increases penalties for quarantine breaches. Quarantine controls over conventional entry of persons, animals, plants and goods are rigorously maintained at all first ports of entry into Australia. In addition, as honourable members will be aware, the surveillance of our northern coastal area has been increased substantially. A daily coverage of our northern coastline between Geraldton and Cairns has as its prime objective the highest practicable protection for our national quarantine interests. </para>
          <para>However, I must stress that despite these measures, we cannot guarantee total exclusion of all material capable of introducing exotic disease. </para>

              <para>- In addition to regular law enforcement and surveillance activities, an important part of an effective quarantine service, and any disease eradication program, is public cooperation. This co-operation is particularly important in detecting all possible sources of exotic disease infection within Australia should the quarantine barrier be breached. The Government has recognised that an essential aspect of eliciting such public co-operation is the existence of a simple, expedient system for compensating owners for animals, plants or goods which it is found necessary to destroy in the interests of disease security. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I draw the attention of honourable members to clause 6 of the Bill which establishes machinery for the payment of compensation to innocent persons who may suffer losses because of quarantine actions. I point out that these provisions will not allow compensation to be paid for imported goods which are destroyed because of non-compliance with quarantine or other requirements prior to release to the importer. The provisions of the Bill specifically exclude these cases and cases where an illegal act by a person results in the destruction of his own animals, plants or goods. The Bill also provides in clause 6 that where there is a dispute as to the amount of compensation to be paid the matter shall be determined by an independent arbitrator. </para>
          <para>Clause 7 of the Bill extends the powers of quarantine officers to include the power to inspect baggage which has come from an overseas vessel or aircraft. These powers are presently vested in Customs officers, and in practice Customs and quarantine officers work closely together in the clearance of overseas baggage. However, many instances arise during baggage clearance which have specific quarantine implications. It is reasonable and proper that our quarantine officers should have the power to inspect baggage in their own right to carry out their duties effectively under the Quarantine Act. In proposing these amendments, I point out that appropriate arrangements will be made with the Bureau of Customs to ensure that there will be proper co-ordination and no overlap with the responsibilities and duties traditionally carried out by Customs officers. The amendments will allow improved staff utilisation and will improve the efficiency of quarantine screening procedures at ports of entry in the face of increasing passenger volumes. </para>
          <para>The Bill also extends the power of quarantine officers to search premises to detect animals, plants or goods that may be a source of introduction or spread of a quarantinable disease. In recent instances where breaches of our quarantine barrier have occurred it was necessary for quarantine officers to enter and search premises for animals and material likely to be infected with disease, treat or destroy items which could be a source of disease, and undertake all other quarantine measures necessary to prevent disease spread. These actions were taken under a general provision of the Act which allows taking of certain actions in emergency situations. However, this Government considers that as these actions affect property and the rights of individuals it is most desirable that where practicable the appropriate powers should be set out in specific legislation. It is also proper that where a search of premises is required it should be subject to clearly identified procedures set out in legislation. </para>
          <para>I therefore draw honourable members attention to clause 8 of the Bill, which provides that a quarantine officer may apply for a quarantine warrant to enter and search premises and to carry out necessary quarantine functions. The issue of a warrant will also empower a quarantine officer to control an area to the extent necessary to prevent the spread of exotic disease and make inquiries concerning movement to and from those premises. Provision is also made for the issue of a separate warrant which will permit the search of premises for documents relating to goods which may be infected with a quarantinable disease. Inclusion of this additional procedure is to provide for the cases where documents related to infected goods may be sought from premises not suspected of containing goods actually infected. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Bill repeals a section of the Act requiring all overseas travellers to report any illness or disease suffered within 1 4 days of arrival in Australia. With the volume of overseas travellers now arriving in this country it is not practical to use this provision as a means of disease detection and control. In all recent cases of exotic human disease in Australia, effective detection and treatment have been possible through our present public health systems. As a person not complying with this provision may be liable for a fine of up to $500 on conviction it is desirable that this provision now be repealed. The Bill before the House reflects the Government&#39;s concern that the quarantine service must be capable of meeting the demands placed on it by changing world conditions. By providing compensation for innocent persons in the event of property loss through quarantine action. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill is a formal measure to change references contained in the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act 1962, from the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. The Act now requires one member of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority to be a member of the Legislative Assembly who has been elected by the Legislative Assembly as its representative. Because the title of the Legislative Assembly was changed earlier this year by territorial Ordinance to the House of Assembly, the references to the Legislative Assembly must be changed accordingly. The Bill provides for commencement on 2 June 1979, the date of the election for the House of Assembly. Its effect will be to enable the member of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority representing the Legislative Assembly to continue in office until the House of Assembly elects one of its members to represent it on the Authority. </para>
          <para>In order to be consistent and to ensure that the term &#39;House of Assembly&#39; is used, the necessary amendments are being made to two other Commonwealth statutes which presently contain references to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. These are the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973. They are expressed to come into operation at the same time, namely 2 June 1979, the date on which the election for the House of Assembly was held. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1 975 to facilitate the development of a township at Jabiru, which is located in the Kakadu National Park, consistent with the Government&#39;s announced policies on uranium mining development. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> The Kakadu National Park was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act on 5 April 1979 and was a major step in giving effect to the protective measures which the Government announced would be established in the Alligator Rivers Region before permitting mining of uranium to commence. </para>
          <para>The first stage declared covered an area of some 6,000 square kilometres. The area for stage II will as soon as practicable be declared a conservation zone under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to ensure that the Park values are protected prior to its formal inclusion in the Park. In keeping with the recommendation of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry the Government decided that the mining town to serve mines developed in the region should be included in Kakadu National Park and should be a closed town with a limited population. The town will be developed on land leased from the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and will be subject to the plan of management. </para>
          <para>The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act requires the Director of National Parks and Wildlife as soon as practicable after a park or reserve has been declared to prepare a plan of management in respect of that park or reserve. The Director has to follow a series of steps directed by the Act in preparing the plan of management, including the receipt of public submissions and making the plan available for comment by interested persons. There will also be close consultation with the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Land Council in the preparation of the plan of management. The Director then submits the plan to the Minister for Science and the Environment together with any representations made and comments by the Director on those representations. The Minister, when he is satisfied with the plan of management, will lay the plan before both Houses of Parliament. Either House of the Parliament, within 20 sitting days, may, in pursuance of a motion upon notice, pass a resolution disallowing the plan. If neither House passes a motion of disallowance, the plan of management then comes into operation. </para>
          <para>It was the Government&#39;s intention that by including the townsite in the National Park the town would be planned and managed in accord with the Park plan of management. Following the Government&#39;s decision in November last year, to allow the Ranger uranium deposit to be developed, increasing numbers of people are moving into the mining areas adjacent to the Park. It is important that an early commencement be made on preliminary construction work in relation to the Jabiru town to ensure that a properly developed town of high amenity is established as soon as practicable so that workers and their families are not accommodated in temporary camps any longer than is necessary. </para>
          <para>The Jabiru Town Development Authority, a statutory authority set up under Northern Territory legislation, has been established to develop the town. </para>
          <para>Under the existing requirements of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act the procedures relating to the coming into force of a plan of management will take some time to complete. The amendment envisages a mechanism which would permit an early start to be made to preliminary construction work prior to the plan of management formally coming into effect. The proposed amendments will ensure that Park values are properly protected while such preliminary construction work proceeds. It is the intention that the major construction work in the town will take place within the framework of the plan of management. Construction in the Northern Territory is largely limited to the dry season- that is April to the end of Novemberand during this dry season the Jabiru Town Development Authority proposes a program to build the construction camp and access roads, and to provide temporary water-supply, sewerage, power and telecommunication services for the camp. <inline font-weight="bold">Major construction</inline> work on the township is not scheduled by the Jabiru Town Development Authority in this dry season. </para>
          <para>The amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act contained in this Bill permit the Director, before the plan of management is in effect, to approve, by instrument in writing, the performance within the park of such work as he considers necessary or desirable for the establishment of a township at Jabiru, upon such conditions as he considers desirable. Before granting a licence, the Director will be required to consult closely with the Jabiru Town Development Authority and the  Chairman  of the Northern Land Council. The Jabiru Town Development Authority will be the focus for co-ordination of the views of the relevant Northern Territory authorities. </para>
          <para>In issuing such a licence, the Director shall specify environmental conditions to be a part of that licence to ensure that the Park values are preserved. The licence will be a &#39;prescribed instrument&#39; within the meaning of the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Act 1978, which enables the Northern Territory Supreme Court at the suit of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife, the Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission or the Northern Land Council to make orders for the enforcement of any requirement under a prescribed instrument so far as the requirement relates to any matter affecting the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region. The amendment will also enable the Director to issue a lease or licence for the land on which the Jabiru township is to be developed in advance of the plan of management. I would like to stress that, in proposing these amendments to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, the Government is determined to protect the integrity of the Park. The Kakadu National Park is one of the world&#39;s great national parks and will continue to be so. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill, I would like to suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill 1979 as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that you permit the subject matter of the two Bills to be discussed in this debate. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-We are dealing with a cognate debate on two bounty Bills. I will deal first with the Bounty (InjectionMoulding Equipment) Bill 1979. This Bill gives effect to the Government&#39;s decision on advice from the Industries Assistance Commission of assistance to manufacturers of injection-moulding machines, which recommendations from the IAC were contained in the report entitled Miscellaneous Industrial Machinery. Whilst this report is dated 12 December 1978 it has not been released. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> in his second reading speech to the Parliament when introducing this Bill sought to excuse this on the ground that the Government&#39;s decision on other products covered by that report have not been announced. He will understand, and I am sure the House will understand, that without the benefit of being able to examine that IAC report, there are difficulties for members of the Opposition to examine this measure as closely as we would like and to be as informed as we would like. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, the Minister did reveal that the IAC had concluded that it could not identify public benefits commensurate with the high rate of tariff protection, currently 55 per cent, for these particular injection-moulding machines and that reduced tariffs would lower costs to the plastic products industry, the users of injectionmoulders, so increasing that industry&#39;s competitiveness in world markets, thus being able, we would hope, to create extra jobs in the plastics industry. We take the Minister&#39;s word for this. I am sure that the information is correct because he knows that we will be able to check it when eventually the IAC&#39;s report is tabled. The IAC recommended, therefore, that existing tariff protection, namely the 55 per cent which I have mentioned, should be reduced to 15 per cent. It also recommended that transitional assistance to eligible Australian manufacturers of injection moulding machines be accorded by way of bounty payments, initially at the rate of 45 per cent of value added, but reducing by 10 percentage points each year over five years. Such a phasing out of bounty over that period would allow the industry to restructure and to become, hopefully, more competitive at the lower tariff level. This is the view of the Government in reaching its decision. </para>
          <para>The Government has accepted all the major recommendations of the IAC. The only recommendation that it has rejected is the payment of the bounty on equipment sold overseas. Tariff proposal No. 18 introduced into this House on 22 May 1979 has given effect already to part of the recommendation which reduces tariff. This Bill is to give effect to the bounty elements of the Government&#39;s package. The cost of the bounty scheme is estimated to be approximately $4.2m over the five years, of which $1.5m will be spent in the first year of operation of this bounty Bill. </para>
          <para>The Opposition does not oppose this Bill since we are informed that it conforms largely with the IAC&#39;s advice. Our major complaint, however, is that the detailed reasoning underlying this IAC advice is not available to us and to the Parliament generally so that we can be absolutely confident in the decision we have made. Frankly, this is unusual as no draft report was released either in this particular case. I repeat that it does create difficulties for the Opposition and weakens the checks and balances which are the essence of this Westminster system. The absence of this report raises problems since this policy initiative is based upon a gradual reduction in assistance to the industry. I am on record at other times in condemning the use of general acrosstheboard tariff cutting alone to promote industrial development, particularly at times of high unemployment such as we are suffering today. I do not deny, however, the benefits of giving reasonably long advanced notice of future tariff cuts- I emphasise- in certain industries. I do not want to be dogmatic about this but I emphasise - </para>

              <para>-One industry I have in mind which was a high cost industry was the domestic whitegoods industry to which tariff reductions have been given notice of well in advance and where, indeed, structuring is taking place. In answer to the interjection of the honourable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hyde)</inline> I state that that is a case where I believe the policy is working. He will agree with me that plenty of notice has been given of the reductions and those reductions are gradual and phased and give time for the restructuring. I merely state at this point of time that I accept that as one of the methods to be used in certain industries to bring about the structural change, but I would not be dogmatic and state that it is the method that ought to be used to bring about that structural change in every case. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Appropriate industries for such action must satisfy certain criteria. I want to list those criteria which will also supplement the answer I have given to the interjection. The industry must be made up of large firms all with reasonable market shares. The potential economies of scale and economies of greater capacity utilisation must be sizable. Furthermore, the direction and nature of industry rationalisation must be apparent to all in the industry. The last of the criteria I want to mention- I do not pretend to be necessarily exhaustive- are that management must be progressive, which includes a progressive attitude to industrial relations, and management must be committed to adjusting to international market realities. Not many industries do satisfy these criteria. Whether the injection-moulding machinery industry is one of these I cannot say because, I repeat, we do not have the IAC&#39;s description and analysis of the industry. Nor do we have the IAC&#39;s views on the sort of rationalisation they would hope might occur within the industry. </para>
          <para>The main reason we have not opposed this Bill on the grounds that I have stated is the Minister&#39;s assurance that officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce will be monitoring developments in the industry. We look forward to the IAC&#39;s report being tabled because without it we are putting more trust in the Government than perhaps the Government deserves. But I can only sum up by saying that we are coming in on a wing and a prayer. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill 1979, which is the other Bill before this House in this cognate debate. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government&#39;s decision to continue assistance to the manufacturers of books in Australia. The purpose of this assistance which is, and has been, provided in the form of a bounty for some time, is to assist local printers against import competition. The intention is for the bounty to be available only for books which, in the absence of assistance, would otherwise have been printed overseas. The Bill largely conforms with the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission contained in its report entitled &#39;Products of the Printing Industry&#39; dated 31 July 1978. The IAC report pointed out that book production is a relatively small section of the Australian printing industry, employing about 1,500 persons and having an annual turnover of about $28m in 1976-77, the last financial year for which statistics are available, as far as I know. However, it is the section of the printing industry which currently records a relatively low level of profitability and experiences more and more import competition. </para>
          <para>The Bounty (Book) Act 1969-75 has assisted the printing of books in Australia by providing for the payment of a bounty on eligible books on the basis of one-third of costs of production. The payment of the bounty under the Act had been due to terminate on 31 December last year but following the recommendations from the IAC, this bounty assistance is extended to 31 December 1979. The existing bounty is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff of about 55 per cent and affords an effective rate of assistance to book manufacturing of 45 per cent. </para>
          <para>Having examined the background to the introduction of the bounty generally and its history and effects, the IAC concluded that the purpose of the bounty should remain to assist local book manufacturers to obtain work which, in the absence of assistance, could be lost to overseas competitors. To this end the Commission recommended, and the Government accepted, that assistance in the form of a bounty should continue for a period of seven years from 1 January 1980. There is already legislation in force to 31 December 1 979 and now the further seven years from 1 980 is to be covered. It was the Industries Assistance Commission&#39;s view, however, that the present bounty is high. Further, the Commission considered that significant improvement in the international competitiveness of Australia&#39;s book manufacturing was unlikely while the industry remained fragmented. </para>
          <para>The commissioners of the Industries Assistance Commission who looked at this industry, and whose report which I mentioned is dated 3 1 July 1978, argued that at the original bounty rate of 25 per cent- the rate which applied between 1969 and 1974- some rationalisation had occurred in the book sector of the printing industry. However, since the increase of the rate to 33 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent in 1974, the assertion by the commissioners was that production had become progressively more fragmented. Therefore, the IAC recommended that the long term rate should be returned to the 25 per cent rate. Recognising the need for stability in business planning they also recommended that the bounty period be extended until 31 December 1986. The Government has accepted this advice. However, the </para>
          <para class="block">Government has decided to phase in the reduction in the bounty rate, that is, the reduction from 3316 per cent to 25 per cent, by leaving the bounty at the 33&#39;/3 per cent rate until the end of 1982, then setting it at 30 per cent for the year 1983 and finally setting the rate at 25 per cent from 1 January 1984. This contrasts with the lAC&#39;s recommendation that the new rate of 25 per cent be brought in on 1 January 1 982 . </para>
          <para>Finally, the IAC argued that the various eligibility criteria employed since 1969 may have led to the payment of bounty for publications of a kind likely to be printed overseas. However, to avoid the need for a complex set of eligibility criteria, the Commission argued that the criterion which most determined the likelihood of import competition for book production was the size of the order. I will quote the argument of the IAC from its report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Of 700 imports examined, only 0.4 per cent involved orders of less than 1,000. The Commission considers that, by setting the minimum order size at 1.000 copies, almost all books not subject to overseas competition will be excluded, and the need for a complex set of eligibility criteria will be avoided. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Based upon this reasoning, the Bill incorporates the revised eligibility criteria recommended by the IAC, incorporating a minimum order size of 1 ,000 copies if the particular bounty is to be applied. It is this last mentioned aspect of the Bill to which the Opposition objects. It is our view, based as I will show in a moment on representations and submissions made to us which seem to be good, that the rather arbitrary minimum level of 1,000 copies will be detrimental to the continued operation of efficient, more specialised smaller printers. The figure of 1,000 was first suggested to the IAC by the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia, a body which frankly represents the larger printing organisations, not the smaller ones. In our view, the smaller printers were not properly heard on this issue. </para>
          <para>The IAC, having heard this representation, then rationalised this figure of 1,000 on what I consider to be a fallacious analysis that only 0.4 per cent of import orders involved less than 1,000 copies. But these figures were based upon import orders during the operation of a bounty scheme when local printers, both large and small, were being protected, more printing was being done in Australia than otherwise would be the case, and when only large orders may have been profitable enough to be handled by overseas printers. Thus the lAC&#39;s evidence in support of a figure of 1,000 is quite inappropriate and irrelevant. It would have been appropriate only if it was based upon the import figure in the absence of any protection or assistance. For this reason, the Opposition rejects the 1 ,000 run requirement as being based upon a rather flimsy analysis. </para>
          <para>I have a suspicion that the IAC was hoping to use the restrictive eligibility criteria to reduce the fragmentation in the industry by forcing out of business many smaller printers. However, we in the Opposition argue that the sudden exclusion of small orders from eligibility for bounty payments is quite unacceptable as an instrument for reducing fragmentation. I have already said something about their often being the need for rationalisation in many industries, but in many cases this way of going about things is the wrong way. This is especially so when the Government has been encouraging the smaller, more specialised printers, not only by the provision of a bounty hitherto, but also by the provision of the 4 per cent investment allowance. The reduction of fragmentation in this way is quite unacceptable as an instrument when the social and economic costs of this move involving bankruptcies and redundancies are compared with the small benefits as measured by the very small reduction in Government expenditure brought about by making the runs a thousand or more in order to attract the bounty. </para>
          <para>The IAC estimated that if the more limited eligibility criteria had been adopted in the 1 976-77 financial year, bounty payments would have been almost $lm less-in fact, $920,000-with only part of this figure attributable to books printed in runs of less than 1,000 since eligibility is to be restricted in ways in addition to the 1,000 copies requirement. If a minimum order size is required, the Opposition suggests that the figure should be 500. We believe this would be far more appropriate, from what we have learned from those in the industry, than the 1,000 that has been included in this legislation. This figure was unsuccessfully put to the IAC by Craftsman Press Pty Ltd and the Australian National University on behalf of the Association of Australian University Presses and the Australian ViceChancellor&#39;s Committee. It is also the substance of representations made to me by a small South Australian facsimile printing firm, Austaprint which has specialised in the reproduction of early colonial books, something which I believe ought to be encouraged and which we would like to continue to exist in this country. In addition, the Australian Book Publishers Association has made objections to any minimum order size requirement. I do not think it will be altogether happy with the 500 recommended by the Opposition. It certainly will not be happy with the minimum run of 1,000 set down in the Bill. For this reason I give notice of my intention to move a second reading amendment to the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill requiring that it be withdrawn and redrafted. I am unable to move my amendment at the Committee stage because it involves an increase in government expenditure by the payment of an additional bounty to those who have book runs of between 500 and 1,000 copies. I am left with only one means of recording the Opposition&#39;s objection to the requirement of 1,000. Therefore I give notice now that when we are considering the second reading of the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill I will move: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That all words after &#39;That&#39; be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: the House, whilst supporting bounty assistance for local printers, is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and re-drafted to provide such assistance for minimum runs of 500 copies instead of the present 1,000 copies in order to aid smaller, more specialised printers who have previously been encouraged to invest in facilities through, for instance, the investment allowance and who must bc encouraged to undertake structural adjustment in more equitable and less costly and disruptive ways. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We do not suggest that there should not be rationalisation; that there is not a need for economies of scale; or that the Government coffers are such that the amount of bounty available is limitless. We suggest that at this stage it would be far more equitable, less disruptive, and less likely to lead to bankruptcy in printing firms if the order was 500 rather than 1,000. In summary, the Opposition is not opposing the Bounty (Injection-moulding Equipment) Bill 1979, but we will be moving a second reading amendment to the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill 1979. </para>

            <para>-One of the two Bills that we are debating cognately is the Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill, the purpose of which is to continue to help the book manufacturing industry. The other is the Bounty (Injection-moulding Equipment) Bill to give transitional help to an industry. Most book manufacturing and much of the injectionmoulding machine manufacturing is small business. This responsible Government has appreciated that small business is very much a part of our way of life in Australia. It is vital to our economy and, therefore, we have encouraged small business in many ways. The main approach has been the responsible economic policy of the Fraser Government with its top priority of reducing inflation. This responsible attitude has restored the climate for expanding business activity and investment. The bringing down of inflation has made Australian products more competitive with overseas products. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At this stage it is worth while noting some of the other responsible economic moves under the Liberal Government which have helped to bring small business back from the brink where they were under the Labor Government. Book manufacturers and injection-moulding machine manufacturers were helped by these moves. There is the additional investment allowance for taxation purposes on the purchase of new plant and equipment. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> Other measures are the increase of the retention allowance for private companies, the extension of the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank, and the extension of the Reserve Bank guidelines to major financial institutions. These last two have greatly improved the finance facilities available to small business. </para>
          <para>Let me turn attention to book manufacturing alone. The latest full figures, those for June 1976, show that the printing industry is large; in fact there are over 3,000 businesses employing 70,000 people. This accounts for over $ 1 ,500m worth of sales, with a profitability slightly above the manufacturing industry generally. However, book manufacturing is not a large part of the total printing industry. This sector employs about 1,500 people and another 300 are employed by supplying industries. In 1976-77 the turnover was about $28m and resulted in a lower level of profitability than that of the general printing industry. This represents 60 per cent of the total book market. In most cases books constitute a minor part of production of firms which produce them and no doubt this is one reason for limiting the bounty to books produced in a minimum run of 1,000 copies. This provision will overcome the arguments of the Opposition as stated in their amendment. </para>
          <para>In 1973 the Tariff Board report said this about the industry: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The ability of the local book manufacturing industry to compete with its Asian counterparts has been impaired by fragmentation, excess capacity, high over award payments and union constraints on the operation of printers. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Opposition forgot to mention those. The report went on- </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Board considers that the community should not be expected to bear, through bounty or other means of assistance, costs attributable to these factors. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In the ensuing six years fragmentation decreased somewhat as some small businesses were driven to the wall under the Labor Government. This is not the way to reconstruct an industry. Excess capacity has remained and high over award payments have increased. This has all made the situation worse. Union constraints have certainly not reduced. Therefore, the Australian people continue to maintain these companies in business and these people in employment when they refuse to do much, if anything, to help themselves. I wonder whether the Australian people really understand the nature of the help they are giving? How long are we prepared to pay the price? As will be seen, the Australian Government has started the process to make the two parties involved aware of the situation and thus reverse the trend. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the help that these businesses and employees have been obtaining. This book bounty Bill is to amend further the original Act of 1969. This Act has already been amended in 1970; twice in 1973; in 1975; and in 1978. In May 1 969 the Government announced the introduction of an interim book bounty to operate immediately. This was to hold local manufacturers&#39; sales at the 1967-68 level. The initial bounty was 25 per cent of the cost of production. This cost of production factor is very interesting. It is the bounty base and was defined in the Book Bounty Act as the price paid, or payable, to a manufacturer, or manufacturers, by a publisher for the production of, or the production processes carried out in relation to, the book. If the publisher is the manufacturer, bounty is payable on the cost incurred in producing the book. </para>
          <para>This statutory definition means, in fact, that the bounty is not based on costs incurred but on the cost, excluding some items such as outward freight and packaging, plus profit, less the bounty, of course. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> The initial bounty was 25 per cent of the cost of production. In 1973, on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, the Government increased the bounty to 33  W  per cent. This has meant an increase in bounty payments from 1969-70  or  $ 1.4m for 18 million books, with a production value of $7m, to a bounty of $8m for 37 million books, with a production value of $32m. This is a lot of bounty. The bounty was shared by 1,930 operations, although 10 of these accounted for 43 per cent of the $8m. The next 50 recipients of the bounty accounted for 33 per cent of the $8m. Thus we have yet to see a significant improvement in the fragmented structure of the industry. </para>
          <para>The Industries Assistance Commission, after examining the industry fully, recommended continuing the bounty at 33!/3 percent of production costs from 1 January 1 980 for two years and to reduce the bounty to 25 per cent for the next four years until the end of 1986. However, the Government has decided to phase in the reduction more gradually. The 33&#189; per cent level will hold for two years as recommended, then 30 per cent will apply for one year and 25 per cent will apply for the remaining three years. This also applies to the cost of paper, but I cannot go into the details of that matter. Again the Government decided to phase in the reduction over a longer period. In keeping with the purpose of the bounty to protect against imports, certain types of books have become eligible for the bounty while other types will no longer be eligible for the bounty. The Government has shown that it is anxious to maintain employment and activity in the book industry. But it is also desirous of providing the opportunity and the incentive for the industry to restructure. </para>
          <para>The IAC is to be congratulated on its report. However, it must be remembered that these investigations cost a large amount of money. A large number of witnesses had to bear their own costs. We must also consider the large bounty which works out at a cost of over $6,000 a year for each person in the industry. This responsible Government has again given help to small business, in this case, the book industry. It should protect employment in the industry but also it puts the onus of restructuring on both the managements and the unions. I hope they accept this responsibility. </para>
          <para>The other Bill with which we are dealing in the cognate debate is the Bounty (Injectionmoulding Equipment) Bill. The Government&#39;s decision to protect the injection-moulding equipment industry is based on the recommendations of the IAC in its report on miscellaneous industrial machinery. As the spokesman for the Opposition said, unfortunately this report has not yet been released because the Government has still to announce the decisions on some products covered in the report. However, a draft report was released. I hope the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> notes that point. In keeping with many of the IAC&#39;s recent recommendations, a phasing down of assistance to help ensure a restructuring of industry was recommended. In this case, the decision has been made to reduce the rate of customs duty and to supplement the assistance with a bounty which will be phased out later. </para>
          <para>When the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> tabled the Customs Tariff Proposals No. 18 on 22 May 1979, he reduced the customs tariff from 55 per cent to 15 per cent, to take effect on the next day, that was, on 23 May 1979. This Bill covers the other side- the bounty side. The bounty will be payable at the rate of 45 per cent of the value added by the Australian manufacturers, but it will be phased out over five years, reducing at the rate of 1 0 per cent a year. It must be noted that the bounty will not be paid on equipment sold for export. It is of interest that Australia&#39;s largest injection-moulding equipment manufacturer, Johns Consolidated Ltd, is establishing a manufacturing base in Singapore which will presumably be making its new technology machines available for sale to the United States of America. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> However, it is expected that local manufacturers will be in a better position to develop their export markets as they become more competitive. </para>
          <para>Again, the cost of helping an industry is high. For the first year the cost will be $ 1.5m and the total for five years could be over $4m. This is a responsible Government, and it has again demonstrated that with its help to this small industry. I am glad that the Opposition is not opposing these Bills. They are good Bills put forward by a very responsible Government. I commend the Bills to the House. </para>

              <para>-I support this amendment for the very good reason that we on this side of the House want to see the book industry in Australia remain prosperous. We think that the provision detailed in the amendment will allow this to happen. If the present ceiling that the Government has imposed of 1,000 books is maintained, it will preclude the production of many books that are important to the community, such as party reports, society reports and all sorts of academic - </para>

              <para>-The Bounty (Books) Amendment Bill, like the previous Bill, seeks to achieve some degree of rationalisation within the Australian industry. The book bounty was first introduced on an interim basis on 1 June 1 969 in order to assist the manufacture of books in Australia by protecting the manufacturers from overseas competition. Initially, the bounty was set at 25 per cent of the cost of production. However, in 1973-74 it was raised to 33.3 per cent of the cost of production. Since its introduction payment of the bounty has risen - </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979 as they are related measures. Separate questions will of course be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that you permit the subject matter of the two Bills to be discussed in this debate. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-This is a debate on two Bills, the Customs Tariff Validation Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2). Let me say at the outset that the Opposition does not oppose either of these Bills. I mention with the indulgence of the House that the Opposition moved an amendment to the motion that the Bounty ( Books ) Amendment Bill be read a second time but we did not call for a division on that question because agreement has been reached that the time that has now been saved can be used to permit additional debate at the second reading stage of the Australian Federal Police Bill after debate is concluded on these Bills. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The purpose of the Customs Tariff Validation Bill is to provide for the validation until 31 December 1979 of duties collected under Customs Tariffproposals introduced into this Parliament during this session and not covered by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1979 which was debated in this House last week. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill which was passed on 3 1 May will consolidate Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 to 15 in the Customs Tariff Act. However, the Government has also introduced Customs Tariffproposals Nos. 16 and 17 on 3 May, No. 18 on 22 May and No. 19 on 5 June, which Proposals were not contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill that I referred to earlier. These Tariffproposals which were not contained in the earlier legislation relate to decisions by the Government on recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission on four separate items. The first is the IAC report on nuts, bolts and screws- Proposals No. 16. The second is the report on the Australian citrus industryProposals No. 1 7. The third is the report on injection moulding machines- Proposals No. 18. </para>
          <para class="block">The fourth one is the report on acetyl products, oxo alcohols, butyl alcohols and vices- Proposals No. 19. However, Customs duty collected on these Proposals, namely Proposals Nos. 1 6 to 19, are protected from legal challenge only until the end of this session of Parliament which we of the Opposition understand from the Government, although we have not been kept fully apprised, maybe some time tomorrow. Because the Government is unable to prepare another Customs Tariff Amendment Bill before the House adjourns for the winter recess, it is introducing this Customs Tariff Validation Bill to give legal authority to Customs duty collected up until 31 December of this year. This Bill therefore enables the Government to cover itself temporarily. </para>
          <para>Because validation Acts have a limited life, ultimately these changes will have to be incorporated in amendments to the Customs Tariff Act via a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. We presume that that Bill will be introduced in the Budget session. This Customs Tariff Validation Bill is therefore an element of the procedure which allows the Government to implement tariff variations without first having to legislate for these changes. That is, this Bill is part of the special provisions which enable quick alterations to the tariff. </para>
          <para>I remind the House that in the debate last week on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill I set out the procedures relating to the enactment of tariff proposals which have been in operation for some 15 years. I will not go through that list again but I draw attention to that debate in which I set out the procedures. The consequence of these procedures is that individual tariff changes are not given the same scrutiny through full debate in the House as is given to other legislative changes such as assistance through bounties. I will not repeat the points that I made in that debate. I merely want to draw attention to them because surely the most feasible way of achieving proper consideration of tariff changes is to have a parliamentary standing committee examine and report on each change as soon as possible after the Government gazettes the tariff proposals. Such a standing committee could meet during the parliamentary recess when proposals are made known and much of the work could be done then. This would allow the representatives of the people to exercise proper scrutiny over proposals which are of immense importance to job creation and many other features of our economic life. I would be glad if the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> at some stage, as he has now had notice for a week or two of this, would give an opinion on this suggestion of mine. 1 am not suggesting he is able to do so in this debate because he has had the courtesy to tell me he has been called away on other business and is unable to take part in the debate. Unless, as I hope, the Government falls in the meantime there will be other opportunities for him to talk in tariff debates in the Budget session and perhaps he could then give me an opinion on this suggestion. </para>
          <para>The procedures currently in operation may have been satisfactory during the 1960s and early 1 970s but they are not satisfactory today. With three-quarters of a million Australians unable to find a job- that is, the Australians who want one- and with enormous changes taking place in our trading patterns, and so on, each one of the IAC reports, as I have indicated earlier, and each one of the tariff proposals which flow from Government decisions about the IAC&#39;s advice is more sensitive in nature and more important to our economy than previously applied and requires close scrutiny. </para>
          <para>I turn to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1979. The purpose of this Bill is to increase the excise on naturally occurring liquid petroleum gas from $13 to $14 per kilolitre. The Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> announced this excise increase in a statement to the House on 2 May this year and the higher rate has been in effect since 3 May. At the time of this announcement my colleague, the shadow Minister for Minerals and Energy, did not oppose this move. Similarly, and for the same reasons, we do not oppose this Bill now before the House. We do not oppose the increase in excise, because it will offset windfall profits which accrue to the producers of liquid petroleum gas. </para>
          <para>Since the last increase in excise from $ 12.60 to $13 a kilolitre in December last year, the Prices Justification Tribunal has allowed the price of LPG sold on the domestic market to increase by $27 to $1 10 a tonne. This increase has brought the domestic price almost in line with export parity, which on 1 May was $ 1 1 6.40 a tonne. Such an increase in the domestic price was necessary to encourage usage of LPG in Australia. If there had been a margin between the cost of LPG and the cost of natural gas, needless to say, natural gas would have been used and the LPG would have been flared. At the time that the domestic price was $27 a tonne less than the export price, the Bass Strait producers of natural LPG had no economic incentive to sell on the Australian market. There was far greater scope for increased earnings by exporting their production. Bringing the domestic and export prices into line will  therefore create a more favourable economic climate for producers to develop a domestic market. This market for our own LPG is of great value to us. Our own energy should be used to the greatest extent possible in this country, particularly if the cost of that energy is marginally lower than the cost of energy available to our competitors. This should enable us to create jobs in this country. </para>
          <para>In the face of rapidly increasing prices for imported oil supplies, liquid petroleum gas is the only fuel now available to the transport sector which can be used to decrease Australia&#39;s consumption of motor spirit. In 1976 the Royal Commission on Petroleum recognised that LPG was the only available alternative to motor spirit in Australia before 1990. It is not that we are opposed to the export of Bass Strait LPG, but if steps can be taken to encourage domestic usage, then in terms of Australia&#39;s energy needs this is the more desirable course of action. </para>
          <para>The energy value of Australia&#39;s reserves of LPG is equivalent to about 50 per cent of the remaining recoverable reserves of crude oil in Bass Strait. Therefore, this resource can make a considerable contribution to Australia&#39;s liquid fuel requirements. Even with the $27 increase in price, LPG remains about 12.5c a litre cheaper than motor spirit. Although consumption per kilometre is greater than that for petrol, at this price differential a vehicle will save about $ 14 for every 1,000 kilometres travelled on LPG. A higher price was necessary to encourage producers to develop a domestic market, but even at this higher price LPG retains its competitive advantage over motor spirit. </para>
          <para>Although raising the price to export parity was desirable, this does not mean that producers should receive substantial windfall profits by way of the $27 a tonne price increase, as this increase occurred without any corresponding increase in production costs. For this reason the Opposition supports the increase in excise by $ 1 a kilolitre provided that returns to producers are still sufficient to encourage the penetration of the domestic liquid fuel market. They are the reasons why the Opposition supports this measure. I repeat that the Opposition support not only the Customs Tariff Validation Bill 1 979 but also the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill ( No. 2 ) 1 979. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-The Australian Federal Police Bill represents just one more about-face by this Government from the time when the coalition parties were in opposition. In 1975, the creation of the Australia Police by the Labor Government was vehemently opposed by the conservative opposition. In 1979, a conservative Government has decided that there are benefits in the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory Police Forces. For our part, we have never been in doubt about the advantages which amalgamation would bring, particularly in the area of operational efficiency. However, the creation of a two-component force, with a general police services component and a protective services component, is an aberration which is totally inconsistent with the purposes of amalgamation. Of course, this amalgamation would never have been brought about if it had not been for the tragic Hilton Hotel bombing. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark was appointed to inquire into the allocation of police resources in the Commonwealth area was an admission by the Government of the inadequacy of the security arrangements for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Sydney in February 1978. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Apart from the suggested amalgamation of the two existing forces, we do not find very much of value in the Mark report. Much of it is unhelpful rhetoric about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark&#39;s perception of the role in society of the police or commentary on the Australian Constitution. It needs to be made clear that the creation of a protective services component is not in any way related to counter-terrorism. Counter-terrorist activities will be undertaken by members of the general services component. The members of the protective services component will, in the main, be involved in static guard duty at Commonwealth places of low security risks. The creation of two components will create a two-class force and second class police officers. Under this Bill, members of the protective services component are not even to be called police officers. We are to have commissioned and non-commissioned police officers, and commissioned and noncommissioned protective services officers. Understandably, the Commonwealth Police Officers Association is very concerned about the creation of a two-component police force. We share its concern. This move will have a considerable detrimental effect on police morale and efficiency. We are totally opposed to this splitting of an amalgamated police force into two components and will vote against it both at the second reading stage and in Committee. Any comparison of the 1 975 Australia Police Bill and this Bill can lead only to the conclusion that police are getting a raw deal under this legislation. </para>
          <para>Firstly, let us take the question of the general terms and conditions under which the members of the Australian Federal Police will be employed. Under the 1 975 legislation, the terms and conditions of employment were determined by the Secretary to the Department of Police and Customs with the concurrence of the Public Service Board. The Public Service Arbitration Act was applied without exception to police officers. Under this legislation, the Minister alone will make these decisions. There are provisions requiring the Minister to consult with various people, but these are not worth a pinch of salt. Of course there are elaborate provisions enabling agreements to be made between the Minister and police associations, and for police associations to submit questions relating to terms and conditions to the Police Arbitral Tribunal. We do not object to these provisions, but we do object to the fact that any matter not covered by an Arbitral Tribunal determination will be decided by the Minister alone. </para>
          <para>Regulations made under clause 40(a) will have to be scrutinised carefully. The clause allows regulations to be made which will shackle the rights of the police to organise into associations which are in their best interests and which protect the future of their total membership. It also theoretically allows for the Government to refuse police the right to be heard by the Tribunal by not making regulations at all. We want an undertaking from the Government as to what regulations are intended to be made under clause 40 (a). I understand the framing of these regulations is well under way. I ask the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> to confirm or deny this. Those regulations already framed should be tabled in the Parliament during this debate. Clearly they are of relevance and should be taken into account. Access should be allowed to members who are going to participate in the debate on the Bill and eventually vote on this Bill. </para>
          <para>Next, there is the question of promotions. Under the 1975 legislation, provisions were spelt out by which appeals could be made to Promotions appeals boards by police officers who considered that they should have been promoted in preference to others. This legislation employs the same criteria to be used in the consideration of promotions, that is, efficiency and seniority. Seniority is relevant only if efficiency between officers is equal. However, there are no provisions in the Bill apart from clause 40 (c) governing the question of appeals to a promotion appeals board against decisions as to promotions. Clause 40 (c) is simply not satisfactory in that it simply provides that regulations may- I emphasise &#39;may&#39;- be made to provide for these matters. This sort of government by regulation is quite unacceptable. Regulations should be concerned with matters of detail, not matters of substance. We consider the question of promotions and associated appeals to be of great importance, and something which no proper legislation should omit. </para>
          <para>Clause 40(d) allows for early retirement at the age of 55 years to be introduced by regulation for the members of the Australian Federal Police. This is a totally dishonest provision. If the Government intends to bring in provisions allowing for management-initiated retirement along the lines of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill, which the police will no doubt oppose, then it should have the guts to legislate for it, instead of taking the coward &#39;s way out and doing it by regulation. We will be moving for the deletion of clause 40 (d) at the Committee stage. </para>
          <para>In clause 39 of the Bill, the Commissioner is given power to transfer to a lower rank or retire members of the Australian Federal Police on the grounds of overstaffing. There is no appeal from these decisions. We would propose to allow such matters to be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal. </para>
          <para class="block">There are other aspects about this matter that the Opposition feels are most unsatisfactory and go to the principles which we opposed in the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. If a perfectly fit officer is capable of carrying on in a position, then once staff ceilings are imposed, these officers can be disposed of. If it were in the legislation then it would at least have shown more courage than the introduction of it by regulation. </para>
          <para>The Bill is also unsatisfactory on the question of retirements. As far as the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner are concerned, there are no legislative provisions governing the resignation of people in these positions. Clause 37 does not apply either to the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner. Therefore, as there are no substantive provisions governing resignations of people from these provisions, we are left with the fall-back position of clause 17(4). It provides: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A person appointed under this section holds office on such terms and conditions (if any) in respect of matters not provided for by this Act as are determined by the Governor-General. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In every Act of Parliament creating positions of statutory office holders, provisions are made for the resignation of the people in those positions. Clearly, there must be some limitation of the right of a Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner to resign, so that undue disruption is not caused. However, everyone is entitled to resign, and simply to say that any question of resignation will be left to the Governor-General to decide is absolutely absurd. </para>
          <para>The procedure governing the retirement of ordinary members of the force is also unacceptable. Under clause 37, a member of the Australian Federal Police cannot resign unless he has given between three and four months&#39; notice. Whilst the Commissioner is given power to vary this period, it is a ridiculously long period in the first place. Whatever reasons may motivate a police officer to retire, it is not either in his interests or in the interests of the police force as a whole, to require him to wait around for between 3 and 4 months until his resignation takes effect. We will be moving in Committee that this period be reduced to one month, in line with the 1975 Bill. </para>
          <para>We believe that any legislation which does not establish procedures for complaints against the police is so totally defective as to be unacceptable. This question, with the related matter of ensuring that the rights of suspects and accused are not abused by police, is matched in importance only by the question of accountability of the police force to the Minister. The time to provide for these matters is when a force is being established. Entrenched practices die hard. Public confidence in any police force is vital to the success of that force. Accusations of police corruption or malpractice can and do arise. If the only mechanism to investigate these accusations is an internal investigation by the police themselves, the public simply cannot be expected to have confidence in the impartiality of such investigation. One must speak bluntly about this. I refer, the Government to what was done in the recent past in an investigation of one of the forces in this country. It seems to be a contradiction in fact when we read about the mechanisms involved in this Bill. </para>
          <para>As I have indicated, one must speak bluntly about this matter. Whilst the vast majority of policemen and policewomen are totally dedicated, hard working and underpaid, there are and perhaps always will be a minority unwilling to use properly the power given to them by society. Such people must be weeded out for the good of the force and for the good of the community. The Australian Capital Territory Police Force, by an administrative arrangement, established an internal affairs branch in January 1978. The Opposition commends it for establishing that branch, but that was as far as it was possible for the Australian Capital Territory police to go without legislation. In his second reading speech, the Minister said: </para>

            <para class="block">The Government anticipates being able to introduce legislation upon complaints procedure later in the year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Clearly the Government will take heed of the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods in this matter. One should bear in mind the extraordinary performance of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark in relation to the English Police Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark resigned prematurely in 1 977 in protest against this legislation. He had been responsible for the creation of the A- 10 unit to deal with complaints against the police. Whilst this was a significant advance on what had been the position before, the system allowed only for internal investigation and hence was full of pitfalls. As the report of the Law Reform Commission in 1 978 points out, there is evidence that in some cases A- 10 did not investigate complaints because police commanders sometimes too readily came to the defence of their subordinates. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark&#39;s petulant retirement meant that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods was in line for the job of commissioner. The fact that he was passed over gives rise to the suspicion that he shared <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert&#39;s</inline> views about the legislation. In an article on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 1 1 May, John Phillips, reports: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">One of the ideas he is considering is to start a section modelled on Scotland Yard&#39;s A- 10 branch&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is most unlikely that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> would make this statement unless he had the support of the Government. If internal investigations, as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods, have the Government&#39;s imprimatur it would appear that a major departure from what everyone expected to be Government policy is being heralded. On the other hand, if he did not have the approval of the Government to make this statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> should be carpeted. We make it clear that the setting up of an A- 10 style branch alone is not sufficient. We have had two reports from the Law Reform Commission on this matter- in May 1975 and in June 1978. In addition to the establishment of an A- 10 style branch, the Commission on both occasions has recommended two additional elements necessary to ensure independence and impartiality in the investigation and determination of complaints against police. </para>
          <para>The Law Reform Commission at page VIII of the summary to its 1978 report, spelt out the role of and the need for these additional instruments in the following terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Ombudsman as &#39;neutral territory&#39; for the receipt of complaints, as investigator of last resort and as public guardian to require certain public complaints to be scrutinised in a public forum. </para>
            <para>A police tribunal, whose President is a judge, which cun sit to hear charges brought based upon breaches by police of the discipline code. Criminal charges against police will continue to be dealt with in the criminal courts. Many publiccomplaints against police, whilst not involving criminal conduct, arc nevertheless serious matters that should be publicly dealt with. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">These proposals have been accepted by the Australian Capital Territory Police Force, although not, it would appear, by the Commonwealth Police. A rather watered-down version has been introduced into the Northern Territory. We are convinced that the Law Reform Commission&#39;s proposals are the best way of ensuring that a proper balance is struck between the need to ensure impartiality in the investigation and determination of complaints on the one hand, and the need to ensure that police morale and efficiency are maintained, on the other hand I shall make reference in the Committee stage to an addendum that should be considered in relation to the point I am making. </para>
          <para>It is outrageous that this legislation should be introduced without provision for complaints against police procedures being incorporated in the legislation. The current furore over the Narcotics Bureau demonstrates that there must be a guaranteed method of independent investigation and determination of complaints against police. </para>
          <para class="block">Indeed, in its 1978 report the Law Reform Commission stressed the need for such a system to apply also to the Narcotics Bureau. The Government has simply sat on that for a year and done nothing about it. The half-baked inquiry initiated by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> would never have been necessary if the Government had acted on the Law Reform Commission&#39;s report. Now we find the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> fobbing off the whole question in this legislation. Despite two reports from the Law Reform Commission, the Minister apparently believes that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods has the answers on this. The Opposition does not believe that he has. </para>
          <para>The other matter which came in for passing mention by the Minister in his second reading speech, was the question of the Criminal Investigation Bill. The Law Reform Commission reported on this matter in September 1975. A Bill was introduced into the Parliament in March 1977. However, that Bill lapsed and nothing further has been introduced. Now the Government, through the Minister, promises us another long delay. In a country without a Bill of Rights, legislation such as the Criminal Investigation Bill is essential. In the recently introduced Customs and telecommunications legislation, the Government decided simply to ignore the Law Reform Commission&#39;s proposals. Fortunately, some Government back benchers voted with the Opposition at a legislation committee to prevent the Government riding roughshod over civil liberties, and perhaps that was to its credit. We fear that the Criminal Investigation Bill, if and when it is ever introduced, will resemble the Law Reform Commission&#39;s report and draft Bill in name only. Much of the criticism of this legislation was the result of a failure to understand it, and what it did and did not do. The proposals provided for certain general rules by which the police were to abide. If they did not abide by these rules, then the evidence obtained in contravention of the rules would be excluded unless the police could justify the departure from the rules. The legislation did not provide for the automatic exclusion of evidence. </para>
          <para>I want to deal now with what is always a controversial subject in relation to any police forcethe question of ministerial responsibility and direction. This question, which in the State sphere is often bubbling not far from the surface, came to a head in South Australia in 1 977 in the events which lead to the sacking of the Police Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harold</inline> Salisbury. We have since been treated to a book on the subject by a member of the Adelaide establishment, Stewart </para>
          <para class="block">Cockburn. There are two separate questions involved in this. The first is the extent to which Ministers are accountable for the actions of the police. If they are accountable to Parliament, then they must be in a position to obtain full knowledge of those actions. The second question is the extent to which Ministers may direct the actions of the police force. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salisbury</inline> took the view that he was responsible to some vague, undefined higher authority called the Crown, not to elected politicians. That is a view which has no place in a democratic system. The upper echelons of the South Australian Police Force from 1971 had continuously misled the South Australian Government as to the nature and extent of Special Branch files. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salisbury,</inline> sworn to uphold the law, was acting in defiance of it </para>
          <para>In South Australia the position as to the relationship between the Police Commissioner and the Minister is absolutely clear as a result of the 1972 amendments to the Police Regulation Act. A Commissioner is subject to government direction, full stop. There is no qualification on this whatsoever. These amendments followed the 1970 moratorium demonstrations and the Bright report into police handling of those demonstrations. There is absolutely no doubt that in South Australia police commissioners must supply whatever information is required by the Minister. In our view, that position is absolutely correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark, in his report, made a fairly glib distinction between administrative accountability and operational autonomy. What appears to be the traditional British view on the relationship between Government and the police, of total independence from the elected government, is rejected in Australia. Yet we find <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods importing the British view into Australia. Our view is fortified by a comment that he made on 1 1 May. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Every chief of police in Britain is a very proud, very independent man. He maintains his independence by proclaiming it on every occasion. I think it is of the greatest importance that chiefs of police should have that independence. I would be very sorry if there were some idea that the development of the Federal Police Force in any way threatens that.&#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We, on this side of the House, believe that the total independence of the police force from the Government of the day and, in particular, the need to answer to, and inform that Government, is very dangerous. It cannot be accepted. We do not see Clause 13(2) in its present form as being acceptable. The meaning of directions as to &#39;general policy&#39; is vague and uncertain. We believe that a government should be able to give to a police commissioner such directions as to the performance of his duties as the government sees fit, provided there is ministerial accountability, the Minister is then responsible to this Parliament. As we have pointed out in relation to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and Customs legislation, there can be no real ministerial accountability unless there is disclosure. </para>
          <para>The South Australian legislation provides the model for this. It requires both the tabling and the gazettal of any instructions to the Commissioner. In that way, a government must answer for whatever it does. We would place no limits on the ability of a Minister to direct a police commissioner, provided that there was public disclosure. Of course, the Queensland Government has interfered with the police in order to ensure that it carries out government policy, as abhorrent as that policy is. However, there is no principle of freedom of information in Queensland, nor is there any procedure for the public ventilation of complaints against the police. </para>
          <para>Provided that there is an independent review of police actions, the question whether the actions of Ministers in giving police commisioners directions is proper or improper must be decided in the political arena. I stress that, on the South Australian model, which we will be seeking to have incorporated into this legislation, Ministers can give no directions unless they are prepared to answer for those directions publicly. In some siege situations where demands are being made for the release of hostages, surely Ministers must be able to direct commissioners. If hostages were killed, it would be too late for a Minister to say that he was unable to give directions to a commissioner as to how such a situation should be handled. That is absurd. </para>
          <para>People elect governments to make decisions. Governments must answer for those decisions. Our amendments will ensure that the power of governments to make decisions is not limited. They will ensure also that governments answer for those decisions by requiring immediate disclosure of directions to the police. We will also be moving in Committee that all provisions relating to the appointment, promotion and termination of commissioners,  deputy  commissioners and commissioned officers, should specify that it is the Governor-General in Council, not simply the Governor-General, who is to make these decisions. While we believe that it is a desirable practice always to write &#39;Governor-General in Council&#39;, rather than simply &#39;GovernorGeneral &#39;, into legislation, that is not the reason that we propose it on this occasion. It is rather to reinforce the view that the police are accountable to the elected government of the day, and not to some vague notion, as I have indicated before, of a higher authority called the Crown. </para>
          <para>In this legislation, for some reason best known to the Government, a very purposeful attempt has been made to try to establish the Salisbury relationship between the Police Commissioner and the Government of the day. The purpose for this legitimisation of the Salisbury attitude fascinates me. It appears to be the action of a conservative establishment framework adding another cross member to its superstructure to inhibit and to frustrate attempts at progress and change in our society. For those reasons it is totally unacceptable to the Opposition. Of course, I would be delighted for the Minister to illuminate the Parliament with his reason for the adoption of the Salisbury attitude. I hope that he will respond to that in his reply. </para>
          <para>I also make reference to clause 1 8, sub-clause (3) which I would compare with clause 17, subclause 4. I mention clause 20, sub-clause ( 1 ). I would like the Minister to respond not only on all of the aspects of the Bill to which I have made reference but also on the aspect of the legislation to which I will now refer. Why is it that an acting commissioner shall have not only terms and conditions but also his or her remuneration and allowances set by the Minister? That does not mean that an acting commissioner can receive more or less remuneration than a permanent occupant of the office. Why should not an acting Commissioner receive the same terms, conditions, remuneration and allowances due to a permanent commissioner with the exception of those terms and conditions normally peculiar to an acting occupant of the position? Why should not terms and conditions for the position of acting commissioner and acting  deputy  commissioner be set in the same way as those for the permanent occupants of the positions? </para>
          <para>Finally it must be said that we are disappointed at the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> has had a distinguished career in England, but his appointment reeks of the colonialism to which conservative governments in this country still cling. The appointment should have been from a State police force or the judiciary. Surely the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> is an insult to the dedication of the people serving in the police forces in this country? However, we are faced now with a fait accompli. We should ensure that never again is there an appointment as insulting to both Australian police and Australians generally, as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods. The Opposition cannot accept this Bill in its present form. For the reasons that I have mentioned, I move: </para>

The Government&#39;s main objective was to obtain the best person available for the establishment of the new Australian Federal Police Force. Whether that person came from Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada or any other part of the world, I believe the Government was duty bound to appoint the best person available. Contrary to the comments made by the honourable member for Melbourne who preceded me in this debate, I have not heard one word of complaint from a serving officer of the Commonwealth Police Force or the Australian Capital Territory Police Force with respect to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods.

              <para>- The honourable member makes an insulting comment. He might be interested to know- and if he want to behave like a ratbag, that is his right- that I have acted for a large number of police officers who quite happily trusted me. Indeed, I was honorary legal adviser to police associations when the honourable member was not even a member of this Parliament. The point I am making is a substantive one, that it does nothing to the credit of the honourable member for Melbourne that he can stand in this Parliament and say the sorts of things that he said a moment ago about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods. If the honourable member is challenging the integrity and ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods, I would be interested to hear the basis for his charges. What the honourable member has done is to scream &#39;colonialism&#39;. He has smeared a man who has been appointed to be the initial Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police Force. I think it is a matter of great regret that the speech which the honourable member delivered, which was not a bad speech, was completely marred by the fact that he behaved like a larrikin in his concluding remarks and attacked the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods. </para>

              <para>- I withdraw the remark and, if I may say so, I seek no withdrawal of the remarks that the honourable member for Melbourne made about me. I invite him particularly as there will be a Federal election next year- if he wants to help me retain my seat, to come to Hobart and campaign on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt.</inline> The purpose of the Bill is to establish the Australian Federal Police Force. I compliment the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay),</inline> who is at the table, and indeed the Government, on the manner in which they have gone about this task. It has been in marked contrast to the incredible performance of the Whitlam Government during its years in office when it endeavoured to establish in this country what in essence would have been a police state kind of police force. There are three very important differences between the way in which we went about this operation and the way in which the Whitlam Government went about the operation. Of course, the source of my information is basically the officers themselves. In the Whitlam Government&#39;s attempt to establish its own secret police force in this country, the operation was carried out in this way: Persons were detailed to go overseas to make arrangements, not in consultation with serving officers of the Commonwealth or the Australian Capital Territory Police forces. There was an attempt in the Whitlam Government&#39;s period of office to establish a political police force in this country. This Federal Police Force which we are establishing is, of its very nature, apolitical. I cannot understand the amendments moved by the honourable member for Melbourne because he has failed to note in the Bill that the police force that we are establishing cannot be politicised. </para>

          <para>He has failed to note that the Minister cannot give a direction to the Commissioner as to the operations of the Australian Federal Police Force unless he does two things: First, he has to confer with the Commissioner- in other words, he has to explain the direction to him- and secondly, he has to put the direction in writing for the record. That would not have been so under the Whitlam proposals. A telephone call would have been made in the middle of the night; no record would have been made; and a direction would have been given by one of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s political henchmen that the force was to take action in relation to a certain person. No record at all would have been kept. Not a skerrick of evidence would have been available upon which the truth could have been nailed home and upon which political intervention could have been established. </para>
          <para>One should examine the provisions of the Bill and consider how on earth they can be reconciled with the remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne. The power of the Minister to give a direction is restricted. He can do so, as I said, only after he has conferred with the Commissioner and if he is prepared to do so in writing. I ask: What Minister of this Government would be prepared to give a political direction in writing? What Minister would put his reputation on the line by putting in writing- as the Bill requires- the direction to the Commissioner? The honourable member for Melbourne obviously has not been talking recently to officers of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. I would have thought, if he had, that he would be well aware that following a number of meetings with the Minister and with back bench committees, practically every single objection to this legislation in fact was ironed out. Unlike the fruitless efforts of the honourable member for Melbourne - </para>

              <para>- The honourable member ought to talk to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pat</inline> Curtin, to give one example. He ought to talk to the people who spoke to the back bench committees. He ought to see the amendments that went through after the police officers had had discussions with the Minister and with the back bench committees. The fact of the matter is that the Opposition is talking about a situation which existed six months ago when it talks about a single component police force. It has been accepted that, providing the rights of the individual officers are protected, a double component police force will in fact be implemented. As I said, the honourable member is trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. There is nothing to support his contentions in relation to a single component police force. As at this moment, I suggest to the honourable member that he is completely without instructions, that he has not been receiving the right information or that he is simply making up what he is saying. It was accepted in the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark that the proposed Australian Federal Police should be a dual component police force, one section of it involving general police functions and the other involving police protective service functions. What is so extraordinary about that? Why is it that the honourable member for Melbourne contends that this is not an efficient way to run a police force? It seems that he knows very little about the operation of State police forces, which are not single component forces. There are three, four or five separate components. I shall draw some of these components to his attention. There is the uniform section and the non-uniform section, the racing and gaming section, the vice squad section- the honourable member would have heard of thatand the licensing branch. A number of separate sections - </para>

              <para>- At your request, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I will withdraw them. I will now talk about the drug section. We have the traffic section, the racing and gaming section, the licensing section and the vice squad. It is well known in the operations of police forces that these sections have to be put into separate components to obtain the best efficiency. A team of detectives who are experts in the subject of vice particularly look for, search out, apprehend, arrest and charge people involved in vice. Similarly, in relation to the traffic section, one would not put a man from the vice squad in charge of the traffic operations for the city of Melbourne. The fact that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is up and down on the question of whether it is a single or double component indicates that he does not have the faintest idea what the Bill is about. The Bill seeks to establish what will be an efficiently operating Australian Federal Police Force, bearing in mind the duties which have to be performed. I invite the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to turn to the Bill for, what I imagine will be the first time. He will find that the functions of the Australian Federal Police Force are set out in clause 8 as follows: </para>

To come back to the example which I gave before, one would not put a man from the vice squad in charge of the traffic section or a man who has been spending many years guarding an airport in charge of an inquiry into a proposed act of terrorism at one of the naval bases or at some other place. It seems to me that the honourable member has failed to appreciate the purpose of the Bill. </para>
          <para>He has his wires crossed because he believes that if somebody who is currently in one section is transferred into another section of the proposed new force, that person will be disadvantaged. I want to nail that one right on the head here and now. If ever there was a Bill which protected the rights of incumbent members of the Australian Federal Police Force it is this Bill. The honourable member talks as if he had not read the Bill when he talks about the creation of rights of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, discipline demotions, retirements and dismissals. I invite the honourable member to look at the Bill. There is a right of appeal in respect of every appointment other than that of commissioner. Because the honourable member - </para>

              <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting I was dealing with the role of the Minister in relation to the Australian Federal Police. I think it is important that the situation be clearly understood. The Minister is responsible as a Minister of the Crown but his right to intervene in the operations of the Australian Federal Police is very limited. He must confer with the Commissioner but only on what are described as the general functions ofthe Federal Police. If he considers it appropriate to give a direction it is essential under the legislation that he do this in writing. This, I think, is the great protection against the fears raised by the honourable member for Melbourne in that whatever the Minister does will be a matter of record. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I refer also to appeals and the protection of the rights of existing members of the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force. I refer again to clause 40 (c) of the Bill. It deals with the regulation making power with respect to the promotion of members, including the right of members to appeal against promotion of other members and the establishment of a promotion appeals board to hear and determine such appeals. I fully appreciate what the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> will say when he follows me in this debate. He will say that that provision ought to be in the Act itself. This is what the honourable member for Melbourne said. Normally, I would accept the argument that if there is a choice between something going in an Act and something going into regulations I would lean towards the Act. But there is a very good reason in this case why it ought to be done by regulation. Firstly, the current position is that the appeal rights in respect to existing members of the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force are laid down in regulations. Secondly, we are starting on a new concept. 1 believe it would unduly fetter the Executive Government, the Minister and the new Commissioner who is to set up the Force. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> The honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> in breach of an agreement, has cut short my time. I now have the opportunity to refer with approval only to clause 73(2). That is an amendment which was introduced as a result of the discussions between the Minister and the Government members committee. </para>

            <para>- Whilst the Opposition may support the concept of the Australian Federal Police Bill, it will oppose and resist a number of provisions. I approach this legislation with a deep sense of cynicism which is soundly based on this Government&#39;s political duplicity and outright hypocrisy. Throughout the period of office of the Labor Government I was a member of the Caucus legal and constitutional committee which was largely responsible for the structure of the Australia Police Bill which we introduced on 30 October 1975. That Bill was thoroughly discussed and examined. As I recall, we had lengthy discussions with the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. I honestly admit that the Bill was predictably unpopular, particularly amongst police officers. Any drasticchange was then, as it is now, a bitter pill to digest. Despite what the honourable member for </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> said, the Bill raised, as the present Bill does, the thorny question of restructuring, reclassification and the status of police officers. We ought to understand that that was the kernel of the problem. </para>
          <para>For the reasons that we enunciated at the time, I believe that the 1 975 legislation was sound and necessary, as the present Bill is, if the federal law enforcement agencies were to be both effective and efficient. But what do we find? The political duplicity and outright hypocrisy of the Government, both now and when it was in opposition, is utterly deplorable. I strongly contend tonight that the shortcomings that led to the introduction of the legislation in 1975 were thrown up following a comprehensive study into the Commonwealth Police and the Australian Capital Territory Police forces in 1973. The measures contained in the Bill we introduced in 1975 and those in the present legislation attest at least to our foresight and credibility. But they speak volumes for the Government&#39;s fork-tongued approach in this critically important area. In 1 975 the then Opposition opposed the Bill. It claimed it be a plank of socialist philosophy. As I recall only too vividly, in the run up to the 1975 elections two current Ministers attended a meeting of police officers. They gave an unequivocal and categoric undertaking that there would be no repetition of the 1 975 legislation and no amalgamation of the police forces. This reminds me of what an old Scotsman once said to me. He said: Never let politics bother you, Ralph. After all, the capacity for human intelligence to absorb garbage is unlimited&#39;. That happened in 1975. 1 wonder how gullible the police forces would be today. </para>
          <para>This legislation is another glaring testimony to the Government&#39;s duplicity, hypocrisy and total lack of credibility. The legislation was necessary in 1975. It is necessary now. It is my intention, as I said earlier, to compared the Opposition&#39;s policy and its constructive approach to this much needed reform with the Government&#39;s restrictive and negative approach. Had this Government implemented the important provisions in the Bill that we as a government introduced into this House in 1975 and had the amalgamation of the police forces taken place in 1975, it would undoubtedly have been of far greater benefit to both the Australian Police itself but more importantly and beyond question, to the police officers. It is my personal view- I sat on the committee then, as I do now- that our legislation would have made the force more effective and efficient. </para>
          <para>This piece of legislation falls far short of the comprehensive and necessary legislation needed if this arm of the law enforcement agency is to have the checks and balances so critically important, if it is to achieve the aims and the ends that the community expects and deserves, and that goes for both the officers and the community. I say advisedly, and I have known this for the last 20 years, that regrettably, throughout the length and breadth of this country, law enforcement officers, whether they be police or law retention officers- we call them prison officers, or officers of what is known as correctional services- are too often used as scapegoats by politicians, political parties, governments both federal and State, and, I hate to say, on a number of occasions Opposition parties. Police officers deserve a lot better than they get. Equally regrettably, all too often- I know this after being involved with correctional services in South Australia for 20 years- when Cabinet, whether it be State or Federal, starts to carve up the budget allocations for police or prison services, these services suffer cuts in government expenditure. They are sacrificed. They are at the end of the rung. Nonetheless, the public still demands a high standard of effectiveness and efficiency. </para>
          <para>Let me take up some of the time of the House to canvass some of the provisions we envisaged in 1 975 and contrast them with the current provisions of this Bill. The Bill in 1 975 provided for the amalgamation of the Commonwealth Police Force, the police forces of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and certain sections of the Department of Customs into a single law enforcement agency to be called Australia Police. This move followed a comprehensive study carried out in 1973. It revealed that the operations of existing agencies contained a number of shortcomings. These included: A lack of co-ordination of enforcement effort in areas of common interests; duplication of effort by officers from the various agencies; wastefulness and inefficiency arising from the maintenance of separate information and intelligence systems; varying standards of training and recruitment for the various agencies; lack of highly trained capacity to deal with white collar crimethat area badly needs an overhaul, but there is nothing in this Bill to update that capacity- the need to refer the investigation of some federal offences to State police agencies; wastefulness deriving from the maintenance of separate pools of equipment and the inability to justify separate use of computer facilities. Based on the knowledge gained from studies that had been undertaken, including a close examination of overseas law enforcement agencies, it became obvious in 1975 as it is obvious now that the wastefulness and inefficiencies deriving from the multiplicity of federal law enforcement agencies in the country could best be overcome by integration of these agencies. The then Opposition, the present Government, bitterly opposed such a socialist proposition, but it is now the proposition of a Tory government. It is marvellous! </para>
          <para>There was and still is scope for specialised training, including that necessary to provide a higher level of expertise to detect white collar crime. One can understand why that is one arm of the police force that the Government will not update to give any semblance of expertise. One can appreciate that. The national and international training courses at present provided for State and overseas police will be expanded. We envisaged that in 1975. On the basis of existing Customs facilities, computer services currently under development include police computer systems with instant access to data by means of visual display units located throughout Australia. We wanted that too in 1975. At the moment that matter is under discussion. These services, whether maintained manually or by computer, are a necessary part of any police force and are being developed at a national level within the Australia Police. Then there is the possibility of developing a national information unit. The unit will have links with Interpol and other international agencies. This Government opposed that concept in 1975. On 16 May 1975 the Law Reform Commission reported on the question of the appropriate legislative means of safeguarding individual rights and liberties in relation to the law enforcement process of the Australia Police. So rights and liberties ought to be safeguarded, but such a provision is not contained in the legislation. </para>
          <para>The Law Reform Commission brought down two reports. The first report was tabled in the House on 2 September 1975 and related to a system to investigate complaints against members of Australia Police. The report is a seminal document in the development of police integrity and public confidence in the police of Australia. The Commission&#39;s second report is devoted to the difficult issue of the proper balance between police powers, which respect the right of the individual, on the one hand, and the community&#39;s need for practical and effective law enforcement on the other. Nothing in this legislation buttresses that and it is critically needed. Part I of the Bill as we envisaged it contained the usual formal provisions and, in addition, preserved existing police powers in federal laws and territorial ordinances. We provided for that in our Bill in 1975. It also provided an interim measure pending the introduction of legislation arising out of the Government&#39;s consideration of the second report of the Law Reform Commission. The Government has not yet responded to that report. </para>
          <para>Part IV related to appointments and terms and conditions of service, including such matters as promotion, resignation and retirement. It also provided for the making of regulations in relation to police discipline, which has not been provided for in this Bill. Parts V and VI would have established the system of dealing with complaints against police, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission. I should have thought that the police would have wanted that themselves. Central features of these parts are the provision of an oversighting role for the Ombudsman; the establishment of an internal discipline section responsible to the Chief Commissioner to investigate complaints and the creation of an Australian Police Tribunal. </para>
          <para>Part VII was based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to torts by police officers. It provided for Australia to assume vicarious liability for the actions of an officer taken in the course of his duty. So he ought to be protected. Where are the provisions in this Bill that adequately protect him? It also provided that Australia may take proceedings to recover contributions from the police officer, and so it ought to. Part VIII provided for transitional provisions in relation to the appointment of and preservation of rights of police officers automatically transferred to the Australia Police. </para>
          <para>The other thing which we envisaged and which I must confess was overlooked by many police officers, but which was important, was the establishment of a national police college at Bathurst in New South Wales. Courses were designed to cater for all levels of police recruitment and training appropriate to the high levels of management. Following the Labor Government defeat in 1975, the college was not established, yet the recommendation for its establishment is contained in the Mark report. The establishment of that college was another promise given by the then Opposition in 1975, and it is another broken promise of this Government. It is part of another set of lies. </para>
          <para>Before I conclude my remarks, I wish to make passing reference to a number of matters contained in the legislation that are of concern to police officers. Police officers are concerned, as well they might be, with the provisions contained in clauses 38 and 39. Clause 38 deals with the retirement of members by reason of mental or physical infirmity. It appears to us that the Commissioner has sole discretion as to whether or not he considers a person unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging his duties. The clause confers on the Commissioner certain options. I would like the reflections of the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> on that. Whilst there may be a benefit to the member to be retired from the police force before obtaining the age of 60 years, under the proposed legislation, the Commissioner would have the sole discretion of transferring that person to a rank lower than the one he presently holds or he may transfer him to another position in the same rank. One notes that there is no provision for a member to appeal against such a decision by the Commissioner. Therefore, the Opposition feels that it would be in the best interests of all members for an appeal provision to be contained in the Act rather than the regulations. I might say that I have an utterly cynical regard for provisions which protect members of an association or a union being placed in regulations. I have had 20 years&#39; experience with it, and I believe that the argument put forward for including clause 38 in the Bill simply was that the same provision already exists in the Australian Capital Territory Police Ordinance 1927 as amended. In my view, it is an archaic provision and one which the force could well do without. There is no need for it. </para>
          <para>Clause 39 of the Bill deals with retrenchment. We on this side of the House, and certainly police officers, I would think, take the firm view that this clause ought to be deleted in its totality. Again, the Commissioner has the sole discretion as to whether or not a member may be retrenched. It appears that no restrictions are placed on the Commissioner as to when or how he may embark upon such a course without consultation. There is also no provision for a member to appeal against the decision of the Commissioner, although a member may have recourse in some other industrial arena. I would like that situation explained, and we will see whether we can drag out an explanation during the Committee stage because it is important. Police officers and the Commonwealth Police Officers Association, feel very strongly that this clause ought to be deleted from the proposed legislation. </para>
          <para>I come back to the point that the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> raised. The clause should be deleted from the proposed legislation but, failing that, a protection clause in an appeal provision should be included in the Act rather than in the regulations. I agree with the honourable member for Denison. I ask the Minister for Administrative Services to explain why a provision should not be included in the Act. It is important in that if there is to be harmony in the force such a provision ought to be inserted in the Act, not in the regulations. I confess that I intend to give the Minister a rough time in the Committee stage on that clause. The Government&#39;s argument for including clause 39 in the Bill was that it is already contained within the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Police Ordinance. I point out that although this sort of provision exists in respect of Australian Capital Territory police, the administration has never sought to enforce it. It is archaic, outdated, and it ought to be deleted. </para>
          <para>There is another area of the proposed legislation that I believe causes police officers less concern, and I refer to clause 37, which deals with the resignation of members. It is noted that three months notice must be given before a member may resign unless the Commissioner otherwise allows. We feel that three months is far too long and suggest that a period of 28 days is more in line with the provisions that at present exist in police forces throughout Australia. I would like some clarification of this point. Is the Government still standing fast on that provision or has it in fact reached agreement with the Police Officers Association and conceded that the period will be reduced to 28 days? </para>
          <para>I want to conclude on this simple note. I thought that the legislation proposed in 1975 was a logical, rational and effective way to amalgamate the police forces so as to give the community the efficiency and effectiveness it deserved, but that proposal was hypocritically opposed. It is a disgrace that in 1975 this Government when in Opposition was able to dupe, if you like, the police forces on the specious ground that once it got into office it would not amalgamate those forces. It is just another nail in this Government&#39;s coffin and an example of its utter lack of credibility. It is no credit at all to the Government or to many members in the police forces, who were gullible enough to fall for this promise. I support the concept of the legislation because I thought the amalgamation was warranted in 1975 and I think it is warranted in 1979. But I make this plea to the Minister: If the Government wants an efficient and effective police force it should ensure that the provisions for the welfare of the members in respect of promotions, appeals and transfers, whether they are written into the Act or made by way of regulations, safeguard the rights of the members. If that is done, the Government will have a much happier police force. This Bill will not give them that protection. </para>

            <para>-The Australian Federal Police Bill now before the House is designed to establish the Australian Federal Police. That force is to be given certain functions, and they are specified in clause 8 of the Bill. They include the provision of police services in relation to the Australian Capital Territory, the provision of police services in relation to laws of the Commonwealth and the property of the Commonwealth, the safeguarding of Commonwealth interests, and anything incidental or conducive to the performance of the foregoing functions. Under this legislation the Parliament is authorising the Crown, the Executive that governs this country, to establish a force to fulfil those functions. In the past when Parliament authorised the establishment of a department, authorised the establishment of an institution such as a police force, it set out the functions and conferred the powers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have a very deep concern that, not only in relation to this Bill but also in relation to other pieces of legislation that have passed through this chamber over recent decades, the Parliament has conferred upon the Executive very wide powers, powers that, except in one limited sense to which I will refer to in a moment, are beyond the control of this Parliament. Because they are beyond the control of this Parliament, we have conferred upon the Executive and upon the institutions that this Parliament has authorised the Executive to establish the capacity to abuse the powers that are so conferred. I recognise the need for a police force in the sense of law enforcement in the Territories of the Commonwealth and in regard to the enforcement of the Commonwealth laws throughout Australia. I want the police force to have the widest possible powers to ensure that it can discharge the duties that this Parliament has in mind for it. But I am concerned that we should ensure that there are adequate safeguards, guidelines, parameters within which that force can operate- parameters that are not to limit it in the discharge of its duties, but parameters that are to limit its capacity, the capacity of any individual member of the force, the capacity of its Commissioner, the capacity of its ministerial head, to abuse the powers in a way which could erode the authority of a democratically elected Parliament and destroy the possibility of that Parliament being democratically elected again in the future. </para>
          <para>I have chosen to raise this matter in this debate, but I reaffirm the view that my concern relates to many of the institutions to which this Parliament gives authority. There is a growing concern within the community among informed people who understand how the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy, based on the principle of ministerial responsibility, is developing. The principle of ministerial responsibility to parliament is seen by many as becoming increasingly ineffectual. I think it is necessary for us to look at some of the historic origins of this House. How is it that we are being asked tonight to vote on a piece of legislation that gives to the Executive a power to govern this country in terms of the running of its police force? It was decided long ago in the Case of Proclamations in 1611 that the King, who was the Executive then, could exercise legislative authority only through Parliament. In part the decision was in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The gist of the Case of Proclamations is that the King is the Executive and his business the enforcement of the existing law; his prerogative is under the law and Parliament alone can alter the law which the King is to administer. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Bill of Rights in 1689 and the Act of Settlement in 1701 embodied in legal terms the settlement of constitutional government between Parliament and the Executive following the 1688 Revolution. These statutes mark a victory for Parliament over the Executive, over the King. From that time on, in place of government by royal prerogative government was to be by and through Parliament. Since that time, Parliament has given to the Executive, the King, the Crown, increasing authority to govern and has handed over in many areas what I regard as a blank cheque. It has not put within the legislation in which it authorises the setting up of institutions sufficient restrictions to prevent the abuse of power. </para>
          <para>I believe that Parliament over the next decade will need increasingly to ensure that, in the ultimate, it is Parliament that protects the rights of individuals and the very democracy which brings us as elected representatives of the people to this chamber. This legislation, therefore, is a case where we can examine the manner in which ministerial responsibility operates. In the view of many, the meaning of the term &#39;responsibility&#39; has come to be interpreted very narrowly. Ministers, though accountable to Parliament for any of their faults and shortcomings insofar as they are obliged to answer to Parliament with respect to such matters are not themselves held culpable and, therefore, bound to resign or be subjected to dismissal unless the action which stands condemned was theirs. </para>
          <para>There are two forms of ministerial responsibility- the one for which the Minister is directly legally responsible and the other which is the operation of the convention where the Minister is responsible to this House to account for his own actions and the actions of his own Department. The Minister&#39;s responsibility is a responsibility to administer the law for the Australian Constitution states in clause 6 1 : </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The powers and duties of the Commonwealth Executive Government relate to the execution and maintenance of the consultation and the execution and maintenance of the laws of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If a Minister or a government comes to this House and asks that we authorise the establishment of an Australian federal police, this Parliament is entitled to lay down the laws under which that force is to operate. In one major and significant respect, this Parliament is not sufficiently defining the manner in which it believes the Australian federal police should operate, that is, the manner in which there is a lack insofar as the disclosure of information is concerned. </para>
          <para>I spoke earlier in this session on the Customs Amendment Bill and drew attention to this very problem that Parliament is authorising a federal police force that is to have responsibility to fulfil the functions that I outlined, to have authority to enter into agreement and to have computer and other information banks, but we impose upon the members of that force no legal prohibition with regard to the use of that information. We leave it to the general law and to the Crimes Act. Yet when we look at the legislation that governs the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation we say that it:  shall be an offence for officers of that Force to disclose information except in circumstances defined by Parliament. </para>
          <para class="block">Without in any way inhibiting the discharge of its proper functions the Australian federal police should have within its legislation a restriction that indicates the manner in which the information can be used. Insofar as it is used beyond the specified manner, it should be an offence for police officers to disclose that information. To achieve this, I would have liked to have moved an amendment. I have discussed this amendment with the Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay).</inline> It is an amendment somewhat similar to an amendment that I moved to an earlier Bill. It is designed to incorporate in this legislation guidelines similar to those contained in the ASIO legislation. It is designed to include in this legislation limitations about the supply of information similar to those imposed upon the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> with regard to the information gathered by the Commissioner of Taxation. I cannot understand why we do not specify these restrictions within this legislation. The time is coming for this Parliament to look at the Crimes Act and to review the legislation that governs the circumstances in which officers of Commonwealth Government departments, and members of Commonwealth Government instrumentalities are required by law to keep confidential information that is gathered by them. There is no doubt that a police force must gather a huge amount of information about hundreds and thousands of law-abiding citizens as it goes about its job of finding those who are the law breakers. None of us who believe and endeavour to comply with the laws of the land should be concerned that our names may happen to come on to information collected by police forces, security organisations and customs authorities because, of necessity, we cannot tell when we park our car in a particular street, when we walk down a particular street or go to a particular meeting whether we are in an area or a place that the law enforcement authorities have under surveillance because they suspect that someone else may be there. The innocent should not be condemned by their association. They should only be convicted if the law enforcing authorities believe that they have sufficient information to lay a charge and bring that charge before the courts of the land. To show how diverse are the provisions that govern the disclosure of information, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a list of the provisions of Commonwealth legislation which restrict the access to information. </para>

              <para>- When honourable members have an opportunity to read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> they will see the large number of Acts of this Parliament that seek to restrict access to information. Honourable members will agree there is a need for a comprehensive piece of legislation that governs all the circumstances in which information is to be kept confidential and to ensure that innocent citizens are not in any way prejudiced by the misuse of information collected. It is true to say that police forces over the years have gathered information. They have had to. It is proper that they should. But one thing that now occurs that did not previously occur is that that information can be recalled at the push of a button. It is that capacity to retrieve information, information that is irrelevant but possibly compromising of an innocent citizen, that leaves this Parliament in a position where it  does not adequately discharge its responsibilities if it confers upon law enforcing authorities and other instrumentalities the power to gather information but in no way restricts the capacity of those who gather it to abuse the trust that is placed in them by this Parliament. </para>

          <para>Having spoken in general terms, I want to direct the attention of the House to what I regard as a quite significant gap in this legislation. It is quite clear that it is intended that the Australian Federal Police shall have a special branch. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark recommended that it should have such a branch. He noted that the term &#39;special branch&#39; does provoke in the minds of many an emotional and unthinking response. I believe the Australian Federal Police Force should have a special branch. A law enforcing authority of the Commonwealth like the law enforcing authorities of the States has a critical role to play in the general security of this nation and should gather and pass on information that relates to the nation&#39;s security. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Hope also made it quite clear that State police special branches should remain an integral part of the overall intelligence system. If it is to be the case that the Australian Federal Police are to have a special branch, why is it that we impose upon Australian Security Intelligence Organisation officers a strict code of behaviour and make it an offence for them to disclose information about any person who is on their files. A person who in no way is a security risk and about whom there is no concern from a security point of view could find that, because of association, his name may quite properly have found its way on to a security file. What begins as irrelevant information can, in due course of time, for some people become quite relevant information in a security context. In like manner, in the case of an ordinary police file irrelevant information about an individual may, in the course of time, when the jigsaw is pieced together by the gathering of further information, become quite relevant. But, we say that it is an offence for an ASIO officer to disclose information unless he does so in a specified way on the authority of the DirectorGeneral of ASIO. Yet we put no such restriction on the disclosure of information by members of the Australian Federal Police acting in their role as general police officers or in their role working for the special branch of the Australian Federal Police. I am concerned that there is this gap and believe that the sort of amendments that I have discussed with the Minister would have overcome the problem. The Minister has indicated that he proposes to take a certain course of action. Included in that course of action is the reference- in the context of the reference by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fife)</inline> to the Law Reform Commission of this whole question- of the way in which information gathered by Commonwealth Government instrumentalities can be used contrary to the intentions of this Parliament and in a manner which is designed to abuse free citizens about whom the police force, either in a security sense or a general police sense, has no concern. Therefore, I urge the Minister to take seriously this question of law reform. </para>

            <para>- I am very happy to participate in this debate because it is a subject to which I have been very close for some years. I believe that I had some influence on the Whitlam Labor Government when it endeavoured to merge the two police forces, the Australian Capital Territory Police Force and the Commonwealth Police. It was common knowledge to those of us who took an interest in police forces around Australia and overseas that there was a grievous anomaly existing here in Canberra. It came to my knowledge many years ago that the Australian Capital Territory Police were operating their radio cars on a different wave length from that of the Commonwealth Police. This meant virtually that a description of an evil-doer could come over the Australian Capital Territory Police radio and the Commonwealth Police would not get the information, lt seemed a grievous anomaly. Therefore, a diligent Commonwealth Police officer could drive past a person wanted for a serious crime because he did not have the information. On that fact alone, I endeavoured to influence my Party to adopt the view that the two police forces should be combined. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In those days the body resisting the amalgamation was the Australian Capital Territory Police Force. There was little or no resistance from the Commonwealth Police. Having some knowledge of police forces and having served in the New South Wales Police Force for 24&#39;/2 years, I believe that the top echelon of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force could see slipping through their fingers the possibility of achieving the rank that they were striving to attain before retirement in order to make their pension more healthy. This would be in jeopardy if the two police forces combined. Of course, this attitude infiltrated down the line to the lowest constable who would have raised his voice with his little coterie of friends to suggest that the two police forces should not be merged. </para>
          <para>I cannot understand really- and I try to be gentle in this submission- the philosophy of my political opponents who in 1975 used their numbers in the Senate to resist the amalgamation which would bring the two police forces together. I believe it was a proposal which, in the interests of the community, was long overdue. Government members used their numbers in the Senate to prevent this amalgamation of the two police forces in 1975. The only excuse that these honourable members have now for amalgamating them, as the Labor Party wanted to do, is that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark has made a recommendation that there should be one police force in Canberra. I think that is a frivolous and weak argument. I believe that honourable members opposite did the wrong thing by society in general, particularly the citizens of Canberra, and the members of both police forces in not allowing the amalgamation which the Whitlam Government tried to bring about in 1975. </para>

The honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes)</inline> and the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> have mentioned certain amendments which the Opposition would like to see made to this Bill with which I agree. There have been some grievous injustices imposed upon members of the police forces by their own administrative bodies.

              <para>- You are making fun of a serious matter, John. It does not become you. I wish that the Minister knew about this case in Canberra which still upsets me when I call it to mind. At the time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> was the Minister for the Interior. I believe that he had the sole power of dismissal of members of the Commonwealth Police Force. This case involved a very dedicated police officer, a man who would have been an attribute to any police force in the world. He was a qualified air pilot and motor engineer. He had three commendations on his police record for outstanding police work. He had a slight verbal altercation of a minor nature with a senior publicservant who reported him. The policeman&#39;s superior officer said to him, &#39;You have to resign or you will be dismissed and lose your superannuation&#39;. This conversation took place after the Minister had been consulted about dismissing him. The Minister said, &#39;No, I do not want to dismiss him. Get him to resign&#39;. Then the pressure was applied to this police officer. In an emotional state, he resigned and lost his superannuation and furlough pay and forwent the right of appeal. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I know of other cases but time will not permit me to raise them. The case I have mentioned involved grievous injustice. Many members of the Australian Labor Party believe that an injustice done to one is an injustice done to all. I do not believe that the Minister at the table would have acted in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> acted on that occasion. </para>
          <para>I recall another case in Liverpool, New South Wales, in which a dedicated police officer with over 20 years service had served the community diligently. One evening at 5.30, his finishing time, a lady was seen to get into his motor car. They then drove away. This happened after he had knocked off work. He was questioned about the identity of the woman. He said to his superior officer: &#39;Pardon me, I was off duty. That woman is a friend of my family and she is known to my wife&#39;. He was dismissed for insubordination. He then appealed to the appeal tribunal. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Perrignon had been appointed  chairman  of the appeal tribunal to tighten up police discipline. Both he and the police commissioner&#39;s representative upheld the police commissioner&#39;s action. </para>
          <para>It was a grievous injustice. The policeman&#39;s wife said at the hearing of the appeal tribunal that she knew the woman. She said, &#39;She visits our home. She is a friend of the family&#39;. But neither she nor her husband would disclose the identity of the woman. This happened when he was off duty. Such action should not be permitted by people in politics or by any administrative officer. I believe that this police force could become the show piece of the southern hemisphere if the members of this House take the interest in it that they should. </para>
          <para>Crime is reaching an all-time high. Many of our criminals are going overseas. Members of the Australian Federal Police could well get trips overseas to extradite evil doers back to Australia. This would apply particularly to members of the Australian Capital Territory Police force when the amalgamation takes place. Such trips would expand the knowledge of the police officers concerned. It would also be an opportunity not otherwise available to them. Extradition of Australian criminals from overseas will become more and more common place. I wish that I was staying in the Parliament long enough to see the progress of the marrying of these police forces. I am not happy about the appointment of a commissioner from overseas. I do not doubt his ability but I know many men serving in the police forces of the States and the Commonwealth- Australian nationals- who could do just as good a job. </para>
          <para>It is a pity that we have had to go overseas and persuade <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods to come to Australia to administer the new police force. I believe this is a grievous insult to the present Commonwealth Police Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Davis,</inline> who was born and raised in the electorate of Hunter. He has been a dedicated, skilled, loyal commissioner to the government of the day irrespective of its political colour. I believe that he would have liked to have been head of the Commonwealth police force following the amalgamation and to finish his career in that position. I think it is a tragedy that he was not given this honour. During his long term as Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police at no time has he made any statements that would embarrass any Minister or any member of the government. </para>
          <para>At this stage, I think that it is appropriate to refer to his great humane qualities. When Labor was in government, I recall the AttorneyGeneral sending for me because representations were made to him in Canberra about certain disciplinary action that was being taken against a Commonwealth Police officer. This officer had an affair with another policeman&#39;s wife. Commissioner Davis in his humaneness and with the wonderful manner that he has, took disciplinary action which I agreed should have been taken. He transferred the offending or erring police officer to Brisbane. Political representations were made to have the police officer returned to Canberra. The Attorney-General asked my opinion. I said that I thought it was a very humane recommendation. The officer had not been demoted and I thought that he should be rejoicing in the fact that he had not lost rank or been dismissed. </para>
          <para>In the New South Wales Police Force, for example, many police officers have been dismissed for lesser misdemeanours than the one committed by this police officer. In reaching his judgment Commissioner Davis took into account the cost to the taxpayers of training a police officer to the required degree of efficiency. He believed that for a minor act of indiscretion a police officer should not be lost to the community. However, in some police forces in the world more advanced steps are being taken than those being taken in Australia. We know that from time to time when the Press has no one else to condemn it turns its poison pen and its sadistic attitudes to a law enforcement body which is a disciplined body that can seldom answer back. In France the police force has a public relations officer. In Great Britain there is talk about appointing a police public relations officer. I refer to a book called <inline font-style="italic">The Police</inline> written by Ben Whitaker which paints a very good picture of police forces. In his book he says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The police in other forces are trying different solutions to the same problem. In Paris, a magazine called <inline font-style="italic">Liaison</inline> has been started with the purpose of explaining to the public what are the problems of the police. The criminologist who was appointed head of the Munich force in 1963 has called in a psychiatrist to teach his men better relations with the public; the Japanese police take an annual survey of publicopinions concerning them. In November 1963 the Chief Constable of Brighton suggested that his force should appoint a public-relations police officer whose job would be to make everybody feel that the police were giving them a fair deal. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That should take place in Australia. I hope that the Minister will take steps to implement some of the advanced ideas which are being implemented in other countries. I want to end on this theme. I have been riled by the attitude of the police at times but I know the great good they do in the community. I conclude my speech with a quote from this book concerning police. It states: </para>

The public use the police as a scapegoat for its neurotic attitude towards crime. Janus-like, we have always turned two faces towards a policeman. We expect him to be human and yet inhuman. We employ him to administer the law, and yet ask him to waive it. We resent him when he enforces a law in our own case, yet demand his dismissal when he does not elsewhere. We offer him bribes, yet denounce his corruption. We expect him to be a member of society, yet not to share its values. We admire violence, even against society itself, but condemn force by the police on our behalf. We tell the police that they are entitled to information from the public, yet we ostracize informers. We ask for crime to be eradicated, but only by the use of &#39;sporting&#39; methods. </para>

            <para>-In order to enable the Australian Federal Police Bill to be dealt with this evening I shall be as brief as I can. First of all let me echo the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> and also the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Jacobi) about the hypocrisy of the present governmental action. I think it should be remembered that a similar amalgamation attempted by the Labor Government was ruthlessly resisted by the then Opposition in what, in many ways, was an example of irresponsible opposition. I hope that we, in criticising this Bill, are acting as a responsible Opposition. The first thing we want to say is that we do not oppose the concept of a federal police force, though we are critical of some of the detailed proposals presented in this Bill. In contrast with what happened in 1974-75, this is an example of a responsible approach to a major issue facing this country. </para>
          <para>The key proposal in this Bill is the amalgamation of the present Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force into a unified federal police force embracing the present powers and duties of the existing forces, but itself internally divided into two components- firstly, a general police function component; and secondly, a police protective services function component. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark recommended this amalgamation as the best option available in order to achieve three objectives- firstly, to overcome jurisdictional boundaries between police forces; secondly, to provide for more effective and economical coordination of federal police resources; and thirdly, to ensure more effective co-operation with the States in law enforcement matters. </para>
          <para>When that is said- and of course it was said in the second reading speech by the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)-</inline> it is important to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> thought this particular amalgamation merely the best option available. He displayed no particular enthusiasm for it, and was not overly keen on this amalgamation, but given the situation, this was the best choice available to him. Indeed one can say that he displayed no great enthusiasm for the outmoded federal system under which we in this country live and within which his recommendations for a federal police force had to be framed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At the best, I am being asked to cobble an ill-fitting 19th century boot. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let me say that I echo <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark on his views of the constitutional framework within which he has to work. It is clearly an inappropriate constitutional framework for this country in the late 20th century. Indeed, I share his ideal about police organisation in this country. He wrote:  lt would in my view be perfectly possible to establish a police system for the whole of Australia, comprising operationally autonomous police forces and a national investigative agency democratically controlled in equal partnership, by central and State governments and the police themselves, not a jot less sensitive to the need to preserve civil liberty or the differing requirements of widely separated States but able to achieve uniformity of standards in manpower, training, leadership, specialist services, operational techniques, interchange and improved accountability, all at present unlikely of attainment. </para>
          <para class="block">That is an ideal which he placed before us. It is an ideal I share. Indeed, the possibilities of national achievement in the field of the police, and in many other fields, are being undermined in the late 20th century by an archaic Federal constitution. </para>
          <para>Let me turn to the range of functions which this police force should perform. One of the problems we have with the Bill is that despite the rather bland assurances of the Minister, and the rather vague provisions of clause 9, the Bill will do little to dampen the rivalry, the jealously, even the feuding, that marks the present relationship between Commonwealth and State police. One has only to read the papers of last week to recognise the types of feuds that have surfaced. Contrary to the Minister&#39;s assertion, this Bill will not &#39;provide a basis for many of the current problems experienced between law enforcement authorities within Australia to be overcome or reduced &#39;. </para>
          <para>Let me suggest some of the specific fields in which this Bill does not contribute towards overcoming the kinds of clashes and conflicts that exist to the detriment of police services in this country. First of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark made a number of proposals for secondments between the State police forces and the Federal police forces, but there is no evidence in this Bill as to what action the Government will take regarding these secondment proposals, which were designed to make the relationships between State and Commonwealth police forces more effective and more co-operative. Secondly, the Bill bypasses one of the central difficulties and that is the jurisdiction at airports. Nowhere in the Bill do we find any clarification of one of the central conflict problems that Commonwealth and State police find in Australia- a point noted in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark&#39;s own proposals. In fact, he suggested rather dramatic solutions to that problem. In the airport situation in Australia there is quite clearly a conflict over jurisdiction not only between the Commonwealth and State police authorities but also between a large number of other Commonwealth agencies and the Commonwealth police. </para>
          <para>Recently there have been revelations about the conflict between the Commonwealth Police and the Federal Narcotics Bureau. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark again suggested secondment arrangements between the Commonwealth Police Force, as he designed it, and the Federal Narcotics Bureau. Has the Government any view on these types of suggestions for trying to break down what is a rigid division of jurisdiction power which had led to feuding, in this case, not between State and Federal authorities but between two forms of Federal authorities. The other day I raised in debate the fact that the drug intelligence unit is within the Commonwealth Police Force and is rather jealously regarded by that Force. The Narcotics Bureau has its own very strong views about that unit being within the Commonwealth Police Force. In this Bill the opportunity to tackle some of these very difficult problems in the Federal area seems to have been bypassed, though the Minister may be able to assure me that the Bill will lay the foundations for tackling some of these problems. </para>
          <para>We are faced in this country with an enormous problem of divided authority in relation to coastal surveillance- a problem touched upon in numerous reports to this Parliament. The whole problem of coastal surveillance in this country in relation to a wide range of issues is divided between a large number of Federal and State authorities. This kind of Bill offers an opportunity at least to look seriously at these types of problems, but the opportunity has not been taken. We are all concerned with the problem of white collar crime in this country- a responsibility which because of the type of constitutional authority given to the Federal Government lies very much within the Federal sphere. This Bill provides an opportunity for Commonwealth police authorities to take up that type of function but again the matter is being bypassed. An effort is being made to unify the forces, and yet we seem to have missed many of the opportunities to tackle some of the conflicts between State and Federal police, and also between various agencies within the federal sphere. </para>
          <para>I turn to my second point of criticism, the internal division of the new force. Having provided a unified force, the Government proceeds immediately to divide it into two separate and distinct segments. Component No. 1 is the general police function component. Component No. 2 is the police protective service function. These functions are not defined in the Bill and the Minister&#39;s single reference to them, from which I will quote, can hardly be said to be a statement which clarifies anything very much. The Minister stated:   . . the Government was cognisant of the special requirements of the Commonwealth in the fields of protective security and the need to retain a relationship of this form of law enforcement with the other general policing functions within the Commonwealth area. </para>
          <para class="block">I am quite prepared to hand that statement over to experts in linguistic analysis to tell me what it means. But the Bill lacks any clear definition of these two components. This is not very helpful. One might argue very strongly against the notion of unifying the force and then dividing its members- I admit there are some transfer possibilities between the two components- and then bifurcating the force in this way. I think there are very powerful arguments for the establishment of a Commonwealth police force which is organised in a multifunctional way- a force with a range of functions. I do not find much valid argument for a simple bifurcation in the way that is suggested in this Bill. Indeed, I think it is true to say that this proposal will create, in status and in function, a first class component and a second class component in the Commonwealth police force. I know that police officers themselves are very fearful of this classification or division occurring between a first class and a second class component. Indeed, if one reads the Mark report, it is implicit in that report that this protective component is very much a second class component. Members of the Opposition would argue very strongly that we should abandon this bifurcation and this stark segmentation into two components within this unified force. </para>
          <para>The third issue I take up concerns the relations between the Government and the Police Commissioner as proposed in this Bill. I ask for the permission of the House to include in <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline> brief comparative table which will illustrate the points that I want to make. </para>

              <para>- I do not think there is any need to emphasise in this House that the relationships between governments and police commissioners have been a rather vexed subject in Australian politics in recent years, quite independent of the party in government. There was the enforced resignation of the Police Commissoner in Queensland in the early 1970s. There was the dismissal of the Police Commissioner in South Australia at the beginning of 1 978. Yesterday there was the resignation of the Police Commissioner in New South Wales. This is a vexed issue. It is an important issue. We think that amendments should be included in the Bill in relation to this issue and in relation to three aspects of this issue. The first relates to appointment, the second to removal and the third to the power to give political directions. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Firstly, in relation to appointment and removal, the Bill refers simply to appointment by the Governor-General and removal by the Governor-General. It is understandable that my party might be somewhat oversensitive to the notion of the Governor-General having these powers. But I point out that in every State in </para>
          <para class="block">Australia the appointment of a police commissioner is entrusted to the GovernorinCouncil. We are simply asking for a provision which may anyhow be the Government&#39;s intention. We desire a provision referring to the Governor-General-in-Council, thus making quite clear that the political executive has responsibility for appointment and renewal. In at least five of the six States, the right of removal of the police commissioner is given to the Governor-in-Council. We ask that those provisions be replicated in the present Bill. We should not leave this right to the GovernorGeneral. In South Australia an ex-governor had rather peculiar views of his authority in this field. We want to make it quite clear that the appointment and removal of a police commissioner is an Executive responsibility for which, of course, a government is accountable to the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Secondly, I want to take up the issue of the Government&#39;s power to give political directions. In the present Bill the power of the Minister to give directions is considerably limited. It is limited simply to general directions. The Opposition wants to carry this point further. We want to make it quite clear that the authority to issue directions lies with the Minister. Let me say that this is true of nearly every State. In New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, the Minister has the power to direct the police specifically, without limitation. It is true that no such power exists in Western Australia. </para>
          <para>However, we do not want to suggest that a Minister or a Ministry should have this power without limitation. I echo in many ways the point made by the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wilson).</inline> We would rather copy the South Australian legislation in this field to ensure a balance. We do not want to see unnecessary restraint on the Minister. We want him to be able to direct the police but we also want to make quite sure that the Executive is clearly accountable to the Parliament for any specific direction that it gives. </para>
          <para>Therefore, we want to see that the Minister operates within provisions for accountability. I think we have suggested that within 6 days he should report any direction to the Parliament and publish it in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> so that it is open immediately to question and debate by this Parliament. We are trying here to balance the power of the Executive to give instructions, but, at the same time, to be accountable to this Parliament by immediately laying on the table of the House instructions that were given and putting them into the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> Those issues, I think, need looking at in this Bill. In doing this we would be copying the South Australian legislation in this field which, in my view, flowing from the 1970 royal commission, is the most effective legislation in this country. </para>
          <para>Briefly, I have two further issues which I want to raise. Firstly, I think more attention has to be given to the rights of the policemen themselves. We are worried about the rights of appeal. We believe they should be given adequate rights of appeal. We believe they should be given adequate rights of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, disciplines and demotions. We also think, rightly, that the policemen should have a right of appeal against the retrenchment provisions which are provided in this Bill. There are certain industrial rights, in a sense, which the Bill neglects. </para>
          <para>Most importantly, we want to follow the suggestions that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark made about the accountability of the police force. We argue, in a whole series of amendments, that this is the chance to set up a model for Australia about police accountability. I do not think it is good enough for the Minister to say: &#39;Well, we are going to look at this problem. We hope to introduce a Bill in some months to come&#39;. We think the opportunity should be taken now. The Government is recasting the Commonwealth police. We suggest that, in the Bill which establishes a new police force for this country, the Government should also include within it a model of accountability to the public which will be something for the rest of Australia to imitate. I conclude by quoting from the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark on this subject. It stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A police force discharging the duties assigned to the AFP- indeed, any police force in a genuinely democratic society- will not enjoy public confidence and trust unless it is accountable, and moreover, is seen to wish to be accountable. Accountability to the criminal law, the civil law and its own police authority, even though that be the government itself, is not enough. Nor should the object be to satisfy complaints, some of whom will never in any circumstances be satisfied. The object should be to satisfy the public that every complaint is investigated thoroughly and impartially, that if there is evidence of crime the decision whether or not to prosecute is taken by a member of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department and that in the event of acquittal, a decision not to prosecute and all complaints not amounting to crime, the possibility of discipline proceedings should undergo the same meticulous examination. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We suggest that the Government should incorporate in this Bill the model recommended to it by the Law Reform Commission. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank all those honourable members who have taken part in the debate. I realise that we have a severe time constraint and that this is going to be a Committee Bill. At this stage there are only one or two comments that I would like to make. Firstly, the Australian Federal Police Bill only establishes a new Federal police force. It does not extend or create new powers for the Federal Police. It only brings together under Federal laws the existing powers of police in the Australian Capital Territory and the Commonwealth Police throughout Australia. The present powers of the Ombudsman to deal with complaints by members of the public against the two present Federal police forces will continue in relation to the Federal Police. New legislation will be introduced later to relate the Ombudsman&#39;s role to an internal investigation unit of the police and an independent tribunal to deal with any charges arising from complaints. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In developing the major proposal for the provision of two components, a modification had to be made to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark&#39;s suggestion that much of the protective service work be done by civil guards. The Government could not afford to retain about 1,000 Commonwealth police who are presently providing protective security and at the same time employ 1,000 civil guards. More importantly, the Government required a police protective service in respect of embassies, airports, official residences and risk installations such as the Atomic Energy Commission and Defence munitions depots. The Government was of the view that it had to retain a relationship of this form of law enforcement with the other general policing functions within the Commonwealth area. At the same time, the Government has been concerned in respect of the police affected by this proposal and has provided in clauses 25 and 26, together with clause 73 of the Bill, for general mobility between the components, subject to the usual principles of competence and qualifications, as well as a preferential opportunity for mobility between components for present police as against new recruits. I think that this would dispose of the suggestion made by the honourable member for Bonython <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Blewett)</inline> and one or two other honourable members that this could create a second class police force. </para>
          <para>I thank all honourable members who have taken part in the debate. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the contribution made by the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman),</inline> as well as that made by the honourable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKenzie),</inline> who was listed to speak tonight but did not do so. He has been a big help in this area. I would also like to thank the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wilson)</inline> and the honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes),</inline> the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi),</inline> the honourable member for Bonython and the honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James).</inline> I place on record my appreciation of the support given by the Government Members Law and Government Committee, of which the honourable member for Denison is the  chairman,  and by the Government Members Communication and Administrative Services Committee, of which the honourable member for Calare is the  chairman.  I thank those committees for the support they have given us. Both these committees, and many honourable members on both sides of the House, have been involved in the consultative processes. I thank them for their assistance. </para>
          <para>I also acknowledge the work of the task force which commenced in August 1978, and upon whose recommendations the legislation has been worked out. It is appropriate to mention the senior officers who assisted the Task Force, one from the Australian Capital Territory Police and one from the Commonwealth Police. In addition, there was a significant input from officers of my own Department, the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of the Capital Territory. I also acknowledge the personal interest of the Minister for Industrial Relations ( M r Street ). </para>
          <para>I wish particularly to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Sturt, especially as they relate to clause 1 3 (2 ) of the Bill. As a result of a number of discussions with him on this clause, and with other honourable members on the Government side, I take this opportunity to inform the House that I propose to give a written direction with respect to the general policy to be pursued by the Commissioner in relation to the dissemination of information by the Australian Federal Police. The direction will safeguard the rights to privacy of individuals. I propose to table the direction and it will be revised in due course in the light of the Australian Law Reform Commission&#39;s report on privacy. This is consistent with the advice given to the Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark in his report last year on the organisation of police resources in the Commonwealth area and other related matters. This will also remove any need to amend clause 13, as foreshadowed by the proposed Opposition amendments which have been circulated. I would like to make two or three remarks in conclusion. The honourable member for Melbourne, I believe, will remember saying before the suspension of the sitting for dinner that the regulations are already made. I think I quote him accurately. </para>

              <para>- The regulations will be processed in the ordinary way. When it comes to the question of debate, that is not in my hands. We would have to lean on the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> for that. One of the other points to which I wish to refer, because it is a matter of fact, is that the honourable member for Melbourne will remember stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Colin</inline> Woods was passed over- I think those were the words he used- when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark retired as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force in the United Kingdom. That is not correct. In fact, in answer to a question on 9 May I placed on record the fact that he was the  deputy  to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark and British law prevents the  deputy  taking over as Commissioner. The Commissioner must come from another force. I just place that on record as a matter of fact. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I appreciate the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter in respect of a public relations officer. I can say that the Australian Capital Territory Police Force does have a public relations officer. I can assure the honourable member that the new force will continue with the public relations officer. We certainly understand the benefit of having one. This was a strong recommendation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark. The only other point that I would like to make- it is just a small one- is in reference to the remarks made by the honourable member for Bonython. I think he said that we should follow the New South Wales arrangements in respect of dismissing a commissioner. The Commissioner in New South Wales can be dismissed only on the unanimous resolution of the combined meeting of the two Houses. That is a small point, but it is a matter of fact. Once again, I thank all honourable members for their contribution. I look forward to a comprehensive but, I hope, brief discussion in the Committee stage. </para>

        <para class="block">During the second reading stage I canvassed all the amendments that the Opposition proposes to move to this Bill. However, two or three matters were raised during the debate which I feel it is incumbent upon me to answer. I wish also to say a few things about clause 6 and our amendment, which seeks to delete paragraph (d) from that clause. </para>
        <para>The honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> talked about the great consultation that had taken place between the Government and representatives of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association. In fact he said that the contribution of the Opposition was in conflict with the wishes of the representatives of that Association. For the record I point out that, as a member of the Opposition committee handling this matter, within the last two weeks I have discussed with the <inline font-weight="bold">President, Mr Dowell,</inline> the Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Curtin,</inline> the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thompson,</inline> and the Vice-President, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dickinson,</inline> the whole of this legislation. I can assure the honourable member that the Opposition is voicing the opinions expressed before the committee by members of that Association. They totally oppose the proposition contained in clause 6(d). Whilst on behalf of the Opposition I indicated our total opposition to the proposal during the second reading debate, in any event, we had adopted the stance as a matter of principle. For the record, I say that we have carried out full and extensive discussions with representatives of the Commonwealth Police Officers Association and we were in complete accord in our opposition to this particular clause of the Bill. </para>
        <para>As I have indicated, the provisions which we seek to delete relate to the splitting of the Australian Police into two components- a general police division and a protective services division. We are totally opposed to the splitting of Australian Police into two divisions, as are the police themselves. I have canvassed the situation on behalf of the police who sought an invitation to address the relevant committee of the Opposition. They carried out a series of discussions with me and with other Opposition spokesmen in this area. The reasons for their opposition to this proposal are quite clear. A two-component force means a two-class force in which there will be a group of second class officers going under the rather unflattering title of &#39;protective service officers&#39;. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member should try to tell police officers that it does not mean that. Under the provisions of clause 24, officers in the second class are not to be referred to as police officers but as &#39;protective service officers&#39;. The functions to be undertaken by the protective service division need to be made clear. It was the obsession of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> with the question of terrorism which caused the Prime Minister to introduce the recommendations contained in the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark and to accept the proposal for the amalgamation of the two federal forces which the conservative parties so vehemently opposed in 1975. The protective services division has nothing to do with terrorism and very little to do with security. Its main task will be to guard Commonwealth places with low, and in many instances, nil security risks. That division is to be the static guard. The splitting of the force into two forces in this way is not only contrary to the principles which underlie the need for amalgamation in the first place but also it is bad for police morale and efficiency. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The reason for the Government&#39;s proposing the splitting of the force is not clear. It is an aberration on the part of someone. We would not accuse the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> of having this original idea because, in any case, the proposal was first mooted before the Minister was demoted or elevated, whichever way he likes to look at it, to his present portfolio. The proposal was not discussed with the Police Officers Association before the draft instructions were issued. Despite all the protestations of the police forces, the Government has refused to budge. If this static guard duty is to be undertaken, it can be done by people who are not police officers, or it can be done by police officers who are just normal members of the force, members who are subject to the same promotional opportunities and of the same status as any other police officer. They are trained in the same way and they present themselves for promotion in the same way, so they ought to be in the same promotional line. But they are relegated to a sub-level of occupation in the areas to which I have just referred. </para>
        <para>It is for those reasons that both the Labor Party and the Police Officers Association oppose the provisions of this clause. There is neither rhyme nor reason to the Government&#39;s proposals. That is why we have moved our amendment and why we will continue to move amendments to delete all reference to a two-component force. </para>

            <para>- Well, let us look at the argument. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark suggested that a lot of the protective functions could in fact be carried out by civilian employees on a whole range of second level protective functions. Members of the Commonwealth Police Association are concerned about whether this notion will in fact be adopted by the Government, that is, that the protective services component will carry out tasks which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark thought could be left simply to civilian employees. If that is true, if members are to be tied in to a particular pattern within the force, carrying out these kinds of low level functions, inevitably a distinction in status will develop within the force. Would it not be much better to have a unified force in which, according to age, qualifications and expertise, people perform different functions, rather than building into the force from the beginning these two separate components? </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Frankly, I think the Minister has to answer those kinds of arguments. There is a real suggestion underlying the report on which this Bill is based that these types of tasks are second-rate or second-class functions. I hope that the Minister will be able to convince us, as he has apparently convinced the honourable member for Canberra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Haslem),</inline> that there is no danger of this development taking place. </para>

            <para>- Yes. No member of the present force will lose any status, salary or position whatsoever. That has been stated categorically by my predecessors and by myself. At the moment, many members of the protective services force are very highly trained. I think it is an absurd proposition to talk about low level functions, which I think were the words used by the honourable member for Bonython <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Blewett),</inline> because many of these so-called <inline font-style="italic">low level</inline> functions are fraught with very high personal risks. </para>

There is preference for existing members of the components. In response to submissions made by the Commonwealth Police Officers Association, the preference period was extended from two years to five years or longer, at the direction of the Minister of the day. The functions, which are really what this discussion is all about, will be decided by the Commissioner, and they will be decided in consultation with the Minister at the time.

          <para>-The Opposition opposes clause 7, which is consequential upon clause 6. Clause 7 provides that the members referred to in clause 6 (c) shall comprise a component of the Australian Federal Police performing such of the functions of the Australian Federal Police as are determined, by general orders, to be general police functions. There is also a reference in clause 7 (2) to the persons described in clause 6 (d). I will not canvass again the reasons for our opposition. The Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> has given us guarantees this evening. But the test will be when the duties are defined by the Commissioner in the final analysis. The Minister has given a categorical assurance that there will be no differentiation between the classes of members of the force. I take it that he is also guaranteeing that all members will be trained fundamentally in the same way irrespective of the area in which they might finally be located in the course of performing their duties. This is the question about which the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> was confused, although I think everyone else understood what was being said. It was not merely a question of members receiving fundamental training and then going into specialised areas of police work. It was a question of members going into duties which would not allow them to compete for promotion with other members of the force. If that is the guarantee that the Minister has given to the Committee this evening, the Opposition accepts it for what it is worth. We hope that when the duties are defined he will ensure as the responsible Minister that the principle is maintained. </para>

        <para class="block">This clause deals with the functions of the Australian Federal Police and State police services in relation to the investigation of offences against Commonwealth places under the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970. However, the Bill enables these arrangements to be made by the Federal Commissioner of Police and State commissioners of police. Clearly there is a question of manpower and resources involved as well as a question of Federal-State relations. Such decisions ought to be taken at ministerial level. I will not canvass the Opposition&#39;s proposal. There seems to me to be some confusion arising in the minds of some police officers. It is suggested that there is now some indication by State police that the States are about to take over some of the duties normally carried out by Commonwealth police officers. However, that confusion could be put to rest once again by the Minister replying to me in the way he replied to what I had to say about clause 8 (2). </para>

The provisions in clause 13 as it stands are not satisfactory provisions for defining the relationship between the Commissioner of Police and his Minister, nor do the provisions provide for proper accountability of the Minister. The Opposition&#39;s view is that whilst the police should enjoy a degree of operational autonomy from the Government, they should be subject to the control and direction of the responsible Minister. Under the Government&#39;s proposal the Minister may give directions only as to general policy. The matter which we are most concerned about is the requirement by the Minister to the Commissioner to provide him with information. Under the clause as it stands the Minister cannot require the Commissioner to provide him with particular information. There can be no question of proper ministerial accountability or responsibility unless there is a disclosure. This requires two things. Firstly, the Minister himself must be able to direct the Commissioner to provide him with any information which he seeks. Secondly, if the Minister does not direct the Commissioner he must be publicly accountable for it. Our amendment is based on the 1972 South Australian amendments to the police regulations which stem from the Bright report into the police handling of the moratorium demonstrations, as I pointed out in my speech at the second reading stage. </para>
        <para>The motion that there should be complete police independence from the Government is one which we reject. As was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark, the police should normally have operational autonomy. We do not question that. However, this is not to be attained at the cost of removing the principle of accountability to the elected government. There can be no prior restraints placed on the ability of Ministers to direct commissioners of police. Events in many States of Australia in recent years have demonstrated that. Our amendment cures two defects in the Bill: Firstly, the unnecessary restraints on Ministers when directing commissioners of police; and secondly, the lack of accountability to Ministers. If ever we have learned a lesson we ought to have learned one from the position in which the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> finds himself today. The disclosures that should have taken place were not made. Had they been made a number of lives may well have been saved. There is a heavy responsibility on the Minister. We believe that clause 13 as it stands is not satisfactory. Therefore I have moved my amendment. </para>

          <para>-I oppose the amendment moved by the Opposition. Whilst I do not agree that clause 13 is in a satisfactory form, the method being adopted in the proposed amendment, although it is said to be modelled on the provisions of South Australian legislation, really does not adequately cover the problems that have been raised and identified by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. In one sense the provision suggested by the Opposition could lead to the Australian Federal Police becoming a political police force because it proposes that the Minister be given power to give any directions he likes. He may have a compliant police commissioner whom he may ask to pursue inquiries about a particular individual. He may also ask the police commissioner not to pursue inquiries about a particular individual and the compliant police commissioner and his officers may carry out that request. The Opposition is suggesting that there should be the power to direct and that that direction be made public. But what of the present circumstances in which, without direction but on request, inquiries are carried out or not carried out, information is supplied or not supplied? I would have preferred to see an amendment in this form. In the light of the statement made earlier this evening by the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay),</inline> I am proposing to move it. The Minister, in being given the power to direct in regard to general policy should, I believe, be prohibited in these words: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. but the Minister is not empowered to override the opinion of the Commissioner (a) on the question of whether the collection of information by the Australian Federal Police concerning a particular individual would, or would not, be justified by reason of its relevance to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">I believe it should be for the police commissioner and his officers, acting with the sort of autonomy that the spokesman for the Opposition talks about, to determine whether or not information should be gathered about a particular individual. I would also like to see the amendment go on to prescribe:  or (b) on the question whether a communication of information concerning a particular individual would be for a purpose relevant to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police. </para>
        <para class="block">I do not believe the Minister should be in the position of either giving a direction and tabling it in this Parliament or, alternatively, through a compliant commissioner of police, getting information about a particular individualinformation off police files that may be totally irrelevant to the discharge of police duties but gathered by accident in the circumstances of pursuing people who are law breakers. It may also be information which, on its face, is today irrelevant but which next week, next month, next year or three years hence may become highly relevant because with the additional information that has been gathered in the meantime it indicates that the person about whom that information, originally irrelevant, was gathered is a person in whom the police force has some interest in the discharge of its proper functions. I would have liked to see the amendment go on to read: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The communication of information on behalf of the Australian Federal Police shall be made only by the Commissioner or by any other member acting within the limits of authority conferred on him by the Commissioner. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In other words, information should be made available off police files only if the commissioner gives authority for it to be supplied. He should give authority for the supply of that information only if it is to be used within the discharge of the functions of the police. For example, the police may wish to place the evidence before the court or in pursuing a person thought to be guilty of a crime it may find it necessary to give information to the Press about persons in the vicinity who might be of interest to them in circumstances where they can bring about a prosecution. </para>
        <para>If a person makes a communication of any information or matter that has come to his knowledge or into his possession by reason of his being or having been a member of the Australian Federal Police he should be guilty of an offence, unless that communication is made to another member of the Australian Federal Police or is made within the limits of the authority conferred upon that member of the Australian Federal Police by the commissioner or with the approval of the commissioner or an officer having authority of the commissioner to give that approval. Of course, I recognise the need to specify circumstances in which information can be passed on to other agencies, to other law enforcement authorities, whether they are State or Territory police forces, to customs authorities and to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I feel most strongly that the Opposition &#39;s amendment is quite inadequate to achieve the purposes that have been outlined for it because it is wide open to the sorts of abuses about which I am talking. Those people who are guilty of supplying information should be liable to a charge themselves. </para>
        <para>The Act should specify quite clearly that it is an offence to supply information about an individual to the Minister. That does not in any way derogate from the Minister&#39;s ministerial responsibility and his responsibility to this Parliament in terms of the administration of the force. It is not right that any Minister now or in the future should be able to say to the commissioner of police: &#39;Supply to me information on your files about a particular individual&#39;. The information might be properly collected but might also be irrelevant but nevertheless compromising and damaging to the individual to whom that information relates. If the Opposition were trying to achieve the sorts of purposes it has outlined, it should be seeking to insert clauses similar to those that restrict the commissioner of taxation from supplying information to the Treasurer and restrict the Treasurer from seeking that information about particular individuals. I do not see any distinction at all in the circumstances in which an individual innocent of any offence or any breach can be seriously damaged by the supply of that information. </para>
        <para>I emphasise that the sorts of amendments I would like to see do not reflect any wish on my part to inhibit or restrict in any way the capacity of the Australian Federal Police to carry out its functions as spelled out in the legislation, nor do I see the sorts of restrictions I am suggesting should be in the legislation in any way inhibiting the responsibility of a Minister to this Parliament. The danger of the Opposition&#39;s amendment is that it will create a situation where a Minister may use a compliant police commissioner or, in the knowledge of the numbers the Government might have in this place and the time lags that might occur before notice has to be given, may direct a police commissioner to supply information about an individual which has not come before the courts to cast doubt under the law as to whether or not that person has been in breach of the law. I think that is one of these cases where one has to take account of the words of David Ogilvy who said: </para>

          <para>- Firstly let me comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wilson).</inline> I do not think, in fact, that the arguments he has just advanced are in conflict with the Opposition&#39;s amendment. The danger of a compliant commissioner, which is his real fear, is just as likely if the legislation is left in its present form as if it is amended in the way the Opposition proposes. Indeed, if I might point out to the honourable member for Sturt, the danger of a compliant commissioner is probably greater under the present legislation because there is no form of accountability to Parliament at all. Whereas the Opposition, in its amendment, though it makes the directions more specific, does provide for an accountability to Parliament which is not in the present Bill. I think that we on the Opposition side would agree with the specific protections for individuals that the member for Sturt is suggesting. Indeed, I think they could be built into the Bill without being in conflict with the proposals that we are making. I think our amendment moves somewhat closer to his own motion of protection of the liberties of individuals because we are providing accountability to Parliament for all directions given to the commissioner. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I wish now to take up the point of the Opposition&#39;s amendment. At the moment the Bill states, in the critical clause 13(2), as follows: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Minister may, after obtaining and considering the advice of the Commissioner and of the Secretary, give written directions to the Commissioner with respect to the general policy to be pursued in relation to the performance of the functions of the Australian Federal Police. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think that phrase and the debate over exactly what is meant by general policy open up an enormous field of conflict between government and police which, I think, we saw in South Australia with such disastrous consequences in the 1970 moratorium. We want to remove that danger of conflict between commissioner and government. Let me say that in four of the six States there is this provision now for the Executive Government to give direction to the Police Commissioner. But of course we do not accept what exists in the States because we say that if this power is given, as we believe it should be given, to Executive Government, then we have to protect the people against any arbitrary misuse of this power by </para>
        <para class="block">Executive Government. So the Opposition does suggest a provision which is found in only one State in Australia at the moment, and that is the State of South Australia, where, in fact, a copy of any direction at all either general or specific, that the Minister gives to the Commissioner of Police, must be laid before each House of Parliament within six sitting days of the date of the direction and must be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> for the information of the public. It does seem to me that in doing that we clarify the possibilities of conflict over this notion of general policy. We give the authority to the Executive but, at the same time- I agree entirely with the honourable member for Sturt- we have to prevent the misuse of that Executive authority. We do that by these two provisions. </para>
        <para>I would be perfectly happy to go on from there and accept some of the individual protections about particular information on individuals which the honourable member for Sturt suggests. That is, I do not think we are in conflict. Indeed, I would suggest that the Opposition&#39;s amendment, which envisages accountability to Parliament and publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> is more likely to prevent a compliant commissioner carrying out ministerial advice than, in fact, the Bill does as it presently stands. </para>

        <para class="block">These amendments have the effect of making it quite explicit that the Commissioner and  Deputy  Commissioners of Police are appointed by the Governor-General-in-Council- that is, Cabinet. It also makes it explicit that their terms and conditions are determined by the Government and that they are responsible to the Government. The need, as I have indicated in the second reading debate, was made clear by the notorious Salisbury case. It has had a decent airing today mainly by the South Australian members and me. Four South Australian members participated in the debate. As I have indicated, the Salisbury affair has had a decent airing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salisbury</inline> took the view that he was not responsible to the elected Government but to a vague notion, as I have indicated before, which he called the Crown.

It is also our view and our amendments seek to make that clear. </para>

          <para>- This is the nearest we will come to exchanging words. It is not a stupid omission or one of absurdity. As the Bill is framed, the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner already have the right to resign. This proposal would diminish that right and would mean than a government could hold a Commissioner against his will. We oppose the amendment. </para>

        <para class="block">These amendments relate to the removal of reference to &#39;Governor-General&#39; to make it clear that the police are responsible to the Government. These provisions relate to commissioned and non-commissioned officers. We clearly understand that &#39;Governor-General in Council &#39; does mean the Executive Government. This will ensure that the notion to which I have referred three or four times, not only in my speech in the second reading debate but also in the Committee debate, is not in anybody&#39;s mind when we are dealing with this matter. </para>

        <para>I will canvass the argument for my amendment to clause 36 and for proposed new clause 36a. I understand that the questions on these clauses will be put separately but the same argument applies to both amendments. I will deal with them together to save the time of the Committee. These two amendments provide for the rectification of what is one of the most serious omissions in the Bill. This is the failure to provide explicit promotion appeal procedures. It is one of the issues canvassed very definitely by the Police Association and as we saw it its apprehension was fell founded. If those apprehensions are not well founded, I would ask the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> to put our minds at rest and in particular the minds of those in the police forces. </para>
        <para>In the 1975 legislation, there are specific provisions which enable a member of the Commonwealth Police to appeal to the Promotions Appeals Board where that member thought he should have been promoted in preference to another member. Such rights are considered basic to any people working in any area of the Public Service. All that is provided in this legislation is the criteria to be considered in promotions, that is, clause 36 and the quite outrageous provision of clause 40 (c) which enables the Government to do virtually what it likes in relation to promotion appeals by regulation. The Commonwealth Police Officers Association is understandably most perturbed about this matter, as I have indicated before. Wide ranging discussions were held with that Association before the introduction of the 1975 legislation and the police remain convinced, as does the Opposition, that the 1975 legislation is the best method of handling the question of promotion appeals. The regulations that might be made under clause 43 could be anything. There has been no undertaking that regulations will not be made without prior consultation with the Police Association. One can only suspect that the Government has something to hide in its intentions in this area. In the matter of the whole range of promotion possibilities and the matter that I raised earlier, the Minister has given certain undertakings in terms of what might be called the apprehension concerning the elimination of certain gradings of policemen. It goes to that fundamental question. It seems to me that the issue of the fundamental  right of appeal should be spelt out by the Minister, giving the assurance to the Opposition and to the Commonwealth Police officers that their position will be preserved in the future. </para>

        <para class="block">These amendments seek to reduce the unnecessary length of notice which must be given by a member of the Australian Federal Police Force before he can resign. The Bill provides that a member must give between three and four months&#39; notice. Whether a member resigns because he sees better prospects elsewhere, or because he is dissatisfied with the force, it is undesirable both for him and for the force to require him to remain for three or four months. Nothing could be more calculated to breed discontent. Our amendment is in line with the provision in the 1975 Bill. Before I resume my seat I add for the benefit of honourable members who have just come into the Committee that I do not want them to consider that we have not a great deal to say to each of the clauses to which I have made reference. However, in line with an arrangement that we have made with the Government to try to complete consideration of the Bill this evening, we are cutting down on what we would normally say when raising matters in criticism of the Bill. </para>

          <para>- I confirm what the honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes)</inline> has just said and I thank him for his assistance on the passage of the Bill. Clause 37 does explain that the three-month resignation period is not an arbitrary term and it can be shortened as the Commissioner determines, but has to be final after four months. The management of both police forces feels that the general provision of three months provides sufficient flexibility for an officer to be replaced. However, any variation is always subject to negotiation between the new commissioner and the association or associations. </para>

        <para class="block">Amendment No. 42 relates to the question of promotion appeals. This provision was referred to earlier. It enables the Government to deal with the whole question of promotion appeals by regulation. For the reasons already stated the Opposition opposes clause 40 (c). Opposition amendment No. 43 relates to clause 40 (d) of the Bill which enables regulations to be made providing for the early retirement of members of the age of 55 years. Regulations could specify either voluntary or compulsory retirement. During the debate on the second reading, and in a previous debate on the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill, it was spelt out clearly why the Opposition is against this clause. People who have served long careers in police forces could find themselves- not because they were not capable of carrying out their jobs, not because they were ill and not for any other reason- sacked or forced into early retirement. We are opposed to compulsory early retirement. At the very least the Government should, if it wants to introduce compulsory retirement, legislate for it. As we said in the argument against the Bill I have mentioned, the Government should try voluntary retirement first and, if it is serious about it and if voluntary retirement does not achieve the desired result, it can take whatever steps are open to it and allow a debate on the question. That is the issue as the Opposition sees it. </para>
        <para>Opposition amendment No. 44 relates to the question of disciplinary offences. The regulationmaking provision of clause 40(f) is quite inadequate and a pale substitute for the proposals of the Law Reform Commission on complaints against the police. The Law Reform Commission recommended that there should be a police tribunal to hear charges brought against police for breaches of the disciplinary code. The Opposition will be moving later for the insertion of a whole new part dealing with complaints against the police and disciplinary offences. The fact that the Government has inserted this pathetic little regulation in the Bill is further evidence that it does not intend to proceed with the Law Reform Commission recommendations. </para>

          <para>- I shall deal with Opposition amendment No. 42 which relates to the Promotion Appeals Board. The Government is unable to accept the deletion of paragraph (c) because the Opposition&#39;s earlier amendment to clause 36 was rejected. Opposition amendment No. 43 acknowledges the Government&#39;s belief that it should be possible for police to retire at the age of 55 years. Because of the implications of superannuation, the policy details have not yet been worked out. Also, we are unable to accept Opposition amendment No. 44. Paragraph (f) of clause 40 provides for regulations to include disciplinary offences. It also establishes a Disciplinary Board to determine appeals. Disciplinary matters concerning the two present police forces are covered under regulations similar to those provided for in this paragraph of the Bill. </para>

However, that provision simply states that the Tribunal, as constituted by another person, may decide to hear the matter under consideration. In other words it gives the Tribunal a discretion. We believe that there should be no discretion in this area and that the evidence that was given before the previous Tribunal should be taken into account. It should be incumbent on those people forming the Tribunal to ensure that due reference is paid to evidence that is given to the Tribunal up until that point in time when the new person may take over. </para>

        <para class="block">The amendments give the right to any person who is aggrieved by a decision taken under clauses 38 or clause 39 to appear before the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal. These clauses deal with the questions of forced retirement and retrenchment respectively. Our amendments would enable persons adversely affected by decisions in this area to appeal to the Arbitral Tribunal. The Arbitral Tribunal, of course, is to be constituted by a presidential member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is totally unsatisfactory that the decisions such as those taken under clauses 38 and 39, which can destroy a person&#39;s career and livelihood, can be made without that person having a right of appeal. </para>
        <para>I will come straight to the third amendment, amendment No. 48, and simply say that this amendment is consequential on amendment 46. It gives the Tribunal jurisdiction to hear matters relating to retirements or dismissals. We believe that this is a very important amendment. </para>

          <para>- I wish to speak to the amendment to clause 46 which seeks to change the term &#39;Governor-General&#39; to Governor-General in Council&#39;. Honourable members ought to be aware that when we talk about the Governor-General under the terms of our Constitution, we are speaking of a single Minister&#39;s decision in this matter. The GovernorGeneral in Council is acting with the advice of his Ministers and therefore is effectively the Cabinet or the Executive Council. I would say that from my experience this means that more than just one just ministerial mind is brought to bear on matters when the Governor-General is deliberating upon a person&#39;s future. I think that the House ought to support the amendment that has been put forward. This is a serious consideration of taking a power from a particular Minister and diluting or distributing that power or bringing a second mind to bear. The wordage in the Act simply means that the Minister does the job himself without proper surveillance on behalf of the victim. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition amendment No. 46 which happens to be to clause 46 is not accepted by the Government. Under clauses 38 and 39 which the amendment proposes to change the right of appeal exists already in the same form as in the present legislation which established the two police forces. If there were a wrongful retirement or dismissal under clauses 38 and 39, a member could test that dismissal in an ordinary court. However, the Government will give serious consideration to the possibility of the provision of an appeal to an appropriate tribunal, not necessarily the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal to which clause 46 refers. Amendment No. 47 was dealt with earlier. I will not traverse the arguments in respect of it. As to Amendment No. 48, the Government does not agree to the previous amendment seeking appeal to the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal under clauses 38 and 39. Therefore, it is necessary to retain the words in the clause. </para>

They broaden the range of people who can represent an association before the Federal Police Arbitral Tribunal.

The Opposition believes that an association ought to be entitled to employ people to represent it before the Tribunal.

          <para>This Report supplements the Commission&#39;s first Report, Complaints Against Police, produced in 1975. The purpose of the proposals contained in this Report is to strike a proper and fair balance between the needs of a disciplined force and the rights of the community it serves. </para>
          <para>The police are in the vanguard of the administration of justice in our society. The honour and discipline of the force are integral to its effectiveness and must be maintained. Complaints do occur and are likely to increase with growing knowledge of and sensitivity to rights. Some will be vexatious. Others will be unjust. Still others will be justified and will require action. The machinery for action must be fair and just to the police and public alike. For the appearance of justice and for the protection of the standing of the police, the procedure cannot be left wholly to the police themselves. As much as possible should be. </para>
          <para>Since the Commission&#39;s first Report, a number of developments have taken place which have reinforced key elements in the Commission&#39;s original proposals, particularly the Commission&#39;s recommendations for the establishment of a special unit of the police force modelled on the A. 10 Section of Scotland Yard and the Commission&#39;s recommendations with respect to the role of the Ombudsman: </para>
          <para>The former Commissioner of the ACT Police has stated that the ALRC 1975 recommendations &#39;were mostly accepted by the police forces concerned as being an impartial and effective way of handling complaints against police&#39;. In advance of legislation, the ACT Police in January 1978 set up an &#39;Internal Affairs Branch&#39; as proposed in the initial ALRC Report. </para>
          <para>Legislation has been proposed for the largest police force in Australia (the NSW police) modelled on the Commission &#39;s recommendations. </para>
          <para>The Northern Territory Ombudsman Ordinance provides for a widening of the Ombudsman&#39;s power to investigate complaints against individual policemen generally along the lines of the Commission &#39;s proposals. </para>
          <para>In his recent report to the Minister for Administrative Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark considered that an effective system for handling complaints against police was essential to any modern police force: the object should be to satisfy the public that every complaint is investigated thoroughly and impartially. In <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Mark&#39;s view the essential requirement of any machinery is the assurance of an initial investigation of manifest thoroughness and impartiality. </para>
          <para class="block">Background to this Report- </para>
          <para>The Commission&#39;s first Report produced in 1975 was substantially adopted by the then Government and the Commission &#39;s proposals were included in the Australia Police Bill 1975. The Bill lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament in November 1975. Government policy changed and the proposal to establish an amalgamated national force of all of the Commonwealth&#39;s police was not proceeded with. The Commission was subsequently asked by the Attorney-General to review its report, making any changes that were necessary in the light of the decision to retain separate police forces of the Commonwealth, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory of Australia. At the same time, the Commission was asked to review a number of developments that had occurred in the meantime. These include the passage of new legislation on complaints against police in England ( Police Act 1 976 ), the receipt of new reports in Australia and overseas concerning this universal issue, the passage of the Ombudsman Act 1976 and public, police and other comments received since the publication of the Commission&#39;s report. </para>
          <para>The Commission has now reviewed its first report in the light of these considerations. It has conducted public sittings and private consultations in all parts of Australia. This supplementary report is the product of its further inquiries. </para>
          <para class="block">The original proposals- </para>
          <para>The basic scheme put forward in the first report is retained. It involves the use of three instruments to infuse elements of independence which police themselves recognise to be important in the receipt, handling, investigation and determination of complaints against police. The instruments are: </para>
          <para>The Ombudsman as &#39;neutral territory&#39; for the receipt of complaints, as investigator of last resort and as public guardian to require certain public complaints to be scrutinised in a public forum. </para>
          <para>A special unit of the police force, titled the Internal Discipline Section, and modelled on the A. 10 Section at Scotland Yard. Whilst reserving to the police force most investigations of complaints, experience teaches that a separate section of this kind achieves greater efficiency and independence in fearlessly investigating complaints, internal and external. </para>
          <para>A police tribunal, whose President is a judge, which can sit to hear charges brought based upon breaches by police of the discipline code. Criminal charges against police will continue to be dealt with in the criminal courts. Many public complaints against police, whilst not involving criminal conduct, are nevertheless serious matters that should be publicly dealt with. </para>
          <para>Particular elements of this scheme have already been adopted in some police forces. The overall scheme has been welcomed by one at least of the Commonwealth&#39;s forces. Part of it will soon apply to the Northern Territory Police Force and is under consideration for adoption in a major State force. Inevitably, some of the details have been modified in the light of changed circumstances and the considerations drawn to the Commission&#39;s attention. We have paid particular attention to the need to uphold the overall authority of the Police Commissioner and to leave with police the greatest possible responsibility for discipline that is compatible with the just disposition of complaints. Since the Commission&#39;s original Report, the Ombudsman Act 1976 has come into operation. It introduces a system of ex post review by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. He can look at the way an investigation of a public complaint was handled by police. Often he may not be able to look at the merits of the initial complaint. Review of this kind is not enough and the Commission proposes that the Ombudsman&#39;s powers be widened (para. 69). It is important that investigations and determinations satisfy the demand that justice should not only be done, but also be seen to be done. </para>
          <para class="block">The Commission&#39;s current proposals- </para>
          <para class="block">Recommendations on Receiving Complaints </para>
          <para>General Procedures. The legislation should make it clear that &#39;complaints&#39; are to be given a wide interpretation (para. 72). A distinction is drawn between procedures to be followed in respect of &#39;internal &#39; complaints and &#39;external &#39; complaints (which originate from members of the public) (para. 70). The former will continue to be handled basically as at present, with the exceptions that an accused police officer or the Commissioner could elect to have a charge proceed before the Tribunal instead of before the Commission and an appeal would lie from the Commissioner to the Tribunal (para. 73). </para>
          <para class="block">Recipients of Complaints: </para>
          <para>Members of the public may make their complaints to the police or to the Ombudsman (para. 73 ). </para>
          <para>Our earlier proposal that public servants should be alternative recipients of complaints against police is withdrawn (para. 75). </para>
          <para>A proposal that clerks of courts should become alternative recipients of complaints is not accepted (para. 76). </para>
          <para>The suggestion that special recipients should be appointed to receive complaints from Aboriginals, nonEnglish speaking persons, illiterate persons or from other disadvantaged groups, is not accepted (para. 78). The Aboriginal Legal Aid Services, ethnic communities and others should be informed of the procedures available, so they can direct persons, having complaints, in an appropriate way (para. 79). </para>
          <para class="block">Need for Community Education: </para>
          <para>A short pamphlet setting out procedures and forms for transmission to the Ombudsman&#39;s office should be prepared (para. 77). Information in the major ethnic languages should also be compiled (para. 77). Information of this kind should be freely available at police stations and other federal offices (para. 83 ). </para>
          <para>The Commission would expect local Commonwealth officers to be informed of the available procedures (para. 76) and to help persons wishing to make complaints against the Commonwealth&#39;s police by providing information concerning the new procedures (para. 76 ). </para>
          <para>One of the non-contentious tasks of the proposed internal discipline section compatible with its other functions, is that of promoting community awareness of the machinery for dealing with public complaints (para. 77 ). </para>
          <para class="block">Form of Complaints: </para>
          <para>Oral complaints should be received and reduced to writing either by the complainant or by somebody on his behalf (para. 81). </para>
          <para>Anonymous complaints should not be rejected. Their disposition should follow, so far as is possible, the same course as other external complaints (para. 82*). </para>
          <para class="block">Recommendations on Investigating Complaints- </para>
          <para class="block">Duties of Officers Receiving Complaints: </para>
          <para>No distinction should be drawn between the way in which &#39;serious&#39; and &#39;not serious&#39; complaints against police are handled by police (para. 88). However, in imposing obligations upon a police officer receiving a complaint concerning the action he should take to ensure its independent investigation and determination, provision should be made so that he is still able to take such action as he considers necessary to prevent injury to persons, damage to property, the escape of a person liable to arrest or the loss or destruction of evidence (para. 89). </para>
          <para>Subject to the above, the duty of a police officer receiving a complaint is to refer it to the proposed internal investigation unit as soon as possible. </para>
          <para class="block">Creation of Internal Investigation Unit: </para>
          <para>An internal investigation unit within the Commonwealth police forces to investigate and report on complaints against police is desirable and feasible (para. 100). It should be created (para. 101). </para>
          <para>Because of the size of the forces involved, each unit will be, at least initially, very small. The minimum number of officers to be attached to a unit to make it viable is two (para. 101). </para>
          <para>The special unit should include officers of different ranks and there should be turnover in personnel, though service should generally be for not less than three years (para. 103) </para>
          <para class="block">Handling of Investigation: </para>
          <para>Investigation of complaints against police should normally be performed by the Internal Discipline Section. </para>
          <para>The Commission rejects the importation of foreign or interstate or other force officers for investigating complaints against police (para. 99). </para>
          <para>In the context of separate forces, it also rejects a Commonwealth-wide unit (para. 100). </para>
          <para>In four special cases, the Ombudsman should have a reserve power, at his discretion, to undertake an independent investigation of his own. These cases include circumstances where: the complaint involves a member of the police force senior to all members of the Section; the complaint involves a member of the Section itself; the complaint is related to a matter the Ombudsman is already investigating; the Ombudsman is of the opinion that it is in the public interest that the complaint should be investigated by him (para. 109). </para>
          <para>A full system of recording complaints should be introduced both by the police and the Ombudsman (para. 106). Details of these complaints and their disposition should be reported to the respective legislatures. </para>
          <para>Where a complaint is made by a member of the public to the police, the Commissioner should notify the Ombudsman (para. 106). </para>
          <para>Reports of the internal investigation unit on external complaints should be sent to the Commissioner, who should then refer them to the Ombudsman with any comments he may have (para. 101). </para>
          <para class="block">Bringing of Charges: </para>
          <para>The bringing of charges following reports should normally be within the discretion of police. </para>
          <para>Where a difference arises in respect of external complaints, the Ombudsman should have power, by making a formal recommendation, to ensure that a charge is brought by police and determined before the tribunal (para. 111). </para>
          <para>Charges should be prosecuted not by the complainant but by the police (para. 115). </para>

          <para>The tribunal should be a single member judicial-type tribunal whose President is a judge (para. 112). </para>

          <para class="block">Present Law and Practice- 213. At common law a police constable is personally responsible for his criminal and tortious acts. So far as his torts are concerned his superior officer and those who appointed him or instructed him are not vicariously liable for his torts. At the heart of this rule is the principle that no relationship of master and servant or principal and agent existed between the Crown or municipal body appointing the police constable and the individual officer. Notwithstanding the fact that in modern times the appointment of police constables has become a matter largely governed by statute, the common law position has remained the same. 2 14. In Enever v. R. ( 1 905 ) 3 C.L.R 969 the High Court of Australia held that it was not competent to a claimant to bring an action against the Government of Tasmania for wrongful arrest by a constable acting in the intended performance of his duty as an officer of the police. The Tasmanian Crown Redress Act gave a right of action against the Government to a person having any just claim against the Crown for an actionable wrong in respect of &#39;any act or omission, neglect or default of an officer, agent or servant of the Government of Tasmania&#39;. In rejecting the claim. Griffith C.J. said. (174) </para>
          <para>At common law the office of constable or peace officer was regarded as a public office, and the holder of it as being, in some sense, a servant of the Crown. The appointment to the office was made in various ways, and often by election. In later times the mode of appointment came to be regulated for the most part by Statute, and the power of appointment was vested in specified authorities, such as municipal authorities or justices. But it never seems to have been thought that a change in the mode of appointment made any difference in the nature or duties of the office, except so far as might be enacted by the particular statute. Again, at common law constables had large powers necessarily incident to the discharge of their functions as peace officers or conservators of the peace, amongst which perhaps the most important was the authority to arrest on suspicion of felony. To these powers others of a like nature have from time to time been added by statutory provisions, of which the 1 79th section of the Police Act is an instance. But there is no reason for thinking that the mere statutory addition to the list of their powers altered the essential nature of those powers. It seems also to have been always accepted as settled law that, although a peace officer was himself responsible for unjustifiable acts done by him in the intended exercise of his lawful authority, no responsibility for such acts attached to those by whom he was appointed. </para>
          <para>In the same case O&#39;Connor J. said. (175) </para>
          <para>The common law has always recognised the office of constable. The duty of locally preserving the peace in England from the earliest times has been placed upon local bodies, upon the decennaries and hundreds in the time of Alfred, and later upon different local bodies, in more modern times upon the Boroughs and Municipalities. The recognised officers for the preservation of the peace in these localities have been the constable or constables chosen, elected or appointed by the local bodies as by law provided. The power to arrest for breach of the peace or other offences is given by the common law, not to the local bodies responsible for keeping the peace, but to their officer the constable . . . The power to arrest is given not to the local body nor the municipality, nor, in cases where a Government Police Force exists, to the Government- but to a constable, that is to a person who for the time being holds the office of constable. 215. The principle outlined in Enever v. R. received support in England in Fisher v. Oldham Corporation ( 1930) 2 K B. 364, a decision of McCardie J. in which the English decisions are reviewed and Enever v. R. specifically approved as &#39;most weighty and most instructive &#39;. The case came under the review of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Perpetual Trustee Co. Limited (1955) 92 C.L.R. 113. The case, which establishes that action per quod servitium amisit does not lie at the suit of the Crown in respect of the loss of services of a member of the Police Force appointed under the Police Regulation Act, 1899 of the State of New South Wales, provides further specific approval for the Enever principles. (176) </para>
          <para>In their view, there is a fundamental difference between the domestic relation of servant and master and that of the holder of a public office and the State which he is said to serve. The constable falls within the latter category.  His  authority is original not delegated and is exercised at his own discretion by virtue of his office: he is a ministerial officer exercising statutory rights independently of contract. The essential difference is recognised in the fact that his relationship to the Government is not in ordinary parlance described as that of servant and master. 216. There have been a number of statutory inroads into this common law position. In Australia, the only substantial alteration to the position of Commonwealth constables arises, and then only incidentally, in the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1 959. By section 5 of that Act, where a claim is made against the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority for damages, or contribution to damages, in respect of the death of or personal injury to a person caused by or arising out of the use of an uninsured motor vehicle owned by the Commonwealth, the driver of the vehicle shall, for the purposes of that claim, be conclusively presumed to have been at all relevant times, with respect to the driving of the vehicle, the agent of the Commonwealth (or Commonwealth authority), acting within the scope of his authority. This section may have the effect of changing the common law position at least so far as Commonwealth police officers driving motor vehicles are concerned and in respect of claims of the class referred to in the Statute. It is clear that the provision seeks to grapple with the uniform statutory third party insurance principle rather than to deal with the specific problem of the Enever doctrine. That problem remains for claims against police officers of the Commonwealth. It is a hindrance to claimants and potential claimants as well as a discouragement to claims. </para>
          <para class="block">Statutory Amendments: 217. The United Kingdom Royal Commission on the Police 1962 considered the status of constables. It had before it the submissions of a number of bodies asserting that the doctrine of vicarious liability, dependent upon the ability of a master to give orders to his servants, had been broadened in decisions of the court, so that persons at common law not previously thought to be servants were coming under the umbrella of the vicarious principle. The Commission concluded: (177) </para>
          <para>We are satisfied . . . that to make a police authority vicariously liable for a constable&#39;s actions would not derogate from this status: nor would it confer any power upon a police authority to control his duties. It appears to us that there are good reasons for making this change, and that to alter the present arrangement would be to the advantage of both police and the public. In particular we are impressed by the argument that where a particular constable complained of is not identifiable a member of the public is at present unable to pursue a legal remedy. We recommend, therefore, that a police authority be made liable for the wrongful act of police officers in the same way as the Crown is liable, under the Crown Proceedings Act 1 947, for the wrongful acts of an officer of the Crown. 218. As a consequence of the Royal Commission&#39;s recommendations, section 48 of the Police Act 1964 was enacted and it modifies the common law in significant respects.

This Commission has received submissions urging the adoption in this country of principles similar to those now to be found in section 48 of the English Police Act. ( 1 78) It has been urged upon the Commission that so long as the member of the Australia Police has acted in a proper and responsible manner, he should be indemnified for any damages and costs recovered against him when sued for a civil wrong. 220. Academic opinion in Australia has also favoured the acceptance of the English reform. Assistant Professor M. R. Goode has drawn attention to the injustices created by the present common law position (179), and especially to the fact that if the police offender is of limited means, a vindicated plaintiff may be left with a meaningless victory. There can be little doubt that the uncertainty of receiving the fruits of victory amounts to a substantial discouragement to the bringing of justifiable actions. Furthermore, Goode draws attention to the fact that failure to identify the particular police officer who has committed the ton effectively precludes the bringing of any action at all. The right to bring an action against a police constable personally is meaningless where a cause of action arises, say, in a scuffle: where one policeman may look like another and where some may be in plain clothes and others may not bear their identification. 221. Due weight has been given to the consideration that the provision of indemnity to a police constable may indirectly diminish deterrence from wrongful conduct and torts. This argument was urged upon the Royal Commission in England. ( 1 80) For substantially the same reasons as were advanced by those Commissioners we feel that the effect on deterrence is either insignificant or not such as can be fairly weighed against the injustices to both claimant and policeman that are presented by the present legal position. If practices are tolerated or encouraged despite their unlawfullness, it is to the policy maker that deterrence should be aimed. </para>

          </list>
          <para class="block">Furthermore, if a member of the Australia Police acts tortiously against a member of the public it can never be in the interests of the force that a member of the community should go uncompensated because of the anomalous state of the law. Moreover, we doubt that the provision of indemnity will remove restraints from an individual constable. Consider the reaction in a disciplined force of a successful damages claim against a constable and the response to that constable&#39;s having made the community suffer the burden of his wrong. (181) 222. Professor Atiyah has advanced a number of criticisms of a technical nature concerning the form of section 48 ( 1 ) which he draws to the attention of future draftsmen of provisions of this kind. ( 182) To these criticisms Assistant Professor Goode has added another. ( 1 83 ) The Commission has given careful considerations to these criticisms. It is not necessary to deal with them here. </para>
          <para class="block">Argument and conclusion- 223. Those who oppose the introduction of the vicarious liability principle to police constables assert basically the position asserted by the common law cases. The position in Australia and England referred to above is closely paralleled by the common law decision in the United States. (184) It is argued that it is unjust that the community at large should have to bear the burden of paying for the consequences of the illegal acts of an individual policeman and that a police officer, who is employed to keep the Queen&#39;s peace, whenever he commits a wrongful act which sounds in damages against a member of the public, is acting outside the scope of his duties and ought not to be indemnified. It is asserted that to provide indemnity will attack the independence of individual police officers, further abridging their special relationship to the Crown. It is asserted that a system which allows a citizen to sue the Government for alleged tort&#39;s on unidentified police officers is open to abuse and fraudulent claims. Against these arguments the Commission has had to consider the plain injustice inherrent in the present state of the law. A member of the public who has suffered injury or damage ought to receive just compensation in every case. It is this principle which is behind the extension of the vicarious liability rule in the common law itself and the passage of legislation, of which the Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Act 1 959 is but one example. 224. In reality most police functions nowadays (and one might say particularly in specialised police divisions such as proposed for the Australia Police) are performed in the pursuance of authority and instructions from the member&#39;s superiors. The establishment of responsibility for successful claims against the police will tend to ensure an even more stringent control by police superiors over their officers. In this way discipline, far from being impeded by the Commission&#39;s proposal, will most likely be strengthened. 225. It is necessary here to repeat that the Commission has not had before it the provisions of the proposed Australia Police Bill. The conclusions advanced that vicarious liability should be established by statute for the acts and omissions of the police officers assumes, of course, that the relationship between the constable and the Crown remains, technically, the same as it has been in the past. If the Police Bill works a change upon this relationship and, for example, either totally or substantially establishes a relationship of master and servant in the case of members of the Australia Police, much of what is here recommended may become unnecessary. This Pan is advanced upon the premise that the relationship remains substantially that set out in <inline font-style="italic">Enever&#39;s Case.</inline> The importance of this question for the issue in hand and other considerations has been drawn to the attention of the Department and Parliamentary Counsel. 226. The Commission&#39;s recommendation is that members of the public should be given a statutory right to recover from the Government in respect of the tortious acts of police officers, as if the relationship existed of master and servant. In the Commission&#39;s view, the damages, if recovered against a member of the Australia Police, should be borne in the first instance by Australia. The Commission is not of the view that a separate fund ought to be established nor is it of the opinion that police officers generally ought to be required to contribute to such a fund. 227. Three ancillary matters arise for consideration. The first arises from the objection that a right to claim damages in respect of an unidentified police officer will give rise to an unjustified and fraudulent claim against the public purse which ought to be prevented. The Commission has been urged to provide some protection by requiring a notice of intended action within a limited time. At present Regulation 59 of the Commonwealth Police Regulations provides for the limitations of actions against certain police officers for a notice of intended action. Normally claims against an unidentified servant of an employer do not require a notice of action. Whether or not such servant existed has to be resolved as a factual element in the trial of the plaintiff&#39;s claim. The claim will normally be discovered in particulars at a relatively early stage in the proceedings, if not asserted in the statement of claim. Having regard to this consideration, the injustices which such notices of action can work on litigants imperfectly advised and the recent legislative policy of the Australian Parliament in these matters, the Commission is not disposed to recommend the provision of such a requirement here. 228. In Australia courts can award exemplary damages in actions against police officers for wrongful arrest, malicious prosecution and the like.( 185) Whilst, in the Commission&#39;s view, it is right that the public purse should bear the burden of damages awarded against a member of the Australia Police for his acts and omissions, it is not felt that it would be proper to burden Australia with punitive damages, where such damages were thought proper. Accordingly the Commission proposes that the legislation should make it clear that Australia is liable in respect of torts committed by members of the Australia Police in the performance or purported performance of their function in like manner as a master is liable in respect of torts committed by his servants in the course of their employment. However the legislation should also provide that punitive or exemplary damages shall not be recovered from Australia in this regard. Such damages should only be recoverable from the individual police officer himself. 229. Finally, it would seem appropriate and desirable to provide that Australia, having borne the burden of damages (other than punitive damages) awarded against a member of the police should be entitled to recover such damages from that member, in proceedings brought for that purpose. It is desirable to so provide in order to spell out the liability of the police officer in respect of his tortious act. The enforcement of that liability may rest in the discretion of his superiors, reviewing all the facts when they are known. But the discretion should be seen to be a discretion to relieve him of a liability spelt out in the statue. It may be that, on ordinary principles a right to indemnity would accrue to Australia upon payment of the judgment sum to the successful plaintiff. But an express definition of the right to indemnity carries practical advantages. ( 1 74) ( 1 905 ) 3 C.L.R. 969 at 975. (1 75)ibid., p. 99 1.

          <para>- I place on record that I think that the use of the word &#39;Federal&#39; is improper. It compounds some of the difficulties we have created for citizens in knowing what it means. The word &#39;Commonwealth&#39; should have been used. I believe that the use of the word &#39;Federal&#39; is incorrect in this sense. The proposed new police force is not really a federation of anything. Perhaps the use of the word Federal&#39; rather than &#39;Commonwealth&#39; has something to do with the present situation. Commonwealth&#39; is a good word. It ought to be used more frequently in Australian Acts. </para>

              <para>- As honourable members will know, a series of companies with which I am associated have been subject to investigation. The first investigation into the affairs of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd, Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Ltd, Allan Walsh Pty Ltd, G. Beavan Pty Ltd, and Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd was instigated by me with the firm of chartered accountants, Messrs George Sinclair, Haylen and Co. Although bearing in part the name of my father, the firm is entirely independent of myself and indeed of my late father, the firm having acquired his chartered accountancy practice some years before his death. This investigation was initiated at my request following the report to me of some irregularities in the accounts by the firm Messrs George Sinclair, Haylen and Co., which was first commissioned by me early in 1976 to bring the accounts of all the companies up to date, this being the time after the death of my father when I first accepted responsibility for them. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In the initial report, the accountants advised that the records and accounts of the companies were out of date and had not been kept in accordance with the requirements of the New South Wales Companies Act under which the companies were registered. In addition, it appeared that a number of cheques had not been correctly identified by the record on the cheque butt. The solicitors for the companies, Messrs Blake and Ring, and the accountants, Messrs George Sinclair, Haylen and Co., thereupon notified the Commissioner of Taxation on my behalf and the accountants notified the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales. A considerable time later a second investigation was commenced. This was on Monday, 22 May 1978 when the New South Wales Attorney-General appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr M.</inline> Finnane a Special Inspector under the New South Wales Company&#39;s Act. It appears that, and I quote the newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> of 21 May 1978: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Corporate Affairs Commission opened an (earlier) investigation into the companies in September 1 976 &#39;after certain information&#39; had been received. The Commission reported to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walker</inline> there was no evidence of any wrong-doing. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As I say, I am quoting the newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> of 21 May 1978. Nonetheless, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> Was appointed and, as far as I am aware is still to report. However, from the time of my first instruction to Messrs George Sinclair, Haylen and Co., that firm, together with two other firms of accountants, Messrs Wilson, Bishop, Bowes, and Craig, and Messrs Kevin Dunlop and Associates, continued their separate investigation. This investigation is now complete, together with accounts of all the companies up to 30 June 1978. </para>
          <para>These accounts have not yet been cleared by the directors or presented to the adjourned annual general meetings of the respective companies. However, in view of information which has come to me about the reported purchase by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper of confidential documents relating to the investigation and which, I understand, are to be published in tomorrow&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> I seek to make this statement tonight. </para>
          <para>It had, of course, been my intention to make a full statement to the House when all the details are available. This is still not so as settlement as well as the ratification of the accounts is still to be completed. Details of the accounts will, of course, be available when lodged with the Corporate Affairs Commission as the accounts obviously cannot be audited. As the accounts have not yet been cleared by the respective companies, I am not at liberty to reveal their full detail tonight. However, I can advise some relevant particulars of the investigation. </para>

          <para>I point out that $250,093.34 is shown in the 1978 group accounts of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd as a loan to Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd. This transaction was made to establish liability not to settle the amount outstanding. Together with amounts standing to the credit of Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd and the estate of the late George Sinclair of about $174,000 in the accounts these sums remain to be settled between the three family shareholders of the companies. A further sum of $292,031 is identified as losses by misappropriation. That is in the accounts for the year ended 30 June 1978. With respect to this sum, I have written, as trustee of the estate of the late George Sinclair, to the directors of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd on 1 1 April, 1979. 1 quote: </para>

            <para>Subject to adjustments yet to be determined between the shareholders and directors of the companies, I accept responsibility for the repayment of this amount as trustee of the estate of the late George Sinclair. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I point out that $4,000 in all in this earlier period is shown as having been paid into my personal account in two lots of $2,000. </para>
          <para>This money was repaid as soon as its source was identified by investigating accountants. Other than that the money had been paid into my account by my father, I had not previously been aware of its origin. </para>
          <para>As a result of the amounts identified as losses by misappropriation, there has been an understatement of income in the accounts of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd, Allan Walsh Pty Ltd, and Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Ltd for company tax purposes. The report of the investigating accountants reveals that the operating profit before taxation of the group for the years 30 June 1 96 1 to 30 June 1972 inclusive as per financial accounts for those years had been understated by $413,204. Provision has been made in the financial accounts for taxation penalties of $1 13,500 which will be payable by the group for this understatement of income and for late lodgement of company tax returns. The amounts, of course, remain to be assessed and the amount is only the assessment as determined by the view of the investigating accountants. The accounts also identify future income tax benefits calculated at current rates of company tax (a) in respect of provisions for long service leave, holiday and sick pay, $13,865; (b) in respect of losses by misappropriation charged in the accounts and not ascertained until after balance date, $31,252; and (c) in respect of taxation losses carried forward at balance date, $32,857: This is a total of $77,974. The companies entitlement to these benefits is qualified in the accounts by a number of conditions which are set out by the accountants. </para>
          <para>As my father is deceased, it has not been possible to identify the detail of the amounts shown as losses by misappropriation or of those shown as losses deemed to be by misappropriation, or determine finally the reason for or the exact nature of these payments. However, in order to ensure complete equity between the parties I have, as I will explain briefly, accepted responsibility for the lot. How they were made and to where was totally unknown to all surviving directors and shareholders until revealed by the investigation of the accountants. Subsequent to my father&#39;s death, a number of loans were made by the companies to myself, the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd, and other shareholders. The <inline font-style="italic">loans to</inline> myself and the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd have been repaid with interest, other than for amounts now identified as loans but which were intended as and when advanced to the individual shareholders were identified as advances against dividends. Monies borrowed by me and the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd attracted interest from the date on which each loan was taken out until repayment at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. They were each loans at call. The completion of necessary formal ties required under the New South Wales Companies Act and the lodging of necessary annual reports and accounts has not yet been completed. Accordingly, some relevant details cannot yet be revealed. Equally, at this stage, I make no comment on the separate investigation being undertaken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr M.</inline> Finnane. </para>
          <para>I stress, as on the earlier occasions when the matter has been canvassed in this House, the companies are proprietary companies and the details are correctly for the three shareholder families alone to resolve. Since my father&#39;s death, there has been detailed consultation between all the shareholders, the investigating accountants, solicitors, and counsel for each party, taxation authorities, and representatives of the Corporate Affairs Commission. There is no matter affecting the public interest other than in the liability for taxation, tax benefits claimed, and the statutory obligations under the relevant Company&#39;s Act. These matters have all been pursued independently altogether of myself in accordance with advice that has been previously tabled in this House by a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Reilly,</inline> the Commissioner of Taxation which verifies that statement. With appropriate professional advice, every effort has been made by me and my fellow directors to regularise the affairs of all the companies as expeditiously yet as accurately as possible in spite of the death of two of the original shareholders and the incapacity of the third and the fact that many of the documents necessary to complete these accounts dating back, as I say, more than 20 years, have not been available. All tax liabilities currently assessed and all outstanding accounts have been paid as they fell due. None as far as I am aware is currently outstanding other than in the normal course of business or with respect to tax liability as yet to be assessed. I deeply, personally, regret the circumstances of the amounts identified as losses by misappropriation and am in negotiation with other shareholders to resolve all matters outstanding between us. The companies were developed from very small beginnings by my father and I have no doubt that were he alive an explanation would have been forthcoming of these transactions. Although not personally liable for the losses by misappropriation in the strictly legal sense, I believe there is no other fit and proper action that I can take than to ensure that they are repaid and that no shareholder suffers because of actions of which none of us were aware; I certainly was not. </para>

            <para>-There are clearly still many, many questions that have to be answered. The first one is: Why is it that an article which may or may not appear in a national newspaper tomorrow morning flushes out this statement tonight? Why is it that we were within 24 hours of this Parliament&#39;s going into recess with this grave statement- these grave allegations against the Minister- still hanging over him without any explanation to this Parliament? I remind this House that 24 November last year, seven months ago, was the last time that the Opposition raised the question in this House. On that occasion it had been 34 months since these problems first came to the fore. It is now 41 months since we first learnt of the defalcations that have taken place, since, indeed, all the suspicions that must be aroused further by this statement from the Minister first came to light. Many of the questions which I raised in this Parliament on 24 November 1978 are questions that still have to be answered. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first one is the one I have alluded to. Why has it taken 41 months for this sort of statement to be made? And it is only the first instalment. Why indeed does it have to be an article which may be published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> tomorrow that has flushed out this statement? That is my first question. The second question is: Why has this Minister made misleading statements about this affair, not only in this House but also on the Willesee program on a previous occasion and in answers to questions asked by the former Leader of the Opposition. I can go through some of these quotations. The Minister said on 12 October 1977: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">It has been reported that there is a deficiency of more than $250,000 in company funds. There are no amounts outstanding which have not been accounted for within the company or between the shareholders. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a quotation from this Minister himself on one of these occasions. </para>
          <para>There were many other occasions. I have mentioned the Willesee program. I mentioned the questions put by the former Leader of the Opposition. These are all to be found detailed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 24 November 1978, on page 3402 and following pages. I need not go further into them tonight. Why have we not had drawn to the attention of this House the national significance of these defalcations? There is the amount of tax that has been forgone because of the $542,125 which is now a claim against these companies. Why was that not drawn to the attention of this Parliament before? Why indeed did the Minister get up tonight and pretend that this was a personal explanation when there are these matters of national concern involved in these affairs? </para>
          <para>Let me continue. Maybe I could just interpose here that this is not just a question of a fair go for the Minister. There is the matter of a fair go for the Australian people, who have a Minister like this involved in the affairs of this country. Let me continue with some of the questions which were raised in the House at that time. To what extent can we be certain that the accountants&#39; report is an independent one, inasmuch as the accountants were the firm of the father of the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party himself? Why have we not got an explanation of the fact that there was a solicitor who was looking after the disparate interests of the many groups involved in this affair? There is no evidence coming forward that the explanation given by the Minister is built on an objective analysis of the affairs as they are today, grave though the admissions are that are in those statements. </para>
          <para>However, I will end on this note. Why indeed is it that we have had the Lynch affair, with that Minister being stood down; the Garland affair, with that Minister being stood down when grave allegations were made against him; the Robinson affair, with that Minister being stood down when there were matters like this hanging over his head; not to mention the Withers affair as well? There probably would be others I could mention if I were not speaking on the spur of the moment. Why is it that this Minister, with an amount of over half a million dollars at stake, with at least $200,000 of that being public funds because of the claims for taxation, has not stood down and has not taken his medicine as the others had to take their medicine during the time of their investigations? I end as I began. We are only just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg. This is only the first instalment. It is a totally unsatisfactory statement as far as I am concerned and, I believe, as far as any objective observer of this scene is concerned. </para>

I should point out, however, that nuclear weapon states do not publicise information about their holdings of nuclear materials for weapons purposes. In nuclear weapon states and in non-nuclear weapons states where International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA) safeguards apply to civil nuclear programs, detailed inventory information is made available to the IAEA, but is confidential to the inspected party and the IAEA. It is only in the event of noncompliance that confidentiality would be set aside and relevant information would be disseminated in accordance with Article XII of the IAEA Statute. </para>

        <para>These figures include passengers travelling on the old APEX, new APEX, Budget, APOW and GIT fares. They do not include Lufthansa figures as these have not yet been made available. These figures, covering the first two months in which new low fares applied, reflect pent-up demand. It is expected that inward and outward passenger movements will even out as the pent-up demand diminishes. This trend is already reflected in the early forward booking figures for the next few months. </para>

The survey is continuing at a cost of $ 1 6,250 per quarter </para>
        <para>Bteween 1975 and 1 977 quarterly surveys were conducted by my Department (within the Building Division of the former Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development) in co-operation with the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors ( (AFCC). The survey was of AFCC members, and its purpose was to measure current work-loads, activity and employment in the civil engineering sectors for which no suitable official statistics were available at that stage. The survey has been completed; it was not significant and not separately costed, and was funded from administrative overheads. </para>
        <para>Since June 1975 on a quarterly basis my Department has conducted a survey, in association with the Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors, monitoring work-loads in quantity surveyors &#39; offices.

        <para>The submission did not include any statements on the advisability of beef carcase classification as this subject was considered by the Corporation to be outside the terms of reference of the Inquiry. Beef classification has no impact on current slaughtering and processing charges as it is still in a limited trial stage.

These discussions did not cover classification in any detail and staff involved in carcase classification studies did not participate. </para>

This included Western Australia where, at the time of the Inquiry, manual beef carcase classification trials were in progress at three commercial abattoirs. I understand that, in the time available, members of the Tribunal were unable to visit some important beef cattle areas, including Western Australia. The Tribunal held discussions, however with representatives of organisations and enterprises involved with meat production and marketing in that State and received submissions from three Western Australian organisations. </para>

The amendment in respect of public roads is not being proceeded with because Land Councils have not yet completed consultations with affected communities, and the amendment in respect of minerals, which is merely intended to clarify ownership, in no way deprives Aboriginal people of rights they currently have under the Act. </para>

          <item label="(">
            <para>1 ) Yes. The Industries Assistance Commission, in its draft report on Grapes and Wine, found that whereas in the early 1970s the stocks/sales ratio of dry red table wine varied between 3:1 and 3.5:1 since the mid-1970s it has been about 4:1. In its April 1979 report on The Australian Grape and Wine Industry, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) found that as at 30 June 1978 80 per cent of wineries considered their 1978 red wine stock levels were too high and, while an improvement in the stocks situation was occurring, 63 per cent expected that their 1979 red wine stocks would be too high. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(2">
            <para>) There is concern in the industry over the surplus of red wine and also of the surplus of wine grapes which in the 1 979 vintage was, according to industry sources, about 30,000 tonnes and was concentrated in the South Australian producing regions. As mentioned above, wineries are taking steps to bring stocks of red wines into balance with sales. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>The BAE concluded in the report mentioned in (1 ) that aggregate demand and supply (of grapes) will be in balance in the next few years at around 770,000 to 780,000 tonnes given normal seasons. This does not take account of supply/demand relationships for any particular variety of grape and moreover it should be noted that balance could be upset by substantial annual yield fluctuations due to climatic factors&#39;. </para>
        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(3)">
            <para>The industry is active in seeking export markets for Australian wine. The wine companies have agents in many overseas markets and their efforts are supplemented by the activities of the Australian Wine Board and the Trade Commissioner Service. The Government is encouraging exports under the recently introduced Export Now program while continuing to provide funds through the Overseas Trade Promotion Committee, the Export Market Development Grants Scheme and the Export Expansion Grants Scheme. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>These activities are made against a background of exports that arc often at cut-prices from wine industries in the European Community and competition from Eastern Europe which may be more related to gaining hard currencies than making economic sales. Low prices and high shipping costs from Australia limit opportunities to realise export sales. I understand that in one instance in order to gain a sale for fortifying spirit in Europe, Australian producers would have been required to sell at a price which would not cover manufacturing costs let alone the value ofthe grapes. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>In directing my question to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, I refer to action currently being taken concerning the misuse of solicitors&#39; trust funds by legal practitioners in New South Wales. I ask the Minister: Can he give an assurance that solicitors&#39; trust funds in the Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Capital Territory are being administered and maintained according to the law? Is he satisfied that the present arrangements for the auditing of solicitors&#39; trust funds in the Australian Capital Territory are adequate to protect the public- interest? Is he aware that solicitors in the Australian Capital Territory are permitted to nominate their own auditors? In view of the New South Wales experience, will he consider reviewing the existing arrangements so that auditors of solicitors&#39; trust funds in the Australian Capital Territory arc made accountable to the public rather than to the Law Society, as is the case in New South Wales? </para>

        <para>The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member&#39;s question: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Law Society of the Australian Capital Territory is responsible, under the Legal Practitioners Ordinance of the Territory, for the general oversight of administration and maintenance of solicitors&#39; trust accounts. I have no reason to believe that the relevant law is not being observed. </para>
          <para>The present arrangements for the auditing 6f solicitor&#39;s trust accounts seem adequate to protect the public interest but that is not to say that they are incapable of improvement. A Bill for an Ordinance to amend the Legal Practitioners Ordinance, which I referred to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly for consideration late last year, contains some amendments in this area. The Bill was recently approved by the Assembly and will soon become law. My Department will also give close attention to the matters raised by the honourable member in the course of a general review of the Ordinance that is now in progress. Regard will be given to the relevant laws in force in the States and proposed reforms of them in the course of that review. </para>
