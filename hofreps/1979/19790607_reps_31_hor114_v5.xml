        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that many Australians are concerned with the inadequacy of Overseas Aid, both Government and Private as well as with support for local charities. Such Aid is saving precious lives, giving undernourished and homeless people encouragement and help, bringing malnourished children to health, education and a better life, giving people friendship and a new hope. A crusade of compassion highlights the hope of a brighter and kindlier world in the International Year of the Child-  1 979. </para>
        <para class="block">We therefore respectfully request that the Commonwealth Government provide some incentive to encourage such Aid by making the same tax concessions to approved voluntary overseas aid organisations, as are already provided for charities working within Australia. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Acting Speaker,</inline>I take a point of order. Last night the Minister for Primary Industry came into the House and under Standing Orders voluntarily chose to make a statement which raised issues before the Parliament which clearly the honourable gentleman thought went to his credit as a Minister. As the Minister has brought forward those matters, there is nothing in this question which is not directly related to the Minister&#39;s statement to the House. Standing Orders were suspended to allow him to make his statement. The matter was canvassed. The issue was raised by the Minister and the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> spoke on it. Debate took place. The effect of your ruling- with respect, it would create an unseemly precedent- is that a matter which is before the Parliament, having been raised by a Minister, and is the subject of debate in the House, where certain facts have been alleged and have become the property of the House, cannot now become the subject of a question in this Parliament. </para>

First of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, as</inline> you have not heard the question, I cannot see how you could possibly say that it reflects on the Minister. My second point ishere I rely on your own statement in respect of the Standing Orders- that a question is in order if it is related to public affairs with which the Minister is officially connected. This matter is a public affair because the Minister, by his statement in the House last night, made it a public affair. It became the property of the House by virtue of the suspension of Standing Orders and the Minister, having made it the property of the House by his own actions, can in no way say that he is not officially connected with it. That being so, under the Standing Orders will you please stand him up? </para>

              <para>-Order! The House will come to order. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports raised a point of order on which I have ruled. The matter was not then open for debate. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports insisted on arguing the matter further on the basis that I had not heard his point of order in full. The Chair is not required to allow an honourable member to advance a question or a point of order beyond the stage where it becomes apparent that it is in contravention of the Standing Orders. It is not necessary that the member be allowed to speak at length. </para>

              <para>- There could not be a more serious matter before the Parliament than that which is being discussed now. I draw your attention to Standing Order 144, paragraph (a) of which says that questions should not ask Ministers for an expression of opinion. Paragraph (b) says that questions should not ask Ministers &#39;to announce the Government&#39;s policy, but may seek an explanation regarding the policy of the Government and its application and may ask the Prime Minister whether a Minister&#39;s statement in the House represents Government Policy&#39;. Last night the House suspended the Standing Orders of this Parliament to enable the Minister to make a statement. I put it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> that there is every right under that Standing Order for the question relating to the Minister&#39;s statement to be directed to the Prime Minister and to the Minister. </para>

I think it may be helpful if you refer to that point also in relation to this question and others that may be asked on the same subject as I submit that the matter has been debated in this session, and that is a lot more than happens in other parliaments around this country, particularly in New South Wales. </para>

This is a matter which should properly be tested in the Parliament and the evidence should be extracted. On that score, as the first point that I want to make, I believe that you should allow the question. It is, as one of my colleagues has pointed out, a matter of the gravest importance that at all times Ministers of the Crown should behave with complete propriety. No one has made a greater fetish of that principle in word, if not in deed, than the Prime Minister. Let me remind you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> of a ruling, which seems to be analogous, of the  Speaker  of this House given on 25 October when I raised a question in this House in relation to the Minister for Primary Industry and a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> weekly periodical about the investigation into his business activity and the possible breaches of company law. A point of order was taken by the Government Whip to the effect that the question was inadmissible because it did not have anything to do with the Prime Minister having to be responsible for such matters in this House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">We would be in a most curious position if the private conduct of a Minister which appears to have been sullied in some sort of serious way was not a matter of concern for this Parliament. It should not be a matter of concern just for the Prime Minister or one or two other people in the Parliament. Last night the Minister for Primary Industry in fact established beyond any doubt that this matter should be properly tested in this Parliament. He was flushed out by a daily newspaper. </para>

            <para>- I have moved this motion with regret. I believe that it is the duty of the Chair to protect the prerogatives of the Parliament and the rights of individual members. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> let me remind you of the events as they occurred last night in this House. On that occasion the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> indicated to the Parliament that he knew certain information was to be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> a Melbourne daily newspaper. He chose to come into the Parliament to make a lengthy and detailed personal statement to the House. Having made that statement, a series of procedures occurred which involved the suspension of Standing Orders so that the issue which the Minister for Primary Industry had raised could be the subject of consideration and debate in the Parliament. That is the process that occurred. Those procedures had the concurrence of all members of this House including Government members. The Minister for Primary Industry then chose to make his statement and some of the issues which were raised by him were then joined. A debate took place in respect of some of those issues. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The first point I make is that the actions of the Minister were related to his ministerial office. He felt so deeply about and so personally involved in the matter, that clearly the allegations he knew would appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> forced him to make his personal statement to the Parliament. He was concerned to establish in this Parliament his credibility and his fitness to hold office as a Minister. That was the purpose of his statement. No one forced him to make the statement; he chose to act in that way. Now we are in an extraordinary situation where we have a Minister who says: &#39;My credibility as a Minister is in issue. I will use the forms of the House to make a statement to the House. We will suspend Standing Orders so that the issues that I have raised can then be debated&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, at</inline> that stage every statement made by the Minister became the property of the House. Every fact that is alleged becomes a matter of public knowledge and the property of the House. What an extraordinary ruling you have given, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker.</inline> What an extraordinary position for the Chair to take when it says: &#39;All right, these issues have been joined. These facts have been asserted and are matters of public property and the property of the House; but what a terrible thing it would be if a member of the Opposition were to ask a question about any one of those facts &#39;. </para>
        <para>Let me remind you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker-</inline> what I am bound to say unfortunately goes to the credibility of the Chair- it was not as if you had even listened to the question I put to the Minister. I had not got through the first sentence. I tried to inform you, sir, that every aspect of my question was directly related not to some newspaper article, not to something that I heard in gossip outside the Parliament, but to the statement made by the Minister in the House. What you are endeavouring to tell the Parliament, with great respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> is that these facts which are alleged to the House, which are the property of the House, cannot now be the subject of a question which goes to the heart and to the detail of the facts alleged by the Minister in the Parliament. I am bound to say- I say it with regret- that that does not involve the protection of the rights of the members of this institution. I am bound to say, with concern, that if it were to go unchallenged there is only one conclusion that any honourable member on this side of the House could reach and that is that the Chair was being used for the purposes of protecting a Minister by not allowing any proper public examination of the issues which the Minister himself raised. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, we</inline>all know that the Government has got the numbers, but we on this side of the House are entitled to look to the Chair to protect the rights of this Parliament because those rights concern the rights of the Australian people. We would be creating a unique precedent if, having raised this matter, sir, you then proceed to rule as you did. This ruling is then binding upon this Parliament. Occupants of the Chair, as a matter of practice and procedure, look to past rulings for a precedent. What an extraordinary ruling. If you look, sir, at Standing Order 142, it is perfectly clear. It states: </para>

            <para>- The point I am concerned to make is that it was open to the Minister, with all his knowledge, not to make any statement to the House until he had read what was in the newspaper. If he was asserting that this was entirely a private matter, a matter relating to family companies in which his credibility was not involved in any way at all, that it did not go either to the nature of the public office that he holds or his capacity to perform that function, then it was not necessary for him to make any statement at all to the Parliament. Having made the statement, I put it that the Minister is estopped from saying to anybody in the community that this is not now a matter of public concern, that it is not a public affair with which he is officially connected. The very nature of the statement made last night by the Minister was an endeavour to assert to the House that his personal credibility was not in issue in relation to what had occurred in respect of these private family companies which involved massive defalcation and matters of real concern to the Taxation Commissioner. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The Minister made the statement because he knew that if the information in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> were allowed to go unanswered then his credibility would be involved. I put it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> that having chosen voluntarily to raise the matter in the way in which he did, he then made that matter a public affair, and a public affair with which he is, to use the terminology of the Standing Order, &#39;officially connected&#39;. To suggest otherwise is to place the Parliament in a completely impossible position. It would mean that the procedures and the rules of this House could be used by Ministers to make all sorts of statements and allegations and the Chair then could say: &#39;But you cannot be asked questions about it&#39;. If that ruling were allowed to stand it would bring disgrace and dishonour to this Parliament and disgrace and dishonour to the Chair. </para>
        <para>I believe that the Minister, having chosen the course of action that he did, has placed his own credibility on the line, and that is fair enough. Further, it would be a matter of considerable injustice to the Minister, he having placed his credibility on the line, if we were to adopt some kind of sleazy procedure to say: &#39;Well, having made that statement, he is not subject to any further questioning&#39;. This Opposition will not be a party to those kinds of sleazy procedures. We will not be a party - </para>

            <para>- I will put it in another way. It would not be just or appropriate for any Minister to find himself in a situation where the procedures that are adopted by the House are so unique, so novel, so without precedent, that any right thinking citizen could reach a conclusion only that the procedures of the House were being bent and abused for the purposes of protecting the Minister. I say that without meaning to give any offence to anyone at all. If this precedent is allowed to stand, this Parliament will become a mockery. We can forget the Westminster system. We can forget the institutions. The importance of the Chair to the Parliament is that ultimately it stands to protect the rights of the individual member and to see that the forms and processes of the House are not abused. If this ruling stands, those processes and those procedures will have been not merely abused, they will have been the subject of gross abuse. This Parliament will have adopted a procedure which will reflect grossly not only upon this institution but also upon the Minister concerned and upon the Government of the day. More importantly, it will lower and demean this Parliament as an institution in the eyes of the Australian people. </para>

In terms of our responsibilities to this Parliament and the nation we are all connected under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia is quite clear in relation to our eligibility to sit here. It says succinctly that a person who is convicted of a crime for which the penalty is imprisonment for 12 months or more is ineligible either to contest a seat for the Parliament or to sit in the Parliament. Now, that is clear and unambiguous. In the case of the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> no one is suggesting that he has been convicted of such an offence: But what we are saying is that there is clear evidence that he is the subject of investigation for at least 12 breaches of the New South Wales Companies Act.

            <para>-Mr Acting  Speaker,  with respect, I am trying to explain to you how the Minister comes to be officially connected as a matter of public affair in terms of the question which has been raised. What I am saying to you is: Should it transpire that the Minister were to be charged and found guilty of any of these offences where the penalty exceeds 12 months imprisonment for a criminal indictment, he would be ineligible to sit here. What I am putting to you is that, therefore, it is entirely proper for members of the Opposition to raise questions on this matter. What we are putting to you is in terms of principles which have been enunciated by the Prime Minister. It is quite inappropriate, if the Prime Minister is to claim sincerity and to assert consistency in practice, for the Minister for Primary Industry to remain in this House while those investigations are under way. Furthermore, while he retains his position in this House, in spite of these investigations, the proceedings of this House will be regularly punctuated and disrupted by questions which will arise because of public comment in association with these investigations. That is exactly what has happened on this occasion. It has happened on earlier occasions. The debate on each occasion arose in this House because of public commentary. Quite properly, it is a matter of public comment and concern and it will continue to be so. The House should not be distracted in this way. The Prime Minister not only followed the principles he had been enunciating earlier but also followed those principles very firmly in practice late last year when he suspended the Minister for Finance. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Bendigo behaves like a block gauleiter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> the point I am putting to you is that last year the Prime Minister suspended the Minister for Finance because of an inquiry which was then under way in relation to allegations that went to the heart of the propriety of conduct of Ministers in the Government. That was proper in our view. On this occasion that practice has not been followed. I put it to you squarely that, in fact, the evidence so far available suggests very strongly that the investigation affecting the Minister for Primary Industry is of a much more serious nature than the one to which I have referred and that the implications are much wider reaching than they were on that occasion. </para>

            <para>-The Leader of the Opposition is rather testing the patience of the Chair in so much as his remarks are expanding into an area not encompassed by this question. It must be borne in mind that the question simply calls for a debate on whether the ruling of the Chair was right and proper under the circumstances relating to Questions without Notice. The matter to which the Leader of the Opposition is referring now would be much more appropriate to a substantive motion. </para>

        <para class="block">He then allowed questions on this matter which we are raising today. It is quite clear that the private conduct of the Minister not only is a matter quite properly before the Parliament and for which the Minister should be answerable to the Parliament under his obligations which are defined and which cover all honourable members within the Constitution, but also it is a matter of great concern to the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> I suggest that it should be of concern to you too. It is because of that that there is this contrivance afoot today, designed to subvert the proper conduct of this House aimed at making the Minister accountable in a way which is quite proper. The Minister cannot seek to rig the numbers to suit himself. He cannot seek to stack the cards the way he did last night by coming into the House, peremptorily, making a statement and then withdrawing, and leaving the matter up in the air in the way in which he did. He has no understanding of how this House functions. He has no appreciation of the concern that is generated by this sort of activity outside the Parliament in the wider community. This Parliament cannot function unless there is proper conduct. </para>

          <para>- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding)</inline> have endeavoured this morning, in contrast to the approach that was adopted last night, to protest outrage and concern about the forms of the House. They have tried to demonstrate that what is involved is a high matter of parliamentary principle. I would like to say at the very outset that there is one thing that this debate is not about. It is not about the unwillingness of the Leader of the House ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair)</inline> to respond to debate about the subject of investigations into a number of companies of which he happens to be the director. I remind you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> and all members of the Opposition, that last night the Leader of the House quite properly sought leave and was given leave under Standing Order 64 to make a statement. It was only as a result of a suspension of Standing Orders being moved by the Opposition and a willingness on the part of the Leader of the House to allow the Opposition to respond to his statement that the provisions of Standing Order 64 were not availed of. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>This debate is simply about whether a ruling which was made by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> under a combination of Standing Orders 142, 144 and 153 should be upheld. The principle involved in that ruling is a very simple one, that is, whether or not a matter which can only be the subject of a substantive motion in respect of an individual can be the subject of a question at Question Time. It is not about anything else. It is certainly not about the unwillingness of my right honourable friend to respond to the matters that the Opposition has raised. If there is one thing that has characterised the proceedings of the last few months as to the investigation into a number of companies with which my right honourable friend is connected, it is the way in which he has been the subject of an absolutely shameful trial by leak, innuendo and smear.

            <para>-I repeat that this motion is not about the unwillingness of the Government, the Leader of the House, myself or any other member of the Government to have these matters debated.

The more that the honourable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howe),</inline> the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> or the other noise makers of the Opposition try to stop me speaking, the more apparent it becomes that members of the Opposition do not want an honest debate about the conduct of the Leader of the House.

        <para class="block">Ports, they are trying to uphold. As I said earlier, the whole affair has subjected my right honourable friend to a trial by innuendo, smear and false accusation. The forms of the House are designed to protect honourable members. They are also designed to enable a proper debate on matters bearing upon the public affairs of this country. I say to the Opposition that we have no objection to its moving a substantive motion. We will debate it quite willingly and openly, just as the Leader of the House was prepared to have debated the statement that he made last night. We will not allow members of the Opposition to rape the Standing Orders of this House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> I draw your attention to page 328 of May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice.</inline> On the subject of personal reflections May said: </para>

It is not about the matters involved in the investigation of the companies of which the Leader of the House is a director. It is simply about that very important parliamentary principle. It is there for a combination of reasons. It is there to stop people being subjected to a form of parliamentary trial without being given particulars of charges. It is also put there to enable a proper process whereby members on either side of the House may bring forward substantive motions. </para>

          <para>I remind the House that Standing Orders and long established practices regulate the manner of debate on these matters. 1 will state them clearly to the House so that there can be no doubt about their meaning and intent. First, Standing Order 1 42 provides that a question may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which he is officially connected or to any matter of  adminstration  for which he is responsible. May&#39;s Parliamentary Practice, page 331, which this House uses as a guide, further amplifies this rule by stating that a question may not be asked which deals with the action of a Minister for which he is not responsible to Parliament. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline>then goes on to explain exactly what I have just put to you, sir, and that is, that where a question is asked of a person in respect of whom a criticism or a challenge can be made only by way of substantive motion, that question is not in order, and it has nothing whatever to do with the question of whether a substantive motion can be used. It is not put there to allow Ministers to escape public scrutiny for matters on which there ought to be some public scrutiny. </para>

So this is simply about a very important parliamentary principle, a principle that is designed to enable proper parliamentary scrutiny of Ministers, but at the same time to give to Ministers, in the words that members of the Opposition have used in this debate, &#39; a fair go &#39;. &#39; A fair go &#39; means that if members of the Opposition have a complaint against the Leader of the House or against any other member of the Government front bench, they should move a substantive motion and have the courage to give particulars of their charge. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Acting Speaker,</inline>I take a point of order. I very much regret having to raise this point of order but there have been a number of remarks made during this debate and recently in which words that are quite unparliamentary were uttered by members opposite. Part of the reason for their being uttered is to get them into the record, whether or not they are unparliamentary. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Speaker,</inline> not only to have that unparliamentary language withdrawn but also to have it expunged from the record of these proceedings so that there is no enticement to honourable members opposite to ignore your rulings on points of procedure and to proceed in a way which does this institution a great deal of harm. </para>

          <para class="block">The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> deserves the grave censure of this House for all of the reasons that I have listed in the motion and more which I hope I shall have time to outline. Firstly, on 12 August 1977, the Minister issued a Press release to the Press Gallery which I will quote in full. It stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It has been reported that shareholders of a North Shore Funeral Company, including myself, met today. </para>
            <para>Such a meeting was held. </para>
            <para>I am not a shareholder. I attended as a Director of the Company and as proxy for a family company. </para>
            <para>It has also been reported that there is a deficiency of more than $250,000 in Company funds. </para>
            <para>There are no amounts outstanding which have not been accounted for within the Company or between the shareholders. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So ends that Press release. In the light of what was divulged last night after over 4 1 months of waiting for such a statement, incomplete though it is, could there by anything more misleading than that Press release which went into the Press gallery? Clearly, the Minister was playing with the truth and clearly he was trying to cover up. That was not all. </para>
          <para>Let us now turn to the Mike Willesee interview of 15 August 1977. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Willesee</inline> mentioned the deficiency in funds of $250,000. He was not as up to date as we are now. The Minister&#39;s first words after the Mike Willesee introduction were: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Well, you &#39;ve certainly blown up the story Mike. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Then there was the attempted confusion of seeking to show that he was not a shareholder of the troubled companies. But Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd was a shareholder, and guess who benefited from that? Later on in this interview are some more gems which the Minister gave as answers. First of all let me quote the Willesee question. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But you say the term misappropriation is being misread by people like me, even though it is in the  order of  $250,000 you say. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline>answered: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Yes but you haven&#39;t looked at how much money has been lent to the companies Mike and you don &#39;t know what the net sum is. You see, this is what it is all about. You &#39;ve blown up a sum of $250,000. If you look at the other side of the ledger you will see that there are equally sums, in fact there is more than that, that has been borrowed from the company. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister is once again misleading the public and misleading this Parliament by suggesting that there were not misappropriations at all. I could also quote him on other occasions, not only from that interview but from elsewhereexamples of the great cover up. He answered questions from me in this Parliament and from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> from the member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> and from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the former Leader of the Opposition. Every time one looks at the text of these answers one sees more evidence of the Minister seeking to mislead the people about the true nature of this charge that hangs over him at the present time. </para>
          <para>Let me now turn to the second part of my censure motion, which concerns the Minister&#39;s reluctance to report to the Parliament fully and promptly. The delays cover three and a half years, or just short of that, 4 1 months. The Opposition has waited and waited. The people have waited and waited for answers. We have been patient; the people have been patient. The last occasion on which this subject was raised in this Parliament was over six months ago when I moved the following censure motion in this House: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That this House censures the Minister for Primary Industry because, among other reasons, he has failed: </para>

              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We did not know the full facts at that time. Once again we get the bland reply from the Minister in that debate. There was nothing to worry about, he told us. It was all a private matter. A full explanation would be made in time. What time? How long did we have to wait? In his statement last night the Minister admitted that he had been flushed out by being tipped off that a newspaper story on the scandal was about to appear in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning. He admitted to this. He said in the statement: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. in view of information which has come to me about the reported purchase by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper of confidential documents relating to the investigation and which, I understand, are to be published in tomorrow <inline font-style="italic">&#39;sAge</inline> I seek to make this statement tonight. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">In other words he was not going to come clean with this Parliament or the public in other circumstances. All this vital information was available, but there was no way we were going to learn about it. It was only because of this threat of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article that it comes out. Does he not think that what he had to say to this House last night is not of public concern? Of course it is. Essential information about the affairs of a Minister of the Crown of the nature that we learnt last night is a public affair and is of great concern. Of course, he should have volunteered the information, incomplete though it is, rather than have it flushed from him in the ignominious way that it has come out. He knows- and we all know that he was seeking to buy a few more months. The reason he was seeking to buy a few more months was the grave nature of the charge. He knew that the parliamentary recess was coming up. He knew he could possibly buy those few more months. He had only another day of this parliamentary session to withstand. He wanted to borrow some more time. His reputation suffers further because of the way this had been flushed out from him. </para>
          <para>The third point in my resolution concerns the matter of who benefited from this amount of $542, 125, which is the present known amount of misappropriation. I put it in that way because last night&#39;s statement itself does not make clear whether a further $292,000.31, also identified as losses by misappropriations, is included in the $542,000. Perhaps if we had been allowed questions in this House, as indeed senators were allowed questions in the Senate to get vital information from this debate, I need not have raised these questions now. They should have been answered publicly by this Minister. We gave him the opportunity to do so. I will not canvass the reasons why that has not come before us. </para>
          <para>Another thing of concern is that the figures do not add up. If we add together the $250,093 as shown in the group accounts of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd as a loan to the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd, with the further misappropriation, we do not get the same figure as that total of $542, 125. 1 can only think that the statement was got together in such a way that it is not accurate. Also, there is another inaccuracy in the statement. At one place we are told the Minister received a loan of $2,000. In another place we are told the amount is $4,000. There is no relationship between the two. What we do know is that there is an amount of something over half a million and something under one million still unaccounted for and to be explained. We do not know who benefited from it. Is it any wonder that we seek far more explanations than we are receiving. Is it any wonder that we felt that we in the Opposition were wronged in not being allowed to question this Minister on a matter of such grave public concern in Question Time today? Who were the beneficiaries? Let me quote from a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 10 November 1978. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Primary Industry Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> told Parliament in a personal explanation yesterday that one of his family companies, the Sinclair Pastoral Company, owned 10 houses in Sydney and had a mortgage on another, although rent was only paid on three houses. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline>was responding to Labor backbencher, John Armitage, who claimed that a house owned by the company at 3 1 View Street, Woollahra, was tenanted but on a no-cost basis. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Armitage</inline>said acquisition of the property represented a considerable investment for a medium-sized non-listed company, especially when its main interests were in rural production. </para>
            <para>An asset, valued at more than $80,000, was incurring the company costs rather than revenue, at the expense of shareholders. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline>said the company had invested in houses so that he could divest himself of shareholdings. </para>
            <para>Shareholdings could be said to affect my holding of a public office, &#39; he said. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I&#39;ll say shareholdings could affect his holding of a public office. That is what this debate is all about.  His  shareholdings do affect his holding of a public office. Indeed, he should not hold public office because of what has been divulged already. Of course this House needs a full and clear explanation about these property holdings and how the funds were found for the investments. There has been an abject failure to explain how the Minister himself has not benefited from the misappropriations. The next part of my censure motion deals with the lack of candour in last night &#39;s statement and on other occasions. </para>

              <para>-Candour. You ought to listen. This section of the motion deals with the lack of candour in explaining the Minister&#39;s responsibilities as a director of some of those erring companies. He has a serious responsibility as a director and as a Minister of the Crown. He should be giving an example of propriety in discharging those responsibilities. Instead, he has evaded the issues. I need only draw the attention of the House to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> article of 3 1 October 1978 where, indeed, some of the questions being put by the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane,</inline> the investigator into these affairs, are fully canvassed and show how this matter is a public responsibility. I wish to quote from just one part of the article in <inline font-style="italic">The Bulletin</inline> in which a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is quoted. It states: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">We have this matter of public duty overhanging the Minister&#39;s head as well. The article continues: </para>

          <para>Said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> in this letter-  that the matters which I propose to forward do not comprehend all possible breaches of the Act and at a later time I may well formulate some additional questions. </para>
          <para class="block">The rest of that article shows the public responsibility of this Minister in the matter of his directorship of companies and of the way that he discharged his responsibilities in that regard. The next point in the motion relates to the tax claims. If the full amount of $542,125 was not taxedthe tax rate during this period was 46c in the dollar- then the public purse has lost, due to this misappropriation, $249,377. If indeed we include only the amount which is described as misappropriation- we do not know enough from the statement; we have not been told enough yet- namely, $292,000, the loss to revenue from the tax claim amounts to $134,320. But this is only the tip of the iceberg, as I said last night. We need far more information. But we know this is the minimum amount. </para>
          <para>The last point in my motion directs itself to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> What is already known is more than enough to censure this Minister. I have outlined point after point which shows that he deserves that censure. Of course, the Minister for Primary Industry should be dismissed now because of the statement he made last night. But what was known earlier was more than enough for this Minister to be suspended. Why did we have a suspension in the case of the Lynch affair, a suspension in the case of the Garland affair, a suspension in the case of the Robinson affair and a dismissal in the case of the Withers affair? Yet, graver charges are made against this Minister and there is not one indication from the Prime Minister that he will be dismissed - </para>

              <para>-The charges are quite clearly set out in this censure motion. I have detailed them and I will go on detailing them. There is only one reason why this Minister has not been suspended or will not be dismissed. It is because he belongs to the National Country Party. This grazier from Wannon will not offend his grazier friends. It is up to the sycophants in the Liberal Party to look at this situation and to note that their own Ministers in the Liberal Party are being suspended and dismissed but there is not one bit of evidence that anything will happen to this Minister. The grazier from Wannon sits there and allows all this to take place around him. Some people say &#39;fair go for this Minister&#39;. Some suggest there are no charges hanging over his head - </para>

              <para>- I will withdraw the remark, so that I have time to say that some people are talking about a fair go for this Minister. Even the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> tendered his resignation to the Prime Minister because his wife advertised some sheets. Of course a resignation should have been tendered to this Prime Minister and it should have been accepted because of the grave charges that are listed in this censure motion. A fair go for this Minister is sought by honourable members opposite. What we want on this side is a fair go for the people of Australia. The Opposition wants a fair go to see that the Government of this country is in the hands of people we can trust. We want a fair go for the people of Australia so that we can end the sort of reprehensible conduct which is contained in this detailed statement from the Minister for Primary Industry and the reprehensible conduct we have had in all of those other suspensions and resignations that have taken place to date. </para>

              <para>-Thank you for that fair ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> This Government is on an escalator of degeneration. It is going down all the way and the bottom is not yet in sight. It has failed in policy and in integrity in government, despite what the Prime Minister pledged in 1 975. When the New South Wales State Government set out to investigate this matter some two years ago, it was thought that some $267,000 may have been misappropriated from the six companies under discussion. We found out from the Minister for Primary Industry last night that the figure is more than double that, namely, $542,000. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reports this morning that $377,000 of that has been misdirected to the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd. That company is a family company. Its directors are the Minister for Primary Industry and his family. He is a life governing director of that family Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd. In addition, the Minister is a director of all the companies from which the $547,000 has been misappropriated. I draw the attention of the House to the relevant Acts and forms of parliament that might be relevant in this matter now and in the future, especially after August of this year. Section 174 of the Crimes Act provides for 14 years gaol for known embezzlement from companies. Section 350 provides for five years gaol for being an accessory after the fact. It provides also for a $500,000 fine. Anyone concealing the identity of persons - </para>

          <para class="block">Anyone would think that we were talking about a misappropriation of $10 from the petty cash. We are talking about half a million dollars. There is a long history of personal involvement here. Between 1972 and 1976 he signed a number of company returns stating them to be factual. So he is either dishonest or incompetent. In either case he is not fit to be a Minister of this Parliament. Two years ago he amended those returns and stated in them that $246,000 had been misappropriated. Last night he had another go. For the third time he amended the figures for misappropriation. We find that $260,000 has been misappropriated from Allan Walsh Pty Ltd and another $283,000 from Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Ltd, which is a total of $489,000 from two companies, out of a total of $543,000 of which $377,000 went directly into the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd, his own family company. We have it on very good authority that this might not be the end of it. Will there be a fourth time? Come August, will the final figure turn out to be something like three-quarters of a million dollars? </para>
          <para>I want to conclude my remarks by saying that we in this place have a direct responsibility in this regard because of the tax connotations. It is a fair measure of the hide of these people that they were not content to misappropriate over half a million dollars, but part of those moneys was claimed as company tax deductions. </para>

              <para>- I take a point of order. The honourable member for Cunningham said- I quote him directly- &#39; the hide of these people  . . they were not content to misappropriate&#39; the moneys. The clear indication is that he has accused my right honourable friend of misappropriation. That is a complete and deliberate falsehood and I ask for it to be withdrawn. </para>

              <para>-Order! I am finding this most difficult. The motion does include the word &#39;misappropriation&#39;. I would like the honourable member for Cunningham to listen if he would.

              <para>- I withdraw it and I say that part of those moneys was claimed as tax deductions. As a matter of fact Allan Walsh Pty Ltd got $91,366 in a tax rebate from these misappropriations and Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Ltd received $33,886; a total of $125,222. Now here is the rub. The Minister is the sole beneficiary and executor of his father&#39;s will.  His  father died in January 1976. Probate was not applied for until 1 November 1978. It was then granted within two days; a miraculously speedy granting of the probate. The probate number was 867,260. In the will of the late G. M. Sinclair-I will skip over all the details- a net sum of $106,985 was left to the sole beneficiary, the Minister.for Primary Industry. I would like to ask the Minister and the House: Where is the money now? It is clearly owed, as was indicated by the Minister in his speech last night, which implicated his father, either to the companies or to the tax department. </para>

              <para>-That is the fact of the matter. Last night the Minister said that his father had misappropriated $540,000. Yet that same father left him $106,000 as the sole beneficiary in the will. Now is that not all very convenient? Last night in this place he said that he would pay the money back. He thinks that that smoothes the matter over and that is the end of it. How convenient. It seems incredible to me that half a million dollars could have been systematically embezzled from six companies into a family company over a period of five years, without the Minister knowing what was going on. He is either dishonest or incompetent. It is very convenient for him in this place to blame the whole affair on poor old dear departed daddy and expect us to forget about it. We will not forget about it. </para>

              <para>- I conclude on this note. It is not I, or the Opposition who have made the allegations against the departed person. It is the Minister who has done that, last night and it is an easy way out. Perhaps we will only find out the real truth of the matter come August. I for one would not like to be in the shoes of the Minister when we know the full results of the Finnane inquiry. </para>

            <para>- As I shall demonstrate, since my colleague the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> became executor of the estate, he has conducted his affairs with great responsibility indeed. He found that a situation needed redress and he has taken every action within his power to do just that. I think it is well worth noting that when the former member for Cunningham resigned, under the gravest possible charges in this Parliament, he gave no explanation or reason for resigning. Of course, he could not give an explanation or a reason without seriously incriminating the Prime Minister of the day. The present honourable member for Cunningham ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr West</inline> ) should have a proper understanding of that and should know quite well that it was for that reason that no explanation of those events was given. The arguments put forward by the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> are hardly worth answering. They were so muddled and difficult to understand that there was no thrust to them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Again, I think that if one looks at the record of the Minister for Primary Industry since he became executor of his father&#39;s estate, it will be perfectly plain that he has taken every action within his power to right whatever irregularities existed. The Minister initiated his own inquiries when he found that there were matters that needed to be put right, and he did that a considerable time ago. The matters were referred to the Taxation Commissioner and to the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission. Again, he was making quite sure that public authorities with an interest and concern in these matters had all the information available to them to make the decisions and judgments that were necessary. It is important to point out that it was the Minister himself who initiated these inquiries. It was the Minister himself who referred the matters to the Taxation Commissioner and to the Corporate Affairs Commission long before they were matters of public disputation and argument. It is worth noting that to this time there have been no allegations, other than the political allegations of the Australian Labor Party, and there have been no charges. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> is on record as saying that it is not the Minister who is under examination, it is the affairs of companies prior to the time when the Minister himself became executor in relation to those companies. Since the Minister has been executor, he has taken every action that he possibly could to put the matters right. </para>
          <para>I think it is worth noting that in part, as a result of information that came to me from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> which could well have come from the inquiry in New South Wales or from New South Wales Government agencies, I wrote to the Commissioner of Taxation. Again, I would like to have my letter, the response from the Commissioner of Taxation and an extract from the letter from the Leader of the Opposition, incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> But I wish to read to the House one part of the letter from the Commissioner of Taxation. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As you know, the Minister had taken these matters up with my office. They are not all yet finally resolved and how they will be resolved is a matter between the companies and myself. I therefore agree with the views you have expressed in your letter. If it is necessary to say it, I add that the Minister has not sought to use his personal position to influence official decisions. These have been, and will be, made according to the law as applicable to the established facts. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think it is worth having my letter and the letter of the Leader of the Opposition incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> so that that record may stand. Again, it is proof that the Minister himself was making quite plain that the companies were in touch with the appropriate authorities to see that any irregularities of the past were put right. That is a matter for praise and not for blame. </para>

              <para>-The Leader of the Opposition reveals himself for what he is in this Parliament. The cogent part of the letter has been read. It will be made available for anyone who wants it, as will the letter of the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, the great question to ask about the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s letter is this: How did the information contained in it come to the Leader of the Opposition? Did it come directly from the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission or directly from a politically motivated inquiry? Is that the conclusion we are to reach? Quite plainly, the Opposition has sought time and time again to try the Minister in this Parliament. The Opposition has sought to use evidence alleged to have been given before the New South Wales inquiry and to introduce it piece by piece, part heard, into this Parliament in order to launch motions of censure or questions against the Minister himself. Quite clearly, the purposes of this Parliament have been gravely misused and abused, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition, in relation to this matter. There is circumstantial evidence that that has been encompassed in concert with the agents of the Labor Party in New South Wales. </para>

In the middle of 1976 the matter was referred to the Corporate Affairs Commission but it was not until two years later, in about May last year, that the Finnane inquiry was launched. On many occasions we have heard that the report would be available by a certain date, but the report is never available. It is always postponed until &#39;a later period. How much longer will this report be? What is the cause for the delay? Is it designed to be launched out, piece by piece, through the Opposition in this Parliament? Is it a matter that is sought to be used either by the New South Wales or the Federal Branch of the Australian Labor Party for nothing more than political purposes? The activities of the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament must certainly have created the climate and whatever is in this report will need to be considered very carefully and very seriously indeed because of the political circumstances which the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him have created by their constant introduction of this matter into the Parliament. It is worth noting that on some occasions <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walker</inline> has said that he resents very gravely indeed the efforts of the Leader of the Opposition to have the matter debated in this Parliament. I suppose one could read that statement, at face value, for what it is. I suppose one could also read it with the possibility in mind that he is merely trying to hide the fact that there could be a liaison between the agents of the New South Wales Government and the officer of the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>This whole affair has raised matters that go very seriously to the way this Parliament is used and to the rules and procedures of his Parliament. If the matters which are the affairs of the Corporate Affairs Commission and the special inquiry under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> had been conducted by a court in the traditional sense, no  Speaker  of this House, I believe, would have dared to allow debate on those matters within this Parliament. The rule of sub judice which applies to this Parliament, to the House of Commons and to other parliaments was established in earlier times when courts of law in the traditional sense were the only tribunals which could make or break the reputations of individuals. Therefore, the rule of sub judice was applied to make sure that the ultimate findings of a court could not be prejudiced by earlier debate, or by innuendo and smear, as we have seen in this Parliament over a considerable time in relation to this matter. </para>
          <para>At an earlier point <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> ruled that the proceedings of quasi judicial hearings and of administrative tribunals should not be covered by the general rule of sub judice. Therefore, debate was allowed and on earlier occasions some questions were allowed also. In all seriousness, not merely for the protection of members of </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament- perhaps most importantly not even for that- but also for the protection of the wider Australian public, this Parliament will need to examine its own procedures in relation to the nature of the debate, the nature of questions which are allowed during the processes of quasi judicial hearings and administrative tribunals, which governments have put to modern use. Reference to proceedings before or inquiries undertaken by such bodies can just as easily, clearly and as certainly as a full court of law destroy the reputation of individuals within this Parliament or outside of this Parliament. Any responsible member of this Parliament would recognise that fact and recognise that evidence being given to such a tribunal or inquiry should not be introduced into this Parliament in a way which is designed to prejudice the circumstances of the inquiry and in a way that is clearly designed, and deliberately so, to prejudice the general circumstances and public attitudes to the final report when ultimately it comes down. </para>
          <para>As we understand it, the timing of the presentation of that report will be motivated by the political interests of the New South Wales Government and nothing else. There is grave cause to doubt the delay that has gone on for a very considerable time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane,</inline> the New South Wales Government, the Leader of the Opposition and his party must have their actions in these matters looked at with a great deal of concern. One thing that does shine through is this: As I indicated earlier, the Minister conducted proceedings into those matters. He referred the matters to be inquired into by independent accountants and solicitors, the Corporate Affairs Commission and the Commissioner of Taxation. What more could this Minister have done when he became executor to see that whatever irregularities had occurred were put right. He did it all. The New South Wales Government waited about two years before it decided to have a special inquiry. The New South Wales Government appointed a special inquiry which will report in a month or two, and a month or two more, but it never does. </para>
          <para>What is the cause for the delay? I believe that the New South Wales Government has a heavy responsibility to answer those matters. The links between what is happening in New South Wales, the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament and the Leader of the Opposition, and the way in which the Australian Labor Party generally has sought to prejudice the ultimate findings of the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> make it perfectly plan that we will have to look at the ultimate findings when they come down with a very great deal of care indeed because the Leader of the Opposition has sought to prejudice the circumstances and the public mind in relation to those matters. The only other point that I make on a part of the censure motion referring to myself is that there is an enormous difference between a royal commission established by this Government and the kind of inquiry that has been promoted by the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales. </para>

          <para>The matter is raised, not because the Opposition initiated the debate, but because the most respected daily newspaper in this country, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> raised the matter in a way which could not be ignored. Look at the headline: Sinclair firm got &#34;milked&#34; funds&#39;. What sort of reaction do honourable members think will arise in the community when- the average man and woman read that sort of headline showing that a senior Minister of the Government of Australia is part of a family company organisation about which a respected conservative newspaper writes as its main headline on page 1: &#39;Sinclair firm got &#34;milked&#34; funds&#39;? It then goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A company of which the Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Sinclair, is the life governing director and majority shareholder has received misappropriated funds totalling $377,000, according to accountants retained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What sort of confidence do honourable members think there is going to be in a government when a Minister receives that sort of publicity? The issue that we are raising is simply this: In the circumstances of this blaze of publicity- it is not an unusual incident; there has been a regular succession of such incidents- the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has no course, if he is going to behave properly and responsibly to this Parliament, but to stand to one side at least as the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> had to do when he was subjected to an inquiry. </para>
          <para>We are not raising this matter in the Parliament as some sort of impulsive action to bring the Minister for Primary Industry to account. We are responding to a very significant report in a significant daily newspaper. If that is not good enough, let us recall the last time when this matter was raised. Again it was raised firstly in a rather conservative journal, the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which is a sort of Bible for the coalition parties, although it certainly has no influence on the Australian Labor Party. One is consistently sympathetic in the general thrust of what the article has to say to the conservative coalition political parties of this country. </para>
          <para>The article was published under the headline: What the Special Investigator wrote to Ian Sinclair&#39;. It is a rather teasing headline. It goes through details of a letter that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> That was the first we knew about the situation and the first that Australia knew about it. The article raised a number of matters of considerable significance, matters that could not be ignored in this Parliament and matters for which the Minister for Primary Industry should be made responsible and on which he should provide answers. For God&#39;s sake- or I should say &#39;for gosh sake&#39;- no-one is going to suggest that we in this Parliament should ignore such important suggestions or allegations as have come forward in a report like this. Whatever one might think of the political bias of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> one must at least respect its integrity. When such an article is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> we are compelled as loyal members of the Opposition to raise questions on behalf of the concerned people of Australia. It is sheer humbug for the Prime Minister to say that there be no allegations made against the Minister for Primary Industry - </para>

              <para>- I will come very close to withdrawing it. Paragraph ( 1 ) (c) of the motion covers what I am saying, but let me move on to the heights of humbug scaled by the Prime Minister today in criticising the Opposition for raising this matter in the Parliament. The Minister for Primary Industry raised it last night. He set the scene for today&#39;s proceedings. He is the man who took the initiative on this matter. What is the Prime Minister suggesting? Is he suggesting that we ought to sit mute like a group of dummies? I know that he would love that. That is the sort of Opposition he wants. He wants an opposition that will not question him. Then he can moralise and posture in those fragile attitudes which he likes to adopt and which convince no one now, as the opinion polls clearly show. On every occasion when this matter has been brought up in the Parliament it has been in response to the glare of publicity from the media or, most recently, last night, the initiative taken by the Minister for Primary Industry and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister says that there are no allegations against the Minister for Primary Industry. Like heck there are not! I ask honourable members to listen to the transcript of the interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Creighton</inline> Walsh, a former colleague and friend of the Minister for Primary Industry, a collaborator, at one stage and a business associate. I refer to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> said in the course of discussion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walsh,</inline> the former friend of the Minister for Primary Industry, the former business associate in, among other things, the undertaking businesses of the Minister for Primary Industry. The way that the Minister and his colleagues are treating the economy of this country, those businesses seems to give him singularly appropriate equipment to continue the policies of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">I make no judgment on that except that I am alarmed at the attitude of the man carrying out the investigation. His attitude reflects the evidence that has become available to him. Why should we not be concerned about these matters? The Minister for Primary Industry cannot sit in this House and expect to have the confidence and courtesy of the whole Parliament and the respect of the nation while these matters are hanging over his head. The Parliament cannot function properly in a responsible way if it is to be continually distracted by questions on this matter as a consequence of the media&#39;s properly raising the latest episode in the developments of the Sinclair family company affairs. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt that the Minister has sought to draw a veil of confusion and deception over this matter. He equivocates on every occasion when the matter has come forward. In 1 977 on the Willesee program he said: &#39;There was no misappropriation&#39;. In October 1978 the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper interviewed him. When asked whether there had been any breaches of the Companies Act he said: &#39;Yes.&#39; Then he said: No.&#39; Then he said: &#39;Well, technical breaches.&#39; That is a little like the chap being interviewed by the detective sergeant from the safebreaking squad and being asked whether he had broken the eight safes that the police were interested in. He said &#39;Yes. Well, no. Well, technical breakings. There were only eight of them. After all, they were very good friends of mine so it is not a public matter.&#39; It is on all fours with that sort of defence for the Minister to say: &#39;They were technical breaches. What is $500,000 between friends. The tax man will subsidise some of it anyhow. &#39; The Minister has argued that it is a private company and none, of the business of the Parliament. It is centrally the business of the Parliament. The conduct and the propriety of Ministers is an essential factor for consideration by the Parliament. Unless the Prime Minister is a humbug he should also be concerned about this. I remind the people of Australia what the Prime Minister said in 1978. He said: </para>

              <para>- This matter arose last night because there was a concern in my mind that there could have been a publication this morning, as I was advised, of some information that had been purchased by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper. I did not know the content of that reported release, but I was apprehensive because of the successive releases that have come out from the very beginning of this affair and which, I believe have made an inquiry which has been conducted, quite independently I would hope, by an officer appointed by the New South Wales Attorney-General almost impossible to be handled impartially and to be completed with integrity. My concern is that I am now in a position where I am still subject to that inquiry. The inquiry is not of me; it is of a number of companies of which I am a director. That I am a beneficiary of some of the moneys is quite obviously apparent from the statement I made last night and from the indication I have given on a successive number of occasions in this chamber. But in circumstances where there is the successive publication of information; where there are statements being made in this House; where there are purported charges, for there are no real charges against me at this stage in any event; I find it extraordinarily difficult to lay down facts other than in accordance with those that are available to me and which yet cannot relate to the inquiry itself. In other words, even here today in this House I am in a position where I cannot respond to things that are separately being inquired into by the investigator appointed by the New South Wales Parliament. I cannot get up in this place and in response to questions that have been asked of me tell honourable members the details which it is true, in the asking, have been published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> but not my responses. </para>

          <para>So let me return to the series of matters raised by the honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford ), but with the qualification of the &#39;Catch 22 &#39; position in which I find myself. First, let me turn to the final part of the honourable member&#39;s censure motion, that is, the part censuring the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> for his actions. Let me say to this House and to the people of Australia that from the moment these irregularities first appeared, I reported them to the Prime Minister and to my own leader. I told them of the nature and the manner in which I hoped to resolve them. I have continued that reporting. Indeed, my statement last night was another part of that reporting, to the public as well as to this Parliament, in addition to my reporting to those to whom I am responsible. Therefore I do not believe that in any way at this stage there is any basis on which this House should censure the Prime Minister. Indeed, if anybody is to be censured, it is me, and for the reasons that I am about to explain, I do not think that those allegations are valid either. </para>
          <para>The censure motion against me relates to a series of particular charges. First, there is a suggestion that I have misled this House. It is true that as events have progressively revealed, the amounts concerned have increased, and I have revealed them. That was the purport of the statement last night. The difficulty that I had last night and which I mentioned in the statement was that at this stage the accounts have not yet been cleared by the directors and they have not been presented to the adjourned annual general meetings of the respective companies. In other words, whilst I have received the detail from the accountants, it has not been ratified by the persons to whom the accounts are presented and whose accounts, of course, they ultimately are. The next thing that I should say is that I have revealed in full detail the amounts as reported to me and to other directors by the investigating accountant. They were set out in the statement that I made to the House last night. </para>
          <para>The second part of the censure motion suggests that in some way I have been reluctant to report to the Parliament fully and promptly. </para>

              <para>-I rather thought that the contrary was the case. On each occasion that 1 have had information available, I have reported to this place. The honourable gentleman mentioned a time today. I point out to the honourable member that the accountants- three firms, not one are involved- have been working without records, many of which are not available, and I guess that even the honourable member might destroy some of his records once they are more than 10 years old. Many of these records are not available. What the accountants have been forced to act on in most instances is supposition and inference. They have had to try to check with other records, with other parties and other people. I think it is remarkable that without those records it has been possible for the accountants to bring together as complete a record as they have. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>During the course of the statement last night honourable members might note that I referred to deemed losses as well as to losses by misappropriation. What I have done is accept those deemed losses as well as the ascertained losses because it has not been possible to check whether or not payments, which on the face of it seem completely valid, are in fact valid. In order to ensure that there is complete equity, I have accepted them as losses by misappropriation. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the next part of the censure motion which reads:  his failure to show that he has not benefited personally from the misappropriations: </para>
          <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> referred to the headlines in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> I have mentioned on other occasions, as indeed the Prime Minister has mentioned today, that this business of being tried by Press, tried by this Parliament and tried without being given an opportunity to respond, is completely repugnant, and this is particularly so in circumstances where I cannot answer because of the constraints imposed upon me by the administrative procedures now under way under the auspices of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Finnane.</inline> On the contrary, in answer to part 3 of the motion, not only have I shown that I have personally benefited, but at every stage I have said that the Sinclair Pastoral Co. and my family have been involved. I have not in any way failed to reveal those figures; indeed, in the statement last night I referred specifically to the accountants&#39; identification of the amount deposited to the bank account of the Sinclair Pastoral Co. and to other amounts that were paid, at that time unbeknown to me, to my own account. I do not believe that there is any other way in which I can respond other than to demonstrate that these figures are available. </para>
          <para>The next part of the censure motion deals with my alleged lack of candour. I do not know how one performs unless one reveals facts, and if one reveals facts, is that lack of candour? I rather thought that the reverse was the case. Having presented the facts to this House as I have successively as they have become available, I thought that I was meeting the obligation of candour, rather than not doing so. Then the motion deals with the question of tax. What I wanted to do very briefly was refer to the four areas of charges as made by the Opposition. AsI understand them, they include to what degree I benefited and to what degree in the time before my father&#39;s death I was aware of these misappropriations? I was not aware before my father&#39;s death of any of these funds being paid or their source; nor was I actively involved with any of those companies except the Sinclair Pastoral Co. As to the degree to which I have benefited, I have revealed that in accordance with the accountants&#39; report. Those figures are exactly there and when the Finnane inquiry is completed, I might well be able to answer in greater detail questions in relation to the compilation of them. </para>
          <para>With respect to matters after my father&#39;s death, there is the question of tax benefit and tax liability. Both of those matters, of course, have to be put in the hands of professional advisers. Because of my own actions, I have ensured that there is an identification of the correct tax liability. I even referred to it in my statement last night. With respect to the tax benefits, legal advice was taken. As I am a director of the company, I have a responsibility to the shareholders and it was their decision, not mine, as to what course of action had to be followed. In fact, one of the reasons for an identification of $250,000 odd now being shown as a loan to the Sinclair Pastoral Co. was in order to establish liability and to ensure that those tax benefits did not continue. </para>
          <para>I believe that the whole of the circumstances of this case are completely regrettable, and I said so in my statement to the House last night. I believe that there is no way, other than when this inquiry is completed, in which I can answer all the questions put in this House. I might add that I am quite happy to respond to questions; however, it is not my ruling, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker&#39;s,</inline> that prevents me from doing so. Incidentally, I am told that the Standing Orders of the Senate are different from the Standing Orders of this House. Therefore, there is no way by which in this place I can do other than to make a statement, as I have now done. I completely resent and oppose the suggestions made in this debate by the honourable member for Adelaide and the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that 1 had no course other than to do as I have done. </para>

            <para>- The information I provide to the House relates to the preparation of regulations under clause 7 (1) (b) (iii) of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill. I am advised by the Public Service Board that it issued instructions for the drafting of regulations to the Attorney-General &#39;s Department on 10 May 1979. Included in those instructions was a request to begin drafting a statutory rule to prescribe reasons for identification for redeployment under clause 7 (1) (b) (iii) of the Bill. This request was made in order that the draft regulations would be available as a basis for discussions with peak councils of employee organisations in the course of consultation between the Board and those organisations as required by clause 7 (2) of the Bill. I am advised by the Board that it is its intention that the consultations required by clause 7 (2) will be frank and comprehensive. It is with this aim in mind that the Board has sought to have a form of words for the regulations available for discussion. </para>

          <para>-by leave-As one of the two parliamentary advisers to this delegation to the United Nations General Assembly I feel it appropriate to say a few words in the Parliament today. Attached to the report is an addendum signed by the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> and me as parliamentary advisers to the delegation. It is one in which we are unanimous, something that the media might take note of particularly on this day. The most important part of the report for the Parliament is that the initiative taken by the delegates in forming a United Nations parliamentary group. This group had approximately six official meetings during the General Assembly period and was attended in all by 19 countries. As we say in the report, it was probably in many respects the most widely represented group in the broader sense of the word at the United Nations. We talk, in our report, of the weaknesses of the General Assembly meetings in that we feel that it comprises interests based on ideological and perhaps geographical groupings. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As we say in the report, the General Assembly is perhaps the &#39;world&#39;s annual general meeting&#39;. Apart from set speeches by Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers most of the General Assembly debates are carried on by public servants, officials representing governments and not people&#39;s representatives in the broader sense. I am not saying that politicians would do any better, but I would like to think that the initiative taken by us as parliamentary advisers to the delegation would be the beginning of some reform of the United Nations- as we say in our report, the vehicle for some change in the organisation. We are pleased that the Secretary-General congratulated us on our initiative. In fact, our meetings were notified in the journal which is the equivalent of the Notice Paper in this place. We feel it is important that liaison be established with other international parliamentary organisations and, as can be seen from our recommendations which are referred to in the report, we hope that other parliamentary organisations such as the International Parliamentary Union, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Parliament of Europe will take an interest in this initiative. </para>
        <para>Representatives of other countries involved welcomed our initiative. It made us realise at the United Nations forum when mixing with delegates from countries all over the world that Australia, Australians and members of the Australian Parliament have an important part to play in international affairs. We were respected for forming this group and for having no vested interest. People said to us: &#39;If some other countries had formed the group it would have been suspect, but as Australians have done so and as we know you have no vested interests we congratulate you&#39;. I think that as a nation we tend to undersell ourselves a little. We ought to take more initiatives such as this in the field of international relations. I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> for your indulgence. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I take firstly the point made by my colleague the honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Shipton)</inline> relating to the role of parliamentarians at the United Nations. We have to see this as a very big organisation indeed. I suppose that on any day when the United Nations is in full session with all the committees, the six standing committees and the special political committee meeting, and perhaps the Security Council and the General Assembly in pleniary session, there would be approximately 2,000 people meeting. There is a significant exchange of international ideas. That is not always expressed in the debates because the speeches are likely to be rather stereotyped. But the fact is that it is a very big meeting and as my colleague said, I think we underrate the role parliamentarians can play in that organisation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The United Nations General Assembly meeting is a very long-running exercise. We arrived there in the middle of September, the last session I attended was late in January, and it was still going to meet later on. So we are committing somebody to three or four months at least to attend the United Nations. On the question of the parliamentary group, of course we took the initiative. I was made  chairman  of the group and my friend the honourable member for Higgins the rapporteur. In the course of that visit one came into close contact with many parliamentary people from around the world, but the real drive amongst people such as ourselves was to try to establish a wider-ranging contact amongst the democratic forces of the world. </para>
        <para>The United Nations is like any other gathering of human beings. It is broken up into factions. There is the ideological group- the Eastern bloc and perhaps even the western Europeans. Then there is the religious group, which is developing rapidly. The Islamic group extends from the </para>
        <para class="block">Atlas Mountains to the borders of Papua New Guinea, I suppose, now that Indonesia is included and is co-operating. There is the geographical group,&#34; in which we find the African countries setting themselves up in some sort of caucus- quite a lot of the time. When we add all the African countries together as well as some of the Arab nations, they have almost 50 per cent of the voting strength of&#34; the United Nations. Then, of course, there are the economic groupings, including the group of 77 calling themselves the developing nations. How countries such as Argentina and Uruguay can call themselves developing nations I do not know. I told them that I thought this was modesty beyond belief. We have to start - </para>

            <para>-That is right, yes. This morning I placed on the Notice Paper a General Business item to examine the general structure of the United Nations. I agree that as Australians we ought to take steps to initiate this. We underrate the role that Australia can play. We ought now to start to examine very closely the factors that make the United Nations a stereotyped nonactive organisation in the cause of world peace. It is easy to write down the United Nations. In such things as cultural co-operation and administrative co-operation it achieves great things. Smallpox has been practically obliterated from this planet by the work of this organisation. That is a major human achievement. However, when we come to the Security Council, that is no longer a functional body for peace. I sat in on a Security Council meeting at which it was discussing the invasion of Kampuchea by Vietnam. The vote was 13 to two- 13 to condemn Vietnam, two against. The vote was lost. One would think almost that this arrangement was drawn up by the Country Party. The two countries that voted against the condemnation, of course, were Czechoslovakia and Russia, Russia had the veto, which meant the vote could not be carried. The Security Council cannot operate in this way. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>If one looks at the Notice Paper and at those matters we are going to take off the record this afternoon, the House willing, one will notice several items about peace-keeping forces. These cannot get off the ground while one of the five permanent members of the Security Council resists it. If we consider the situation in southern Africa, the Security Council members who are principally charged with the responsibility of producing and protecting and expanding world peace are the countries that are the biggest arms sellers. We have to change that. We have to take a look at the structure of the United Nations. As I have said, Africa, with perhaps 10 per cent of the world&#39;s population and 0.1 per cent of the world &#39;s gross domestic product and producing a very small percentage of the funds to run the United Nations, has nearly 30 per cent of the votes. </para>
        <para>It is 30 years since the United Nations was established in 1945 with 45 member nations, lt cannot work any longer in this way. It simply needs to be changed, like all human institutions. It is going to be a long haul. It might take 1 0 or 1 5 years, but the longer the journey the sooner we ought to start. I am grateful for the opportunity of attending the United Nations. </para>

            <para>- It is one of the more useful exercises in which one is able to indulge by having membership of this place. There are many things that members such as ourselves could do at the United Nations. I think we ought to adopt the same attitude we adopt to Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences. There should be some sort of continuum of membership from year to year, although nobody would want to be at the United Nations for two years and four months in succession. Some European countries as was pointed out in the report, send four or five people to the United Nations and change them around over the period. I do not know whether the Leader of the House, who is at the table, is trying to wind me up, but if that is the case I will keep going. We do not often have the opportunity to discuss these matters. I hope that I am talking about something that is of vital interest to humanity and mankind. I suggest that honourable members read the report carefully, and especially the section that has on it the signatures of the honourable member for Higgins and myself. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, unfortunately</inline>I did not hear the expression the man is a humbug&#39; because at that stage the  Deputy Speaker  had called the honourable member to order.

        <para>More important is the fact that the allegation is totally untrue, and it may well have been an accident by the honourable member for Newcastle. Pages 1774 and 1775 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 11-12 October 1978 show that I did not vote for the second reading of the Social Services Amendment Bill which reduced automatic in-&#39; dexation of pensions from a six-monthly to an annual basis. In fact, I was joined by three of my colleagues. On page 1823 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 12 October 1978, during the Committee stage clauses 5 and 6 relating to the indexation of pensions were put to a vote and I abstained from voting in that division, along with four of my colleagues. The allegation is untrue. It may well have been that the honourable member for Newcastle accidentally looked at the next column, which was the division on the gag, and I did vote in that division. I stress that the honourable member for Newcastle claimed that I voted for the freezing of pensions. That is totally untrue, and I ask that by some measure he be asked to withdraw the unparliamentary and unacceptable expression that I am a humbug. The facts show clearly that I am not. </para>

              <para>-The Australian Parliamentary Observer Group was made up of myself, the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie)</inline> and the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant).</inline> It was an all parliamentary group. In the interests of time, I understand that the honourable member for Cook will not be speaking on the tabling of the report today but he, as a member of the group and as a signatory to it, as we all are, endorses the report. Whilst we are all members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, as the report sets out, we went as individual members of parliament and not as representatives of a committee or of the Government. However, our fares and expenses were met by the Government. It was my view that our group was really the only genuine parliamentary team present to observe those elections. As I said earlier today in the debate on the United Nations General Assembly report, as a Second World power, Australia has a part to play in international problems of this nature. I refer briefly to some of the conclusions in this report which were reached by all members of the observer group. The report states: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>A large proportion of voters appeared to see the elections not so much in terms of a choice between parties but as a means of achieving black majority rule and, hopefully, an end to the guerilla war. Many voters asked why they were voting replied for peace, an end to the war, for majority rule or to bring &#39; the boys &#39; home from the bush. </para>

          <para class="block">This was a theme which I heard from nearly everyone to whom I spoke. The people were just voting for peace. The report continues: </para>

            <para>We were most impressed by the fact that some 64 per cent of the estimated voting population turned out to vote. This is a high proportion when compared with most other voluntary voting democracies. We do not believe that such a large number of voters could have been forced to go to the polls against their will. </para>

          <para class="block">It is my personal belief that the Constitution gives proper and legitimate majority rule. If one looks at the Constitution, one sees that there is a black majority in the Parliament. It has general power over appropriation of revenues to both the police forces and armed forces and the government has power to issue general policy directions to both the police and the Army. </para>
          <para>We conclude by urging the Government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia to make an earnest attempt at rapprochement with the minority parties within the Parliament, and with the Patriotic Front parties, so that the peace which has for so long proved so elusive is achieved. I note that since we wrote that conclusion there has been an offer of amnesty. Perhaps that makes our final conclusion more relevant. That is: </para>

            <para>-by leave-I hope that the report speaks for itself. I will mention some of the points that are in it so honourable members may delve into it for themselves. The honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie),</inline> who supports the report, worked hard on the delegation. I found that, despite his grievous political errors, he is actually a good person when it comes to working as far from home as possible. I suppose I am speaking on behalf of the three members in this matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We should get firmly in our minds the point that Australia was, as far as one can use &#39;official&#39; about our delegation, the only one of the 151 nations of the United Nations which had people there who speak to and for and from and with and directly to government and are part and effect of that. I think that is a plus for us although there are some people I think who say that we ought to be ashamed of that fact. On the other hand, I think that the rest of the world ought to be ashamed. </para>
          <para>I belong to a party which believes in the spirit of free inquiry- to go, to look and to find out for oneself where possible. Zimbabwe Rhodesia is under seige. This country of six million people, about half the size of New South Wales, is very much on its own. I think I speak for my two colleagues in making the point that we did not come home starry-eyed about the government or about the future. We are more optimistic than pessimistic about its future. I think that, in the run-up to the election, there was the opportunity for free campaigning, as far as one could determine. One cannot give an absolute clean bill of health on that because there is no way of checking on some of the things that may have been done by police forces and security forces in the last few months. The election, as my friend from Higgins said, was technically as clean as an election could be. The Government, I think, is going to be a parliamentary government in control of the situation, given the normal run of human affairs. I think it was much closer to being a democratic election than an election in Queensland. It is a list system in which people put their crosses against the party for which they wish to vote. The names of candidates are on the ballot paper. There are symbols on the ballot paper which make it easier for them to vote. </para>
          <para>A new environment has developed there and the world will now have to face African people across the table. So far as we could determine, the social situation has changed completely in the last two years. I refer to the military situation. There are people who believe that the Patriotic Front is the legitimate government in Zimbabwe Rhodesia, that it ought to take it over and that it will. My guess is that the military situation is on the side of the Government. It is not good guerrilla country. It is similar to the country to the west of Canberra or in western New South Wales. It is not an easy country for patrols to roam in without being winkled out. These patrols face a very efficient military force indeed. I hope that honourable members will take the opportunity to study Zimbabwe Rhodesia at first hand. In the near future, a parliamentary delegation will go to Africa to visit Zimbabwe Rhodesia. In view of the Zaire conference if it is indiscreet in the present situation for that delegation to go there in total, perhaps individual members could go. However, the parliamentary delegation ought to include Botswana in its tour as it is perhaps the other democratically elected country in Africa. </para>
          <para>So that members may be able to study the documents at first hand, I will put my copy of the Constitution, plus some documents including the party policies, into the Parliamentary Library. Kindly remember that they belong to the honourable member for Wills. </para>

I shall be very brief because I agree with what has been said by the two previous speakers, particularly the comments by the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> about myself. The elections were fair, efficiently run and, in my opinion, they were honest. I think that is perhaps the most we can expect from any election anywhere in the world. We went as three individual members of this Parliament without the endorsement- as the honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Shipton)</inline> has said- of committees, parties or any group in this building. We therefore went as hard nosed, experienced politicians, looking for mistakes and errors, which we did not find. </para>

              <para>- Hard nosed, but charming, nonetheless. We went and saw these elections and came back impressed. As I said the other night, we hope that the new government of Bishop Muzorewa- this is my own personal hope- will in fact gain endorsement in whatever form that may take. But more importantly, despite the struggle that this country has had for a long time, one can only hope from the efficiency with which their election was run- observed not only by ourselves but also by other observersthat the Muzorewa Government will receive encouragement, which is what it badly needs from now on. I was very proud to be a member of the delegation and to have represented this Parliament on a bipartisan basis at such an important function on the African continent. I thank the House for its indulgence. </para>

            <para>- by leave- Members of the delegation are able to bring before the Parliament a first-hand assessment of how the elections have been conducted. Their conclusions seem to be in accord with the fairly large body of opinion that the elections in a relative sense were conducted freely and openly. They are reporting on a significant development. However, I would not like honourable members and the community generally to feel that the solution to all the problems of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia has been achieved. That certainly is not the intention of the report of the delegation as I understand it in the brief time that I have had to look through it. If the test were to be applied as to how successful the elections are in terms of resolving the problems of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, I would expect that the quote in paragraph 5 of the conclusions of the delegation is the relative measure. The last sentence reads: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Many voters asked why they were voting replied &#39;for peace&#39;; &#39;an end to the war&#39;; &#39;for majority rule&#39; or &#39;to bring the boys home from the bush&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That clearly seems to be the sentiment of the people of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia who voted in that election and who had been approached by other sources who reported on their findings. In weighing up the general situation in southern Africa and the problems of ZimbabweRhodesia, I would not have thought that all those objectives would have been achieved by the results of the election. In that sense I think what we have to say in a qualified way is that the elections are significant, and one would hope that they are a step in the direction towards achieving the objectives enumerated by those many voters who were asked why they were voting. There are two areas that we should look at. One is the internal approach and the other is the external approach in southern Africa. At this point it is hard to accept that peace will have been achieved as a result of this election. The dissident group from the Patriotic Front have made it clear that they find the election processes, and the result, unacceptable. Very simply that means that unfortunately we can expect a continuation of guerilla activity. </para>
          <para>Accordingly, to exaggerate in some unfortunate sense the results which have been achieved will be to lift people&#39;s expectations excessively in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, and therefore it would lead to massive disenchantment and disillusionment later. That would be most unfortunate. It would mean that the moment of rapture would be very brief indeed; that the problems would be as great and probably worse in the near future. I mention in passing the nature of some of the problems. For instance, the censorship which applied for several months before the election must be seen as some sort of restraint to how free and open the conduct of the election could be. Secondly, there are the constitutional provisions which make it quite clear that there is minority white control over the affairs of the Government of that country, in the public service, in the police force, in the defence services, in the cabinet and so on. </para>
          <para>Therein lie the seeds for some considerable level of discontent now and in the future. It is in this area that objections are being raised externally in Africa and especially in southern Africa. It is true that commercially and politically our relations with Southern Africa are crucial to this country. Certainly strategically they would not loom as high as our relations with many other areas of the world, especially in our region. We do have an interest which is related to a need to maintain stability in the world and a common concern about humanitarian matters like the welfare of people and the wish to avoid war and turmoil as much as we can. I would expect that unless further progress can be made towards what is really a majority rule in ZimbabweRhodesia, one which embraces all of the elements of political activity, internally, and those which are now external but belong internally - </para>

              <para>- The honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wilson)</inline> likes to give me counter harmony to keep me in metre. Unless that situation can be achieved there will be problems. Let me quickly outline the serious nature of those problems. For instance, I find it inconceivable that Julius Nyerere of Tanzania would be able to live comfortably if a decision were made to recognise the election processes which have taken place in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and to eliminate the sanctions, and to do this quickly and completely. It would be seen by the people of Tanzania as a sell-out by the West. I am putting to honourable members that whether or not one agrees with this assessment the hard reality is that we have to face how people in that area see it, how they will respond to it, and what consequences will flow from it. I am trying to put it on a quite balanced level, on a non-partisan level. If that happens then we could expect the administration of Julius Nyerere- if he does not do it, some other group which will replace him- to swing very sharply and radically away from the West. I could not see him comfortably accommodating such a change. The degree and the intensity of feeling throughout Africa- especially southern Africa- on this matter is such that it would be completely unreasonable and totally unreal to impose that upon Julius Nyerere and his government, and similarly  President  Kaunda of Zambia would be put in an intolerable position. He is already facing enormous difficulties because of the guerrilla activity conducted by the Patriotic Front from within his own territory moving across into Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, and the reprisals which have taken place from regular units of the Rhodesian armed forces in his territory. Quite clearly  President  Kaunda is finding that those reprisals are lifting to such a level that they are generating political tension. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>If this sort of settlement were to be accepted by the West, in some sort of uncritical way, as the finality of what can be achieved, I am afraid there would be rather grave disturbances to the balance and the general security of the nations of </para>
          <para class="block">Southern Africa. I come to the next point and that is that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> of Australia will be going to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in Lusaka in August and it would seem that he would have an excellent opportunity to exercise influence towards some sort of settlement- I would expect an African type settlement- which could conceivably and hopefully advance the cause of stability in this area. We are in the position where there has been a change of government recently in both Canada and Britain. Accordingly, the African heads of government in the former Commonwealth countries would find rapport with those leaders, something yet to be established. It does seem that we have some advantages in our relationship with the former Commonwealth countries, especially the African ones, over our near neighbours, our very good friends in New Zealand. The Prime Minister is going to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in Lusaka. Honourable members will bear in mind from comments that I have made in this place in the past that I am far from being a glowing approbater of the concept of the Commonwealth of Nations and Commonwealth heads of government these days. However, this occasion seems to offer an opportunity for a positive and helpful contribution to be made towards a settlement of this problem. Therefore, the Prime Minister goes with my good wishes. To the extent that he tries to achieve a settlement of this problem, he goes with my support and with the support of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>In summary, I state that this report must be seen as a very interesting one. It is a beneficial report because it gives the views of people who were eye-witnesses to the electoral processes. It must also be seen as covering an event which is no more than a step towards an objective which is still far removed from the grasp of the world. I say &#39;the world&#39; because the settlement internally impinges not only on peace in ZimbabweRhodesia but also on the stability of Southern Africa and perhaps Africa generally. That is something that ought to concern of us all. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I promised the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> that I would not delay the House for long. I will keep that promise. But I feel that I would like to comment on the report that has been presented because of my close and long association with Zimbabwe-Rhodesia which goes back to 1941.I congratulate my colleagues. I think that this report is an excellent effort. The Parliament of Australia has been represented, and I think that we ought to emphasise that fact. As such, this report is an illustration of the fact that there is unity within this place for progress and development to take place in some areas and for all honourable members to obtain a knowledge and understanding of what happens in other countries. I think that the three honourable members are to be congratulated on the report that they have presented and for the work they have done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not think there is any doubt that Prime Minister Muzorewa has done a great deal in that country. On numerous occasions he has tried to come to an agreement with the Patriotic Front. I think that that should be realised. I do not want to go into the political aspects of the matter. But I have found at the conferences that I have attended and at the meetings of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, that when we are discussing matters in African countries and with other member countries of the Commonwealth, if we are honest and if we put forward our point of view without hesitation and in a way which shows that we desire to work with the cooperation of the Commonwealth, those African countries respect us. I do not think that they respect us when we try to cover up and run away from a situation or a problem. I conclude by saying that the report contains a great deal of food for thought. It is a well thought out and well presented report. Again I congratulate my three colleagues in its compilation and on the work that they have done. </para>

            <para>-On page 2994 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 6 June, I made a statement to the effect that the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume)</inline> had voted to terminate half-yearly adjustments of pensions. I was incorrect. However, that still does not take away from what I said, which was that the man is a humbug. So too are the other five honourable members who abstained from voting on that occasion. If they had been fair dinkum they would have come over to this side of the House to vote with the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- by leave- On 24 February 1977 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation decided to conduct an inquiry into and report on: &#39;The adequacy of arrangements to prevent and deal with oil spills in Australian waters&#39;. The thrust of this inquiry was directed at oil pollution from ships, off-shore operations and shore based oil installations. The main government submissions were provided by the Department of Transport and what is now the Department of Science and the Environment. The major government initiative for dealing with the control, prevention and abatement of oil spills was the establishment of the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil. The plan had been operating since 1973, being administered by the Department of Transport in co-operation with the States and the oil industry, and funded by a levy on the shipping industry. The Committee recognised the value of the plan in its report and recommendations. The Committee tabled its findings on 26 October 1 978. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The inquiry was the first independent look at Australia &#39;s capability to deal with oil pollution. In preparing the report the Committee drew not only on evidence from Commonwealth departments and authorities but sought and received information from responsible State authorities, the oil and shipping industries and interested private organisations and individuals. The result is a balanced view of the situation as it now exists. It is clear to me however that the Committee had a difficult task in combining the different interpretations of the oil pollution situation. On the operational side, both government and private witnesses expressed the view that, although the possibility exists of large scale pollution from shipping, off-shore operations or land installations, experience has shown that the risk factors are extremely low. This is due to the low density of shipping around Australia and to the operating procedures followed on off-shore platforms and at shore installations. Those responsible for environmental matters on the other hand stressed that the possibility of oil spills from these various sources is nevertheless always present. </para>
          <para>The report acknowledges that the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil is an effective program at a realistic level which can, when required, deal with pollution incidents from other sources. The report in its recommendations called for action by a number of departments. These are set out in a paper which I will table with this statement. These recommendations have been carefully considered by the Government and I would like to outline briefly for the House the results which have been agreed. At the time when the report was tabled, the Department of Transport and the Departments of Education and Science and the Environment had already put into action eight of the recommendations. These are the ones dealing with tanker safety training; reporting of suspect shipping; official register of suspect shipping; encouragement to States to bring their legislation up to date; national plan equipment; involvement of environmental officers in incidents; register of oil cargo and spill information; and monitoring of international developments. Another five recommendations have since been adopted by the Government and are being implemented. These deal with: The provision of navigation aids; national plan involvement in incidents flowing from off-shore or shore based activities; reports on usage and success of dispersants; review of priorities regarding marine science research; and examination of the need for increased marine source research. </para>
          <para>The Government has also agreed on the desirability of the following recommendations but any decision as to their implementation would depend on further discussion and investigation either locally or overseas or in some instances on availability of funds, such as: Ratification of the International Convention on Training, Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers; use of satellites; ratification of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1 969; equitable basis for contribution by offshore and land based installations; research program for monitoring pollution; compulsory pilotage; restricted areas around off-shore platforms; widening of recommended tracks on navigation charts; increased funds for hydrography work; and extension of national plan to other hazardous substances. The recommendation dealing with ratification of the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971 has a number of constitutional and financial aspects which need yet to be resolved. The recommendation on cargo tagging is still under consideration. </para>
          <para>The recommendation proposing the establishment of a more equitable formula for the levy on ships cannot be implemented at this time. This recommendation suggests that a more equitable formula should be devised for imposing the levy on the shipping industry and in particular that tanker operators should pay a larger share. This view is not accepted by the Department of Transport or by the shipping industry. Statistics indicate that in Australian waters tankers are no more frequently the source of marine pollution than other vessels. The recommendation dealing with research in toxicity of dispersant and oildispersant mixtures will also not be proceeded with for the time being but will be kept under consideration pending developments. The Department of Transport has called tenders for bioassay testing of the toxicity of dispersants and oil dispersant mixtures in 1978 but did not proceed with the project. This decision was reached after detailed discussion between an expert member of the Maritime Services Advisory Committee- National Plan- and scientificauthorities in West Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The Government wishes to express its appreciation of the work done by the Committee and in particular for the value of the recommendations. </para>
          <para>I now table this statement to which is attached the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on oil spills. I present the following paper. </para>

            <para>-The response from the Government to the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on the prevention and control of oil pollution in the marine environment has taken some nine months. Most of the recommendations have received the attention of the Government to the extent that they have been acted upon, they are being implemented or they are being considered. I assume from the remarks of the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee)</inline> that the response is made not only on behalf of the Department of Transport but also on behalf of the Department of Defence, the Department of Science and the Environment and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The dangers that tankers pose for the Australian coastline are more serious, I believe, than one would think from a reading of the Minister&#39;s statement. In general, the statement tends to gloss over the serious nature of some of the things that could occur in the event of a tanker accident off the coast of Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I refer briefly to the recommendation that the Commonwealth Government increase the funds available for hydrography work in Australian coastal waters to hasten the upgrading of navigation charts. We are told that the Government is considering that recommendation. Because of the references to the faulty navigation charts which the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation found, I impress upon the Government that adequate funds should be made available for that purpose. Another recommendation under consideration relates to cargo tagging. Whilst cargo tagging is a simplistic term, it is best described in a reference in the report of the Committee. Paragarph 94 of the report refers to the various methods of individually fingerprinting oil cargoes that have been considered. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Sweden has introduced a trial system of coded plastic pellets which are put into unladen or ballasted tankers. Tank washings from these vessels can then be easily traced. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Oil slicks off the Australian <inline font-style="italic">coast</inline> are a fairly frequent occurrence, and the authorities are unable to identify the sources of those slicks. It is also a regular practice for vessels visiting Australia to take the opportunity in the course of the voyage to wash out their tanks so that they do not have to pause. They wash the tanks while the vessel is travelling instead of doing it in an authorised area. It is essential, if we are to protect our own marine environment, that there be some sort of efficient means of identifying the source of the pollution. </para>
          <para>The early part of the Minister&#39;s statement referred to the recommendation that the Department of Transport investigate and report to the Minister on possible ways of reporting suspect shipping. I relate that recommendation to the policy of the Government in respect of flag of convenience vessels. In recent years, during the world wide economic trough, particularly in relation to international shipping rates, this country has been exploiting the benefits of the cheapest international freight rates for many years. However, one always gets what one pays for and, along with those cheap freight rates, we have had a large incidence of flag of convenience vessels travelling the Australian coast. 1 refer the House to the statement in the report relating to evidence by a representative of the Queensland Coast and Torres Strait Pilot Service. I mentioned this to my colleague, the shadow Minister for the environment, in respect of the Great Barrier Reef. On page 26 of the report it is stated:   . . Approximately 40 per cent of the ships he pilots have substandard equipment. He went on to say, &#39;a very large percentage of ships afloat today under flags of convenience have absolutely appalling standards both in trained navigating personnel and in equipment. </para>
          <para class="block">It is not generally recognised in the Australian community that on these vessels the crews are paid virtually slave labour rates. Depending upon the country of registry, only one qualified person may be on board that vessel. One could best and most kindly describe the rest of the crew as sea-going labourers. It has been brought to my notice by members of the maritime industry that there are occasions when pilots have gone on board vessels traversing the Great Barrier Reef area at night to find nobody on the bridge. In effect, nobody was qualified. The one qualified officer on board was asleep below. That is the kind of risk that is entailed. Naturally, one would have thought that the Government would have been alert to it. </para>
          <para>On 4 April this year I asked the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> about the large percentage of ships flying under flags of convenience and frequenting the Torres Strait area and the quality of their personnel. Surprisingly, and I think irresponsibly, the Minister for Transport said that as the statement in the report to which I have referred did not include particulars of the identity or nationality of the ships in question, no meaningful answer could be given to the question. We are asked to believe that the Department of Transport does not know who are the flag of convenience operators through the Torres Strait and around the Australian coastline. Obviously the Department could not care less, from the tone of the answer I received. The Minister also said that the items of equipment referred to were the gyro compasses, radar and sounding machines. Surely, they are the most essential pieces of equipment in the navigation of a vessel and the negotiation of difficult sea passages in rock strewn areas? </para>
          <para>On 2 1 February this year I asked the Minister about the nature and number of deficiencies discovered during tanker inspections. The Minister referred to tanker inspections that had been established as a supervisory safety process and gave the impression that everything in the garden was lovely in relation to those inspections in Australia. On 15 January the Minister issued a Press statement in which he said that as a result of tanker inspections carried out over the period from August 1977 to December 1978 a number of deficiencies had been found. He did not establish the nature of the deficiencies. On 21 February, in a question on notice, I asked the Minister what was the number of deficiencies. The number of deficiencies referred to by the Minister for Transport so blandly, and obviously with an intent to delude the Australian public, was 480. There were 480 deficiencies revealed during inspections of vessels visiting the Australian coastline over a period of 16 months. I refer to some of those deficiencies. Ten overseas vessels had leakages from joints, hoses and glands pumps. Six vessels had electrical equipment in a hazardous zone which was not intrinsically safe. In six Australian vessels and six overseas vessels fire appliances were not ready for immediate use. In 25 vessels doors to accommodation and other doors and windows overlooking a hazardous zone were open. In 12 cases warning notices were defective or missing or safe smoking areas were not designated. In 31 cases tanker safety publications were not on board. Sixteen overseas vessels had faulty navigation equipment and insufficient or uncorrected charts and publications. Those are only a few of the deficiencies referred to in the Minister&#39;s answer. I will terminate my remarks to give my colleague a chance to respond. Whilst the statement from the Minister is welcome and goes a substantial way towards improving the position in Australia, a lot remains to be done. I hope that the Government acts with a sense of responsibility on this issue. </para>

            <para>-This is a very important statement made by the Government because it comes at a time when there is considerable debate in the Parliament about the impact of oil on the Barrier Reef. This matter was dealt with by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, in passing, because it was primarily concerned with oil spills from ships. It was pointed out in the report that ship-generated spills were estimated at about 35 per cent of the total input of spills into the ocean. Of course, there are various types of spills. Minor accidental spills frequently occur during loading and unloading operations. Then there are major accidental spills such as occurred with the <inline font-style="italic">Amoco</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-style="italic">Cadiz</inline>and deliberate spills which usually occur as a result of tank cleaning at sea. </para>
          <para>The important thing that needs to be noted by the Australian people, I believe, is that oil spills are very damaging to the marine environment. That is one of the reasons that I think this report is significant. Many statements have been made recently by people who have hopes of drilling on the Barrier Reef. We have had statements from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> assuring us that he would make sure that no damage would occur to the reef. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the report itself which is entitled Oil Spills: Prevention and Control of Oil Pollution in the Marine Environment&#39;. I ask honourable members to note the findings on page 7 of the report which states in regard to the effect of oil spills on the reef: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="18.">
              <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Major oil</inline>spills have a clear and obvious deleterious effect on the marine environment and on the communities of plants and animals living there. Oil is a conspicuous pollutant, and in particular, it has a dramatic effect on sea birds. Although long-term effects of sub-lethal concentrations of oil are not as dramatic as massive mortalities, the results may affect the survival of an important species, or alter the balance in the food chain. At present little is known of the long term effects of oil spills and an accurate assessment of possible damage is difficult. Damage to the environment is not easy to measure objectively. The basis of environmental concern is so ill-defined, that it is not surprising that research scientists have reached widely differing conclusions about the dangers of oil pollution. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I think that first statement is significant because in recent days the Prime Minister has been saying that he would never allow anything to happen on the Barrier Reef. We are talking about oil drilling and oil spills, but the result is oil in the marine environment. The Prime Minister has been saying that he would never permit any damage to the reef. I put it to the House that it is simply not possible for anyone, even the Prime Minister, with all the magic powers that he may have, to guarantee to anybody that if there is a blow-out on the reef through an oil drilling operation, there will not be damage to the reef. I do not care how much research is done in the short term or the long term; it is not possible for those guarantees to be given. </para>
          <para>Let me continue with what is said in this report. On page 8, under the heading &#39;Damage to Marine Life &#39;, it is stated: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="19.">
              <para>There are five main ways in which oil can damage marine ecosystems. These are: direct coating leading to suffocation; lethal toxicity of oil components; habitat alteration: hydrocarbon accumulation; alteration of behavioural responses. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The most obvious environmental effect of oil is usually the coating of large numbers of sea birds, nearly all of which die. Treatment of the birds is expensive and usually unsuccessful. If oil arrives at breeding time, the effects can be devastating. Birds are particularly vulnerable because of their activity at the air/water interface. Surface-feeding fish together with surface-living plankton are similarly effected by oilblanketing. If a slick arrives on shore, it traps innumerable littoral organisms. </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="20.">
              <para>The second harmful effect of oil is related to its inherent toxicity. Oil is extremely poisonous to shore plants. The aromatic components of oil are especially toxic. The overall effect is largely controlled by the manner of presentation to the organism. Thus, any suspension of fine oil droplets in seawater can be expected to harm underwater animals which otherwise might only be slightly affected by floating oil. Long-term toxicity can result from weathered oil which has sunk and then been lightly covered by sand or other sediment. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Surely everybody in Australia is aware of this magnificent marine ecosystem called the Great Barrier Reef. There is an enormous variety of marine life. There are literally hundreds of thousands of different forms of life in the sea. There are different forms of plant, fish, and coral and there is an inter-relationship between the land and the sea. </para>

But from the findings of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and from the evidence presented to that Committee it is very clear that very serious damage, probably devastating damage, will result to the reef. </para>

            <para>-The purpose of this Bill is to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1 975 to facilitate the development of the township at Jabiru. We know that that township is to be located in the Kakadu National Park, a unique area; indeed one of the most beautiful areas not just in Australia but in the world. The Government has decided that the mining town to serve the uranium mines developed in the region would be included in the Kakadu National Park and would be a closed town with a limited population. The town will be developed on land leased from the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and will be subject  to a plan of management. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act requires the Director of National Parks and Wildlife as soon as practicable after a park or reserve has been declared to prepare a plan of management in respect of that park or reserve. The Director has to follow a series of steps directed by the Act in preparing the plan of management, including the receipt of public submissions and making the plan available for comment by interested persons. I will have something to say about that later, particularly the conflict that exists between the conservative and, one might even say, reactionary leadership within the Northern Territory Government, especially under the leadership. of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Everingham,</inline> the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. He is very much at loggerheads with the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and that, of course, means that he is in conflict with the Government here in Canberra on that matter. Even though I think the Government in Canberra is a very conservative government, no matter how conservative it is it does not have to the same extent the reactionary elements that exist within the Northern Territory Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It was the Government&#39;s intention that by including the town site in the national park the town would be planned and managed in accord with the park plan of management. The last point in this respect that I want to dwell upon is that the Jabiru Town Development Authority is to be established under this legislation as a statutory authority responsible for the development of the township. I am quite sure that there will be continuing conflict between that body which is under the control of the Northern Territory Administration and the Parks and Wildlife Service. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government is responsible for the protection of the Kakadu National Park as a national asset. This Park is one of the world&#39;s great national parks and this Government says that it will continue to be. We on the Opposition side question that claim. We believe that the mining of uranium in the area will lead to the raping and destruction of many of the beautiful aspects of the park, including its natural points of beauty which have existed for thousands of years. Future development aspects will be affected also. We on this side say that the mining of uranium in the area will rape the lifestyle and the environment of the Aboriginal people. We say that the mining will pollute the waters of the Alligator Rivers system and will create a good deal of havoc. We say that clearly- and I will argue this point later on- insufficient work has been done from a scientific point of view to overcome the problems that will result from mining activities. Even those people who carry out the Government&#39;s business are stating that. Later in my comments I will quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry,</inline> the Supervising Scientist, had to say. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party will divide the House on the motion that the Bill be read a second time. We will divide again on the third reading. We will divide when those questions are put because this piece of legislation is interrelated with the Government&#39;s uranium mining policy. If this township is developed to house the people who will work the Ranger operation, the development will be extended to the Pancontinental mines, when they are given authority to mine, so as to house the people who will work them. The people who will work at Nabarlek will not be involved. Originally, because of the concern expressed at the inquiry into Ranger- what we now call the Fox Commission- it was thought that the uranium mining development would be sequential. It was thought that Ranger would be developed. Later probably there would be development of Nabarlek. It may be necessary to develop the Pancontinental mining area. </para>
          <para>The interesting aspect of the proposed mining activity is how the Northern Land Council was duped into signing the agreement. I believe that the evidence that I will place before this Parliament will prove that the manner in which the agreement was signed makes that day one of the darkest days of our history. It is evidence of the way in which the Ranger agreement was forced onto the Northern Land Council. Anyone who reads the transcripts of the discussions at that time between the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the present Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)-</inline> and many people now refer to him as the &#39;Minister for Unemployment&#39;- and the Northern Land Council will see who was the guilty man. Historians will write the real truth of the barbarism that was perpetrated at that time. It will be to the dishonour of this Government. Many people will call this Government a racist government because of the attitude that it took at that time. </para>
          <para>I want to make clear the reason why the Opposition will divide on the second and third reading motions. The Government&#39;s proposal is contrary to the Labor Party&#39;s policy on uranium mining. The Labor Party&#39;s policy is that, having regard to the present unresolved economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental and technical problems associated with the mining of uranium and the development of nuclear power in particular, until Australian sovereignty, the needs of our environment, the economic welfare of our people and the rights and wellbeing of the Aboriginal people are understood we will not assist in any way the Government&#39;s actions to carry out uranium mining in the Northern Territory. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the Labor Party&#39;s policy on uranium as was set out at Perth in 1977. </para>

              <para>-I thank the House. The only aspect of our uranium policy that I draw to the attention of the House is that, even if this Government proceeds to develop this township to house people to work the uranium mines of Ranger, when a Labor Government is returned in 1 980, as it will be, we will- and we clearly remind the people of this as we have reminded them so often in the past- repudiate any commitment of a non-Labor government to the mining, processing or export of Australia&#39;s uranium. That of course is the real strength of our policy. We of the Opposition are saying to this Government, to the people of Australia and the people throughout the world that we oppose the mining of uranium at this time because of the unresolved problems that exist. I do not have to remind the House of the Harrisburg incident. Do I need to remind the House of the third recommendation of the first report of the Fox Commission. At page 1 85, that report states: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The nuclear power industry is a very dangerous industry. Uranium mining cannot be divorced from the nuclear power industry because nuclear energy provides the material for the development of nuclear weapons and this increases the risk of nuclear war. The nuclear power industry is interrelated with the uranium mining industry. The &#39;peaceful uses&#39; of uranium for the nuclear industry cannot be divorced from the manufacture of nuclear weapons and the increased risk of war. That is clearly the situation. That is why the Labor Party stands very firmly on its decision on uranium mining. For the reasons that I have given, more and more people throughout the world are beginning to understand the reason for our opposition to uranium mining. </para>
          <para>We warn the Government, the uranium mining companies and the international financiers who are entering into the mining of uranium in this country that we will repudiate any commitment by this Government. We know that no publicity has been given to the conference being held at the Wentworth Hotel in Sydney. Representatives from most of the big mining companies and most of the financial institutions are present. I might say that most of them are foreign concerns. They include representatives of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd! The word &#39;Australia&#39; should be in inverted commas. That company is owned by Riotinto of Great Britain. We know that Esso Australia Ltd- an American company- is represented. We know that Getty Oil is represented. It owns 35 per cent of the Pancontinental organisation. Of course the representatives of Pancontinental are there. How much of Pancontinental is owned by foreign interests? All the great financial and foreign concerns are involved because they want to exploit Australia&#39;s resources, particularly our uranium. We have given a clear warning. A good deal of investment has been lost in the past particularly in land speculation in this country. People have had their fingers burned. I believe that those who invest in uranium mining in this country will have their fingers badly burned. </para>
          <para>Of course, even on the international scene demand for uranium is falling. We know that the economic aspect is one which will defeat the uranium and nuclear industry in the northern hemisphere. Let me give one example. Who will pay the enormous costs of the crisis that occurred at Harrisburg? Will the company pay? If it does, the cost will be passed on to the taxpayers through increased electricity charges. Will the Government pay? Will we ever really learn the true price of the enrichment of uranium? In the past the enrichment of uranium has been part of the war machine, part of defence expenditure. What about the cost of decommissioning nuclear power stations after their 30 years life has ended? Will they become tombs of the future? What is the real cost to police nuclear waste for a quarter of a million years? People are asking these questions more and more. We know that economics are drying up the nuclear power industry. They will do so more and more. </para>
          <para>I want now to talk about some of the conflicts between the Australian Government representative, the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.

              <para>-I will not quote out of context. If I quote out of context the Minister can read back to me where I misquoted him. I will try as much as possible to quote the Minister verbatim. On the first day of the last meeting with the Northern Land Council at Bamyili on 1 November 1978, in the course of the discussion, the deputy chairman of the Northern Land Council, Gerry Blitner said: </para>

And now we have a mysterious meeting here in a mysterious place, with police outside guarding us and we have mysterious doings outside by white people. If those white men have been asked by your people, okay. I am not angry about that or saying that it is wrong- if they have been asked. 1 still want to know if Oenpelli people want this. I say let us work the right way and proper way. </para>

          <para class="block">He was talking to the Minister because the Aborigines were surprised that they had been called together. They did not understand that there would be an agreement and that, in fact, they might sign it. The then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who is now the Minister for Employment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> orchestrated a meeting with the Northern Land Council and tried to blackmail the Aboriginal people morally into agreeing to the Ranger uranium development. The Minister spoke to the Council on the second day, 2 November 1978, and then again the following day at Oenpelli. </para>
          <para>Some people might say that the way in which he manipulated the Aboriginal people into sharing his concern that the whole Ranger matter be settled immediately was very clever. I have other expressions for him but if I used them in this place they would be unparliamentary. Therefore, I will not use those expressions. But, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> you can probably read my mind and you will know what I think of the man. The Minister said time after time that he was worried about concerns of people outside the Aboriginal area. He said repeatedly that he was worried that for six years the Ranger matter had been discussed. That is, he put the blame on the Aboriginal people for delaying the Ranger development for six years when, in fact, his Government had caused several delays and the whole project was not up for discussion until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox had made his report. </para>
          <para>I might also say that the Minister had not been to Oenpelli until July 1976. 1 had been there several weeks before him and no Minister of this Australian Government had been to Oenpelli and talked to the Aboriginal people up until that time. He was the first Australian Minister to do so although many Ministers had been to the area and talked to the mining companies. However, they had never met with the Aboriginal people there up and until that date. If the Minister follows the transcript of those meetings he will see that the Aboriginal people felt guilty. They were made to feel guilty because they had delayed the proceedings. They were softened up to submit to the pressure put on them by the then Minister for </para>
          <para>Aboriginal Affairs, the Government and the Minister&#39;s advisers, particularly a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishshaw</inline> who played a very sinister and treacherous game in the transaction at that special meeting. The Minister acknowledged that the Aboriginal people in their hearts did not want mining in that area. I quote again from page 9 of the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The evidence before us shows that the traditional owners of the Ranger site and the Northern Land Council (as now constituted) are opposed to the mining of uranium on that site. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Clearly, they have always been opposed to it and they are still opposed to it. The Minister claimed that the Government had accepted the recommendations of the Fox report. The Government had not done so. As I have already said, some of the most major decisions on the sequential development have been scrapped. Of course, the rat race is now on. May I remind the House of the fishing expedition recently between Tony Gray of Pancontinental and the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> who was under pressure in the House today and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony).</inline> Of course, a deal has been worked out for Pancontinental. That deal will further erode this Government&#39;s position and break the sequential development decision of the tax commissioner which was one of the most major recommendations of the Fox inquiry. The Minister then said that the Aboriginals would get a good deal from the development of the project. He then said- I will quote him word for word: </para>

            <para>We have been told that your negotiator has been acting on instructions. So I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> with me here today, it is a good opportunity for us to sit down and talk about it. </para>

            <para>Because at sometime, a decision has to be made, we can&#39;t go on another couple of months, another six months, another 12 months, now we can&#39;t go on, you really can&#39;t go on, it is no good for the mind to get worried, the Commonwealth, the Government can &#39;t go on, not knowing, you know, when it is going to come to an end. </para>

I am not speaking to delay the erection of the township at new Jabiru. In fact, I do not want to see time wasted or lost by too many other regulations or amendments which seem unnecessary being brought into the situation. Proposed new section 8D appears to be slowing the development of the town rather than speeding it up, despite the fact that the Minister has said that the amendment is supposed to speed up the work at Jabiru.

          <para>It is said that speed is required. This further consultation does not seem to accelerate the construction of the new Jabiru township. Surely the further reference to the Northern Land Council or councils will delay the granting of licences under sub-section 2. The Aborigines have the right to consult. They have done so. It has been written in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act.

          <para>I wish to reply to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Reid who spent quite some time attacking the Chief Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paul</inline> Everingham, about the conflict which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren</inline> states is ensuing between the Northern Territory and the Director, Professor Ovington, which in turn the honourable member says is the Government. The honourable member is saying it is the Northern Territory Government which is objecting. That is not true. It is the people of the Northern Territory who are objecting because they consider that the Commonwealth, through the Director, is using a heavy hand and moving to a position where it will control to too great an extent a township which is going to be in the Northern Territory. It will be surrounded by Aboriginal land, albeit land leased back to the Director. That is turn is surrounded by Northern Territory land. I just put him right on that point. He said also that uranium development will rape the lifestyle of the Aborigines. When the Ranger consortium first went to that area there were few, if any, Aborigines at that site. Old Peter was probably the only man they dealt with. The grog at Karl&#39;s Crossing was raping Aboriginal life to a far greater extent than an ordered township at Jabiru site would do. No doubt the honourable member and many others have been there, but the open cut site at the Ranger mine is a mere pinpoint on the map when compared with the National Park. </para>
          <para>Concerning pollution of the water, I hope the honourable member for Reid is aware that very extensive water and flora research is being carried out right now at Jabiluka. The scientists will continue to establish what pollution, if any, is being introduced into the waters, plants, fish, animals, et cetera. I would remind Territorians, when they hear or read this speech that the honourable member for Reid, one time  Deputy  Leader of the Labor Party, has stated that if the Labor Party is ever returned to power it will shut down uranium mining. He has said in this House that is what is going to happen. I warn people in the Northern Territory, who are hoping that his mining will help with development and employment in the Northern Territory, that it will occur. Yet the member for Reid knows only too well that his colleagues- I say this unreservedly- in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are forging ahead with the development of nuclear energy. When his friends in the USSR are forging ahead with developing nuclear energy, why does he do his best, with many of his colleagues, to prevent this development in Australia? I leave that question open for the community to answer. </para>
          <para>He mentioned the scandal of pressure being brought to bear on the Northern Land Council to make a decision concerning uranium mining. The greatest scandal of the lot was when his friends there- he mentions the local member as one of the people who would have been doing this, and his Labor Party colleagues- were pressuring the decision at Oenpelli, the place he mentioned. They were endeavouring to bring tremendous pressure upon the Land Council that was making the decision at Oenpelli. I point out to the House why we in the Northern Territory consider that the territory should have a far greater responsibility in regard to the planning and running of the Kakadu National Park. </para>

              <para>-I thank my colleague. In speaking of the Northern Territory&#39;s ability to manage and plan for national parks there is a proven record, and it is for that reason that we in the Northern Territory are behind Paul Everingham and the actions he is taking to give the Northern Territory Government more say in this regard. The Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission has a proven form in running the Ayers Rock-Mt Olga National Park, the Katherine Gorge and low level; old telegraph station in Alice Springs. All these things have been run efficiently and well by Territorians. In the light of that, I ask the Government what form the National Parks and Wildlife Service has on its side? Why should we not support more representation by the Northern Territory? </para>

          <para>I would also like to know why the township is to be limited to a population of 3,500 and, as reported, 13 square kilometres instead of the original 69 kilometres, as was suggested. To me that seems pretty short-sighted. One final remark </para>
          <para class="block">I make for the benefit of the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> is that he adopts an antiuranium stance and tries to identify every Aborigine in the Territory with that anti-uranium stance. This is absolutely not so.  His  Labor colleagues are endeavouring, as he is, to make political capital out of this. There are many people throughout Arnhem Land who are in favour of this. The Yuendumu mining company, which is situated 1 80 miles north-west of Alice Springs, is an Aboriginal mining company and it is flat out for the mining of uranium. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member makes it very difficult for the Chair. The Standing Orders state quite clearly that one voice is not sufficient on which to call a division. In view of the fact that the honourable member for Melbourne is here, if somewhat tardily, if the honourable member for Reid insists that he wishes a division, in view of all the circumstances, the Chair will give way and call a division. But I warn the honourable member for Reid that he must have more than one voice on the next occasion. </para>

            <para>-The purpose of the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill which is now before the House is to amend the Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973. This Bill will alter the membership of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation from five to eight members and provides common membership of the Albury-Wodonga development corporations. At present the Corporation is made up of three full-time and two part-time members. The Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Ministers are also members of the Ministerial Council. It was also agreed that these objectives could best be achieved by extending the membership of the Corporation to include the Mayor of Albury and the Mayor of Wodonga as ex officio part-time members of the Corporation. The legislation makes provision for a prominent businessman to serve on the Corporation in order to build up its membership. That makes the composition of the Corporation eight members, with the addition of the mayors of Albury and Wodonga and a prominent businessman. The prominent businessman who has been selected, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Russel</inline> Prowse, is a well known banker from the Bank of New South Wales. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Prowse</inline> has ultra-conservative, extreme private enterprise attitudes. The Bill abolishes the Consultative Council, which was composed of 16 members and which tended to create friction among members of the community. The 16 people who represent the community were meant to create friction because we wanted to get the people&#39;s views. This elitist type government would never really want to obtain the people&#39;s point of view. On behalf of the Opposition I move as an amendment: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, we know that the Prime Minister continued to dismantle all urban programs entered into by the the Whitlam Labor Government and set about implementing their complete destruction. There are very few of those programs intact that have been continued. The programs that are intact, such as the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, are given lip service only. What we refer to as &#39; Fraser &#39;s new federalism&#39; has meant a withdrawal of the Australian Government from any inter-relationship with State and local governments in urban and regional programs. I invite honourable members to look at the Labor Government&#39;s commitment on decentralisation. It was a policy of anticentralism because for so long Liberal governments had allowed the market force to determine the development of and even to centralise our cities. Over 60 per cent of migrants who came to Australia between the end of the Second World War and 1972 settled in Sydney and Melbourne. It was their over-centralisation which created the real problem. We had to examine the overall programs in an endeavour to achieve sanity in the development of our cities and to raise the standard of living within our urban communities. </para>
          <para>The average population growth between 1950 and 1970 was 1.9 percent, achieved as to 1.1 per cent by natural growth and 0.8 per cent by migration. If our population had continued to grow from the 1970s through to the turn of the century we would have had 23 million people by then. That means, taking as a base the figure for 1972, even if we were equal to the achievement of decentralisation and could slow the growth of our major cities, their population would increase by a litte over one million. If we look at the world, the best achievement was in Great Britain where between the end of the Second World War and 1970, it was able to slow up the population growth of the major cities by about one and a quarter million. If we could achieve that situation in Australia between 1972 and the year 2000 we would be looking to housing about 9 million or 10 million people in our existing cities. That would be simple madness because most of those people would reside in either Sydney or Melbourne. There were several programs that the Labor Government wished to carry out. Firstly, we had to slow down the population increase. We wanted to work towards an objective of l.l per cent increase or thereabouts from natural growth of population and immigration intake. </para>

              <para>- Towards that objective. This would have brought us a population by the turn of the century of about 17.5 million. As it turned out, Professor Borrie came to a very similar conclusion from his population demographic study. I want to make it quite clear that the policies of the Labor </para>

          <para class="block">Government at that time for urban and regional development were geared to a population level of about <inline font-style="italic">ITA</inline> million by the turn of the century. This would have meant, if we could equal Britain&#39;s achievement by slowing the growth of our major cities and redistributing the population by diverting them to selected growth centres a little over one million people in that period, then we could have absorbed the other 3.5 million into our other capital cities and made those cities rational places in which to live. That was our objective. We wanted to achieve our objective in several ways. We wanted to try to stop the over-centralisation of what we call the central business districts of Sydney, Melbourne and the other major capital cities. We wanted to develop in the cities what we call sub-metropolitan centre areas and to build a rational transport system within them, instead of having a transport system of the kind that now exists. At the present public transport travels empty from the cities of a morning, returns to the cities in a packed condition, and the reverse situation occurs at night. In other words, our cities are geared to a peak load system. </para>
          <para>We had already obtained agreement with the New South Wales Government on submetropolitan centres for the development of areas such as Parramatta, Penrith, and Campbelltown. In Melbourne we had reached agreement with the Victorian Government over a period of about two years working out a program of agreement. Again this was achieved with co-operation, because the only way we are going to solve these problems is in co-operation between the Commonwealth. State and local governments. We had achieved agreement by which we would have created submetropolitan centres at places such as Broadmeadows, Sunshine, Dandenong and the EppingWatsonia area. That agreement was reached between our Federal Labor Government and the Hamer Government. On top of that, we wanted also certain selected growth centres and the major priority was the Albury- Wondonga Development Corporation. Our study revealed that there were 18,000 too many Commonwealth public servants in the central business district of Melbourne. The great proportion of those 18,000 would have been diverted to selected sub-metropolitan centres in Melbourne as well as the other selected growth centres of Geelong and Albury-Wodonga. That was the pattern that we would have adopted. Some of the Commonwealth public servants would have transferred to the other selected growth centre at Bathurst-Orange. Of course, we know that in the change of government in 1975 these programs ceased and the free market forces have continued. The present Government has undermined completely the whole program of anti-centralisation and also has scuttled what it calls &#39;selected decentralisation&#39; in every shape and form. </para>

              <para>- The Minister asks about the population level. 1 stress that the Government&#39;s objectives in relation to the population level have not altered and the Opposition&#39;s objectives have not altered. It is the growth rate that has altered because of the downturn in the economy of the western world. In particular, the Australian economy has gone through a disastrous period. This has had an influence on growth patterns. But people still have to be housed. It is better to house them in a rational way rather than in an irrational way. The present Government represents nonplanning. It consists of non-planners. It is controlled by the Treasury. The Treasury does not believe in planning the economy. It believes in the market forces- the free enterprise system and the power of the corporate sector- determining growth. It does not believe in planning in any shape or form. That is the truth of the matter. That is why this Government has undermined and destroyed the urban and regional development programs that the Labor Government established. </para>

          <para>The Labor Government came to power in December 1972. On 25 January 1973-an extremely historic day- an agreement was reached between the Australian Government and the two conservative governments in Victoria and New South Wales. Those Governments worked together in a spirit of co-operation. Local government was also included in the agreement. I will never forget the tensions that existed between the public servants on the day of that historic conference. During the three years of Labor administration from 1972 to 1975 I was extremely proud of the public servants in the Department of Urban and Regional Development. They were part of a special breed of public servants who set out to build up a basis of goodwill, who sought to build a bridge of co-operation between the Australian Government, State governments and local government authorities. They discussed matters in a gentle way with State governments and local government. There is nothing worse than what I saw on the day of the conference. I saw the fear and suspicion of State public servants of the people coming from Canberra. There was an uptight situation. They thought that we were men from Mars or from a foreign land, not representatives of the Australian Government coming to have discussions with a State government. The public servants in the former Department of Urban and Regional Development were great ambassadors for the Australian Government and the Australian Public Service. They set out to cooperate. After two years of negotiations between Commonwealth public servants and planners and the Hamer Government in Victoria we were able to reach agreement on where development in Melbourne should occur. By June 1976 we had invested $90m in Albury-Wodonga. Of that amount $79m went directly to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. </para>

              <para>- Of course the bulk of the money went into land. That is where real wealth lies. Why should the people not own the land? An enormous investment in infrastructure is needed in an area which is to be developed. Urban land is worthless until the infrastructure is put on it by the public sector. Why should not the public sector- by that I mean the people- benefit from that investment? The investment inland represented a sound base for the development program. We invested in land so that we could stop the land speculators. Honourable members opposite support land speculation. They were supporters of Associated Securities Ltd and the Finance Corporation of Australia in Adelaide and the enormous speculation in land. Those organisations tried to reap profits from the young people in this country. Of course, eventually people had their fingers burnt. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Of course we invested in land. That is why, in the long term, Albury-Wodonga will be a great success. When the Labor Party returns to government in 1980 we will make sure that the spirit is reborn and we will give encouragement and stability to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. The only way to give that stimulus is for the Government to say that it is behind the Development Corporation. When in government we will transfer public servants from the overcentralised business district of Melbourne. We will create a stimulus and we will encourage manufacturing industry in Albury-Wodonga. We will protect industries in Albury-Wodonga and in other decentralised areas. We will not squash them as this Government has squashed them. </para>
          <para>Commitments to the Albury-Wodonga growth centre were made by the Labor Government when it was in office. Up to 30 June 1976 the investment amounted to $90m. The Fraser Government in its first year in office made $ 1 9m available to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. In the same year it made available $ 1 ,850,000 to local government in the area. It had made many millions of dollars available previously because it knew of the strain on those local councils. The Prime Minister said that the Government would continue its urban programs. What did it do? In 1 977-78 it cut back the funds to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation to $5m. What did it give to local government in the area? It did not give local government an extra penny. In the following year, 1978-79 the Government allocated a further $5m to the Development Corporation, a mere pittance to carry out its programs. It did not make any further money available to local government. </para>
          <para>The amendment which the Opposition has moved represents a constructive criticism of the Bill. In a way, I am grateful for any crumb that falls from the table. At least the Government has not completely destroyed the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. When a Federal Labor government is re-elected it will be able to give the Development Corporation the spirit it needs to carry out its program. I could say much more about our urban and regional development program as a whole. An integral part of that program was the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. However, I know that honourable members want to go home after a long session. I know that my colleague is waiting to deal with legislation. Therefore, instead of speaking for 30 minutes I will shorten my speech. I hope that the few remarks I have made in regard to the Development Corporation will lead to a better understanding of the Corporation in the Parliament. I hope that they will wipe away the hypocrisy about what this Government is doing. It is not meeting its commitment. The only way that Albury-Wodonga will take off, be a success and show the over-centralised areas of Sydney and Melbourne that decentralisation can work, is for a federal government to have the guts, the courage and the commitment to support a decentralisation program and the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. Only then will decentralisation succeed in this country against overcentralisation and the greed of the free market forces. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition does not oppose this Bill but it does want some clarification or simply assurances on a couple of the aspects. I read into the words of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> the intention that nothing will be changed. However, the actual wording of the Minister&#39;s speech was not as clear as it might have been. In making the requirement for obtaining visas and entry permits a statutory requirement rather than as it is now, an administrative arrangement, in that the Minister draws a distinction between the visa and the subsequent entry permit, people might draw the conclusion that one could have a visa, arrive on the shores in good faith and then be refused a permit on grounds of which they have not been totally unaware. I know that there may be some occasions when that may be necessary and I do not deny the Minister&#39;s right to have that discretion. I simply seek an assurance that this new arrangement changes in no material way the expectations of people who visit us have had till now that if they gain a visa, then they can, under reasonable circumstances be assured of entry. In like fashion, someone who has lived in Australia for years and who has gone overseas should be able to expect a re-entry permit. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not deny that carriers should be held responsible if they bring people here without a proper visa, but given that they have ascertained that people do have a visa, it would be unfair to the carriers if people with apparently legal visas got here and then, for reasons that no one could know of beforehand, were refused an entry permit. That would seem to be an open-ended liability imposed upon the carriers. I concede that the Minister has defined some of the circumstances under which this requirement would be waived. I acknowledge that. I simply want an assurance that there will be no change from what has been the practice in the past- a practice that holds in most countries. With those comments, we support the Bill. </para>

              <para>The Social Services Act was amended on 10 November 1 977 to give the Director-General power to grant a handicapped child&#39;s allowance in respect of a substantially handicapped child as distinct from a severely handicapped child. The Act was further amended on 26 October 1978 to enable payment to be made in respect of full-time students aged between 16 and 25. A number of other minor changes were also made at that time. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Yes. The allowance is available to parents or guardians of severely physically or mentally handicapped children who are living in the family home and who by reason of their disability require constant care and attention and are likely to need such care and attention permanently or for an extended period. The allowance may also be paid where parents or guardians care for substantially handicapped children in their family home and provide care and attention only marginally less than that required if the child were severely handicapped and who, as a result, experience severe financial hardship. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">

            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Neither the Minister for Social Security nor any doctor has the legal authority to grant or refuse payment of a handicapped child &#39;s allowance. The Director-General of the Department of Social Security, who has responsibility for assessing entitlements, may require the child to be medically examined or he may obtain medical advice from a legally qualified medical practitioner. This is usually a Commonwealth Medical Officer but specialists in private practice may be consulted in some cases. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>Yes. The Director-General has the discretion to set the rate of handicapped child &#39;s allowance where the family is suffering hardship as a result of providing almost constant care and attention to a substantially handicapped child. I have been informed that in setting the rate the Director-General has regard to the family income, its relationship to the average minimum weekly wage, the size of the family and, of course, the special costs incurred in providing the required care. In such cases payments may not exceed $65 a month. </para>

              <para>In assessing entitlement to an allowance, and in particular in assessing the need for constant or almost constant, care and attention the Director-General and the medical practitioners from whom he seeks advice have regard to a number of factors including the extent to which the child relies on the claimant for the performance of everyday activities such as eating, dressing, bathing, ambulation, toileting and any other special activities such as therapy programmes. </para>
            </item>

          <quote>
            <para>Telecom Australia has advised that it would be feasible though quite costly to fit all public telephone cabinets with locks. One of the design features of the aluminium seethrough cabinets now in wide use is that the door opens inwardly and diagonally, thus providing for easy bracing by a person inside and therefore a reasonable degree of protection against instrusion. It is conceivable that if it were possible to lock the cabinet door from the inside this could provide further protection from a would-be attacker in some instances, but it is doubtful whether a locked door would deter a determined attacker. Fortunately, incidents such as those referred to by the honourable member involving public telephone users are rare. Instances where a person faints or collapses due to illness in a public telephone cabinet and requires outside help are a more frequent occurrence and rendition of assistance in such cases could be seriously hampered if the cabinet door were locked. On balance, it is Telecom&#39;s view that it is preferable not to fit locks to public telephone cabinets. </para>

The decision to close each of these offices was made only after careful consideration of all the factors involved, including the effect the closure was likely to have on the local community. Moreover, it is normal practice for a proposal to close a post office to be discussed with local representative bodies, and for State and Federal Members of Parliament to be advised in advance of the proposed action. </para>

During the late 1 960 &#39;s and early 1 970 &#39;s, my predecessor the Rt  Hon.  John McEwen and myself as Minister for Trade and Industry highlighted the problems for Australian exports particularly primary products and strove to have special access to the EEC. Since its return to office in December 1975, the Government has maintained its long-standing policy of actively working to secure stable, fair and equitable trading conditions not only in Europe but in all existing and potential markets. We have been unceasing in our efforts both bilaterally and in relevant multilateral fora such as the GATT, to seek to obtain some moderation of the policies of the EEC which were not only resulting in severely limited market opportunities for Australia within the Community but which were also seriously disrupting our sales to third markets. It was as a result of the continued resistance of the Community to our continuing representations that the Government decided in mid 1977, to mount an intensive campaign to press our case at the highest political levels within the EC Commission and member states. To suggest that the Government acted belatedly is to ignore the facts. </para>

Staff engaged full-time on a Telecom function are offered employment with Telecom when the function is transferred. Should the offer be declined, the staff remain with Australia Post and are allocated other appropriate duties. In some such cases, staff are relocated to facilitate their continued employment. </para>
          <para>Staff engaged part-time on Telecom functions are not offered employment with Telecom and work rearrangement and staffing adjustments are handled by Australia Post. The under-utilisation of staff caused by the loss of Telecom agency work in these circumstances may be offset partially by growth in postal business. </para>
          <para>The withdrawal of Telecom agency business will, of course, reduce Australia Post&#39;s revenue with consequent adverse effects on operating results since, at least in the short term, Australia Post costs will not fall at a corresponding rate. </para>

            <para>In my answer to a Question Without Notice, I informed the House on 1 March 1979 on the steps taken to reduce the civilian element in the Defence Forces. I said that in 1973 the number of civilians employed within the Department of Defence was of the order of 37,300. Today that number has been reduced to 30,700. </para>
            <para>I take this reduction of 6,600 in staff numbers to be the aspect referred to by the honourable member for Corio in his Question. </para>
            <para>This total reduction of 6,600 in civilian staff numbers represents the net result of recruitment to and wastage from the Department in the six years from 1973 to 1979. In that period there has been considerable turnover in both staff and positions and it is not possible to trace out and identify all these movements. Many of the staff positions which were abolished and others which were created arose from the reorganisation of the Departments of Defence, Navy, Army, Air and Supply in 1 975 and 1 976, the transfer of some 6,000 staffs employed under the Naval Defence Act and Supply and Development Act to the Public Service Act in 1975 and 1976 and changes to a number of functions and activities undertaken by Defence. </para>
            <para>Estimates have been calculated of the net changes in staff numbers between 1973 and today in broad functional areas and these are shown below. It is not possible to calculate staff grades because of the lack of comparability between Public Service Act grades and the staff grades of personnel previously employed under the Naval Defence Act and Supply and Development Act referred to above. </para>

              <para>For reasons of operational training, general support and economy, battalions are located within the ambit of their particular Task Force base. These bases are currently adjacent to Sydney, Brisbane and Townsville. It is important that the fighting and support elements of a Task Force can be trained and deployed together, and without incurring heavy movement costs. Should a battalion be located in Tasmania, it would be at some considerable distance from the tactical air and other support forces needed to enable it to train effectively. Such support would have to be provided from the mainland. Therefore it is not intended to locate a battalion in asmania. To do so would involve substantial cost penalties with no countervailing benefits in terms of operational training and capability. </para>

Departmental officers are not in fact required to communicate extensively with CYSS participants. This is undertaken by the CYSS Project Officers who are in turn employed by the CYSS Committees which supervise the projects. </para>

            <para>As I have indicated on several occasions, both in the Parliament and elsewhere, the Government has been looking very closely at the feasibility of rewriting section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act in order to have an effective general provision against tax avoidance practices. </para>
            <para>I said in the House on 4 June that I hope to have an exposure draft of a new provision available for comment during the Budget sittings. </para>
            <para>However, any person with a knowledge of income tax law will realise that drafting a provision to replace section 260 is an extremely complex task. It is not one that can be, or should be, hurried. </para>
            <para>Apan from considering all the ramifications of judicial decisions on the present section 260, it is necessary to ensure that any new provision does not impinge upon genuine transactions or concessions provided in the income tax law to encourage various forms of activity. </para>

              <para>1 ) State Governments, through the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM) have been involved in the development and assessment of a National Wetlands Survey for over five years. In 1974-75 Commonwealth funds were provided to Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales to support pilot projects. CONCOM at its meetings in August 1978 and April 1979 strongly endorsed the need for a national wetlands survey conducted in co-operation between the States, Territories and the Commonwealth and urged the Commonwealth Government to provide funds to initiate the survey. </para>

              <para>CSIRO did not propose the national wetlands survey but with funding provided by the former Department of Environment was engaged in 1975 to undertake a feasibility study to determine how a National Wetlands Survey could best be conducted. CSIRO provided a feasibility study report to CONCOM in 1976. The proposals were not implemented because of cost, lack of agreement on a national approach and differences of opinion on the extent to which a national survey should concentrate on the aquatic fauna or the total wetlands ecosystem. CSIRO Land Use Research Division completed a further feasibility study in 1 978, which Standing Committee of CONCOM endorsed. </para>

              <para>The concept of a National Wetlands Survey was conceived in 1973 by the Australian Fauna Authorities Conference (precursor to CONCOM). The first stage of the National Wetlands Survey was initiated in 1 974-75 through the former Department of Environment, when $ 100,000 was allocated for this purpose. </para>

          <para>At its third meeting in August 1975 CONCOM, reviewed the progress of the National Wetlands Survey. In November 1976, at its fifth meeting, CONCOM accepted the view of Standing Committee that the Ecological and Wetlands Survey proposals submitted by the CSIRO in February 1 976 did not meet the immediate needs of nature conservation agencies but should be considered as the framework for a broader Australian land inventory. At its seventh meeting in August 1978, CONCOM noted the final reports by CSIRO on the feasibility study for a national wetlands survey, and accepted the view of Standing Committee that such a survey was an important conservation objective. At its eighth meeting in April 1979, CONCOM again strongly endorsed the need for a national wetlands survey conducted in co-operation between the States, Territories and the Commonwealth and urged the Commonwealth Government to provide funds to initiate the survey. </para>

              <para>The Public Service Board has informed me that the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act which provides paid maternity leave for Commonwealth public servants received Royal Assent on 18 June 1973 and the Act contained provision for retrospective payments for maternity leave absences since 1 January 1973.

        <para>I have been advised that since 1 July 1975, when the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian Postal Commission were established and the staff removed from the Public Service Act, it could be expected that the total cost of maternity leave for the non-Public Service Act area of Commonwealth employment would be of roughly the same order as for the Public Service Act staff as set out in (a) above. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Education to recommendation 5.33 of the Williams Report, which states:  . . that the Tertiary Education Commission discuss with the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University and the Western Australian PostSecondary Education Commission an integration of the activities of the two universities. </para>
            <para>Can the Minister explain the inconsistency between that recommendation and the statement of the Prime Minister on 22 March in which he alleged that the report had suggested the merger of Murdoch University and the University of Western Australia? I am sure the Minister will understand the difference between the integration of activities and merger. Will the Minister take into account the strong educational arguments in favour of the maintenance of separate institutions and not compel the two universities to merge? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister for Education has provided the following reply to the honourable member&#39;s question : </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As the honourable member has pointed out, Recommendation 5.33 of the Williams Report uses the phrase &#39;integration of activities&#39; rather than the word &#39;merger&#39; which was used in the speeches in both Houses of Parliament when the Report was tabled. The relevant portion of the speeches was a brief summary of certain major themes in the Report and the use of a different word to describe the Recommendation in this context did not imply any pre-judgment of the issue. I would point out that the recommendation is not that the two universities in question be merged, integrated or amalgamated but merely that an integration of activities be discussed between relevant State and Commonwealth bodies. </para>
            <para>This recommendation along with all other Williams Report recommendations will be considered by a Ministerial Committee set up for the purpose. The Committee will certainly take account of all arguments and representations which are relevant to the Recommendations and will have particular regard to the findings of the inquiry recently instituted by the Western Australian Government into the future of Murdoch University. </para>

          <para>A further consideration in the potential for development of jojoba as a commercial crop is that the present market for sperm whale oil is small by agricultural standards and there are already alternative products, other than jojoba, being substituted for both the purposes for which sperm whale oil is used and the wide variety of other purposes for which jojoba could be used. At this stage unknown factors include probable growth in world production, the costs of that production and the extent to which jojoba will be able to compete with these alternative products. Research results to date indicate that prospects of stability of production under Australian conditions cannot be expected to be known before the late 1980s. </para>

Summaries are prepared from Departmental files which are already in existence. There is no point in preparing a summary until an appeal has been lodged. </para>

          <para>If, after an adverse decision by the Repatriation Commission, an appellant to an Entitlement Appeal Tribunal decides to put forward further medical evidence and finds that there is insufficient time between his receipt of the summary of evidence provided by the Appeal Tribunal and the date of the hearing for him to obtain the further evidence, it is the normal practice for a Tribunal to grant an adjournment of 28 days to enable that f Further evidence to be obtained. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>As explained above this is not so. Nor is there a Departmental medical opinion as such, as the medical officers who write opinions for consideration by the determining authorities are required by section 48 of the Repatriation Act to express their own opinions. The medical officers who advise the Repatriation Commission when further evidence is referred to the Tribunal, are not the same medical officers who deal with the initial claims and each case is considered by the Commission and its medical advisors on its merits. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>There is no evidence that Departmental medical opinion tends to become more rigid or partisan than is consistent with section 48 of the Repatriation Act. I can assure the Honourable Member that the Repatriation Act itself states clearly the philosophy behind the handling of claims and this is well known to all members of Repatriation determining authorities including Entitlement Appeal Tribunals and the Repatriation Commission and its advisers. </para>

              <para>From 1969 the Australian Government began to review the transfer of the land to the New Hebrides. As no suitable Condominium authority then existed to receive the lands, discussions were held with the British authorities who agreed to establish a Land Trust Board in the New Hebrides, which would hold and use the lands in trust &#39;for the benefit of the people of the New Hebrides&#39;. The Board was set up in 1973 and on 3 December 1974 the Australian Government relinquished responsibility for its lands when it formally transferred the bulk of them to the Land Trust Board. </para>

          <para>I might note that, separate from this transfer of the bulk of the land to the Lands Trust Board, parts of the former Australian land were transferred to Burns Philp and Co. Ltd. In 1971 two blocks totalling less than 1 acre in the town <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> Luganville on Santo were transferred to Burns Philp (one block provided access to its main store, the other to the company&#39;s wharf). In 1974 two islands, totalling some 80 acres, oft&#34; the coast of Santo Island, were transferred to the company, subject to existing leases, for tourist industry development. Other transfers of land may have occurred between 1902 and 1971 but the research required to identify each would be considerable. The transfers referred to above nevertheless cover the bulk of the land acquired in 1 902. </para>
