          <para>- I am sure that all honourable members of this House were saddened to hear of the death of Frank Stewart. He has been a colleague and friend of many on both sides of the House over many years. I move: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <motion>
          <para>That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 16 April 1979 of the Honourable Francis Eugene Stewart, a Member of this House for the division of Lang from 1953 to 1977 and for the division of Grayndler since 1977 and a Minister of the Crown from 1972 to 1975; and that this House places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </para>
        </motion>
        <para class="block">Frank Stewart was a long-standing and highly respected member of the House.  His  untimely death takes from the Parliament a man who had given the country much and who had so much more to give.  His  passing takes from his wife and six children a loved and respected husband and father. </para>
        <para>Frank Stewart was born in Belmore, Sydney, on 20 February 1923. He was educated at St Mary's Cathedral College. He was always a keen sportsman. He had been a first-class rugby player. He was an excellent tennis player. Before entering the Parliament he worked in the State Department of Transport for 14 years. This period was interrupted by his four years service with the Australian Imperial Force during World War II. He served in New Guinea and achieved the rank of sergeant. In 1953 Frank Stewart won a by-election for the Sydney metropolitan seat of Lang which he represented continuously until it was abolished in 1977. He then contested and won the new seat of Grayndler which generally coincided with the area of his former division. During his 26 years as a federal member he served with characteristic conscientiousness on several parliamentary committees. He was an active member of the Standing Committee on Printing from 1959 to 1969 and the Joint Committee on Parliamentary and Government Publications from 1 962 to 1 964. </para>
        <para>Frank Stewart held the position of Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1964 to 1969. More recently, over the past three years, he served as Deputy Chairman for both the Standing Committee on Expenditure and the Select </para>
        <para class="block">Committee on Tourism. In addition, on numerous occasions he represented the Parliament and his government at international conferences. During the term of the Australian Labor Party Government, Frank Stewart held ministerial appointments including Minister for Tourism and Recreation and Vice-President of the Executive Council. He also assisted the Treasurer and other Ministers in their portfolio responsibilities. As Minister for Tourism and Recreation in the Labor Government he demonstrated his ability as a capable and hard working administrator and as a man with a sharp sense of his responsibility to this Parliament. </para>
        <para>Frank Stewart was a man widely respected for his integrity and resolution and for holding to his own convictions. He is recognised as an adherent, perhaps, of the old school of the Labor Party. He was also a highly principled and deeply religious person, a Roman Catholic who actively pursued moral causes. All honourable members will recall the force and conviction with which he espoused his views in the Parliament. Although many members of this chamber may have disagreed with him at times they would all, I believe, have deeply respected the views that Frank Stewart expressed and especially the conviction with which he expressed them. I believe that his parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House had a respect and affection for him and for his character, honesty and singlemindedness of purpose in those things in which he believed deeply. We all feel a great sense of sadness at the loss of a colleague who distinguished himself as a parliamentarian, as a Minister and as a dedicated member of his own party. On behalf of the Government I extend to his widow and family our sincere sympathy at the passing of a very fine Australian. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I join the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in the expression of condolence from this House to the surviving members of the family of the late Frank Stewart. Frank Stewart was a representative of a strong traditional element of the Australian Labor movement.  His  creed was based on two fundamental principles: The Catholic Church tended one's spiritual welfare; the Australian Labor Party protected one's temporal welfare. Millions of Australians have lived their lives in accordance with these basic articles of spiritual and political faith. Frank Stewart was one of the finest of them.  His  faith in two great institutions was absolute. He sensed their imperfections on occasions but his belief in their fundamental correctness could not be moved. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When the split overtook the Labor movement in the mid-1950s many Catholic supporters of the Labor Party were not able to reconcile their spiritual loyalty with their political loyalty. As a result, much of its traditional Catholic backing was lost to the Labor Party. The hostilities of warring factions did not shake in any way the loyalty of Frank Stewart to his church and to his party. He was able to maintain a total loyalty to both institutions. In their respective areas, church and party were as supreme in his personal beliefs as they had always been. With a small band of colleagues who were also Catholics, he remained a member of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party in an atmosphere of considerable difficulty- indeed, of some ostracism. The commitment of these members of the Labor Party was maintained down the years and they made a fine contribution to the record of the Labor movement from 1972 to 1975. </para>
        <para>To the end, Frank Stewart was a staunch adherent of the principle that, just as the Church should keep out of politics, there were areas of conscience where the State should not intrude. We saw a notable example of this in this House only a few weeks ago during the debate on the Lusher motion. In his last major speech to this Parliament, Frank Stewart maintained with the utmost dignity and conviction his belief that laws against abortion must be maintained. I am sure that even the most fervent adherents of law reform in this area would have respected Frank Stewart's motives and the tremendous force with which he expressed his passionately held beliefs. </para>
        <para>The main biographical facts about Frank Stewart have been listed by the Prime Minister, so I will not reiterate them. Frank Stewart in his youth was a fine athlete. He was for many years a competent and conscientious public servant. He had an excellent war record. He was a most devoted family man. It is as a professional politician that I want to speak briefly about Frank Stewart. He was a member of the Federal Parliament for 26 years. Like many of us, he spent much of his working life as a parliamentarian and professional politician. Frank Stewart's rise in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party was steady rather than spectacular. Perhaps this had something to do with the composition of the Party after the split. Once Frank Stewart was elected to the Parliamentary Executive in 1969 his contribution was undeniably a substantial one. </para>
        <para>Much has been said and written about his role as Australia's first Federal Minister for sport. In recent days I have been tremendously impressed with the tributes which have been sent to me from sporting bodies and other voluntary organisations. These have acknowledged most eloquently the value of the assistance that the programs initiated by Frank Stewart brought to hundreds of sporting and community groups. Many of these programs have been abolished or transferred back to the States. Little of the structure that Frank Stewart created now remains. But it is reassuring to see that his efforts have not been forgotten and that there is among sporting and community groups an appreciation of the assistance that he sponsored. </para>
        <para>It is fashionable to say, I dare say, that this sort of work should not be done by the Commonwealth; that it should be left to States and to local communities. The fact remains that without Commonwealth initiatives this important area of Australian society would not have been given the stimulus that has brought benefits to it in recent years. I instance in particular the assistance given for physical rehabilitation and for disadvantaged community groups. Frank Stewart was directly responsible for this assistance. The gratitude of associations in this previously neglected area has been strikingly evident, as I mentioned, in the expressions of sympathy that I have received. It is particularly poignant that Frank Stewart's lifelong dedication to sport and physical fitness might have been a factor in his death. </para>
        <para>There is another aspect of Frank Stewart's work that I want to put on the record in this Parliament. It was his extremely conscientious approach to his duties as a Minister and the competence with which he performed them. I worked with him closely when I was Treasurer and he was Minister assisting the Treasurer. Very often an Assistant Minister takes only a scant interest in a portfolio. He sees it as a distraction from the principal portfolio which is his main responsibility. He confines his duties to signing routine correspondence or attending an occasional meeting. This was not the case with Frank Stewart. Despite the burden of setting up a new department and establishing administrative processes in a new area of federal involvement, he worked most assiduously on Treasury matters. </para>
        <para>As Treasurer, I found him a tremendously loyal colleague. He was always master of even the most complex economic documents, always ready strongly to support the Treasurer in a difficult Cabinet role. I know from my observation that he gave other Treasurers the same loyalty and assistance. I found his support of tremendous value and I do not think I am breaking any of the rules of Cabinet secrecy by acknowledging that his backing helped to resolve successfully a number of tight situations in my favour. From my experience, he was an extremely competent Cabinet Minister and administrator. By sheer application and hard work, he built up an impressive command of economic data, and the arguments he based on this material invariably were cogent and compelling. His natural gifts compensated superbly for a lack of formal economic training. It saddens me that these talents, which have not been recognised sufficiently, will not be at the disposal of the next Labor Government. </para>
        <para>There is one remarkable quality he had which I suspect few recognised. Frank Stewart had what could only be described as a photographic memory. In all my life I have never met anyone who could recall almost word for word the verbal detail of complex economic reports submitted to Cabinet. He had the gift of almost total recall; not only that, he was able to understand the implications of the material that he absorbed so effortlessly. </para>
        <para>Frank Stewart's death reduces significantly the representation of the Roman Catholic Church in this Parliament. It is a sad fact that the Roman Catholic Church, in terms of its share of the population, is under-represented in this Parliament. With the death of Frank Stewart it has lost a most eloquent exponent of its principles. We of the Labor Party have lost a dedicated spokesman for our beliefs and a loyal and treasured colleague. Frank Stewart died much too young. </para>
        <para>There are only two other observations I wish to make on what is a most sad occasion for the Labor Party. One is to acknowledge the suitably solemn and memorable service at St Mary's commemorating the loss of a valued colleague. The second is to remark on the evident qualities of strength of personal character displayed by the surviving members of Frank's family in the face of the trying and immediate ordeal of personal bereavement. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I offer my sincere sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Maureen</inline> Stewart and to her family. </para>

It is indeed a very sad occasion when one of our colleagues dies, especially one who served in this Parliament for such a long period and had such a distinguished parliamentary career as a private member and as a Minister. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In 1965 I travelled overseas with Frank Stewart. We had the opportunity of getting to know each other. We became friends. I always considered him a manly man, a person dedicated to his party and devoted to his family. Frank had very strong religious convictions. This led him to take a strong stand on moral issues. We all remember the forthright and unyielding way in which he put his views on matters relating to the sanctity and security of family life.  His  high principles also extended to his political views and convictions. As was mentioned by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> Frank Stewart was of the old school of Labor men. At times in his career he suffered because of his attachment to his principles. Frank Stewart was the kind of man who won respect from people from both sides of politics. He certainly had my respect and that of my colleagues. We join in the expressions of sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Stewart</inline> and Frank's six children. They can take great pride in the fact that Frank Stewart was a man who served his country and his fellow man with humility yet with a determination based on the strong convictions and principles that guided all his actions. </para>

          <para>-! join the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> in expressing condolence to the family of the late Frank Stewart. As one who has known the Stewart family for many years, I can talk of Frank Stewart as a son, brother, husband, father, colleague and friend. I knew his parents. I knew his family. It is very evident from what has been said already that Frank Stewart was anxious to contribute to public life. He believed sincerely in the Labor Party. In a speech he made in 1953 after becoming a member of this House he spoke about fighting to preserve the conditions that the Labor movement had won. He kept up that fight with the strongest personal convictions. As has been said here, his convictions related not only to attaining political office but also to setting an example whereby all Australians could say: There goes a great Australian'. Frank Stewart was a great Australian. He exhibited that in this Parliament. All his colleagues and friends knew that they could always trust Frank Stewart in what he said and did. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>His parents were outstanding members of the Labor Party. Their membership of it went back to the turn of the century. They instilled in Frank the fact that there were principles in life to which we should all adhere although we might have different political convictions as to how to achieve them. Because of the Christian principles which were imbued in him, he was convinced that the only way to achieve them was through a political organisation such as the Labor Party which recognised equality of opportunity for all. The need to guarantee that equality has existed since time immemorial. As has been said by my leader, Frank Stewart was a great adherent of the Catholic faith. It must be remembered that he espoused its principles because he could identify them with the philosophy of a political party. </para>
        <para>Frank Stewart is well remembered for the contribution he made to debates in the chamber on family law and abortion issues. On those occasions he spoke about what is important in life and how best to achieve that end. Honourable members will remember the memorable occasion of 3 April when he was very concerned about the fact that, to quote him, we were tearing ourselves apart on an issue that he knew could not be solved in this place or in any similar political institution. He believed that the sort of conduct that one wants to achieve in life has to be determined in one's mind. He wanted to achieve conduct in accordance with the principles of Christ, and he endeavoured to do this by his own example. A significant feature of Frank Stewart's speeches is that he was always trying to convey, not by legislation but by example, what he thought would be the most excellent conduct for any person to achieve, whether it be as a politician, a father or a legislator. As my leader has said, there was no fiercer opponent in Cabinet than Frank Stewart when one was trying to get more money out of Treasury than he thought one should get. He approached issues on the basis of saying clearly: 'This is how it has to be'. Friendship did not enter into it. Honesty of purpose was always present in Frank Stewart. His integrity was impeccable. In supporting the motion I remember that Frank Stewart made a great contribution to public life. He will always be remembered. He was a magnificent Australian and a delightful parent. Obviously his death is a tragic loss to the nation. </para>

          <para>-(Moreton-Minister for Defence)- We pause today from our contest, our contention and conflict to recall the life and work of Frank Stewart and to express our sorrow to his widow and family. We do that with sadness, yet with pride- sadness that he has left us and gone to another world; pride that we have had the privilege of being in this world with him and knowing him so well. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you, the Prime Minister and a few of us still remaining in this House, sat with him in this Parliament for well over 20 years. We had an opportunity of knowing his qualities. I am sure that his family, his colleagues and friends would understand me when I include his weaknesses, but his strengths far outweighed his weaknesses. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Right Honourable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> my friends the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> have spoken about his integrity.  His  integrity was there at all times and so, too, was his courage. There is a very lovely injunction to be found in the Old Testament that seems to me to sum up the life of Frank Stewart: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">Frank Stewart held very strong views and he expressed them without any fear at all, no matter what conflict it might have brought him into within his own political organisation, within this Parliament or in the whole body of political controversy in this country.  His  principles were not acquired with each daily mail or with the publication of some fresh editorial. He held his views with deep religious conviction and clear zeal and this Parliament is the better for it. This Parliament is the better for men and women who hold strong views and express them here without hope or expectation. That was the life of Frank Stewart. In this cynical age, an age that seems determined to batter down rather than to elevate, there are many people who treat very lightly and casually the great estates of integrity and courage. It may be that from time to time those unseen estates are diminished but they can never be destroyed. Why? Because men such as Frank Stewart come among us and add to them with their own superb, sterling qualities. </para>

          <para>-I want to express my sorrow at the passing of Frank Stewart and offer my condolences to his family. There are several things that I want to say arising out of remarks that have already been made, in particular those made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> about the tensions, struggles and strife which were inherent on our side of the Parliament in 1955 when I first came here. It is almost impossible to believe what the tensions were at a time such as that. When I came into this Parliament Frank Stewart was one of those who was on the other side of the Caucus, in a minority which was regarded with a great deal of resentment by the rest of the older members of the Caucus. Throughout that time he stood steadfast to his political principles and to those things in which he believed. I think that there cannot be any better tribute to him than to acknowledge the fact that no matter what pressures came from outside from other forces, no matter what cultural or other pressures were upon him, he stood steadfast through it all. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Eventually, of course, he became a member of the Labor Cabinet. I think he sat on the front bench in 1969. If I remember rightly, in the ballot in which he gained that position, I was the runner-up. Frank Stewart and I have more often been runners-up in ballots in this Parliament and our Party than we have been victors. Occasionally, there are also victories. It is one of the penalties of our political life that we spend most of our time talking to influence. It is not often given to us to leave something constructive on the ground, as it were. During our term of office Frank was Minister for Tourism and Recreation. Scattered around this country there must be hundreds of projects that would not be there if Frank had not been the Minister and if we had not had a Minister in charge of those activities. I suppose that his most important memorial, if we can put it that way, is the Bruce Stadium in this city. The matter was raised with me as Minister for the Capital Territory and we made a joint project of it, but I must say that the initiative was his. </para>
        <para>Honourable members may recall that at various times in the government of this country it comes to pass that blue pencils are put through new expenditure. This was one project that was ready for the blue pencil. It was Frank's steadfastness, I hope with my support, that kept it on the agenda, and it is now out there in this city for the world to enjoy as an international arena. Over the years that I have been in this Parliament- I have spent a third of my life in this auditorium- a third of my life has been spent in association with Frank Stewart. We travelled together, we agreed together, we disagreed and still stayed together. Honourable members may guess that when we disagreed we really disagreed. Frank Stewart has left a mark on this nation because of his integrity and because of positive and physical accomplishments which it is not always given to many of us to achieve. I place on record my deep sorrow at his passing and at the loss of a man at his age. He was years younger than I am and he was a man of great activity who was always able to give what was needed to his opponents, to give support to his friends, and to take it as it was given out to him, that is like a gentleman and a proper soldier as he always was. him <inline font-weight="bold">Mr GARLAND</inline> (Curtin-Minister for Special Trade Representations)- I would like to add a word to what has been well said. I got to know Frank Stewart fairly well only during recent years, but I think it is worth placing on record that when the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure was established he was chosen by his colleagues to be  Deputy Chairman.  He was one of those people who did his best, with success, to establish the activities of that Committee on a bipartisan basis in its efforts to scrutinise parliamentary expenditure. He was, I found, always very well briefed and this has some relationship to comments made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden).</inline> Frank Stewart was concerned to find the central and main issues before the Committee and he stuck to those issues. In the circumstances I think that needs to be mentioned to the House and I offer my condolences to his family. </para>

          <para>-On Saturday night, 14 April, Barry Jones, the honourable member for Lalor, who was visiting the central coast as my guest, myself and my family went out to dinner at The Entrance. To our pleasant surprise we found at the same restaurant our colleague, the honourable member for Grayndler, and former Minister for Tourism and Recreation, Frank Stewart and his wife, Maureen. We spent a delightful evening with them and left them at about 1 1 o'clock. It was, therefore, a terrible shock to learn a few hours later of Frank's death at his weekender at Bateau Bay after playing squash. I mention this today because Frank Stewart, apart from having a holiday house in my electorate, was a great friend of the Central Coast. Shortly after the Australian Labor Party Government was elected to office and Frank had been appointed as Minister for Tourism and Recreation, I picked him up at his Bateau Bay home and took him up to Somers by to meet Frank Fox, the entrepreneur who had plans to build Old Sydney Town. Frank Stewart was quick to see the enormous potential of the Old Sydney Town concept which was not easy then as all we were looking at were hundreds of acres of barren land, a big dam and some plans. As he left he said to me: 'We've got to find a way to see this goes ahead and I hope that the Federal Government will be involved in it'. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is history now that the Whitlam Government, through the efforts of Frank Stewart, became deeply committed to Old Sydney Town and invested the vast bulk of funds required to get it off the ground. Old Sydney Town has had its problems, but is firing well at the moment. One day I believe it will be Australia's greatest tourist attraction and when that day occurs it will be largely as a result of the efforts of Frank Stewart. There was deep shock and sympathy among the staff and management of Old Sydney </para>
        <para class="block">Town. Frank Stewart was often described as he has been described in the House today- as an old style Labor man. It is true that as a staunch Catholic he held strong views on moral questions but it would be wrong to suggest that he was in any way a reactionary. As honourable members can see from his involvement in Old Sydney Town, he was in many ways a visionary and a forward thinking man. It is also true that under his stewardship, tourism and sport made the first real progress they had ever made in the federal sphere. It was only after he ceased to be the responsible Minister that people in those fields realised just how much he had done in breaking new ground. </para>
        <para>I was very pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> mention today what a marvellous job Frank Stewart did in Cabinet. I can recall many Cabinet Ministers saying to me privately how impressed they had been with Frank Stewart as a Cabinet Minister. He was one of the unheralded heroes of the Labor Government. I was very distressed that I could not attend his funeral because of a previous commitment to welcome Len Reid, a former member of this House, in his 'Walk for the Child' around Australia. I am sure that Frank Stewart would have understood my inability to be there. I had a close association with Frank, firstly, as a member of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism and, secondly, because of my long interest in tourism, sport and recreation. I now have the honour to be spokesman in those areas for the Australian Labor Party. I hope that the job I do is half as good as that done by Frank Stewart. I would also like to take this opportunity of reading into the record two messages which I think are important and which came from people who were involved in areas of Frank's portfolio. The Confederation of Australian Sport sent this letter to me: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Confederation of Australian Sport deeply regrets the passing of the Honourable Frank Stewart. </para>
          <para>He was a man of great empathy with the Australian sporting community. He was the Federal Minister responsible for the first general allocation of Federal Government funds to sport but moreover, he was at all times a gentleman and accessible to sports people. </para>
          <para>In true Australian style, he was 'a great sport'. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That letter was from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gary</inline> Daly, the Secretary of the Confederation of Australian Sport. The second letter, from the  President  of the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation.was addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bill</inline> Hayden but was forwarded on to me. It reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I am writing on behalf of the Council to express sincere regret at the passing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Stewart. In the years when he was Minister for Sport and Recreation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stewart</inline> had a most significant influence on these aspects of Australian life, and I know from my recent reading of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> how proud he was of the progress made during those years.  His  initiative and impact will long be remembered by those who knew him well, and those people involved in physical education, recreation and sport who benefitted from his programs. </para>

          <para>-I join the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and other speakers in paying a tribute to Frank Stewart. It was my privilege in my first year in this Parliament to visit Indonesia and the Philippines. Frank Stewart was the  deputy  leader of that delegation. On that occasion he served Australia well, as he did in all the years he was a member of this Parliament. One of the impressions that I gained of Frank Stewart remains very clear in my mind. As has already been said, Frank Stewart was a man of honesty, integrity and determination and a man who gave a clear indication of where he was going. This Parliament can do with more such people. I had occasion to approach Frank Stewart when he was a Minister in the Government of this country with a proposal that I did not expect to be accepted. I believed that it was deserving of acceptance, and it was accepted by Frank Stewart on the basis of the character and principle he exhibited so clearly during the time that he was a member of this Parliament. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It was with sorrow that I learned of his passing. But I am very pleased to have the opportunity of joining other speakers in paying a tribute to a man whose character, I believe, has lifted the standard of integrity and honesty in this Parliament. However, this high standard is not upheld by every member who comes into this place. It is appropriate that all the speeches that have been made today have centred around the character and courage of a man moving as he thought fit. That is all that any of us can do in service of the country. I admired Frank Stewart. I offer to his wife and family my very sincere condolences. </para>

          <para>-I join the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> in offering my condolences to Maureen Stewart and her family. I knew Frank Stewart from the time I became a member of the Australian Labor Party. He lived very near to me in the adjoining electorate, the former electorate of Lang, for most of his life. He was a person of great strength against whom one could measure oneself- as a yardstick of integrity, how people should behave and what principles they should have. It is very nice for those who were friendly with him to see the House pay him a tribute such as this and it was even nicer to see the tribute paid to him during his funeral. Whilst plenty of people say that the Church gives Catholics a great send-off, a funeral is not a theatrical performance. To those people who tended to write Frank Stewart off as a right winger, or as somebody who never made Prime Ministerial rank but was in the body of the Labor Party, I point out that there can be no greater tribute than a cathedral the size of St Mary's in Sydney to be filled with people who meant what they said about him. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The composure of Maureen Stewart and her family was testimony to the fact that they believe what Frank Stewart believed; that is, that there is a life after death and that one's life on earth counts in terms of one's contribution to others and one's eternal reward. Frank believed that there would be an eternal reward. He died after Easter Sunday and those of us who shared some of his views like to think that he died in a state of grace and will live an eternal life with Christ. Our most fervent wish is that his family will join him in a life with Christ after death. </para>
        <para>He made a great contribution to the Labor Party, as many people on this side of the House have said. Perhaps on many occasions his family did not understand the tests of strength which were put on him, not often in great public speeches but in the corridors and in the Caucus- in those little ways in which a man can have a big influence on the way in which the Parliament works and upon the nation. It is pleasing to see that through the Labor Party a person with no special background can have such an enormous influence upon the Parliament as he had. </para>
        <para>He was a very rare man and I am very much in his debt personally. He was a source of much guidance to me. He generally commented on things that I said and the way in which I performed, and I was always grateful. But more than anything else, he was a great influence on the Labor Party. He tried to keep the Party relevant and to see that it maintained its principles. He is a great loss to our Party, to the Parliament and to the nation. I join the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in offering Maureen Stewart and family my condolences. </para>

          <para>-I join the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and all my other colleagues and friends in expressing my deepest sympathy and condolences to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Stewart</inline> and her family at the sad passing of her husband. I was privileged to be a member of this House when the  Hon.  Dan Mulcahy passed away. The House lost an elderly gentleman who was respected and revered, a man for whom a great majority of members had great affection. Into the Parliament came a much younger man who brought with him a robust integrity and a very deep conviction. As  chairman  of the ex-servicemen's committee of the Government parties I will not reiterate the fine expressions that have been made but I will point out to the House of Representatives this afternoon that in 1941, during a war that had commenced in September 1939, when casualty lists were long, when the great campaigns that were fought in the Middle East, in Greece and in Crete were finished, almost immediately after Frank Stewart turned 1 8 years of age he became a member of the fighting service, the Second Australian Imperial Force. It is a tribute that in 1979 might be regarded as rather late, but it is worthy of recognition that in 1941, when the full consciousness of war was upon the people living in this country, a man who was just barely qualified legally to wear the uniform of the Monarch did so. With great respect, I bring that to the attention of the House. As you have been told, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> Frank Stewart fought in battles in New Guinea under conditions and circumstances with which some in the House would be familiar, but they are a diminishing group. We have lost a friend and a man who represented, in terms of integrity and service, a dedication to duty and a devotion to principle, as he saw it, that I know will be respected by all who knew him. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I want to mention in particular one point of which most honourable members would not be aware. In doing so, I speak on behalf of that great hospital in my constituency, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, which is well known throughout Sydney. I put this tribute on the record for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Stewart</inline> and her family and for Frank Stewart's distinguished brother, who is the Minister for Health in the Government of New South Wales. The  Hon.  Frank Stewart, the honourable member for Grayndler, was of great help to that hospital. Few contributions of thanks and gratitude are rendered to a member of the House for deeds that are not made known publicly.  His  assistance to that hospital is one such deed. I place my thanks on record this afternoon. </para>
        <para>Frank Stewart and I served together on a number of committees, including the Joint Parliamentary Government Publications Committee, which has already been mentioned. We also snared adjoining offices. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you divided for us a suite of offices that had belonged to a great and distinguished aviator who was a very senior member of this Parliament. My office was more on the utilitarian side and the honourable member for Grayndler, having regard to his distinction as a former Minister of state, enjoyed the more pristine side. That gave us the opportunity to enjoy a personal friendship which began in 1953. Having had many discussions with Frank, having been a political competitor, having been a man who respected him over a long period and having known of his education and training at St Mary's Cathedral College, as mentioned by the Prime Minister, I leave honourable members with this thought: When the time came for Frank to arrive at perhaps the most significant entry gate and he was invited to identify himself, in my judgment he would have said in the Latin which I know he learnt: ' Adsum semper fidelis'. </para>

His  name was most respected in his electorate of Grayndler and in his previous electorate of Lang. As other speakers have said today, our condolences go to his wife, Maureen, his son, his daughters, his mother, brother and sisters and those of his friends most dear to him. Previous speakers including the Prime Minister have said, amongst other things, that Frank Stewart was a great Australian and politician. He showed these qualities when he represented his electorate for the past 26 years. He came to Parliament as a young man of 3 1 years of age. In those days that was a young age to be a member of Parliament. I must convey to his wife Maureen and his family the thought that many times when he should have been at home he was in the Parliament looking after Australians. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Frank was very good to me as a member of Parliament for the last four years. Although there were only a few years difference in our ages, Frank used to treat me like a son, sometimes by abusing me for saying many things which I should not have said. He used to take me in- I was in trouble a few times- and tell me how to put a question on notice and how to ask a question without notice without being ruled out of order. As a new member of Parliament I well appreciated his advice. I remember Frank asking me one day about my background and about my father who was a trade union official like his own father. I told him the three main principles of the old Irish Catholic. He laughed and said that he had thought of them but had not heard them expressed that way previously. My father used to say that the three main things a man had to do in life were to go to mass, be a member of the trade union movement and be a member of the Labor Party. I think that was Frank's philosophy. It is a philosophy that has been adopted by many members of the Labor Party. </para>
        <para>Frank was going to take a trip as a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union with his wife, Maureen, together with me and my wife, Pat. We were to leave on 13 September for a few weeks. He told me that his wife, Maureen, had not been away since 1963. She had agreed to leave the family and take a few weeks to see the world. We were to meet last week to have dinner and work out the itinerary. Not many people know this. Frank said that this would be his last trip as he was getting older. He said that after another couple of terms he would think about retiring. I shall read an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Catholic Weekly</inline> in which Cardinal <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Freeman paid a tribute to Frank Stewart. He said: </para>

          <para>-Just one moment's reflection makes it clear that Frank Stewart's period in the Parliament was an adornment to his family, his party and the Parliament. It was my privilege to know him very well and to have been brought up in the same suburb of Sydney. I attended a more recent off-shoot of the primary school which he attended. The reputation which he deservedly earned was well known to me and my family. His whole family can take enormous pride in his private and public life. People in public life can have many qualities but the rarest is the possession of moral courage. Compared with it, physical courage is common indeed. It was physical courage, for example, that caused the late Frank Stewart to play lock  for Canberbury-Bankstown. Moral courage is possessed by extremely few people in private or public life. Frank Stewart fought for many things, privately and publicly. I believed with him in many of the things for which he fought. We all know of the battles he fought. We know that he was a member of Parliament from 1953 to 1979. People like Frank Stewart went through an enormous strain in public life from the middle 1950s. Life became exquisitely difficult for them. But Frank Stewart was never one to flinch and he was never one to retreat. His views were always views for Australia. They were never sectional. He never suffused his own attitude, his own statements and his own views with bitterness or with rancour. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>To Maureen and to his family his loss is indeed a heavy blow. If a husband 's or a father's life can act as a light and as an example to his wife and to his children then Frank's will shine for many years.  His  example will be a beacon for many decades to come.  His  party, this Parliament, Australia and certainly his family should remember him always. </para>

Frank Stewart was my friend. Not only that, he had a multitude of friends outside this Parliament and I think that that really is the test of how good a person is. Political life is a strange life. It is almost a passing phase, quite frankly, and it is often said that the worth of a member of this Parliament is not fully recognised until such time as he dies. I do not think that that can be said of Frank Stewart because the worth of Frank Stewart to the community was recognised long before he passed from this earth. Deep down Frank Stewart was a very human man. On the outside he had a veneer- I think one could call it that- of toughness. But when one got below the surface one found that Frank was very human. I think I can say quite honestly that he was very soft beneath that tough exterior. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He fought for what some people might say were lost causes, mainly moral issues. But it did not stop the tenacity with which he fought for those causes. He earned the respect of all people whether or not they believed in the causes for which Frank fought. There was many a tussle in our party meetings as happens at all meetings of all parties. But I think it can be truly said that whilst many harsh words were sometimes spoken, people respected Frank for what he said. He was justifiably proud of his family. Possibly he did not always express outwardly the pride which I know he deeply felt for his family. Members of parliament on both sides might not always have agreed with some of his views or indeed with many of his views but they respected him for putting them forward. He earned the respect of everybody. </para>
        <para>As has been said by previous speakers, he was a man of absolute integrity. He was part of a family commonly known in the green belt around Belmore- as the right honourable member for Lowe <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William McMahon)</inline> has often said- as the Stewart clan. My brother married Frank's sister and I was classed as part of the Stewart dynasty, something of which I was proud and of which I still am proud. The Stewart family is a very close-knit family. It includes not only Maureen, the six children, each of the six brothers and sisters who are alive today but also Frank's lovely old mother, aged 84, still battling on and commonly known amongst the Stewart clan as Mama. One sees a wonderful respect displayed from the members of the Stewart family and the grandchildren not only to their own mothers but also to the mother of the Stewart clan. I pass on my sincere condolences to Maureen and her family and also to the other members of the Stewart family, including the six remaining brothers and sisters and Mama. </para>
        <para>Frank left his mark on Australia. The mark will still be there in generations to come. I feel honoured to have known him. To me he was more than a colleague; he was a friend. </para>

          <para>- I too wish to be associated with this motion of condolence. I express my very deep sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Stewart</inline> and members of her family. I suppose it could be considered almost presumptuous for one who has served in this House for only <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> years to speak on a motion such as this concerning a man who has served this Parliament for so long and so well. During 1 977 and 1 978 I served with Frank Stewart on the Select Committee on Tourism. He was the Deputy Chairman of that Committee. Last year I was Chairman. Frank Stewart was a tremendous help not only to me but also to other members who served on that Committee. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I was interested to hear the words of the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> when he said that in many respects it was Frank Stewart who brought the first recognition to this House and to the nation that tourism was an industry in Australia. I believe that that tribute was spelt out in St Mary's Cathedral just a few short days ago when more than 2,000 people packed that cathedral. The tribute to the work that </para>
        <para class="block">Frank Stewart had done in that particular area was obvious by the fact that representatives of all levels of the tourist industry attended that service. Frank Stewart was, in the best sense of the word, proudly Australian. He loved Australia. He loved everything that Australia stood for. He was convinced of the future of Australia and he let that be known very loudly indeed. </para>
        <para>Frank Stewart was a man who thought that all decisions should be made in the best interests of Australia. As a result of the many hundreds of hours that members of that Committee spent together, we realised that that was the case. The report that was finally issued was very much the work of Frank Stewart.  His  influence on it is obvious. It was a report delivered to this House without one dissenting voice. In that respect it is a very great tribute. Many honourable members have said that he was a man of great moral courage. He was also a man of great political courage. Frank Stewart was a fine Australian and I am proud that I had the opportunity to serve with him. </para>

          <para>-I wish to support this motion of condolence and to express my sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Maureen</inline> Stewart, her family, and Frank's family. I first met Frank Stewart in 1953 when he had just gained pre-selection for Lang. I was introduced to Frank by John Armstrong, a former Minister in the Chifley Government and a former  Deputy  Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate. He was also a former High Commissioner to London and a former Lord Mayor of Sydney. Frank was a very close friend of John Armstrong throughout John's life. When I first walked into this chamber this afternoon I wanted to check today's date. I involuntarily turned around to the seat behind me, as I have been in the habit of doing so many times in the past for the purpose of checking some details. It is at a time like that that his passing comes home to me. Most of what I wanted to say has already been said today. I refer to Frank's tenacity, his fundamental belief in the place of the family in our society and his determination to fight for the place of family in society, irrespective of the cost. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As has been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and others, and has also been mentioned to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reg</inline> Bishop, Frank Crean and Gough Whitlam, there was no Minister in the Whitlam Cabinets who went into a meeting better briefed than Frank Stewart. No one read his papers more assiduously. Thus he had the ability to fight tenaciously for what he believed was the correct decision. That has all been said. It was fundamental to everything about him.  His  loyalty to his church, his loyalty to the Labor movement and, equally as important, his loyalty to his mates have been mentioned. I think that those are important facets of any man's beliefs and of any man's makeup. Frank had those very great attributes. Once again I wish to express my sympathy to Maureen Stewart and her family. </para>

          <para>-I wish to be associated with this condolence motion not only because I had the opportunity of serving with Frank Stewart in this House but also because of his family's association with mine in other ways. My late father served with his brother in the Parliament of New South Wales. He told me of his fondness for and his admiration of another member of the Stewart family. In this House I had the opportunity to know what my father meant. As one who, in a sense, is part of a political family I think I can recognise and respect what happens when members of a family together serve the public and serve their country in the way they think best. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I also had the opportunity of serving with Frank Stewart on the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. The Committee was established only recently but it has been working assiduously. It met in Perth, with Frank present, the week before he died. We knew of his intense personal interest in the subject of our deliberations. We recognised his conscientious support of everything that had to do with the family and family life, and its importance to our particular task. We respected his diligence and the assiduous way in which he fulfilled his duties in that role, as he did in all others. He attended all the public hearings we conducted in our short time of operation. I know that other members of the Committee would want me, as Chairman, to speak briefly about his involvement in this area because of its close association with his own personal area of concern and interest in this Parliament, one which transcended, I believe, the political interests that we all have and share. The report of the Committee ultimately will be poorer, in my view, for not having him associated with us to the end. I finally want to make an observation, as a non-Catholic, about his churchmanship. He was respected for his churchmanship by, I believe, men and women of all faiths. </para>

        <para class="block">Frank Stewart before I entered this Parliament but I want to say that it was very gratifying to find after I entered Parliament that we had many things in common. I can well remember with appreciation the many occasions that Frank invited me to go into his office and have a drink and discuss some particular matter. He was a thorough politician. He believed in fully analysing the things before Parliament, particularly the moral issues to which he had a great commitment. I appreciate very much the many things that he did for my electorate during the time he was Minister for Tourism and Recreation. On behalf of the people of the former electorate of Darling and the present electorate of Riverina, I express gratitude for the many things he did for them. It was with some satisfaction to me, although I am still deeply in his debt, that I was able to do something for him in return. He was a great friend and, I believe, a great member of this Parliament. I feel very sad at his passing. I offer my deepest sympathy to his loved ones. </para>

I pay particular recognition to the contribution which Frank Stewart made to this country's tourist industry as Minister for Tourism and Recreation. As a Catholic, I recognised the steadfast nature of the convictions held by Frank Stewart and the resolute nature in which those convictions were put forward at all times. This Parliament will be the poorer for his passing. I extend my condolences to his widow and family. </para>

          <para>-I wish to pay tribute to Frank Stewart. The honourable member for Banks <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martin)</inline> pointed out that Frank Stewart had many friends. I am unlike them in that my friendship with Frank Stewart was virtually one of only a few months duration. Nevertheless my tribute is a personal rather than public one. I had contact with him on one or two occasions and, as a relatively new back bench member of this House, I found the advice and at times, consolation that he gave me to be most beneficial and rewarding. At times I spoke to him about some of the situations in which one found oneself, particularly in terms of the effect on family life of the commitment that is required of a Federal parliamentarian and the sacrifices that are made by one's wife, children and friends. I once said to him: ' How does one handle the situation when one comes back from Canberra and finds that one's eight-year-old daughter is saying goodbye instead of goodnight?' It was in those sorts of situations that Frank was able to give very good and sound advice, consolation and sympathy. I found him to be a man of extraordinary integrity. I am not of his faith; nevertheless I have very deep respect for him. He said to me at one stage that the most important thing in this game is to retain one's identity and integrity and that sooner or later every individual in this place will come up against a time of testing and that that person should not be found wanting as he has to live with his conscience. It is my honour to have known this man. </para>

          <para>-The seats of Grayndler and St George are adjoining and it was a privilege for me to be with Frank Stewart on community occasions as well as to learn from his contributions in this House. He was almost an institution in the Canterbury and surrounding areas of Sydney which formed the electorates of Lang and Grayndler. He had a deep devotion to his constituents and gave fully of his time and energy to assist them. Frank Stewart held the respect of the whole community and had a great personal following. He was a kindly man, but also a strong fighter for his causes. He served his country honourably in peace and war. At recent Anzac reunions the shock and sense of loss were felt deeply by all present. It did not seem the same without him. The loss of a man of such integrity is a grievous loss to the Parliament. I join in supporting the motion and extend deepest sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Stewart</inline> and her family. </para>

                <para>The computer network connected to the IBM 360/65 computers has resulted in a net staff saving of about 300 staff. The major saving results from the containment of staff numbers needed for pharmaceutical benefits claims processing which currently involves 627 people. </para>

            <para>The network centred on the IBM 370/168 computers was established primarily to provide data processing support for Medibank. More than 4500 people were employed by the Health Insurance Commission during 1976/77 to administer the Medibank Scheme. It would not have been possible to operate a comparable universal health insurance scheme on this scale without the computer network. Consequently there is no satisfactory basis for assessing notional staff savings by comparison with some alternative wholly clerical system. </para>

Details of the services to be available at the new hospital have not yet been provided but it may be that this is the neo-natal facility to which the honourable member refers.

              <para>I ) The Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System took over four years to complete and produced 303 recommendations and conclusions. This is an indication of the complexity of the Repatriation System. Since the tabling of the Report there have been many important changes in health and welfare benefits available to the Australian community. These changes must necessarily be taken into account in the consideration of the recommendations contained in the Report. The Government has ignored none of these recommendations. Indeed, when any aspect of the Repatriation System is under review it is the practice of the Government to take into account the relevant comments and recommendations in the Report. </para>

            <para>I understand that the project is designed to produce mainly middle distillates and fuel oil to meet the requirements of the South East Asian market. Thus the product mix from this refinery is not expected to make any significant contribution to overall Australian demand, which is predominantly for light products. It is however expected that because of favourable shipping costs Singapore will continue to supply the bulk of Northern and North Western Australian fuel oil requirements. </para>

              <para>and (2) (a) Passenger services between Hobart and Wvnyard ("The Tasman") and Hobart and Parattah ("The Rail Car") ceased after 28 July 1978, as their continued operation was in the commercial judgement of ANR not justified. Freight services between Winnaleah and Herrick were withdrawn on1 October 1978, due to the condition of a bridge which was condemned for future use. (b) Scheduled freight services between Ledgerwood and Herrick were replaced from 31 July 1978 by an "as required" service, to improve the viability of this branch line. Between that date and 1 October 1978, a freight train service operated between Ledgerwood and Herrick on an average of three days per week for the transport of wagonloads, subject to a minimum of two tonnes per wagon. After 1 October 1978, the service has operated between Ledgerwood and Winnaleah, for the reason specified in (a) above. Since 26 February 1979 a daily service has operated to Winnaleah due to the commencement of log loading at Derby. Scheduled freight services between Wiltshire Junction and Smithton and Wiltshire Junction and Stanley were replaced from 31 July 1978 by an "as required" service, to improve the viability of these branch lines. Since that date a daily shunting service on both lines to and from Wiltshire Junction has been provided subject to a minimum of two tonnes per wagon. Transport of livestock ceased as from1 October 1978, because of the losses being incurred in carrying this traffic, and the very low utilisation of facilities. </para>

A typical middle range compensation case was one where an employee had twenty-four days' compensation leave as a result of a fracture and incurred $ 1 8 1 . 00 medical expenses. Total cost to my Department was $1,710.16. The highest compensation payment made during the specified period was due to the death of an employee.

          <para>The Commonwealth Development Bank can and does accept stock or plant mortgages as security for its loans. It is prepared to consider requests for finance from a share farmer where the purpose falls within the scope of its lending policy and the applicant meets the general criteria set out in its printed lending policy statement. The statement of the Bank's lending policy is a public document and is freely available to members of the farming community. </para>
          <para>The Development Bank does not specifically publicise that it accepts any particular type of security and does not see any need to do so. In accordance with its chaner as laid down in the Commonwealth Banks Act, the Bank is primarily concerned with the prospects of success of an enterprise and it does not necessarily have regard to the type or value of the security available. </para>

            <para>-On 21 March 1979 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> page 949) the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dawkins)</inline> asked me a question, without notice, concerning assistance for workers unemployed because of damage caused to plant at the Dampier Salt operations by Cyclone Hazel. I promised that I would check to see whether there had been any communication in relation to this matter from Western Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The following additional information to the answer I gave then to the honourable member's question is provided: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commonwealth's role is to provide financial support to the State for agreed measures. With respect to losses incurred generally because of Cyclone Hazel, the Western Australian Government has sought and obtained the Commonwealth 's agreement to the implementation of certain core measures in accordance with the natural disaster financial assistance arrangements. </para>
            <para>No special assistance in respect of the Dampier Salt operations has been requested by the State Government. </para>
            <para>I have also received representations on this matter from the Shire of Carnarvon. </para>
            <para>The position is that all persons affected by the Cyclone are immediately entitled to assistance financed jointly by the Commonwealth and the State for the relief of personal hardship and distress. </para>
            <para>In the short term, of course, those unemployed are entitled to unemployment benefit and the Commonwealth Departments concerned naturally expedite the processing of their entitlements. </para>
            <para>In the longer term, it is usually found that employment picks up rapidly in cyclone affected areas as repair and reconstruction work gets underway. </para>
            <para>I assure the people of Western Australia of the full support of the Commonwealth as provided under the natural disaster financial assistance arrangements. </para>
            <para>Particular relief and restoration measures to be applied are, however, a matter for the State to determine. It would be improper for the Commonwealth to pre-empt any arrangements the Western Australian Government may wish to apply. </para>

Even then, the time taken for repairs and fear of delays caused by industrial disputes would weigh heavily with shipowners. Consequently, the Industries Assistance Commission recommended against any change in the present financial or legislative assistance given to the industry and rejected requests aimed at a measure of compulsion to use local repairers. </para>
            <para>The Government has considered the IAC report and accepted its recommendations. The decision on where to have a ship repaired should be made by the foreign shipowner, after taking into account all of the commercial factors involved. </para>

Having regard to the expenditure of resources involved in searching out records that are between 14 and 27 years old, and the ensuing problem of tracing ex-members of the Commonwealth Police who could be located in a number of countries, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to authorise the considerable expenditure necessary to search out and check the detailed information required to answer the question by the honourable member.

              <para>1 ) and ( 2 ) Section 42 ( 5 ) of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Electoral Act</inline> 1 9 1 8 gives Aboriginal people the right to choose whether or not they enrol as electors. Against this background the Australian Electoral Office in consultation with other appropriate authorities has undertaken a variety of electoral education activities aimed at ensuring that Aboriginal people are better equipped to meet their electoral responsibilities should they choose to enrol. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Since 1962, when the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was amended to make enrolment for Aboriginal people a matter of choice, the Australian Electoral Office has conducted ad hoc visits to Aboriginal communities in order to acquaint them with their electoral rights and responsibilities. In comparatively recent times the Australian Electoral Office has begun to use more effective means to communicate these ideas. </para>
          <para>For the 1977 Northern Territory Legislative Assembly elections and the last Federal general election some of the specific activities included: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">

              <para>the issuing of special instructions to Presiding Officers to ensure that assistance to non-literate voters was properly given.

Additionally, similar information was prepared in leaflet form for general distribution to Aboriginal communities; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(d)">
              <para>cassette tape-recordings, films and video-cassette recordings were made about electoral procedures. These were distributed to radio and television stations and to Aboriginal communities; </para>

              <para>in conjunction with the Western Australian Department of Education a special pilot electoral education program was conducted amongst Aboriginal people in the Kimberley area of Western Australia. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The success of activities such as these is difficult to measure since many factors may influence the voting behaviour of individuals. In the case of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election the Australian Electoral Office believes that it is significant that there was a reduction in the informal vote from S.08 per cent of the total vote in 1974 to 3.18 per cent of the total vote in 1977. While similar statistics are not available for the Kimberley area in Western Australia the opinion of special observers sent to polling booths in this area was that the special pilot electoral education program had had a significant beneficial impact in assisting Aboriginal people. Specific pre-election information/education activities such as these will be continued in the future. </para>
          <para>In addition the Australian Electoral Office has recognised the need to have an effective continuing program of electoral education for Aboriginal people. To this end a program has commenced. The staff for the initial phase of the program have begun their training and the detailed planning of field operations. This program will involve two mobile education teams and the overall initiative has been developed in close co-operation with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Council for Aboriginal Development and the National Aboriginal Education Committee. In order to avoid confusing Aboriginal people, the Commonwealth Government has sought and received the co-operation of both the South Australian and Western Australian Governments with respect to the inclusion of information about State electoral procedures in the program. As the program moves into the Northern Territory, Queensland and other States the Commonwealth Government will be seeking to establish similar co-operative arrangements. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The exact timing of visits to Aboriginal communities including those planned for the Electoral Division of Grey, cannot be given at this stage since consultation with the leaders of those communities has yet to take place. In broad terms, it is expected that field operations will commence in South Australia and Western Australia in the first half of June 1 979. I can assure the honourable member for Grey that the Australian Electoral Office is intent on making this program effective. </para>

Members may choose to be registered with the fund they currently belong to, or may, through their GPSA Plan, be registered with a fund nominated by the GPSA '. This view is different from that expressed in the question. The honourable member will be aware that all Australian residents are eligible for the 40 per cent- $20 Commonwealth Medical Benefits on registration with a private health insurance organization which has a medical benefits fund registered under the National Health Act. The Australian Casualty Company is not registered under the Act. </para>
