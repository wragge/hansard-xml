It has come to my notice that in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 23 August 1979 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Begg issued an order in the case of Uren v.

            <para>-I have had the opportunity of seeing the order of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Begg. I have had the opportunity also of consultations with the Leader of the House. A motion which I understand the right honourable gentleman is about to move has my concurrence. I think that that motion, if passed by the House, will encompass the matter raised by the honourable gentleman without identifying it as the sole issue. It is a broader issue. I therefore will call upon the Leader of the House to move his motion. I am quite sure the honourable member for Burke will be satisfied that the matter will be incorporated within that motion if it is passed by the House. </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">This motion, in its wider compass, picks up part of the purpose for the earlier reference to the Privileges Committee. In this chamber there is obviously a concern as to the extent to which proceedings should be made available to the courts in future instances. Whilst the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson)</inline> has raised a specific matter, the Government feels that there would be more benefit for the consideration of this chamber if the Privileges Committee were to look at the matter in the broad rather than in the particular. I would therefore commend this broader motion for acceptance by members of the chamber. </para>

          <para>- Without quibbling with the words in the motion, in an effort to expedite the matter and to agree that something should be decided by the Privileges Committee, I wish to state that in the case in question the idea behind the petition was to use the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of this House to cross-examine a member. I think that is an infringement of privilege. I do not think any petition, no matter which side of the House it comes from, should ever be granted unless the House is unanimous that the course of justice would be furthered. One cannot have the cause of justice furthered by a majority of the House. The rights of the House belong to each member and should not be transgressed by a government or by anybody getting the numbers and saying: &#39;I am going to make certain that what you said in the House is going to be the subject of cross-examination in a court&#39;. I think the rule is clear, as referred to by the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson).</inline> The Bill of Rights gives certain freedom of expression in this chamber. If what each of us says in the course of that expression is going to be the subject of cross-examination in the witness box, we lose that freedom. I do not think it is a matter for any court to determine. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I make this point: This House is a court in itself- a supreme court- to try to regulate the conduct of members. If a member transgresses the rights of individuals, we, as a parliament, can deal with that member and can expel him. There is a sanction on our behaviour here. But to inhibit us on the basis that perhaps we are not allowed to say something, because if we do we can be the subject of legal action which will be the subject of cross-examination, I think, is an inhibition of our rights. Whilst everyone is anxious to facilitate the cause of justice, I do not think the motion ought to be on that basis. I do not want to alter it now, but I want to say that if and when it goes to the Privileges Committee, members of the Committee ought to look at the rights of each and every one of us in this chamber on the basis that those rights are in no way interfered with unless the House unanimously agrees that such action can take place. </para>

        <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. </para>
        <para>The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the sales tax as applied to articles handmade by artisans is unfair. </para>
        <para>An artisan is a handcraftsman, or a handcraftswoman, who exercises a non agricultural activity, revolving around the transformation of materials with his own handwork or that of his family. On craft, above all, the accent must be on design, practicability and quality, where the craftsman must perforce pay highly for his raw materials and time must not be a conditioning factor in the making of an article. </para>
        <para>This petition seeks the objective examination of the existing Sales Tax Acts in respect to persons seeking to earn their living by the labour of their hands alone. </para>
        <para>Every day, skilled artisans are being forced out of their livelihood, not by the competition of machine made goods, not by high prices of materials, but by the injustice of antiquated Sales Tax Laws. The artisan, thus taxed out of his living, will then go onto unemployment benefits, or worse still, to prostituting his craft by sacrificing his professional integrity, forcing him to lower his standards of workmanship in order to conform to existing laws. </para>
        <para>We therefore request that a Sales Tax exemption be created immediately for all hand crafted articles. </para>
        <para>We also request that the current exemption limit of $ 1 , 400 and $1,000 respectively referred to in items100-(1) and 100-(2) of the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act 1935-1967, be immediately raised to a realistic figure, in line with current living standards, and from then on to be periodically reviewed so as to keep pace with the Australian standard of living. </para>

            <para>- In answering the question let me point out one fundamental thing: There is a world of difference between a discussion paper and policy. This Government has a clear policy on parity pricing and that stands in sharp contrast with the confusion on the Opposition side of the House on the matter. Parity pricing is absolutely key to any energy policy that any government around the world may pursue. Why is this so? Let me remind the Opposition once again. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mulock,</inline> the New South Wales Minister for Mineral Resources and Development understands and even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> understands. Later in debating the matter of public importance on this subject I will be quite willing to expose the honourable member to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has to say about it. Let me repeat it again for the benefit of those on the other side of the House who are ignorant about parity pricing. Parity pricing means the encouragement of fuel conservation. Let us make no mistake about that. It means the substitution of alternative fuels that this country has- fuels such as coal, natural gas and electricity. It means that people can make rational decisions about the production of alternative fuels- synthetic fuels, methanol, ethanol, oil from coal and oil from shale. Finally, and not least, it encourages exploration and development of oil and gas fields in this country. </para>

            <para>- Whether it is the last chance or not, clearly time is running out for a negotiated peace in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. An opportunity has been provided as a result of the Lusaka agreement. I think we must all hope that that opportunity is built upon at the constitutional conference that <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> now being held. An opportunity has been presented to all the parties by the conference called by the United Kingdom. We must hope very much that they have the good sense and the wisdom to seize the opportunities that are opened up. The fact that the parties to the dispute- parties which have been engaged in a bloody warfare against each other- are now sitting at the conference table with Great Britain is a tremendous achievement by itself; an achievement for Britain principally, but also for the front-line states and all those who have promoted and fostered the cause of a peaceful settlement in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. Again, we must hope that that achievement is built upon by good sense at the conference. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are many vital issues to be discussed and settled before anyone can be sure that there will be a final peaceful outcome. They relate not only to the constitution but also, if there is agreement on it, to the difficult issues in relation to the transition arrangements and the disposition of the forces of different elements- different parties. But it must be our great hope- and I am quite sure that all members of this House would share it- in acknowledging what has been achieved so far, that good sense and a willingness to work together for a peaceful outcome will characterise the progress of this most important conference. </para>
          <para>A continuation of the fighting, or a continuation of the bitterness, has the high likelihood of involving more of southern Africa and doing more damage to more economies, with more people paying a high price in poverty, in difficulty, or in death, and the high possibility also of outside powers gaining a greater sway and influence within Africa because countries that supply arms or guns tend to have a political influence flowing from that and as a result of it. I do not believe that anyone in southern Africa wants that kind of conclusion. Therefore, we must hope and pray that the opportunity that has been opened up by this London conference is seized and built upon. </para>

            <para>- It is quite clear what the Government did with the various drafts of the discussion paper that was being worked on by the Department of National Development in consultation with other departments, which is perfectly normal. As I was saying, that discussion paper was turned into a vital, comprehensive energy policy for this country. It is an energy policy that encompasses a wide spectrum of policy initiatives. It covers a proper, realistic pricing policy which I have dealt with already, in answer to an earlier question. It deals with a proper, rational, co-ordinated energy research and development program for this country. It encompasses the best incentives for exploration that this country has ever seen. In fact, they are probably equal to any in the world. I give only some examples of what happened to that Green Paper, and I hope that that satisfies the honourable member. </para>

            <para>- I give the honourable member an assurance that the Government is maintaining very substantial funding for women&#39;s refuges throughout Australia, and particularly in New South Wales. Out of this year&#39;s allocation of over $3m, no less than $1,055,000 will be going to New South Wales. That is 12 per cent up on the allocation that was made to that State last year. The amount that has been allocated to the New South Wales Government, in spite of the bleating of the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jackson,</inline> happens to be in accordance with the amount that was sought by the New South Wales Government to maintain services at existing levels. However, I think he may have been somewhat overcome by the fact that the Minister for Social Security, my colleague in the other place, made available $300,000 to child care workers in those refuges. The New South Wales Government could well have undertaken this job since it has a responsibility for children in its own State. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Under the funding arrangements that we have specially established for women&#39;s refuges, they are favoured to this extent: Community health programs, other than those for ethnic health workers, and interpreters and translators in the ethnic communities, are receiving 50 per cent of the capital requirements. The State is being asked to meet a similar portion. We are meeting dollar for dollar the operating costs of all other projects. But for women&#39;s refuges we are meeting 75 per cent of all the capital costs and 50 per cent of the operating costs. So, we are giving special emphasis to them. I will give an undertaking, as I have already done to the women&#39;s refuges in New South Wales, that we will investigate the problem to see what is going on. It is just my hope that the New South Wales Government is not in some way diverting funds that we are making available to the States to other than women&#39;s refuges. We will make sure that those funds go to women&#39;s refuges. I cannot understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jackson</inline> should be engaging in such a campaign, because he has shown a very poor initiative in this area. </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the specific conference to which the honourable member for Prospect has referred. He has of course once again raised an issue which illustrates that members of the Labor Party are past masters at getting keen on an idea once they have seen that somebody else is doing it. As the honourable gentleman&#39;s question has suggested, the Labor Party is now starting to get interested in alleged abuses of the taxation system. It has taken a long time for the Labor Party to do that. I say to the honourable member for Prospect that, as far as I am concerned, the taxation laws of this country ought to contain provision for the deduction of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with conferences which involve professional and educational activities involved in a person&#39;s business or profession. There is no reason in the world why the taxation laws of this country ought not to include reasonable provision for matters of that nature. All that the honourable member for Prospect and other members of the Opposition do by raising these types of matters is to illustrate again and again how sensitive they are to the fact that when they were in government they did nothing about the real abuses of the taxation system. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the price index for materials used in the manufacturing industry recorded an increase of 40.5 per cent in the year to May, representing the highest increase ever recorded for this index? Further, did the price index for goods produced by the manufacturing industry increase by 15.9 per cent in the year to July, and was this the largest increase for the last four years? Have these record rates of inflation been boosted by deliberate government policy, such as import parity pricing for oil, the12&#189; per cent tariff on quota imports, the 2 per cent duty on non-tariff imports, and a steady devaluation of the Australian dollar? Finally, does the Treasurer recognise that these statistics, in conjunction with other price indices, make it clear that the Government&#39;s high unemployment anti-inflationary policies are notably inflationary? </para>

            <para>- I have seen the price index to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred. The figures that he mentioned are substantially correct. While I am on the subject of price indices, perhaps I should inform the Leader of the Opposition of some other figures which have come out fairly recently and which are relevant to the international competitiveness of Australia. They illustrate that for the 12 months to July 1979 Australia&#39;s rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index- the Leader of the Opposition was referring to the consumer price index in his question- was 8.8 per cent, whereas the average for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries was 10 per cent.

            <para>-That is just where the Leader of the Opposition is wrong, because over the last six months the gap between Australia &#39;s rate and the rate of the OECD countries has broadened. Over the six months to July 1979 the rate in Australia was 9 per cent, whereas the average for OECD countries was 12.9 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition said: &#39;While they are coming down, we are going up&#39;. The fact of the matter as I said in the Budget Speech and as members of the Government have not tried to disguise, is that there are inflationary pressures around the world. What really matters is the effect of domestic economic policy in containing those inflationary pressures in Australia. It is in that regard that the Government differs from the Opposition. </para>

          <para>The Leader of the Opposition talks about energy. He has an Alice in Wonderland energy policy which he says will achieve three things. Firstly, the Opposition&#39;s policy is to continue to encourage exploration and development; secondly, to reduce the price of petrol; and, thirdly, to increase revenue from the crude oil levy. They are the three mutually contradictory things which the Leader of the Opposition says that his energy policy will produce. The truth of the matter is that over the last two weeks since the Budget was brought down neither he nor his colleague, the honourable member for Blaxland, has had the courage to spell out anywhere in Australia what the Opposition&#39;s energy policy really is. The Opposition does not have an effective policy because it is mutually contradictory. </para>

            <para>-Of course I have seen references, as I am sure every member of this House has, to the wages policy coming from the Australian Council of Trade Union Congress which is currently being held in Melbourne. What seems to be emerging re-emphasises the problem identified by the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when in handing down its latest decision it referred to one side wanting indexation without restraint. What the ACTU policy means and spells out- the ACTU is not keeping it secret- is that in addition to national wage case increases, the union movement must have complete freedom to negotiate whatever it can over and above those increases. As we well know, all too often &#39;negotiation&#39; is a euphemism for &#39;extort by industrial blackmail&#39;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I remind the House of what the Commission said when the indexation package was introduced. It said that the Australian economy just could not afford increases over and above that. But the ACTU wages policy does not even stop there. I notice the latest thing is that the </para>
          <para class="block">ACTU wants national productivity increases for the last six years to be added to current wage claims. The ACTU wages policy is now exposed as the most selfish ever put forward by an organisation in this country. It completely ignores the interests of those in less secure employment and completely ignores the interests of the unemployed. If it ever came to pass the inevitable, inescapable result must be fewer jobs. I reiterate that this represents a new peak in selfishness, and the people responsible for it will be judged accordingly by the Australian community. </para>

            <para>-I ask a question of the Treasurer which relates to the last question that I asked of him. He will recall stating in his answer that the rate of inflation in Australia was 8.8 per cent as against an average of 10 per cent for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Is it a fact, however, that the rate of inflation for Australia for the period the Treasurer referred to was understated by some 1.5 per cent as a result of the &#39;judicious&#39;and I put the word &#39;judicious&#39; in inverted commas out of kindness- rigging of health insurance arrangements by the Government in its previous Budget? Is it a fact that if that is allowed for, the inflation rate for Australia for the year just completed is of the order of 1 0.3 per cent, or considerably higher than the average for the OECD countries? </para>

          <para>Does the Treasurer deny that inflation is now increasing?

Why does he present this changed assessment? </para>

            <para>-The Leader of the Opposition is getting deeper and deeper into fairyland on this subject. The fact of the matter is that I said in my answer that I was using figures that compared consumer price increases as measured by comparable means in all the OECD countries. The Leader of the Opposition reckons that the consumer price index for the end of July was rigged. If he wants to apply that double standard, the figure of 14 per cent that I used in the Budget Speech as being the rate of inflation in Australia for the 12 months to December 1975 would be closer to 1 6 per cent or 1 7 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition knows as well as I do that, as Treasurer, he had an artificially low figure of 0.9 per cent in the September quarter of 1975 through the rigging of the system with the introduction of Medibank. </para>

Members of the Opposition do not seem to be too interested in asking me questions, particularly about Canberra, for the simple reason that they know the Government is doing a good job in Canberra. As the Minister responsible for the Territory, consistent with the policies that the Government has been introducing, I have been looking at the question of energy. The fact is that the question of linking Canberra to the main natural gas pipeline has been under study. I would like to confirm that I have received a submission from the Australian Gas Light Company.

              <para>- It is estimated that over the next 20 years some one million tonnes of fuel oil will be used in the national capital by institutional, commercial and industrial bodies and, of course, domestic users. So the connection of natural gas to the city obviously would be of some significance. The honourable member also asked me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker-</inline> I shall be quickwhether recently any other things which would show private enterprise confidence in the city had been done. Last week when Parliament was not sitting I announced a tourist complex development project on the Jolimont site, which will involve if it goes ahead- it is a serious proposition- an expenditure of $48m. If anything, that is an extreme indication by private enterprise of its confidence in the national capital. I hope that that project will go ahead next year. I hope that we will soon hear of other measures that would indicate the confidence of private enterprise in the national capital. </para>

On the other hand, did he secure United States agreement that if imports fell below that level the balance of concessions achieved in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations between Australia and the United States could be affected? What is the &#39;balance of concessions&#39; made by Australia and why has the Minister failed to table in the Parliament the document he signed in Washington in March 1979, bearing in mind that members of the United States Congress have already seen the document? </para>

            <para>- In relation to the latter part of the honourable member&#39;s question, the Government will not be tabling the final outcome of the MTN round until the whole of Australia&#39;s negotiations have been concluded and that conclusion will be upon the presentation of the most recently considered package to the United States Government, which has not yet occurred. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is true that some readjustments have been made to the settlement that was reached between Australia and the United States concerning the global allocation by America on beef imports. Under the MTN round, Australia achieved a firm floor quota of 1.2 billion lb of meat. That quota is registered with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and it is absolutely final. It is a binding arrangement between Australia and the United States. But, over and above that quota, we sought a quota of 1.3 billion lb should countercyclical legislation be brought into being. At the time of the negotiations that was only talked of. Since the completion of the negotiations, the American Congress has agreed to introducing countercyclical legislation. The Administration has agreed to imports of 1.25 billion lb of meat which is a decline of 50m lbs on what it had assured us it would try to obtain from the Congress. It was not final. It was merely an assurance to the Australian Government that the Administration would aim to agree on the level we sought. The Australian allocation of beef into the United States will drop by about 4 per cent should the countercyclical legislation come into being. </para>
          <para>I am pleased to say that, as a result of the discussions that have taken place, there have been some adjustments of concessions which are of benefit to the dairy industry and also affecting paper exports from the United States. Furthermore, we have an assurance from the United States Government that should the countercyclical legislation result in imports below 1.3 billion lb there will be room for further adjustments in the future. All told, we have a very satisfactory arrangement. I do not think that people realise how important the binding arrangement that we have with the United States is. For the first time in the history of this country, we have assured access to the United States markets. Until the MTN round was concluded there was never any certainty or security for the Australian beef industry. This arrangement is a wonderful addition to our quota and it provides for the Australian meat industry a security which it has never previously achieved. </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman is spot on about what is being suffered in South Australia at the moment, and that is a crisis of confidence. Not only is investment fleeing from South Australia but also it will not return to South Australia until it has a government which produces policies which will attract investment to that State. If there is one thing that we have learned in Australia in the last three years it is that we need investment and development to produce economic growth and, through that, employment growth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Unfortunately, in South Australia the unemployment situation at the moment is disastrous. It is the worst in Australia at 40,400 persons or 8.2 per cent of the work force. Last month unemployment in South Australia rose by 5,100 when throughout the rest of Australia it decreased by 4,600. That increase is against the record throughout Australia since January this year, which is that unemployment has dropped by 76,200. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman asked what can be done about it. There is one very simple message to the people of South Australia. I give an example of how jobs can be created by investment. There are great copper, gold and uranium deposits at Roxby Downs in the electorate of Grey, an electorate held by a Labor member of parliament. I wonder what he thinks about them. What does the honourable member for Bonython say about those deposits? What does the honourable member for Port Adelaide say about them? If those deposits are developed they are capable of producing 55,000 jobs. </para>

              <para>- The development of Roxby Downs has, quite properly, been compared with the development of the great Mount Isa deposits. Mount Isa Mines Ltd employs 4,800 people. In Mount Isa itself 10,000 people are employed. The population of Mount Isa is 28,000. This indicates the magnitude of the prospects for development of the great Roxby Downs deposit. If the honourable members of the Opposition are not prepared to accept that, let me quote the words of the former Premier of South Australia, the  Hon.  Don Dunstan.

            <para>South Australia is suffering a crisis of confidence and as a result is losing prospects for 55,000 jobs. Investment and development are the key to the creation of real jobs in South Australia. Investment is being lost to other States and development is at a standstill. </para>
            <para>Also a government which knows what is needed to create jobs. </para>
            <para>The present South Australian Government is stupidly dogmatic in pursuing policies which: refuse to allow great mineral resources to be developed, and frighten investment away from manufacturing as well as mining. </para>
            <para class="block">South Australian unemployment at the moment is disastrous- the worst in Australia- 40,400 persons- 8.2 per cent, a rise of 5,100 last month when across Australia unemployment fell by 4,600 and is 18,000 less than in August last year. (South Australia 600 more). Unemployment dropped 76.2 percent since January. </para>
            <para>What can be done? </para>
            <para>One startling example- the great copper/gold/uranium development at Roxby Downs in the electorate of Grey. Bonython? Hawker? </para>
            <para>WMC must choose between South Australia and another copper development in Victoria-Benamba- Gippsland. WMC can&#39;t develop Roxby because present South Australian Labor Government flatly refuses to give approval. </para>
            <para>Potential of Roxby Downs: $2,000m capital investment 2,000-3,000 construction jobs 5,000 permanent jobs 50,000 additional jobs from the multiplier effect into other industries. </para>
            <para>Compare Mt Isa with which Roxby Downs has been compared: 4,800 company employment 10,000 people employed in the town 28,000 population in Mt Isa supported by the mine. </para>

            <para>If Don Dunstan was interested in getting it off the ground to create jobs, Premier Corcoran certainly is not- neither are the Member for Port Adelaide or the Member for Grey. </para>
            <para>When South Australian industrial development is at a standstill, this is political stupidity by the left-wing of the Labor Party, led by the Duncan forces which control the Premier, Port Adelaide and Grey. </para>

            <para>-There is no question of the Government discounting Geelong, for example, and treating it as a no-man&#39;s-land. It would be absurd to put that proposition. I am glad that the honourable member acknowledges what an important program the regional development or decentralisation program is. The amounts of money that this Government has spent on assisting enterprises outside the capital cities or metropolitan areas have been significant both in capital investment and jobs created. Many hundreds of jobs have been created through this program. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member asked me whether I have excluded Geelong from the program. The answer is yes. That was done because the Decentralisation Advisory Board advised me that it considered that the amount of support that would flow to Geelong, which is very close to the Melbourne metropolitan area, was reason enough for it to be excluded, therefore diverting more of the decentralisation funds to other non metropolitan areas. I cannot tell the honourable gentleman whether I have had any response from the Victorian Government but I will check and let him know. </para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable gentleman for that question. In view of the current interest in energy policy it is appropriate that that sort of question be asked. All honourable members will recall that the North West Shelf project is one project that stopped dead under the last Labor administration. A $50m project definition study now under way is the result of the energy policies that have been introduced by this Government. That is a clear example of our policies working. It is very sad to see the sick looks on the faces of some honourable members opposite. If they acknowledged some of the things that are happening in this country to get it back on its feet after the events of the period 1972-75 we would all be better off. The honourable member asked about the present position of the North West Shelf venture. I am pleased to be able to advise him from the information I have that it is true that there has been renewed interest by possible buyers around the world of our liquid natural gas. Particularly keen interest has been shown by Japan, the United States and, I am informed, South Korea. In fact, I am informed that the Japanese will require an extra 10 million tonnes a year of liquid natural gas. The joint venturers have been in Japan in recent weeks negotiating with the Japanese and I am told that they will be moving on to the United States very soon. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is often forgotten that one of the potential spin-offs of this project is the condensate expected from the production stream. I am told that the potential volume is equal to that of Barrow Island. Condensate is an excellent feed stock for refineries. The additional condensate for feed stock for our refineries will provide a very important increment to our oil self sufficiency in the 1980s. The Government is very happy that the world markets are showing such an interest in that project and that it is generating such keen customer interest in that we are actually getting letters of intent to buy off the ground. This project is not only going to mean very important foreign earnings for Australia, but also is going to create an awful lot of jobs. </para>

            <para>-It so happens that on the Sunday before last I met, by chance, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gustav</inline> Nossal who succeeded <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Macfarlane</inline> Burnet as Director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. At that meeting I also met <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Gajdusek</inline> who is a Nobel laureate and who has been working in the Soviet Union. He came to Australia especially for the celebration of the birthday of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Macfarlane</inline> Burnet which was to be the next day, that is, Monday of last week. At that time I wondered what the Parliament might do to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Macfarlane</inline> Burnet on reaching his eightieth birthday. I thought I would contact the  President  of the Senate to see whether the Senate might join with the House of Representatives on behalf of the Parliament to express our congratulations to this very eminent Australian. I shall consult with the  President  of the Senate. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Are wages and incomes in Australia fixed on occasion by direct action in the market-place after a claim has been unsuccessful in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission? If that is the case, what have been the consequences of such a series of events? Is there any likelihood of that practice being widened in Australia? </para>

            <para>-I have seen reports of an address which shortly preceded the cruelly selfish Australian Council of Trade Unions wages policy to which I referred a moment or two ago. I find it incredible that the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions should direct the trade union movement to ignore the proper industrial relations processes. By advocating this policy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> has grossly misused, for political purposes, his own position as leader of the Australian trade union movement. What in fact has happened is that the  President  of the ACTU has threatened the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the business community and the public that unless trade union demands are met industrial disruption will be used and, indeed, encouraged to damage our economy. The people who would suffer most from this damage are the unemployed. Once again, the trade union movement has made it quite clear that it offers nothing to the unemployed. In fact, it offers them less than nothing. What, in effect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and trade union leaders have done is to tell members of the trade union movement that lining their own pockets comes before the interests of the community and of the unemployed. Any pretence to reason or responsibility has been thrown aside. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> has also said that while, in his words, the unions have offered consultation, the Government has offered nothing but confrontation. I make the point that such allegations are totally and demonstrably untrue. Since this Government came to power we have established on a statutory basis, the National Labour Consultative Council. By an interesting contrast, the Labor Party when in power never even called together what was then the National Labour Advisory Council. I would be more impressed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s allegations about lack of consultation if the union movement had not twice walked out from the body established to provide the proper processes for consultation. The fact is that the ACTU has now demonstrably embarked on a policy of confrontation not just with the Government but also with the Australian community. In this respect it has far overstepped the mark. The direction to the unions to increase industrial disruption shows just how far the leadership of the trade union movement is from community thinking. As far as the trade unions are concerned, wage increases are apparently to come before economic recovery, the interests of the unemployed and the commercial and social life of this nation. If that is not a policy of confrontation, I do not know what is. </para>

            <para>- I will conclude on this point. The feasibility study on Roxby Downs will take another three years. It is futile to argue the employment opportunities that may be available from that proposal now when the people who owned Roxby Downs will not know for another three years whether it is feasible. To follow this matter to its logical conclusion, from the views put forward by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and, perhaps, his colleague in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Tonkin,</inline> there is no doubt that the Liberal Party in South Australia intends to build a nuclear power station in Adelaide in the hope of carrying through its policy of uranium mining. That nuclear power station is going to be sited right in the heart of Adelaide if the Liberal Party wins the State election. </para>

            <para>- Yes. During Question Time, the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> interjected and accused me of saying that half a million jobs would be created out of Nabarlek. No such statement has ever been made by me regarding employment at Nabarlek. What he is confusing this claim with, I think, is the fact that the South Australian Government under the then Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> Dunstan, did issue a report on an enrichment program for South Australia in which he said that, if there could be an enrichment program for South Australia, it could both directly and indirectly lead to something like half a million jobs. Of course, in South Australia the Labor Party is in utter and sheer confusion at the moment because it does not want to accept the report of its own Government. </para>

          <para class="block">The motion establishing the Joint Committee on the Family Law Act was moved by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> in the Senate on 17 August. Paragraph 12 provided that the Committee report to the Parliament by 3 1 December 1979. It was reasonable, at that stage, for the Attorney-General to expect that the Committee should be able to report by the end of 1979 although honourable members were no doubt aware that it was extremely unlikely that the Parliament would be sitting on New Year&#39;s Eve. However, the passage of the motion through Parliament was not as rapid as might have been expected by the Attorney when he moved it. Amendments were made to the resolution in the House, requiring the concurrence of the Senate. Because of the interest of members in the inquiry, the matter of nominations of members to sit on the Committee was not finalised until 12 October 1978. The first meeting of the Committee took place on 18 October 1978. Submissions were called for by 31 December 1978. The inquiry did not really get under way until February of this year, when public hearings commenced. Nor could the Parliament or the Committee have been expected to anticipate the tremendous public interest in the inquiry, which has resulted in the Committee receiving 485 written submissions. </para>
          <para>The Committee has worked extremely hard and has pursued the inquiry relentlessly since its first public hearing on 8 February. It has conducted public hearings in all State capitals, except Brisbane, where it will meet for a public hearing on 24 September. The transcript it has taken now comprises some 5,500 pages of evidence. Since its appointment the Committee has accumulated a substantial body of information, both local and international, bearing on the inquiry. In that regard, I have recently returned from a study tour of Europe and North America, during which I gathered substantial data on family law <inline font-style="italic">systems in</inline> other countries with comparable jurisdictions. The Committee has accumulated a wealth of facts and knowledge and will require time to assess and process this information. A series of private meetings with selected experts is being undertaken to examine particular issues. Consultation on this basis is a comparatively new technique in parliamentary committee work. These meetings will cover topics where difficulties have been identified, such as the position of children under the Act, custody, maintenance, property and the organisation of the Family Court. </para>
          <para>As all honourable members are aware, the issues for inquiry by the Committee are complex and diverse in their implications and it is considered that more time to finish the inquiry is needed. In these circumstances, the Committee has agreed that it would not be able to do justice to the inquiry if it attempted to rush through a report simply to meet the deadline contained in the resolution of appointment. The Committee believes that a more considered and substantial report on the many issues that this reference has raised will be possible only if an extension of time for the report is obtained. The Committee believes that it could report to the Parliament by the middle of the Autumn sittings in 1980, and will direct its efforts to presenting its report to both Houses shortly after Easter next year and certainly by the end of the Autumn sittings. </para>

            <para>-The Government&#39;s energy policy is in a shambles; but, more accurately, it does not exist. What passes for an energy policy in Australia is a mishmash of ad hoc policy statements more accurately described as Press releases. The Government&#39;s energy policy is just a giant jigsaw puzzle with every department sitting upon one piece. It is represented in the House and to the public by the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)-</inline> a tragic, incompetent ministerial figure excluded from Cabinet, torpedoed in his own policy initiatives by the major economic departments of the Government, and served by a department that has not the strength to beat off the Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This Government has a Minister articulating energy policy; but that Minister has a department which fails to agree with the Government&#39;s policy, and he articulates a policy for which he has no departmental support. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Yesterday we were informed that he was abused in the Cabinet by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> for failing in the energy policy area. Indeed, the whole general thrust of energy policy and support and confidence by the public, by consumers and by producers of energy are languishing under the lack of any direction by this Government. The Treasury is again preeminent in policy configuration and formulation within the Commonwealth structure. For four full years this Department has failed. No department in the Western world has had such a rein on economic policy, with a more compliant Cabinet, than the Treasury in this country has had for four years. Despite its four years it has doubled the unemployment level in Australia, has failed to contain inflation and has dragged Australia deeper into recession. Now it is running an energy policy for Australia. It has wiped out the Department of National Development. That Department cannot even produce a discussion paper on energy without its being snuffed out by the Treasury and by the inter-departmental committee run by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Visbord</inline> in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The gurus of everything else in the bureaucracy- the Treasury officials- are now the energy gurus of Australia. </para>
          <para>At Question Time today we had the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> and the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> talking about energy. All of a sudden they are all energy experts. Of course, they realise that the public now has no confidence in them. They have had four full years in office and they have not even tabled a discussion paper on energy. During Question Time today I interjected to say that that had been the case and the Minister for National Development said: &#39;We tabled a comprehensive policy&#39;. This is the statement made by the Prime Minister just a couple of months ago. It was a statement made for some political cover against shortages of petroleum products when the Government was scared stiff that there would be protracted shortages, as in fact there have been in the case of avgas, dieseline and other commodities in the third and fourth quarters of the year. When one has a look at the comprehensive energy policy announced by the Prime Minister, one sees that half of it was devoted to a short term- that is the next two months- economic policy which the Government could no longer affect or have any influence upon, and that there was only a smattering of references- minor and incidental ones at that- to anything in the long term area. </para>
          <para>The truth is that the Treasury is suffocating every alternative area of advice to the Government, and this includes advice in the very important area of energy. The unimpeded, uninhibited market-place philosophy is supreme. The high petrol price policy of the Government is a Fraser-cum-Treasury invention, which is essentially based on the simple notion: Flog the motorists, make them pay, and hide behind the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The truth is that the Arabs increased the price of their oil and the Prime Minister of this country increases the price of Australian oil. This Government has put in the link there to put up the price of Australian oil and then try to blame it upon the Arab states. That has not curtailed consumption as the Treasury and the Prime Minister believed it would. In fact, consumption has risen quite markedly even though higher prices have been prevailing. </para>
          <para>At the moment consumption of petroleum products in this country is at an unprecedented high. The Government&#39;s Budget estimate of a 5 per cent increase in revenue from the excise on refined petroleum products- that is the pump tax excise which was not increased- means that the Government expects an increase of 5 per cent in the consumption of petroleum products. If we contrast that 5 per cent projection with the 2.7 per cent projected by the Minister&#39;s Department last year, what we clearly see is evidence of the argument that petroleum products are largely price inelastic. People must pay for the product; they must keep their cars running and their industries moving; and farmers must keep their machinery moving. In this regard they are caught and just have to pay the tax at the pump, in the same way as they pay tax through income tax or in any other way. The Fraser high petrol price tax is a policy which is geared essentially to raising Commonwealth revenue and is just taxation by stealth, by moving the emphasis of taxation off direct taxation and on to indirect taxation. That is all the policy is. </para>
          <para>The Minister for National Development tries to put across the furphy that the high petrol price tax is the right energy policy, and he castigates the Opposition for opposing this policy. Let me just take him to task. Every time he mouths these slogans he says that this policy will encourage exploration. Let me analyse that statement The truth of the matter is that in the tenement areas on the North West Shelf, which is the most likely prospect for oil exploration in Australia, the mature drillable structures off the Exmouth plateau- the deep water ones where a lot of money is being spent- are structures in respect of which there was an atmosphere of competition for the awarding of those tenement areas mainly by companies that do not produce oil in Australia. </para>
          <para>If the Minister&#39;s contention is right, that one must pay big money to oil producing companies presently operating and producing in Australia, why did a gaggle of exploration companies, which do not produce in Australia, bid competitively for tenement areas on the North West Shelf? They did so because of the ruling price regime which the Australian Labor Party implemented in September 1 975 which was that the Commonwealth should pay the import parity price for new discoveries of oil made after 14 September 1975. That is the price regime which is now common to the Opposition and to the Government of this country, introduced by Prime Minister Whitlam, reaffirmed by Treasurer Lynch, by Treasurer Howard and by me. That is the policy which governs exploration. Even in regard to Bass Strait, the Esso-BHP consortium has now gone to the Government and argued that the Fortescue Field in Bass Strait was a field that was found after 14 September 1975 and hence should be awarded full import parity. So, the Minister&#39;s contention that the rising of the price for old oil helps exploration, is nonsense. All it is doing - </para>

Instead of that you have given this largess to companies only producing in Australia. It is fair enough gradually to move up the price for Barrow Island and Wapet which have small reservoirs and which are coming to the end of their lives, but to argue as you are arguing that you must take the price for old oil to import parity for new exploration, is nonsense and you know it. </para>

          <para>Let me get onto the conservation effect. You have said that your policy will conserve petrol. </para>
          <para class="block">The price of oil went up in 1973-74 throughout the Western world and consumption of petroleum products rose dramatically in all the years since. The United States of America is far more dependent on the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries now than it was before 1973-74. Even with the one year of high petrol prices operating in Australia there has been no consumption effect whatsoever. In fact, demand has gone up. If you read the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> this week, you will find that consumption of avgas, dieselene and petroleum products generally has risen far beyond the capacity of the refining industry in Australia to handle it. If you talk to Shell and BP as I have, ask them for their market projections for petroleum consumption and production. They are all above estimate. They are all above a high estimate. So, your conservation line is essentially rubbish as well. </para>
          <para>Now, your final one is substitution. You say that this introduces substitutes. What is the difference between the Government and the Opposition on that? Certainly, a high price of fuel does allow for a substitution effect. </para>

              <para>- It does allow for a substitution effect, but the Opposition&#39;s policy was to stay with the 1977 gradual increase in the price. Because there was a one-third complement from imports of oil which was priced at the world price- that is the price you have to buy it at- with the one-third complement going up and the two-thirds domestic production gradually rising over time there would be a slow rise in the price. That is what we on this side of the House supported. In the presence of a slow rise the substitutes which were possible under a higher price could have been brought on. As it is now, the price has skyrocketed and there are no substitutes because the price went up before the infrastructure for the substitutes could be developed. </para>

              <para>- He is interjecting, so it is fair game. If he wants to interject he will get it back. I make the point that LPG is one of the substitutes. There are hardly any LPG outlets at all in New South Wales or in any other State bar Victoria. There are other substitutes like ethanols which are now being looked at, but they are not presently available because the price of petrol rose too quickly. If industry could have planned on a gradual price increase an infrastructure for substitutes could have been made available four or five years down the track. As it is now, the government put the price up overnight to grab revenue for itself and the substitutes are just not there. If they were there we would not have any shortages. On the substitution angle its policy is phony. On the conservation angle its policy is phony, but more particularly its exploration policy is just an outright untruth, a deception and a distortion. I nail that once and for all. Let us be clear on that. The Opposition stands for gradualism. Under the 1977 policy the government took it all to import parity and collected $2,050m for itself plus $950m under the crude oil excise. It has slugged the motorist an extra $3 billion.

The Minister has never made any such suggestion. He has just made them pay through their pockets at the petrol pumps. Whether a man is on $100,000 a year or $5,000 a year he still pays 29.5c per litre for petrol in the capital cities without any attempt by the Government to distinguish his capacity to pay. In other words, the Minister has not in any way heeded the advice of his Department. The advice of his Department has been snuffed out by the free enterprise lunatics in the Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. If the Minister is silly enough to let them run energy policy he does not deserve to be the Minister. </para>
          <para>Let me dwell on this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> I do not speak in this debate on a negative basis. I have outlined the Opposition&#39;s attitude on crude oil prices. I produced, without a bureaucracy, a 60-page Green Paper on Australian energy and minerals policy. I will read some of the headings. They include: The &#39;Energy Crisis&#39;; The Problem of Liquid Fuels- Exploration, Windfall Gains, Fuel Substitution, Conservation; A Natural Gas Policy For Australia- Demand and Supply, Gas Pricing, End Use Allocation of Gas; The Contribution of Coal- Reserves, Coal Uses; and The Australian Mineral Industry. The greatest demand for this paper, of which I produced 600 copies, was from the Commonwealth bureaucracy including the Minister&#39;s own Department and the Treasury. It is the first major policy statement by a major party about energy in this country. It was not produced with a massive bureaucracy. It was produced by the Opposition because it has planned for energy policy. At the Federal Conference of the Labor Party in Adelaide we established a mechanism for policy development with a national fuel and energy commission for long-term policy development and, as an operator, an Australian hydrocarbons corporation. </para>
          <para>I am pleased to say that even some of the people who write for the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> are reading Labor Party policy these days. They advocated on the weekend a national oil company as an instrument of long-term policy development. That is a marvellous recognition of a policy which we have had for two years, particularly for a national fuel and energy commission. So, right across the board- on energy pricing, on substitutes, on conservation, on exploration, on long-term policy development, on bringing the States, plus producers and consumers of energy into a policy development body, plus an operator- we have covered all of the fields and left the Government without a leg to stand on. </para>

            <para>- I think we had better be clear about two things in this debate. Two things should be clear in the minds of everybody- what the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> based 15 minutes of bluster, rhetoric and some abuse on. He based his speech on two things. One was that a discussion paper constitutes policy advice. As I demonstrated at Question Time, I hope, that is demonstrably untrue. A discussion paper presents certain options and, of course, it argues various cases. But that did not constitute final advice; it did not constitute policy. Perhaps I can disabuse the honourable member for Blaxland, his colleagues opposite and those other people who engage in tittle-tattle in the corridors of Parliament House. The policy statement that is now in front of the people of Australia contains practically every major option that finally was put to the Government by me and my Department. So do not let us confuse discussion with policy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second point on which the honourable member&#39;s 15 minute contribution was based was pricing. We have had a remarkable admission from the honourable member for Blaxland today. He actually does agree with pricing for substitution; he does agree with pricing for conservation; he does agree with pricing for the long term effects that it has. But he says that the introduction of a pricing policy has to be gradual. It should be noted that he gives absolutely no definition of what &#39;gradual&#39; means. Is his proposal that the price should be a couple of cents below our price for oil? Does he propose that it should be $3 or $4 beneath our price? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Opportunity cost pricing is the most rational pricing policy that is effective over the long term. Oil pricing need not necessarily be at the import parity level, but it is desirable that it should at least be import parity related. The opportunity cost concept is conducive to correct resource allocation and minimises market place distortions, but few would argue that the increase in the price of oil will have a dramatic impact upon aggregate petroleum demand. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not agree that few people would argue that price is unrelated to demand, as the honourable member for Blaxland suggested in his speech. I recognise that few people in the Labor Party would hold that view- I admit that- but there is absolutely no doubt that pricing is a key element. That is a sound proposition and the honourable member for Blaxland agrees with it. </para>
          <para>The only two points that the honourable member for Blaxland made in his IS minute speech were that somehow our discussion paper was policy advice, which it was not, and that pricing is the only matter with which he disagrees. Let us have a look at the facts about the Government&#39;s energy policy. One central fact is that the policy is comprehensive, that it is coherent. The very fact that Ministers of this Government support it at Question Time rather than criticise it is something to applaud. That comprehensive policy covers a full spectrum of initiatives, ranging from a substantial energy research and development program to incentives for oil exploration, which are the equal to any offered by any other country. </para>
          <para>I think it is important to repeat what pricing does. It encourages the conservation of scarce oil and it helps to correct waste which results in the maintenance of artificially low prices of petroleum products. When there is a tight supply in Australia and some people are having difficulty in getting petroleum products, nobody would seriously suggest that we should start to reduce the price of oil. It is absolute tommy-rot to make such a suggestion, and the honourable member for Blaxland knows it. Secondly, pricing encourages the substitution of other fuels for liquid fuels. Examples are natural gas and coal. The honourable member did not mention those; he had to concentrate on liquified petroleum gas. I will have a little more to say about that later if I have the time. Those energy resources are already replacing liquid fuels. Thirdly, pricing provides an incentive for the development of alternative energy projects. The relative economies of coal liquefaction, oil from oil-shale, power alcohols- ethanol and methanol- and solar power can be seen in an accurate perspective, which allows more realistic decisions to be made about financing their development. That is what pricing does. Let us look at exploration. Expenditure on exploration in current dollar terms peaked in 1972 at $ 108m. </para>

By 1975-76 that $ 108m had fallen considerably. However, petroleum exploration expenditure in 1977-78 was $116m, and it has been estimated to be $160m to $170m in 1978- 79. Minimum expenditure commitments for off-shore exploration over the five years 1979- 83 are estimated at over $4000m, with expected on-shore expenditure in the same period about $ 100m. That gives the lie to the sort of garbage which was served up a moment ago to the effect that our exploration programs were not having an effect on exploration. </para>

              <para>- I will answer it. The honourable member for Blaxland keeps talking about old oil. The effect of old oil is that it will produce over $700m worth of extra development in Bass Strait. That figure will probably increase to about $ 1 billion. That extra development would not have taken place without that pricing being in effect. That is one example. If the honourable member wants another example he should look at what is happening on Barrow Island. Capital expenditure which is to be put into the Barrow Island fields is substantial. That would not have occurred had the old oil pricing policy not been in place. </para>

          <para>To support energy research and development, the Australian Government made available almost $ 15.5m for commitment in 1978-79, additional to that provided through normal funding for such activity to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and other bodies. In 1978-79 180 projects were approved. Support included $4.5m for production of synthetic fuels from coal, biomass, oil-shale and wastes, and $3.1m for studies aimed at improving the efficiency of coal mining, handling and transportation. In this year&#39;s Budget the Government has made provision for expenditure on energy research and development of $9m, and that compares with $4m in 1978-79. Expenditure from the Coal Research Trust Account in 1979-80 is estimated to be about $5m, making a total of $14m for overall expenditure. In addition, $6m is being provided for forward expenditure in the year following the one in front of us and $3m for the year after that. That makes $23m in all. That program is one which did not exist before. It is one that has been running for just over a year. It is a substantial one and a good one. </para>
          <para>I turn now to energy conservation. Realistic pricing of oil is basic to any approach to petroleum conservation. In the past petroleum products have been priced at levels which have encouraged wasteful and inefficient use of this premium transport fuel and discouraged its substitution by more plentiful alternatives. Pricing on its own, however, is not enough to bring about prompt changes in consumption habits or to develop improved social responsibility towards energy use in the community at large. But the Opposition spokesman on energy matters said a moment ago that the implementation of a pricing policy must be regulated, kept quiet, and done slowly. The substitution effects that we are now seeing would not have occurred but for our policy. It is sheer nonsense for the honourable member to come up with his sort of airy-fairy, breezy generalisation, which is unsubstantiated by facts. The fact is that because of that pricing policy, substitution is taking place, and taking place at a very impressive rate. The honourable member for Blaxland knows that in the very Sydney metropolitan area in which he lives the demand for natural gas has risen by 80 per cent this year. That is a saving of furnace oils and industrial diesel oils, and it constitutes a one per cent increase in the available oils that can be used for other purposes. That is the effect of energy conservation and interfuel substitution. I have described in brief what the Government&#39;s energy policies are. They are important policies, they are comprehensive policies, and they are working. If I had another 20 minutes or so I could demonstrate how they are working. I have given only some examples today. </para>
          <para>The hypocrisy of the Labor Opposition to come in here and talk about confusion and energy policies is the height of folly in the first case and absurd in the second case. If ever we had an illustration of confusion, it was exhibited by the Labor Party in Question Time today. Members of the Labor Party here in the Parliament say Don&#39;t mine uranium&#39; and Labor Party supporters say &#39;Don&#39;t mine uranium&#39;, yet we have it very clearly on the record that the Australian Council of Trade Unions disagrees with that policy. Here we have a fundamental issue: Whether to mine uranium to meet the demands for energy around the world, to gain earnings for this country through exports. The Labor Party has no policy on this issue at all. Its policy is a shamble. </para>
          <para>Central to any policy is pricing; it is absolutely key. I have demonstrated during the course of this speech that there is utter confusion in the mind of the honourable member for Blaxland, but it goes much further than that. As I illustrated during the last sitting week at Question Time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mulock,</inline> the New South Wales Minister for Mineral Resources, sees proper pricing as leading to increased exploration.

            <para>- Whenever I hear the Minister for National Development ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman)</inline> in these interminable debates where he defends himself or attempts to defend himself on these most important energy matters I get a remarkable sense of deja vu because all he does is repeat himself ad nauseam and attempt to bluster his way through with 15 minutes of nonsense. It is no wonder that the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> and other responsible elements of the media refer to him as a junior Minister heading a junior department. One can better understand that comment when one looks at the situation. Who in this Government is responsible for this vital energy policy? The Department of National Development is responsible for oil pricing and supply. The Department of Trade and Resources is responsible for the issue of export licences, the pricing of such vital energy components as coal and uranium and for setting pricing parameters on the export of coal. The Department of the Treasury attempts to perform its usual overseeing role. Above and overriding them all is the heavy hand of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. That Department always insists on having the final say. As far as an energy policy is concerned, the Minister for National Development, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> are bogged down in a quagmire of their own making and their own ineptitude. </para>

          <para class="block">It is no wonder that the so-called Green Paper was suppressed. So at this stage, the Prime Minister, as he is sometimes wont to do, took over. He released an energy Press statement instead of the Green Paper. It took the Prime Minister three months to produce that Paper, and in June it took him three minutes to deliver it. When one looks at the Green Paper, one can understand why. It contains such futilities as: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Expects oil companies to obtain imported oil supplies, as necessary, to meet Australian requirements. It will ensure that the PJT will permit oil companies to pass on to users the higher costs associated with spot purchases and will provide an assurance to this effect to the companies. The companies will be required to satisfy the PJT that spot purchases are bona fide and at arm&#39;s length. The Government will ask NSW and South Australia to take similar action. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In another section of the so-called energy statement the Prime Minister said that the Government: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Will formally ask the oil companies to provide complete data on the supply, consumption, stocks and exports of petroleum products in order to improve its monitoring of the oil situation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So on the one hand the Prime Minister is saying in that latter paragraph that the Government does not trust the oil companies to supply full data on costs and shipping and so on; yet on the other hand, in a naive way, he gives them full control and instructs them to import oil at spot prices, expecting the Prices Justification Tribunal to pass on to the Australian public the effects of buying under that spot purchasing system. </para>
          <para>I make the point that the Prices Justification Tribunal on the federal scene has been seen to be inadequate in monitoring costs in the oil industry. It has been so inadequate that the New South Wales Prices Commission has issued a questionnaire of 36 pages to all the oil companies. They are required to complete it in full detail before the Commission will allow any more increases in the price of petrol in New South Wales. It covers such areas as f.o.b. prices on imported oil, shipping costs, the actual purchase of local crude oil and so on. So the Government will not take action to monitor the industry through the PJT, and the New South Wales Prices Commission, if it wants to do the job, is required to step in to fill the gap. </para>
          <para>I invite honourable members to compare this mishmash with the policy of the next Federal Labor government. We have made it perfectly clear in a constructive way what we intend to do. The federal conference in Adelaide spelt out very clearly that we will set up a separate department of energy and minerals and establish a fuel and energy commission. We will place under one umbrella responsibility for administering all policy regarding energy. We will set up a fuel and energy commission to draft long-term energy policy. With regard to petroleum, we have made it abundantly clear that there will not be any automatic flow-on of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries prices to the price of Australian indigenous crude. We have made it clear that, because the oil companies are not spending a proper proportion of their windfall profits on oil exploration, we will set up an oil and gas corporation to explore, produce, refine and market oil. What could be clearer than that? </para>
          <para>I note that my colleagues in Western Australia take the situation seriously enough to call a special conference in Perth for next weekend to hear what the mining and energy industry in Western Australia has to say and to explain our policies to it. There is no question that we need a separate energy department. We are the only Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nation of any size that does not have one. Even tiny Norway has its own department of fuel and energy. Here we have a Minister for National Development who has a junior ranking in the Ministry. The Department of&#34; National Development covers oil pricing policy and four other departments have a finger in the pie covering the highly technical area of energy. One single department should administer such areas as pricing policies on oil, coal and gas, research and production of alternative liquid fuels, gas pipelines, the rationalisation of coal production, an oil and gas corporation, the buying of oil on a government to government basis and liaising with the States on their power generation needs. </para>
          <para>I make this point with regard to not passing on automatically OPEC prices to Australian petrol prices: It is OPEC which makes the decision on the price of its own oil; it is the Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Government that makes the decision on what the price of Australian oil will be. In Australia, we produce 90 per cent of our petrol requirements from the 70 per cent of oil produced from domestic wells. We can charge the full OPEC price if we wish, but that is our decision. That is what the Government has done. It has chosen to make it a revenue raising enterprise and has raised $2000m from the import parity pricing and another $956m from a direct tax on petrol at the pump. If the Government wants to do this, it can do so; but it should clearly explain the negative effects of its actions. The effects of decisions taken in the 1977-78 and 1978-79 Budgets have been to double petrol prices to 30c a litre in the last two years, to increase the consumer price index by 2.5 per cent this year, to double the price of aviation gas since 1 975 and to increase the operating cost of the average farm by $ 1,000 a year. </para>
          <para>There are alternatives to this inflationary nonsense. We need to replace the present shambles with the Labor policy that I have just enunciated. That means three things, and we can afford the luxury of our own pricing policy if we do these things: We need to explore for oil ourselves, using the expertise of the oil and gas corporation; we need to step up our research and production program on liquid fuels such as methanol, ethanol and oil produced from shale and coal; and we need to produce an overall rational energy program and policy. </para>

              <para>- We are told that a united policy is being expressed today but I read in the newspapers at the weekend that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has some different views about what Australia&#39;s energy policy should be with regard to uranium exploitation in this country. I point out that we live in a federation. Over a period this Government has announced a dynamic, sensible and forwardlooking energy policy. The Government knows that we have to live in a real world, in a world that is short of energy and, in particular, short of oil. As a result of the events that have occurred in other parts of the world, the Government has taken resolute action to ensure that Australia&#39;s availability of oil resources is guaranteed. When the Labor Party was in office, oil exploration in this country stopped and, as a result, today to a large extent we are paying some of the price of that. We are not, as the previous speaker said, able to boast that we have 90 per cent self sufficiency in oil. At best we have something in the order of 70 per cent self-sufficiency. There are many indications that but for the initiatives of the present Government, that percentage would have begun to fall and fall very rapidly. When we talk about energy, we need not only be concerned about petroleum and oil products. Also we need to be concerned about other sources of energy that we can sell overseas to buy energy types that are more suited to our needs. </para>

If we want to see whether the Labor Party has a coherent energy policy, let us look at the present situation in South Australia where there is an economy that is in decline. As I said at Question Time today, in South Australia there is a crisis of confidence in the economy. Businessmen across the whole scene of the South Australian economy lack confidence. Consumers lack confidence. The public lacks confidence in its future. That loss of confidence has come about because of the 10 years of Labor government within that State. </para>

              <para>- I am speaking precisely to the point of the Government&#39;s energy policies and I am saying that they are coherent policies. But it is very difficult for a nation to have coherent energy policies, particularly for a federation, if some parts of that federation are negligent in the way in which they handle the situation within their own States. Some discussion has taken place this afternoon about the pricing of petroleum. We heard the honourable member for Blaxland say that he believes that the price of petroleum had to be gradually brought up to world parity prices but not all in one jump. That appeared to be the gist of what he had to say. He is opposed to the bold, determined policy of this Government to ensure that our - </para>

              <para>- The honourable member for Blaxland was complaining about the price of petrol to the Australian petrol user. I draw the attention of the House to what will happen as a result of a Labor Party decision in South Australia. The price of petrol in South Australia will be raised on 1 October by lc a litre because the State Labor Government has imposed an additional petrol tax. It has done so, it says, to pay for the lost revenue resulting from its forgoing of the road tax. It is raising the tax to compensate for some rather mean concessions that it has given to South Australian motorists in terms of licence fees. But in the South Australian Parliament legislation which proposed a growth tax would have imposed a tax burden on South Australian motorists far in excess of the replacement cost of the taxes it was substituting. The Labor Party in South Australia is willing to impose taxes on petrol in the way in which the honourable member for Blaxland is complaining that the Commonwealth Government is doing in respect of a far more coherent energy policy. </para>

              <para>- I want to explain to the House the fact that earlier this year the Labor Party attempted to pass a motion in South Australia that would have prevented the development of Roxby Downs at any time in the future. As a result of the work-statesmanlike work- of the honourable member for Hawker who, through his research assistant, was able to persuade two delegates, that conference voted the amendment out. In South Australia the Labor Party has resolved to develop Roxby Downs when it is satisfied that the safeguards are sufficient. But no one knows who is to determine when it is satisfied. The Liberal Opposition in South Australia wants to see Roxby Downs developed. Its development would be a catalyst that would turn South Australia&#39;s economy around. It is a goldmine that would enable the State&#39;s economy to take off and employment to rise. </para>

It is based on Standing Orders 85 and 86 which provide that a member shall not persist in irrelevance or abuse the orders or forms of the House for the purpose of obstructing business.

            <para>- I am saying what I have already said. I said that the Opposition supported the 1977 pricing policy for a gradual movement to 50 per cent of import parity in company with a resources tax. That should be the full net increase of the old oil price, and that is that. That is the simple fact. There can be no distortions of it and any distortions by the Government parties will be corrected by us. </para>

              <para>-I was aware of that as you were, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker.</inline> Today the result of the by-election in Redcliffe was announced. The Queensland Parliament has a new Liberal member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Terry</inline> White, M.L.A. I am delighted to be part of the team that demonstrated a significant approach and a positive manner in that by-election, unlike members of the Australian Labor Party. The Federal Leader of the Opposition and the State Leader of the Opposition campaigned fearlessly on the Federal Budget of 1979. I say to Opposition members that the people of Redcliffe have spoken. The Labor Party has lost again. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr White</inline> has now been elected to the Queensland Parliament for the very first time. On the day the election in Redcliffe was held there was also a by-election in Gympie. In case the Labor Party has taken heart from the figures that came out of that by-election I remind the House and the Opposition that there was a swing to Labor of 1.8 per cent. The Labor Party may think a swing of 1.8 per cent is an indication that it will come to power in a general election, but I am afraid it has a long way further to go. </para>

            <para>-In the closing moments of a speech interrupted by a week&#39;s adjournment the honourable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peter Johnson)</inline> left no doubt in the minds of members of the Australian Labor Party that the rift between the once great Liberal Party and the once powerful National Country Party is wider than it has ever been before. From the comments of &#39;hear, hear&#39; that supported the honourable member&#39;s remarks it seems that the rift is not only in Victoria and Queensland but is general throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. Frankly, I cannot think of a nicer bunch of people to suffer such a fate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The House is considering the 1978-79 Budget. There can be no doubt that it is a big business Budget. All its provisions are aimed at enlarging those businesses that are already large, such as the oil companies and the mining companies. It is generally believed in the community, although not by myself, that they make hefty donations to the coffers of the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has never denied the direction of the Budget. He justifies it on the basis that as long as business is big there will be employment opportunities in the community. He makes that bald statement with no justification. In fact most of the statements that trip off the tongues of the Prime Minister and members of his Ministry have no justification. The Prime Minister cannot point to any company in the world which has become larger or has increased its profits and as a consequence increased its work force. That does not work. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> and the Prime Minister know that it does not work, as does the Liberal Party; but it sounds plausible. For this reason, the Government is able to rip off funds from the taxpayers, the wage earners in the community, and make them available to the very large companies. </para>
          <para>This Budget is definitely an anti-family Budget. It has been so described by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden).</inline> This description has been repeated in the Press throughout the country. That is not surprising. The Liberal Party has never shown any great propensity to care for the family, the integral unit in our whole society. In this Budget the Government went overboard in making sure that that was understood. There has been no adjustment to the family allowance, which is a very important payment. It is a compensation made to people on the lower income scale, those who have families and who are suffering more than any other section of the community because of their responsibilities and their willingness to face up to them. The House has just concluded a debate on energy policy and petrol prices. I thought that the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> and the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr West ) absolutely wiped the floor with the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman)</inline> and his supporter in that debate. They put the lie to the proposition that all the subsidies paid to oil companies are necessary in order to bring about more exploration for oil. I would like to explode that myth. It has always seemed to me- it has yet to be proved differently to me- that oil companies will drill for oil where they believe that they will make a profit from finding it and where they believe oil to be. It does not matter how much money they are paid or how much or how little they are likely to obtain for a gallon of oil. They will continue to explore for oil, as they have since time immemorial. </para>
          <para>The Government has done two things. It has given the oil companies a higher margin of profit than they had before. It has justified that on the basis that they would explore more diligently. They have not done so. The Government has also gained a windfall tax to which it is not entitled. It has levied this tax on one section of the community only, the purchasers of petrol. It is well known that a year ago it cost $9 to fill the tank of an average car in Australia with fuel. It is also well known that now it costs $17 to fill the same tank with fuel. The difference of $8, which is almost a 100 per cent increase, is not attributable entirely to price rises that have been granted by the various authorities. Most of it is attributable to a government rip-off in the form of another tax. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister glibly comments that people will be paying less tax by the end of this year. Nobody believes him. I do not think he even believes himself. Even the Treasurer is starting to become a victim of his own propaganda. He is almost starting to sound sincere when he alleges that people will be paying less tax by the end of the year. But what is he talking about? Where does tax start and finish? If he is talking only about personal income tax he is wrong. When a government takes action to raise revenue, it is in effect levying a tax. The Government took action to raise more revenue from crude oil produced in Australia. So an additional tax is being paid by the motorist. Because the public transport systems in Australia by and large are fairly poor most people are driven to the point of using motor cars. In any case most of the goods that they buy have been carried on the back of a motor vehicle so that everyone is paying the extra tax. </para>
          <para>The Government has taken action to increase health insurance payments. It has made health insurance more costly. This is also a tax. It was brought about by government action. Through changes to the health insurance system the Government has made it more costly for the delivery of health services. Again, because this has resulted from government action it is a tax. I could go on and on. This Government claims to be a low tax government. It will go down in the annals of history as the highest tax government Australia has ever seen. That includes all the excesses of the Menzies era and the high taxation paid by the Australian people during that time because of the extraordinary inflation that took place during the 1950s. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member was still in three-cornered pants at that time. If he cares to speak to his parents about it they will remind him. It was during the 1950s that Australia suffered its greatest inflation and taxes rose to their highest level. This Government tries to explain its own inadequacies, inabilities inefficiencies and dereliction of duty by going back beyond more than four years of uninterrupted Liberal-Country Party government and blaming what happened during the time of the Labor Government. The people of Australia will not fall for that argument. At all turns of the wheel there is talk about a need for confidence. Of course there is a need for confidence. Our fine economists will never make anything work unless there is confidence in the community about the future. The Prime Minister has the lowest popularity rating of any Prime Minister that this country has ever had at any time in its history. He has had the lowest credibility rating and the widest credibility gap of any person in Australia. He tells us that there is a need for confidence. I would go so far as to say that because of the Prime Minister&#39;s actions and those of his Government the people of this country have as much confidence in him and his Government as housewives had in door-to-door salesmen during the time of the Boston Strangler. There is just no way they can have confidence in a government which twists and turns like a snake on a red hot plate. One never knows where it is going next. That is the sort of thing that has upset the people of Australia and made them afraid. </para>

          <para>People are not prepared to exude the confidence they did during the time of the Whitlam Government. They are squirrelling their money away to make sure that when the axe drops on them they will have some money in the bank to sustain themselves. So for the Prime Minister of Australia to be talking in that vein is absolute and arrant nonsense. So long as he and his Government remain in office there will never be confidence, lt is all very well to talk about foreign capital coming into the country- one wonders about that, too- but unless the ordinary people have confidence, pull their dollars out of the bank and start buying, then all the confidence in the world will come to no good. When I opened the mail today and finally sorted through it I came across a very interesting document called <inline font-style="italic">Building Comment,</inline> Number 4 of 31 August 1979.

It is too long to quote in full but in part, under the heading &#39;Economic Factors Dampen Building Demand &#39;, it states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The 1979 Budget reaffirmed the Federal Government&#39;s economic policy stance of contractionary fiscal and monetary policy, a firm monetarist commitment to restraining money supply growth and the Treasury-inspired conviction that the level of real wages must be reduced as a pre-condition to reducing the level of unemployment. </para>
          </quote>

          <quote>
            <para>The Government &#39;s economic strategy relies on private sector recovery. The basic premise is that reducing the inflation rate will inspire business confidence, and hence investment, and will boost overseas confidence to the extent that the resultant capital inflow will alleviate balance of payments problems and prevent deterioration in the international standing of the Australian dollar. </para>
            <para>The problem is that with economic growth, in terms of Gross Domestic Product, expected to be 2-2&#39;A per cent in 1979-80, (a rate which Treasury admits is hardly sufficient to absorb the growth in the workforce let alone help to reduce unemployment), and an inflation rate of at least 10 percent, the prospects for business and consumer confidence are not good. </para>

The Building industry is particularly vulnerable to industrial disputes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let me analyse what is said there. On two occasions in that passage acknowledgement is given that there will be less after-tax disposable income available to people in a year&#39;s time.

          <para class="block">Association of Victoria, a very respectable body. It gives a warning which this Government should heed, that unless disposable income either remains the same or improves then the Government can expect the people to take what they want, to use every method at their disposal to get what they want, namely, a reasonable disposable income. The Treasurer used a new expression this morning. He called it a cruelly selfish wages policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Government is walking around with its eyes closed if it ignores the factor I just referred to. Working class people of Australia are not going to stand by and see their purchasing power eroded by the action of this Government. The article continues: </para>

              <para>-The table shows the high transaction costs for a house and land package costing $30,000 financed on a first mortgage of $20,000, It is very interesting to note that the highest costs in Australia are in Victoria. Government charges are highest in Victoria, yet there is a Liberal Government in Victoria that boasts about the fact that people want to own their own home. That Government is doing a hell of a lot to help them if it is charging people more than any other State government! Solicitors&#39; fees in Victoria are the highest in Australia. Financial institution charges are marginally the same as they are in other States. The table highlights quite clearly the costs for young people in purchasing their own homes in Australia and how it is absolutely beyond the pale. </para>
            </talk.start>

          <para>Probably I will not have time to raise the way in which this Government has cut back on its funding for all sorts of training programs- the National Employment and Training scheme and the rest for young people in Australia, but when the Opposition speaks about unemployed people it is speaking about young people in our community between the ages of 18 and 25. They are the people who are not finding employment. They are the people who have never had any work experience. They are the people who, at 20 years of age, go for jobs calling for applicants of around 20 years of age with 15 years experience in that type of job. Those people have no hope of getting a job and this Government is doing nothing to help them. </para>
          <para>The industrial relations that were mentioned in that article by the Master Builders Association is a very important matter. I have statistics from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in 1976. In any given year these percentages seldom change. A break-up of the causes of disputes in 1976 shows that wage disputes were responsible for 26 per cent of industrial disputes, management behaviour was responsible for 23.5 per cent of industrial disputes, inter-union rivalries and demarcation disputes of one kind or another constituted 1 5 per cent of the disputes, and working conditions and safety matters constituted 12 per cent of disputes. Even to the casual listener it is obvious that most strikes in Australia are not caused by wage demands but are caused by matters such as management behaviour, inter-union rivalries- this Government does not support the amalgamation of unions and so stands in the way of union amalgamation which would cut out demarcation disputes- and safety matters. Safety issues are the cause of one-eighth of all disputes. Surely nobody is going to be critical of working men and women not wanting to work in situations that are not considered safe. Yet this Government, for its own domestic and political purposes, likes to promote the line that all of the difficulties in Australia are brought about by the industrial action of these militant trade unions. </para>
          <para>A contrary view to that has been expressed by Professor Cifford Donn, an economist at Macquarie University in New South Wales. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 14 February 1977 he wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is probably safe to conclude that Australia is among a group of the most strike-prone Western countries. That group includes Britain, Canada, Finland, Ireland, Italy and the USA. More specific statements about Australia&#39;s strike rating cannot be justified on the basis of existing data. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is very interesting. It was stated by a professor of economics. He continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the area of costs, the ILO data vastly exaggerates Australia&#39;s strike losses in the strike-prone industries of mining, manufacturing, construction and transport. A more valid measure of the overall economic impact of strikes would include all employees in all of our industries. When this measure is used, the ILO figure of 1,390 strike days per 1,000 employees is cut by roughly half. If we compare this with the average work year, we can show that approximately one-third of 1 per cent of all potential work-times was lost because of industrial disputation in 1975. Thus, less time is lost through strikes than through industrial accidents, a single national holiday, or the common cold. Even this one-third of 1 per cent of work-time lost exaggerates the economic cost of strikes to society. Lost production is often made up out of overtime or out of inventories maintained for such purposes. Competitors may fill the gap. Often, production dosen&#39;t even slow down during a dispute. On occasion, strikes may be precipated at times of slack economic activity when output is unwanted by the employer, i.e. strikes may substitute for temporary retrenchments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is a bit sad that those truisms- nobody can dispute them- are not taken into account by this Government which, I repeat, for purely domestic purposes tries to give to the world and has been successful in giving to the world the impression that industrial disputes are ruining Australia. The good professor went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australia is not peculiarly strike-prone. Strikes are not a great economic burden and are not a major drag on productivity when management is competent and creative. Finally, the strike often remains the only effective way for employees to resist the unilateral will of employers. Thus, the right to strike constitutes a fundamental freedom in a democratic society. </para>

After three and a half years of intensive work and hard decision-making, the Government has at last been able to ease some of the restrictions that it has found necessary to place on the whole of the Australian community. This Budget follows a program that has introduced tight control of inflation, a commitment to reduce the deficit and a balancing of the national accounts. This is something which the previous Government could not cope with and which the present Government has coped with. In this Budget, all sections of the community receive benefits. It does not matter whether they are pensioners, small businessmen, taxpayers or those engaged in energy exploration; every section of the community receives some benefit. Furthermore, no increases in charges are made. No section of the community will bear additional costs because of this Budget. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The only aspect that I am concerned about for Australia&#39;s future is whether the wave of industrial unrest and the wage push can be moderated to such an extent that all Australians will be able to gain true benefit from the Budget. It is clear from the economic surveys conducted in Australia by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which were published in August that the Australian community, the Australian people and the Australian economy will benefit from this Budget, and that we are once again on the road to recovery. </para>

            <para>-The Budget is some three weeks old and clearly has already gone sour. There was a temporary euphoria, the first response to the Budget, but very quickly both in this House and in the country this particular Budget has gone sour. One can see that it has gone sour in the House simply by examining the comments of the speakers in its defence. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the advantages of coming into the debate somewhat late is that one can make an analysis of the speeches of those who have got up to defend the Budget. Apart from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard),</inline> only three Liberal speakers have attempted either a comprehensive defence of the Budget or a defence of its major provisions against the charges that have been brought against them. Those three were New South Welshmen- the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connolly),</inline> the honourable member for Berowra <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Edwards)</inline> and the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume).</inline> The honourable member for Mitchell <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cadman)</inline> who has just spoken also made that effort in his three minute speech. But those members are the only members on the Government side who in the weeks of this debate have made any real attempt to defend the Budget. I think the adequacy of their defence leaves much to be desired- I will examine it in due coursebut at least they made an effort to defend the Budget. </para>
          <para>The remainder of the members who have spoken from the Government side, having decided that the Budget was either indefensible or perhaps incomprehensible, opted for one of three courses. Let me examine the kinds of defence that they have presented. First of all we heard what is now typical in this House- a ranting on about the Whitlam years and a savaging of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden).</inline> Apparently these speakers were mostly oblivious to the fact that their Government has been in charge of the economy of this country for four years. We have now had four years of Liberal economics. It is no defence of this Liberal Budget simply to go back to the period 1972-75. We have had four years of Liberal economics, four years of a stagnating economy, four years of depressed demand and four years of rising unemployment. It is on the Government economic policy that the Australian people will deliver their verdict in the next 18 months. </para>
          <para>The tactic of simply bringing up the years 1972-75 or of simply savaging the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was led, needless to say, by that merchant of froth and bubble, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> the chief parliamentary blatherer, abetted him. Another eagerbeaver in the cause- I am sorry that he has just left the House- was the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Carlton).</inline> He has pursued the Leader of the Opposition assiduously. He said: &#39;I have kept a copy of every speech that he has made*. One can only wish that for his sake and for the sake of the New South Wales Liberal </para>
          <para class="block">Party he had pursued <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyenko</inline> Urbanchich with the same assiduity as he has pursued the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>Nearly all of those speeches referred, of course, to the donkey-walloping incident. Indeed, the speech of the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> would have been more than usually vacuous if he had not had an opportunity to orate for some paragraphs on donkey-walloping. I think I can characterise this whole performance by the Government on the donkey-walloping theme. What we had was simply a cacophony of asses braying a bout their own mistreatment. Indeed, one only has to consider the Government benches in this House to realise that all members of the Opposition are inevitably donkey-wallopers, at least metaphorically speaking. That was the first response. It was simply either to attack the Leader of the Opposition or to talk about the Whitlam years. There was no defence of the Budget. </para>
          <para>A second response from the Government benches was what I call the parochial response, that is, to abandon any defence of the broad economic policies of the Budget and to talk about the particular themes of the Budget in a parochial context. Needless to say, that was a very popular approach with the National Country Party members. We heard what I can only call a rural lament from the honourable member for Murray <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lloyd).</inline> He lamented over telephone charges, fuel costs and the rural inadequacies of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. </para>
          <para>Then, from the honourable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> we heard complaints about the costs and inadequacy of rural fuel supplies and worries about the television coverage in rural areas of test matches. He included for good measure in his speech a castigation of <inline font-style="italic">Broadband.</inline> He described that program as &#39;garbage&#39;. I can only say personally that any program castigated by the honourable member for Kennedy would ipso facto be worth listening to. Then we had the extraordinary exhibition of the honourable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lusher). His</inline> speech sounded like a left-over from some transport debate. For 20 minutes the virtues of the southern railway were compared with the virtues of the Hume Highway. Let me say that all these things were, no doubt, worthy causes but none of them constituted a defence of the third Howard Budget. </para>
          <para>Finally, there were quite idiosyncratic responses by Government members. I think the classic example of the idiosyncratic response was made by the honourable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drummond)</inline> who devoted almost entirely the whole of his speech to California&#39;s Proposition 1 3 with scarcely a reference to this Budget or, indeed, to this country. Of course, as Proposition 13 was concerned with a drastic cut in California&#39;s taxation, I can assume only that the honourable member was using this approach to attack his own Government because it is now clear that whatever else this Government might be it is certainly not a government devoted to taxation cuts. </para>
          <para>Let us look at those few members- very few indeed- on the Government side who have attempted any real defence of this Budget. The honourable member for Berowra said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The performance of the economy over the past 12 months has been pretty good. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I like the word &#39;pretty&#39;. I think one could say equally well that the performance of the Australian economy over the last 12 months has been pretty bad. Let us give the Government a couple of points. It is true that there has been an improvement in the balance of payments position, partly the result of the export growth and also the private capital inflow. Let us recognise that there has been an improvement there, but it is a pity that that improvement is not being used because it gives expansionary possibilities that this economy may not have had in recent years. Again, one also admits that there has been some improvements in business fixed investment and in business profits. One can collect a few facts like that. The honourable member for Berowra did his best with newspaper headlines to put together enough facts to suggest that somehow, over the last 12 months as a result of this Government&#39;s policy, the economy has been pretty good. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the overwhelming evidence that over the last 12 months the economy has been pretty bad. For the third year running the economic policies of the Government have failed to work. As in 1976-77 and again in 1977-78, so in 1 978-79 the economy had just not responded to the economic medicine prescribed by this Government. I think it should be now clear to the Australian people that it is impossible for them to go on having faith, either in the economic policies advanced by this Government or in the Treasury gremlins that guide them. One could examine what the Government promised in each of the Budget Speeches and then examine what happened to those promises. Perhaps &#39;promises&#39; is the wrong word. I am told that the word promises&#39; is not used now by the Government. The word we should use is &#39;projections&#39;. Let us examine the projections made by the Treasurer last year, the indices he suggested we should watch in order to judge the health or otherwise of the economy. I want to suggest that if we examine the things that the Treasurer suggested we should emphasise then we will discover that, in fact, on his own measures and on his own indices, in the last 12 months it is truer to say of the Australian economy that it went pretty badly rather than pretty well. </para>
          <para>Let me deal with each of these indices advanced by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech last year to see how they have worked. First of all an obvious one is, of course, the deficit miscalculation. In the Budget projection of last year a deficit of $2,8 1 3m was promised which, we were told by the Treasurer, would be a reduction of $52 lm over 1977-78, that is, the Government was bringing down the deficit. Of course, what we actually got was a deficit of $3,478m, an increase in fact of $145m over the Budget deficit for the previous year. I am not a Budget fetishist as the Government is, but if we accept the arguments advanced by the Government of the importance of the deficit to the control of inflation in this country, that kind of failure, that kind of miscalculation- and for the second year running- undoubtedly has inflationary implications. That is the argument of Treasury. If, in fact, there are these serious deficit miscalculations then, on the Government&#39;s own argument, that failure injects inflationary elements into the Australian economy. </para>
          <para>Let me take the second of the indices used by the Treasurer in 1978 to suggest how we should make a measurement of the economy in the past 12 months. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The firm control of the monetary aggregates which the Government has put in place since early in 1976 has contributed much to the subsequent wind-down in inflation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He also said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In this regard- and despite the acknowledged uncertainties in such projections- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I want to be fair to the Treasurer; 1 want to put in the qualifications he made. He stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I now state that this Budget is consistent with an outlook for financial conditions indicated by growth in the broadly defined volume of money (M3) in the range of 6-8 per cent over the course of 1 978-79. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What was, in fact, the growth in the money supply as measured through M3 in 1978-79? The growth rate was 1 1.8 per cent. That is nearly double the lower figure suggested. I know the Treasurer abandoned this projection in April 1979 as inappropriate. I recognise that certain economic developments led to a reconsideration of the money supply position. The Budget </para>
          <para class="block">Papers, for instance, provide a whole host of excuses for the blowing out of money supply. There were Reserve Bank advances to finance the wheat crop, there was a turn-around in the private sector foreign exchange transactions and there was a reduction in demand for government securities. All of these excuses are advanced and, no doubt, contain some elements of truth. What the Treasury Papers, of course, do not mention is that there was, in the latter part of 1978 and the early part of 1979, monetary mismanagement in this country; that, in fact, the blowing out of the money supply was partly the result of a mishandling of the monetary position in the latter months of 1978 and the early months of 1979. 1 do not know of any leading economic commentator who has not brought that kind of criticism against the Government about its monetary management in the latter part of the year. If this is true then what happens to the statement made by the Treasurer that the firm control of the monetary aggregates have had much to do with the subsequent wind-down in inflation? If, in fact, the infirm control of the monetary aggregates which took place in the latter part of 1978 and early 1979- if it was infirmed, as I clearly would suggest- then it has had some contribution to the accelerating pattern of inflation in this country. The Treasurer cannot escape, on his own argument, some responsibility through monetary mismanagement for what is again becoming the great problem for this economy, the acceleration of inflation. </para>
          <para>We then come to another of the indices suggested by the Treasurer. He said that the Government promises a &#39;further sustainable reduction in interest rates&#39;. Indeed, that promise, which was inappropriate in the monetary conditions of the time, was partly responsible for the monetary mismanagement at the end of the year. Of course, the effort to bring down interest rates in that period contributed to the blowing out of the money supply but it also had the effect of compelling interest rates back up. What we have now is that the downward trend in interest rates, in 1 978, which were inappropriate for the market conditions at the time, was reversed in early 1 979. That is certainly true of the official rates. So another of the kinds of projections made by the Treasurer for the health of the economy in the period 1978-79 was not met. Then we were told by the Treasurer in 1978: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The personal saving ratio is likely to continue to decline and private consumption expenditure can be expected to grow at a healthy pace. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That did not occur. The personal savings ratio increased over the year and all the signs are that it is likely to go on increasing. The depressed demand situation of this economy ran through 1978- 79 and looks as though it will be more threatening to economic development in the coming year. </para>

              <para>- I am saying that we should make a judgment on the accuracy of the Treasurer&#39;s projections by looking at what he said last year and at what has happened in the past 12 months. If the honourable member is prepared to do that, then any faith that he could have in the economic management of his own party would rapidly dissipate. This was another promise made in the Treasurer&#39;s statement a year ago: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>Overall, gross non-farm product is projected to grow by around 4 per cent in real terms in 1 978-79. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In 1978-79 that growth was distinctly below that figure; it was 2.8 per cent. We usually consider that that measurement is the most effective measurement of growth in the economy. It fell well below the Treasurer&#39;s prediction. One of the interesting things is the response of the Treasury gremlins when they have problems like this. They know that the failure of that growth projection undermines much of the economic argument of last year&#39;s Budget. If one reads the Budget Papers for this year one will discover that the Treasury gremlins have, at enormous length, tried to explain why these predictions go wrong. Indeed, I suggest that, when we read the Budget Papers in the future, and the Government has long and involved statistical explanations that is a sure sign of a Treasury cover-up of a failed projection. </para>
          <para>Last year the Treasurer said in his Budget Speech: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>With even reasonably sensible outcomes for wage determination, inflation is expected to be running at an annual rate down towards 5 per cent by mid- 1 979. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He knows that that has been completely falsified. If one reads the 1979-80 Budget Papers, one sees that the explanation is that overseas factors are the chief reason for this failure. To be fair to the Treasurer, there are certain overseas factors which have affected the failure of his inflation projections. But, the failure of those inflation projections is as much the fault of the Government in terms of the way in which it developed indirect taxes over the last 12 months. The fact that we now have an inflation rate running at about 9 per cent is due to the deficit fetish in pursuance of which the Government said: &#39;We will put on indirect taxes to solve our deficit problem&#39;. Therefore, the Government directly puts into the economy the inflationary factors of indirect taxes. For instance, the health changes which are now being made will have an inflationary effect in the coming year. The petrol taxes which were introduced last year had an inflationary impact last year and will have an increasingly inflationary impact in the coming year. The changes in other indirect taxes in the last Budget fed into the inflationary spiral. By trying to cut the deficit with the introduction of indirect taxes the Government is even more directly fuelling inflation in this country. If there is one major criticism to be made of last year&#39;s Budget and this Budget in terms of the total management of this economy, it is that in pursuit of a cut in the deficit, in adherence to a deficit fetish, the Government through indirect taxespetrol taxes, increased health charges and other indirect taxes- is directly fuelling the accelerating inflation in this economy. </para>

            <para>- The member of the Opposition who has just spoken, the honourable member for Bonython <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Blewett),</inline> indicated once again the complete misunderstanding of what Budget policy is all about. The substance of his remarks meant that a deficit does not matter; that all that is important is for the Government to spend money on programs that it thinks are good and that there is no need to have a responsible funding of a deficit. That was the plain implication in the remarks made by the honourable gentleman. If he does not like it, it is too bad, because that is what he was saying and that is quite plainly the reason why under the Labor Party there was a mammoth inflation and under the Labor Party again there would be a massive inflation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Budget maintains and reinforces the ongoing strategy that we have pursued. It presents with candour and detail- warts and all- the shape of things in 1979-80 as we see them. It is not a question of expediency or of short term popularity. It is a question of consolidating and strengthening Australia&#39;s economic recovery so that we can have a firm foundation for the 1 980s. We still have some major economic problems to confront. These reflect partly some international developments and partly distortions which we inherited and which, <inline font-style="italic">3Vi</inline> years later, still in part beset the economy. The world economy is troubled and, as the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> has made plain, inflation is accelerating quite rapidly- too rapidly- in a number of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. In many of those countries economic growth has slowed down. As a result, world trade is likely to remain sluggish. In the United States output is actually declining. That means that there is an even greater need for Australia to conduct her own affairs in a realistic and clearheaded manner. The tighter we can run our economy, the better we can run our ship, the better we can get through a difficult international economic environment so that we can advance in a hostile external environment. We are establishing the circumstances in which we can do that because of the strategy that has been applied over the past 3V4 years. As a result, we are much better equipped to do so than might otherwise have been the case. </para>
          <para>The strategy that we followed has already been vindicated. In the year to June 1979, compared with the figure a year ago, civilian employment is up by more than 64,000, and it is worth noting that the number of full time unemployed is 18,000 fewer than it was a year ago. How many people out in the countryside are aware of that? So often, people have reported that unemployment is rising and continues to rise; but, on the figures issued by the Bureau of Statistics, unemployment is 18,000 fewer than it was a year ago. Unemployment has been reduced from 6.2 per cent to 5.8 per cent. Whilst we cannot make too much of that, it is an encouraging trend and one which, through our policies, we intend to build upon. </para>
          <para>Profitability is up, but it can be improved even more. Inflation is down substantially from the 1 7 per cent of Labor&#39;s years to around 9 per cent. This figure is higher than we would like and higher than we believed at this time last year it would be; but we all know what has happened since. We can understand that those inflationary pressures that have put a hiccup into the downward movement of inflation in Australia have had the same effect or a worse effect in many countries overseas. On an annualised basis, inflation in the United States is now running at around 14 per cent. On the latest figures, inflation in the United Kingdom is around 22 per cent. For the OECD area as a whole the figure is 12.9 per cent and for Australia it is around 9 per cent. The margin in favour of Australia is increasing, which means that our industries become more competitive, that our exporters can do better and that the Australian economy is strengthened, and that is good for Australian employment. </para>
          <para>I remember that about two years ago my colleague, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> brought to the Government a proposal to buy a major replenishment ship for the Navy at a cost of $70m or $80m. The tender was to go to an overseas firm and the best overseas tender was from a French tenderer. We, as a government, said: &#39;We would like to give Australian contractors a last chance. Go back to the Australian contractors. See how much subsidy might be involved to get that ship built in Australia&#39;. Our colleague was able to come back and only a short while ago announce that the contract had gone to an Australian tenderer, Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd. No subsidy at all was required because the Australian firms undercut the best overseas tender available to the Australia Defence Forces. That is the kind of result we want from our policies- Australian industry being able, to go out and compete and get into business which some time ago we thought was beyond our reach. </para>
          <para>We are exporting again. In the 12 months to June of this year exports were over 20 per cent up on the same period in the previous year. Australia is again recognised internationally as a good place in which to invest. Private foreign investment in the last financial year was the best for almost a decade. That again is a result of the policies that have been applied rigorously by this Government over three and a half years. A large number of major mining and manufacturing projects now exist in Australia. Over $13 billion is firmly committed or the projects are in the final feasibility stage. In the alumina and aluminium smelting industry alone, projects total $4 billion, and that means jobs right around Australia. In the coal industry, $2 billion-worth of projects mean more jobs around this country. There has been international praise for Australia&#39;s steadfastness and success. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development compliments Australia on its economic policy. We are one of the few countries that over the last few years has been able steadily to improve international competitiveness. That again is as a result of our policies. </para>
          <para>But we cannot hide the fact that there are some undesirable aspects, some dangers in this year ahead of us. The downward trend in prices has been interrupted, as we know, and for reasons that we understand. New dangers are produced by international developments- upward pressures on oil prices, on beef prices and on some metal prices. But we do not sit back, we do not blame adverse overseas developments. They are a fact of life and we have to meet them. We face them and devise a strategy to minimise the damage, and to improve Australia&#39;s competitive advantage compared with other countries. That is just what we have done. Compare that with the attitude of our predecessors in office. They inherited an economy with inflation running at about 5 per cent- that was below the OECD average. During their term in office they increased inflation to 17 per cent, five points above the OECD average. That was as a result of their policies over three years. In the last six months, Australia&#39;s inflation rate is significantly below the average rate of advanced countries overseas. We intend to keep it that way. </para>
          <para>I think we need to remember that Labor compounded the world inflationary problem for Australia by quite deliberate policies of its own. Commonwealth outlays increased successively by 20 per cent, 46 per cent and 23 per cent. Let us look at health, the area under the control and charge, first of all, of the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden).</inline> Presumably he kept a fatherly eye on it when he was Treasurer. But the escalation of costs in that area, which was under his control in one form or another, was 2 1 per cent in 1973-74, 37 per cent in 1974-75 and 1 14 per cent under the Budget of the Leader of the Opposition. I think that shows that his area of direct interest was one of those areas that contributed most to inflation, most to an increase in outlays in a quite exorbitant and unreasonable fashion. We need to understand that in the area allegedly under his control costs were quite patently out of his control. Over the last three years my colleague, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> has re-established control over health finances in a very praiseworthy way. </para>
          <para>It is worth noting that the Leader of the Opposition would do it all again, because he said he would restore Medibank as it was. That would cost $600m and the cost escalation would be off again. He would have no concern for the deficit and no concern for its consequences on the Australian economy. Look at what happened through Labor&#39;s wages policy. It also compounded the world inflationary pressures. In the year to March 1975 wages went up by 38 per cent- in one year alone. Was it any wonder that Australian industry had some difficulty in employing people, any wonder that it had some difficulty in producing and selling and providing jobs for Australians? Our Budget builds on the achievements of the last two to three years. It responds to emerging dangers in the world economy. It is anti-inflationary. It maintains and enhances the competitive gains for Australian industry. It establishes rigid controls over government spending for the forthcoming year, which will increase by about 9 per cent, about the same as inflation. I think it is worth noting that since 1975-76 total government expenditure has basically been held constant in real termsunder 1 per cent a year in any case. In the three years before that, expenditure grew by 10.5 per cent per year in real terms and in the years before that by nearly 5 per cent per year in real terms. So, in a sense our Government is the first for a very long while, maybe the first in the post-war years, that has maintained the kind of rigid control over expenditure that we have established. Despite that, we have met major commitments in defence, in social welfare and in the development and support of Australian industry. </para>
          <para>How many people understand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that in 1969 there were 179 pensioners for every 1,000 people in the labour force, but in 1979 there are 284 pensioners for every 1,000 people in the labour force? Is it any wonder that the welfare bill has grown as a result of those figures? I do not think that anyone has advocated cutting back income support to needy individuals. Because inflation is now higher than we envisaged at the time of the last Budget a year ago, pensions and benefits are again indexed twice-yearly. We have gone beyond that. The income limits for pensioners who may receive fringe benefits have been extended, and supporting parent beneficiaries have become eligible for pensioner health benefit cards, as is only fair and just. Repatriation benefits have been improved and extended, as this Government and I believe they should have been, to allied ex-service personnel. So, we have met obligations in that area. </para>
          <para>In defence we are providing an extra $28 lm, nearly 1 1 per cent more than last year in money terms. That has enabled us to lift the percentage of the defence vote going on capital equipment from Labour&#39;s average 7 per cent to over 15 per cent this year. We can start to rebuild the infrastructure and weaponry of the armed forces, and that is a very welcome and necessary improvement. In industry, export expansion grants have increased from $20m allocated in 1978-79 to $170m in 1979-80, partly because there is a backlog in the bills owed, but also very significantly because that program has been very much more effective than we originally thought and because Australian manufacturing industry is being much more effective in exporting and getting out into markets right around the world than had been thought possible two or three years ago. That again is a commitment that this Government has met. So, we are providing for national goals in areas of social welfare, in defence and in support of industry. Despite that we have been able to contain expenditure overall in the most rigid way and reduce the deficit very substantially indeed. </para>
          <para>The deficit is now coming down to 1 .9 per cent of the gross domestic product, to under $2.2 billion, a very substantial reduction indeed. The domestic deficit is coming down to under $900m, less than half that of last year. I think we need to understand the implications of this for the Australian economy. It provides more scope in the private sector, it greatly assists in the management of monetary policy and it will make it easier to find adequate private funds for investment and housing. It keeps a downward pressure on inflation and strengthens the Australian dollar and very greatly builds private sector confidence. People have only to go round Australia and to the business and financial areas to see how, over the last two or three weeks, in the time since the Budget, this Budget has built and extended confidence right throughout Australia. We intend that that be continued. </para>
          <para>In addition, we have been able to reduce taxes. Whatever the semantic arguments might be about whether or not people should pay more tax when they have a higher income, the fact remains that on every dollar earned from 1 December taxes will be lower. If additional dollars are earned less tax will be paid on those additional dollars than would otherwise have been the case. I think it is worth noting that in this year alone tax paid will be $4,000m less than would have been paid had the famous Hayden scales still been in force- $4,000m less. Let us look at somebody on an income of $12,000 a year. Under the Hayden scales he was on 45c in the dollar. He will be on a shade over 33c in the dollar through this year. Under the Hayden scales a man on $20,000 a year was paying 60c in the dollar tax. He will be on a shade over 47c in the dollar this year. </para>
          <para>It is worth noting that after 1 December a taxpayer on average earnings, and having a wife and two children, will be $20 a week better off as a result of our reforms and as a result of family allowances than he would have been under Labor. In the case of family allowances alone, we have provided $4 billion over four years. That represents massive support for Australian families and a major social welfare innovation introduced by this Government. One can compare that with taxes going up by 125 per cent under Labor. Labor has promised additional taxes on capital, on wealth and on national resources, increased oil levies and a marginal income tax rate of 75c to 80c in the dollar. One can see which is the party of high taxes and which is the party of low taxes. </para>
          <para>It is worth noting that the September issue of <inline font-style="italic">Syntec</inline> noted that in 1980-81 we will have the unusual spectacle of investment inflow picking up in this country in the midst of international recession. That is a remarkable statement. It is also a remarkable commentary on the Australian economy and the way in which it has been managed. That publication is virtually saying that because of the management of the Australian economy we are attracting investments to this country when other countries are not doing so; because we are keeping this country under economic control Australia will have more activity than will many other countries. We know that the world is in trouble because inflation is too high and growth in economies is too low. </para>
          <para>But if Australia is to come through it well, the strength and the heart of our policies must be to keep a downward thrust on inflation, to improve Australia&#39;s competitive advantage over other countries, and to build opportunities in the private sector so that lasting real jobs can and will be created and we can get this country moving again- I believe we are- in the major resource areas, that will provide a substantial number of jobs. Creating a climate for private investment will also create a substantial number of jobs throughout this country. I have already mentioned $2 billion worth of investments in the coal industry and $4 billion worth of investments in the bauxite, alumina and aluminium industry. In the June quarter private foreign investments of $ 1,400m was approved. That represents prospective expenditure and people from overseas, voting with their dollars and their pounds, demonstrating their confidence in the Australian economy. No other country has that kind of reputation at this time. </para>
          <para>What is Labor&#39;s alternative? I think we should look at it. It is worth noting that the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> said at the National Press Club: </para>
          <quote>

          <para class="block">What a wonderful reason for the Labor Party abnegating its responsibility.

The recent economic experience of the whole industrialised world drives homes the lesson that policies which do not attack inflation cannot achieve a return to sustained economic growth and the enhanced living standards which only that growth can bring. </para>
          <para>Let me quote for a moment from comments made by William Miller, Secretary of the United States Treasury and designated by President Carter as the Chief Economic Spokesman for the United States. He said: </para>

One could mention such proposals as a national investment fund, national superannuation, national no-fault compensation, the establishment of a national newspaper to print those things which Labor would like to see, subsidies for political parties and the abolition of staff ceilings. How much would all those proposals cost? Are the members of the Labor Party modest people? Would the cost be $200m, $500m or perhaps $ 1,000m? We could take our pick. </para>

              <para>- It might even be $2,000m, but we know that it certainly would not be a modest amount. But in the alternative Budget that has not been presented there was a proposal in relation to capital works. How much were they going to cost-$200m, $300m? The Leader of the Opposition is silent about it. He has given some figures in relation to the establishment of a community services corps, which is his own discredited Regional Employment Development scheme, a scheme which he abandoned in his 1975 Budget. On the basis of 50,000 people being involved in the new scheme, it would cost $600m in a full year and not $ 100m, or $40 a week per person, as he tried to suggest. It is another example of opportunism; it would not create jobs. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let us look at the consequences experienced in a Labor State which has pursued this kind of policy. In South Australia, 8.2 per cent of the work force is looking for full time work. The national rate is 5.8 per cent. That is the kind of result one gets in a Labor State pursuing Labor policies. There is an argument going on about it at the moment. Again in South Australia in the month of August the number of unemployed increased by over 5,000 people, whereas overall in Australia the number of unemployed fell quite usefully during that month. If people want more of the stagnation which is occurring in South Australia, they have only to vote for Labor policies for the whole of the country. However, I am certain that people have more sense than to do that. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition made another gentle remark about an employer subsidy scheme. It is something which has not really been analysed. He hopes that it will sound good. It is meant to create sympathy for the unemployed when in fact it is a policy which will provide no help at all. He has proposed that a subsidy be paid to employers equal to the rate of the unemployment benefit or net additions to the work force. Such a proposal can be taken only on a firm or company basis. Even if employment were static, there would be many companies expanding their employment base and many others that would be losing because they just were not doing so well. On some estimates the increase in employment in a number of companies and corporations would be not less than a quarter of a million right around Australia. This scheme would cost about $ 1,000m a year but would produce no real increase in employment at all. It is a hyprocritical scheme and one which seeks to delude the Australian public. </para>
          <para>In view of all of this, what would the deficit be under Labor? I do not think it could be less than $4 billion and it might well be substantially more than that. Even if it were $4 billion, matching those commitments would still depend upon very greatly increased taxation in a number of areas. I refer to such things as wealth taxes, the oil levy and the resources tax- taxes designed to destroy initiative and enterprise right throughout Australia and to bring this country to a halt, just as Labor so successfully did once before. </para>
          <para>It is worth noting that these expenditure proposals have come from somebody who was regarded- I do not know why- as a responsible Treasurer. But what would things be like after a bunch of Labor Ministers got around a Cabinet table? Expenditure would go up two or three times. Labor has no policy to control inflation; it has a policy only for disaster. That seems to me to be like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> all over again. Labor has no wages policy; it has no recognition of wages and their relationship with inflation. It is quite plain that Labor sold out to the Left at the Adelaide conference. Honourable members do not have to take my word for that; they just have to take Bob Hawke &#39;s word for it. One sentence which came out of the Adelaide conference states: </para>

That is the interpretation and it is the interpretation that members on the opposite side of the House would be bound to. We have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> &#39;s word for it that the Leader of the Opposition had a gutless sell-out to the Left. We had confirmation of that just a day or two ago.

The Leader of the Opposition is being sensible, says <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hartley,</inline> because he is accepting the advice of Jim Roulston of the AMSWU I do not know that anyone wants the AMSWU running anyone in this Parliament. I think that the first act of decency that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hartley</inline> has ever performed might be his advising us of the secret adviser to the Leader of the Opposition in economic policy. Is it any wonder that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> called it gutless? Is it any wonder that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> called it a sell-out to the Left?

          <para>Quite plainly, Labor&#39;s policies are also against foreign investment. A Labor Government would take action to prevent a continuance of activities of transnational corporations which are against the interests of the Australian public. But which activities, which companies are they? Is it going to hold a sword over the heads of all of them? How many people would invest in or undertake new enterprises against that kind of threat? The Labor Party wants an institution to spy on transnational, to provide the information to unions here and overseas. Again, that would just send investment out of this country. </para>

But still South Australia and the Australian Labor Party hold up the development of one of the greatest mines that could be established anywhere in the world because they are wedded to an archaic and stupid policy which is going to inhibit Australia&#39;s development and which is going to prevent Australia playing the role that she should as an energy supplier. </para>

          <para>Let me say something for a moment about policy on oil. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> would abandon our oil policy. But what would he replace it withsuggestions or innuendoes? He has not said. The Opposition&#39;s opportunism and deception are nowhere more apparent than in its attitude to crude oil pricing. It tries to suggest that the motorist should get his petrol for less, but at the same time it tries to suggest that the levy should be higher. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. There is no getting away from the fact that oil supplies are scarce. I am certain that the Australian public understands that. Prices must reflect that scarcity and I am sure that people accept that, even if they do not like it. We cannot delude ourselves that Australia can enjoy artificially low oil prices simply because at present we are 70 per cent self sufficient. Beyond the very short term that 70 per cent self-sufficiency would fall very dramatically and an artificially low price would be a recipe for disastrous shortages a short while into the future. </para>
          <para>Almost every industrialised country in the world has recognised that the days of cheap oil are over. Indeed Australia still has lower petrol prices than, for example, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and many other countries. It is worth recalling, I think, the words of the Leader of the Opposition when as Treasurer, he announced the introduction of the crude oil levy in the 1975 Budget. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The low domestic price is not conducive to rational resource usage. Yet it does not necessarily follow that increases in the domestic price should be reflected fully in corresponding increases in prices to Australian producers . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I would have thought that that is exactly the attitude which underlies this Government&#39;s policy. It is in fact the policy that has been pursued. It is an attitude which has been endorsed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, by the International Energy Agency and by the governments of most industrialised countries. </para>
          <para>Labor&#39;s current approach would mean the end of oil search and development. World parity pricing for oil, is an essential part of conservation. It is an essential part of the use of alternative fuels and it is an essential part of the exploration and development of new fields. We intend to stay with that policy because it is the right policy for Australia. </para>
          <para>When we look at the Labor Party&#39;s economic policies, or rather the lack of them, its policies against foreign investment, against development- the policies that would lead to inflation running ahead once again- it is plain that the Labor Party would increase unemployment, and end development and investment. I do not really think that we should have any reason to doubt this. Labor did it once before to a greater extent and more effectively than anyone could have believed possible. Is there any reason, therefore, to doubt Labor&#39;s capacity to do just that once again? That would be reminiscent of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> all over again. </para>
          <para>In marked contrast to the Opposition&#39;s fantasies, the 1979-80 Budget, which the Treasurer introduced, is a simple and direct document. It is in marked contrast to the Opposition&#39;s blithe disregard for the inflationary consequences of its alternative policies. The 1979-80 Budget does not pretend that inflation can be solved by schemes that ignore the basic cause of inflation or be devices which manipulate price levels at the expense of intensifying underlying inflationary forces. Let no one forget that one of the major dislocations of the mid-1970s, one which to some extent is still with us, was the huge increase in the share of income going to wages and the huge fall in the share going to business. Let no one forget that that catastrophe flowed directly from the policies of the Labor Government. Let no one forget Labor&#39;s massive spending splurge. Let no one forget Labor&#39;s catastrophic inflation and let no one forget that the Labor Party is the party that began high unemployment in this country. Let no one forget Labor&#39;s destruction of this economy. We are repairing that economy, recovering from the disaster of Labor. This is a Budget for the future. It is a Budget for strength; it is a Budget for all Australians. We agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> when he says that the 1980s will be the boom decade for Australia. Occasionally he speaks a little economic sense. </para>
          <para>This is a Budget which will steer Australia through the difficult international economic scene. Because we are running the economy well, because our inflation is lower than that of many of our trading partners and because we are therefore becoming more competitive, even if world trade is low and even if there is not much growth in the United States or in Europe, we will be able to get Australia through a difficult world scene much better than most other countries. We will be able to get more than our normal share of world investment. We will be able to get more activity in this country because we can attract that investment and we will get more activity in this country because our industries are becoming more competitive and reaching out to more markets in many different countries. We can do those things only if this economy is well run and inflation is kept under control. The Budget is confidently pointing the way to the 1 980s. Under our policies, it will be a decade of achievement, of stability, of social progress and a better life for all Australians. </para>

Seven out of ten people disapprove of the way the Prime Minister is doing his job. After listening to his speech on the Budget I think that only two out of ten people will approve of the way he is doing his job.

              <para>-When the Prime Minister talks about a wages policy he should remember that in November and December of 1975, when the race was on to be Prime Minister of this country, he told the people of Australia that he would abide by indexation. That was to be the Government&#39;s wages policy, which he dispensed with immediately he came to power. In the last seven of eight national wage cases he has asked the wage and salary earners of this country to take no wage increases at all. This is one example of the things that the Prime Minister told us in 1975. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>If we are to have a debate on what was said in those days- if it is still relevant today- the Prime Minister also told us that it would be terrible to have the original Medibank scheme back because it would cost $600m. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> told us last month that reintroduction of the original Medibank scheme would cost $400m. Obviously, they have different people in their departments who are doing the arithmetic. But in November 1975 the Prime Minister of this country found it convenient to tell all the voters: &#39;We will maintain Medibank&#39;. That was a promise to the electorate to win the support of the majority of the people. He said: &#39;We will abide by indexation, we will support indexation and we will maintain Medibank&#39;. Where are those promises? It is not relevant to talk about what the present Leader of the Opposition said in 1975 and what he could have done. </para>
          <para>Let us consider something else that the Prime Minister told the people of Australia. He said: Only under the Liberals will everybody get a job&#39;. There were 230,000 people unemployed when he became Prime Minister. Today 390,000 people are unemployed. Where are the promises? How do they stand up when one compares what was said in 1975 with what is really occurring in 1979? I think people in Australia are entitled to be reminded about the promises that were made by this Government and the futility of its economic policies as they have been evolving from the last four Budgets of the Fraser Government. All the Budgets promised an economic miracle. </para>
          <para>When we had the land broker as Treasurer, the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> he told us that the Budget being introduced would solve all the economic problems of Australia. This is the fourth Budget of this Government. It is still promising the same thing. But now we have this unique economic situation in which we have rising inflation, rising interest rates and far higher unemployment. Where is the miracle evolving from any of the Liberal Party Budgets? Would someone please explain to the people of Australia when the miracle will occur? </para>
          <para>I give this warning: It will do no good for this Prime Minister to go to the next election campaign with promises. No one in Australia believes him. It will be no good saying at the next election campaign: &#39;Unemployment will drop, inflation will drop and interest rates will drop by 2 per cent over the next year&#39;. Even the three out often people who approve of the way he is doing his job at the moment do not believe him. They are just died in the wool Liberal voters hoping to hell that something will occur in Australia that will enable them to sustain their support for the Liberal-Country Party coalition. The performance of this Government has been miserable. </para>
          <para>Let us have a look at some of the things the Prime Minister said tonight in his speech on the Budget. The shape of things to come in 1979-80 is in the Budget. The shape of things to come is a minimum of 10 per cent inflation. That figure is incorporated in the Budget predictions and I will have more to say about that at 8 o&#39;clock. </para>

              <para>-Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was referring to some of the statements made by the present Prime Minister prior to and leading up to the 1975 and the 1977 elections and also to what he has said subsequently in relation to the Australian economy. The Prime Minister prided himself on being able to quote the present Leader of the Opposition in what he had said as the Treasurer of this country way back in 1975. When one looks at some of the things that the Prime Minister has said about indexation, Medibank, inflation and interest rates it is no wonder that just a few months ago a journalist wrote: </para>
            </talk.start>

          <quote>
            <para>The Prime Minister has never allowed his commitment to the truth to become obsessive. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that is correct. People throughout Australia no longer believe anything that the Prime Minister says because so many of the things which he has said have proved to be futile and just political rhetoric. </para>
          <para>I want to refer to some of the things he said this afternoon because they also are questionable in relation to the 1979-80 Budget. He said that the shape of things to come in this financial year are inherent in this Budget and in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard).</inline> It is evident from that speech that Australia will have a worse economic condition during 1 979-80 than it had in 1978-79. Unemployment will be much higher in Australia next year than it was last year. The Prime Minister said that Labor&#39;s plans to create jobs in Australia would cost a billion dollars. As I said, he has no commitment to the truth. But be that as it may, Australians should be asked whether they are prepared to spend a billion dollars on creating jobs, or do they want, as this Government is doing in this financial year, to spend $998m on unemployment benefits. We have the choice. We can do what is done in Sweden, Belgium, West Germany or in the United States of America. Alternatively, we can continue to throw the young people of this country on to the scrap heap. The Government by its own figures in the Budget expects that in the forthcoming year at least 325,000 people will be receiving the unemployment benefit. Just imagine, $ 1 billion is to be spent on unemployment benefits but no additional money, services or resources are to be put toward job creation. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister has made his position quite clear. He says that things cannot get better this financial year because of all the international factors; that he hopes that other governments throughout the Western world will do more to get inflation down; and that perhaps they could follow his lead. I remind the House that this Prime Minister is the very same person who said of the Labor Government in 1974 that international reasons had nothing to do with the condition of the Australian economy in that year. He is the very same person who said that our inflation problems, our unemployment problems of that period- the international recession- had nothing to do with the condition in which we found ourselves in 1973-74. All of a sudden, international reasons have something to do with inflation going back up to 10 per cent in Australia, with unemployment going back to over 500,000 early next year. The Prime Minister of the country will say anything for any reason and hope that some of the people in Australia will believe him. </para>
          <para>As I said at the outset of this speech, three out of every 10 Australians approve of the way in which the Prime Minister is doing his job. He takes pride in the figures announced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last Friday, which showed that there had been a slight fall in the unemployment figure for August. I remind the House that the unemployment figure for people between the ages of 15 and 19 went up by 7,000 and that 1 13,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 19 are registered as out of work. No rhetoric from the Prime Minister can disguise that fact. On average, those young people are out of work for 27 weeks. That is the duration of their unemployment as they search for work, and I will have much more to say about that later in my speech. </para>
          <para>As we all know, the Government has no policy on wages. Its attitude to wages is that everybody in Australia is being paid too much and the only way to overcome our economic problems is for wage earners who have no other form of income to be prepared to tighten their belts. But in relation to profitability, this Prime Minister has an open-skies policy. He told us in his speech this afternoon he was quite happy with the level of profitability of some of the major companies but it could go up even more. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy</inline> Speaker: Who in the Australian electorate will be prepared, after reading the financial pages of our newspapers outlining the skyrocketing profits of our major companies, to accept the Government&#39;s suggestion that there ought to be a cut in real wages? It is an unrealistic suggestion to put to wage and salary earners. It already has been rejected by the 700 delegates who assembled at the Dallas Brooks Hall in Melbourne yesterday and today at the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister said- and he prided himself on this-that our competitiveness had improved so substantially that we were able to build naval craft in Australia, but he neglected to tell this House the sorry story about this Government closing down the Newcastle and Whyalla shipyards. The reason there are 50 young people for every job vacancy at Whyalla in South Australia is directly attributable to the decision by this Government to close down the Whyalla shipyard. That is why there is such high unemployment at Whyalla, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> made no mention - </para>

              <para>-The Prime Minister could have told us the truth about Newcastle and Whyalla. He found it convenient not to tell us. I do not blame him.  His  decision has allowed those cities to fall into a sick and sorry state. He said- and he prided himself on this-that we were able to attract more foreign investment than some other countries. No other country in the Western world is prepared to allow foreign investors to rape their country like this Government is prepared to let them rape Australia. There is no better example of this than the overriding of the Labor Government decision that 50 per cent of the ownership of the Ranger uranium mine should remain in Australian hands. This Government has now decided that that should be sold overseas. For $300m this Government will sell an asset worth in the vicinity of $8 billion. Why would a foreign investor not want to purchase it? The  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> says that Australia has had 57 submissions from people who would like to buy our share of the Ranger mine. The Japanese want to buy it, the Americans want to buy it, the French want to buy it, and the British want to buy it. But this Government has no pride. This Government should say that the share in Ranger should belong to Australia. There is no pride in this Government in saying: &#39;What could we do with the assets from a site such as Ranger? What could we do with Australian ownership?&#39; Of course this Government will attract some foreign investors if it can reduce wages sufficiently, if it has very loose guidelines on the operation of foreign investment in this country and if it looks as though Australia is down on its knees- as this Government portrays its appearance to foreign investors. Of course it will attract more foreign investment than some other countries. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Prime Minister had the audacity to blame some of our inflation problems on oil prices. Who in this country is responsible for the price of motor spirit in Australia? It is not the Arab states. It is not the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. It is not any other group of countries. The decision was made directly by this Government. Australia produces over 90 per cent of its own requirements of motor spirit. In order to cook the books this Government decided on world parity for motor spirit. Everybody in Australia knows that it takes 60 per cent more fuel to fill up a car each week now than it did 14 months ago. It is no good the Prime Minister&#39;s coming into the House and saying that international reasons are to blame for that. The decision was taken in Australia by the Fraser Administration to raise funds to try to get down the deficit and Australians should reject it as a superficial policy. I am sure that they will do so. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister then told us that the Leader of the Opposition is irresponsible in talking about the return of some form of Medibank. He said that in 1975 Medibank cost $600m. Why did Medibank cost so much in 1 975? Again, the Prime Minister found it convenient not to tell the people of Australia that his direction to his members in the Senate was to reject the Medibank levy. The original Bill establishing the Health Insurance Commission provided that every wage and salary earner would pay a levy of 1 !6 per cent of his salary or wage in order to maintain his health insurance. At the direction of the present Prime Minister the Senate rejected the clause incorporating the levy in the hope that it would destroy Medibank. We did not introduce Medibank in order that the Governent could raise funds. We did not introduce it because we wanted to be bigger in the health insurance field than some of the private insurers. We introduced Medibank because 1.25 million Australians had no health insurance. We were not going to allow the present Prime Minister and his cohorts in the Senate to destroy Medibank by taking the levy provision out of the Bill. The ultimate removal of the levy cost $600m or in the vicinity thereof and it was directly attributable to the actions of the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister talked tonight of a 9 per cent inflation rate. He has great flexibility in his descriptions of inflation rates in Australia. Three weeks ago the Budget Papers told us that the inflation rate next year would be 1 0 per cent. The Prime Minister without any explanation has already reduced that rate by 1 per cent since the Budget Speech of the Treasurer just three weeks ago. It is less than a year since the Prime Minister of Australia told everybody in Australia that by the time in 1979 when the Budget was brought down the inflation rate would be 5 per cent. He told the Australian people that they could expect that inflation in the middle of 1979 would be 5 per cent. Where is the Prime Minister&#39;s explanation of what happened to that promise? Where is his commitment to the truth in telling the people of Australia last year about the inflation rate? As I said, he has great flexibility in telling us about the inflation rate. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister said tonight that the Opposition &#39;s arguments against the Budget were not real, that they were semantic. We have said that wage and salary earners should not be hoodwinked by the surcharge on taxation being taken off from 1 December. The Prime Minister tells us that there will be a great drop in income tax, that people will appreciate it and that we should not be so semantic. Neither the Prime Minister, the Treasurer nor anybody else sitting on the front bench of the government side of the Parliament can deny what both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eric</inline> Risstrom and the economic spokesman for the Labor Party, the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Willis)</inline> have said. If a person on a salary of about $8,000 a year- that is what the majority of wage earners in this country receivegets the 9 per cent wage increase anticipated in the Budget he will be paying 28 per cent more tax in 1979-80. A massive increase in personal taxation is what comes out of this Budget. What a farce it is to go through all the Prime Minister&#39;s rhetoric to get at the kernel of his argument about a drop in personal taxation. There is no drop. If the tax surcharge is taken off the taxation rates will only return to the rates that were applicable before this Government imposed the tax surcharge. There is no drop in the tax which is being paid by Australians. What the Prime Minister is doing to a certain extent is taking off the massive fine on wage and salary earners which he imposed 12 months ago. It was a temporary surcharge to be imposed for a few months. It has lasted 18 months. It will return to this Government about $900m from wage and salary earners. This is not a semantic argument. It is just that we on this side of the House like to speak the truth because we find it refreshing. I am sure that people outside the House also find it refreshing. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister talked as though we would have a competitive edge on all our competitors throughout the world because we have been able to reduce wages. There is no doubt- I will say more about this later- that the real wages of Australian workers have been reduced substantially, both by decisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the application of indirect taxation. Be that as it may, how ridiculous it is to hear the rhetoric of the Prime Minister trying to persuade Australians that we will be able to compete with all the industries being established throughout South East Asia. How ridiculous it is even to believe that we know what decisions are being made by multinational companies as they set up their subsidiaries throughout the Asian region to compete with their sister companies operating in Australia. Multinational companies do not make decisions on the basis of what is in the best interests of Australia. They make decisions on what is in the best interests of their companies. If it happens to suit a company to set up in Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines or anywhere else where it can persecute labour and get it as cheap as it possibly can it will do it and throw thousands of Australian workers on to the street. We need some honest statements from this Government about the problems we will face in the 1980s in a variety of industries. It is no good listening to the rhetoric of both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> We have to know what is achievable in Australia and what lies ahead. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister then referred to the decisions that the Labor Party made at its national conference. He said what a dreadful thing it was that the Labor Party was committed to two things. He said that the Labor Party was in favour of national superannuation. One would hardly be sent to the gas chambers for being in favour of national superannuation because the majority of people whom we represent do not have superannuation. We think it unfair that a substantial number of Australian people do not have superannuation. When they retire from employment they receive the old age pension, a payment which is in no way related to their standard of living when they were at work. The futility of this Government in not looking seriously at the question of national superannuation is being exploited by individual trade unions who are saying to their employers that one of the ways in which they will involve themselves in productivity gains is by setting up company trade union superannuation funds. I have said before and I will keep saying that there is no substitute for a national superannuation scheme. If it is good enough for the majority of white collar workers, if it is good enough for politicians and if it is good enough for the majority of Australians to have superannuation, it is good enough for everybody to have it. I would have been ashamed if the Labor Party at its conference in Adelaide had not adopted such a program as national superannuation. The sooner it is introduced the more justice we will have for all the people of this country. </para>
          <para>The other thing about the Adelaide conference that disturbed the Prime Minister was the decision to establish a national newspaper. For a person like the Prime Minister who visits the Fairfax organisation, the Murdoch organisation and the Herald and Weekly Times organisation so regularly I can understand that he finds that disturbing. But we do not find it disturbing. We believe that the service already given on radio and television by the Australian Broadcasting Commission is basically acceptable to all Australians. If this service is given in the visual or audio form of radio and television why would not the Australian people be prepared to see an independent objective newspaper produced to rival and compete with the newspapers put out by private interests in this country. We can see during any political campaign how the proprietors of the newspapers in this country line up in support of their conservative counterparts in the Parliament. An American journalist once said of America that it has a two-party system and a one-party Press. The same situation is true of Australia. I think many people in Australia are fed up with the situation. It would be well worth exploring whether, in conjunction with the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, we ought to have a national newspaper to do the same job and so compete with the newspapers of the private proprietors. If this was done, it would keep the private proprietors a lot more honest than they are at the moment. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister of course talked a lot about wages policy and said that the Opposition had no wage policy. Let me state quite categorically in relation to wages in this country, as the Prime Minister wants a very simple explanation, that since 1953 the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have supported cost of living flow on or indexation, if honourable members like to call it that. There has been no break in our policy since 1 953. At the 1979 conference of the Labor Party, we reaffirmed our policy by saying that, if one wants to come to terms with the work force of this country, if one wants to minimise industrial disputation, the government&#39;s position on wages must be clear. The Opposition&#39;s position on wages is clear. We would go to the Arbitration Commission and say that we support the flow on of the cost of living increases which have taken place in the preceding quarter. That is not difficult to explain. One would think that someone even as thick as the Prime Minister would understand it. But he wants it another way; he wants quite the opposite. </para>
          <para>Not only did he say in 1975 that his Party would support indexation but also did he send a couple of his Ministers to the indexation inquiry a fortnight ago- and what a package they took to the inquiry. What a lot of dopes the wage earners of Australia would have to be to accept such a proposition. The Prime Minister said that, if the wage earners of Australia are prepared to discount all government charges as they exist in the cost of living, the Government would support six-monthly flow ons of the cost of living and a productivity case in 1980. There has been no productivity case since 1973-74, so any increase in production in Australia- it has been quite substantial in that period- has not been shared by wage and salary earners. That was the Government&#39;s first argument. </para>
          <para>As its second argument, fancy the Government having the audacity to go to the indexation inquiry and to say to the trade union movement of this country that it can have the cost of living increases passed on every six months but not including health insurance charges or the increases in petrol. In this financial year those two issues are likely to make up approximately 4 per cent of the total cost of living increases. For the trade union movement to accept that argument it would have to say: &#39;Inflation is going up by 10 per cent, but if you give us something like a 5.5 per cent increase in wages we will be really happy. Congratulations to the Prime Minister for thinking up such a splendid idea&#39;. That is totally unacceptable to the wage and salary earners of this country. The Government ought to have realised this fact before it put that futile proposition to the wage and salary earners of this country at the indexation inquiry. </para>
          <para>I now refer to the Prime Minister&#39;s comments about South Australia. He told us that South Australia is looking down the barrel because we are not going to exploit Roxby Downs. As I said in a personal explanation after Question Time today, the feasibility study on Roxby Downs will be completed in 1982 by Western Mining Corporation Ltd. That company is not sure what is involved in Roxby Downs. But be that as it may, the whole furore over Roxby Downs is perhaps that we will not mine uranium. The people of South Australia are not in accord with the views being expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court in his talks with the Prime Minister, or with Joh Bjelke-Petersen in his talks with the Prime Minister about the establishment of enrichment plants and as a probable follow-up the establishment of nuclear power stations in Australia. The Opposition does not believe international safeguards are there for us to say responsibly that those sorts of things can occur. The Corcoran Government stands by that decision. </para>
          <para>What a ridiculous argument the Prime Minister uses in terms of what should happen and what is not happening in South Australia. We have the unfortunate feature of the work force in Australia that for every job vacancy there are 25 people out of work. Under this Government, we have seen unemployment grow by 150,000. Next to Italy, Australia has the highest youth unemployment. Last Sunday, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> and the Prime Minister put out statements saying that things were dreadful in South Australia. Let me remind members opposite that there are more young people out of work in the Minister&#39;s electorate of Stirling for every job vacancy than in South Australia.  His  home State of Western Australia, which he never seems to comment upon, has double the national average of numbers unemployed to every job vacancy. The problem of unemployment is not a South Australian problem; the unemployment problem is one for all Australia. I quote from an excellent document which has been prepared by the Catholic bishops, because if I said it, the idiot son of the Establishment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baillieu,</inline> would say that it was not true - </para>

              <para>- I withdraw it. This is an excellent document entitled <inline font-style="italic">Beyond Unemployment</inline> which I recommend to every member of this Parliament. It is a statement on human labour prepared by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace for the Catholic bishops of Australia. I do not think the Catholic bishops of Australia could be described as a gang of radicals trying to upset equilibrium in the Australian economy. They now tell us- perhaps if we had had more brains we could have thought of the comment ourselves- that if all the unemployed people of Australia were put in one spot it would be the sixth largest city in Australia. The sixth largest city in Australia would be the place whose population would equate the number of unemployed. That is something for this Government to be really proud of. When this Government came to power, there were 230,000 people out of work. In May 1979, 394,000 people were out of work according to the figures being used. In the ratio of vacancies to unemployed, there were 1 8 people <inline font-style="italic">out of</inline> work for every job vacancy. That figure is now even higher. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The work done by the bishops and the Catholic Church goes further. It shows that the burden of unemployment is not being shared equally by people throughout Australia. If one looks at the suburbs of high unemployment, one finds that the working people are carrying the greatest share of the burden. In the Sydney area in Hornsby, the unemployment rate per job vacancy is 1.69 per cent. In Mount Druitt the figure is 1 3.46 per cent. In Melbourne, in the suburb of Waverley, the figure is 2.45 per cent. In the suburb of Sunshine the figure is 9.37 per cent. In the Brisbane suburbs, the figure is 12.63 per cent at Inala and at Indooroopilly the figure is 4.64 per cent. In the Adelaide suburbs the figure is 13.7 per cent at Elizabeth and 5.3 per cent at Unley. In the Perth suburb of Girrawheen the figure is 13.3 per cent and in Claremont the figure is 6.6 per cent. From the figures we can see that the problem of unemployment is one that is spreading all over Australia. Yet this miserable government, in the hope that it might attract a few votes in South Australia next Saturday, says that the problem of South Australia is within the borders of South Australia. </para>
          <para>How ridiculous that statement is because in this document the bishops also point out that the indiscriminate use of the investment allowance, which costs this Government hundreds of millions of dollars, has put people out of work because it has allowed companies to introduce new technology which they did not need for years. New technology bought with taxpayers money, might have helped these companies make more profits, but it has put thousands of people out of work in Australia. Yet the Prime Minister said that unemployment dropped 12,000 last month. We have 400,000 unemployed. Try with a row boat to save 400,000 people from drowning. That is what the Prime Minister is trying to do. It is an absolutely disgraceful situation. The blame can be laid at only one door; that of the Prime Minister of Australia. In this Budget the biggest cut in any program was the 69 per cent cut in the Special Youth Employment Training Program. By the Government&#39;s own figures, 45,000 young people under 24 years of age are to be denied employment because of this 69 per cent, or over $50m, cut in the Special Youth Employment Training Program. This Budget is a hoax. We are going to have higher inflation and higher unemployment. The sooner the Government goes to the polls so that the people of Australia can kick it out, the better. We need a government that is concerned about people, not profits. </para>

            <para>-The Budget presented by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> on 2 1 August is an economically responsible document. It continues the Government&#39;s uncompromising attack on inflation and is designed to overcome the difficulties which have bedevilled the Australian economy for so long. I agree with the Treasurer that the Budget debate is an occasion not only to review the course of the economy but also to assess prospects and problems for the year ahead. Today I wish to draw to the attention of the House and the Government a serious problem which has faced us for some time and yet has remained unresolved. It is a problem that the Treasurer should understand. It is the problem of how to make ends meet when you are taxed unfairly and provided with precious little assistance towards the cost of maintaining those dependent upon us. Many of the questions I have asked in this House and many of the speeches I have made have demonstrated my deep concern for the well-being of Australia&#39;s families and of the children in their care. I have called for a national family policy; I have urged the use of family impact statements; I have called for increased family allowances; and I have advocated tax reform in the interests of families. Members will therefore not be surprised that I am using this opportunity tonight to call upon the Government to relieve the desperate plight of many hundreds of thousands of families with dependent children, especially those with only a single income. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Canberra government is remote. To the majority of people it seems, and often is, removed from the day-to-day problems of Australian families. The unique responsibility of a back bench member of this Parliament is, according to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> to bring to Canberra the concerns, hopes and aspirations of our fellow Australians. In a recent electorate talk he reaffirmed, firstly, his view that the Cabinet has no mortgage on wisdom and, secondly, his insistence on the need for an effective government members&#39; committee system. He said: &#39;It is through this system that all those who support the Government are able to contribute to the central decision-making process of government&#39;. I have been  chairman  of a working party set up by one of these committees. The task we were given was to examine proposals for the reform of income tax and income support schemes now operating in this country. Our work has been comprehensive and thorough. We have identified the principles we have thought should be followed and we have formulated very detailed proposals for the consideration of the Government. My colleagues and I were pleased recently to receive the assurance of the Treasurer- a public assurance- that the proposals of the working party for overcoming the tax disadvantage of single income families would continue to receive very close study by the Government. I hope that it will give similar attention to a number of other important proposals including those which, if accepted, will result in increased family allowances and the abolition of the pension income test. </para>
          <para>Tonight I want to concentrate on a matter that the Treasurer is studying. In summary, it is the proposal that spouses should be allowed, if they wish, to split their incomes for tax purposes and be taxed as if they were in a partnership under which the income is shared equally. It is a proposal which has wide support. When its general concept was reported in the Press I received letters of support from all parts of Australia. There is a steady stream of favourable comment on radio talkback programs and in letters to the editors of newspapers. A recent gallup poll showed that 64 per cent of the Australian community favoured the proposal. Over recent months I have often been asked: How can it be achieved without costing the Government more than it can afford and without increased taxation for many? Tonight I will explain how it can be done without raising anyone&#39;s tax, or by increasing only the tax payable by those on high incomes who are now paying less than their fair share. So that concerned members of the public can analyse the proposal I must give some technical details. I therefore apologise to those who enjoy the more entertaining type of speech on the Budget. </para>
          <para>This proposal was formulated because of our concern for Australia&#39;s families. The problem of family income support for children should not be confused with the relief of absolute poverty. Although there has been an undeniable increase in living standards for every Australian, a disproportionate part of that increase has accrued to households without children. The relative position of families with children, especially those with only one income, compared with other households, is worse today than it has been for a long time. The introduction of the family allowances and the tax changes in 1 975-76 were positive steps in the right direction. But except for these moves the erosion of public support for families has continued for at least two decades. Their position is continuing to deteriorate rapidly. As a country we lag behind many others in family policies and family income support. The financial pressures facing families are insufficiently recognised. For many the situation is now desperate. The need for action is urgent. Reform is a necessity. If we are to give families the support they need we must establish the goals we wish to pursue. Then we must take bold, imaginative and inovative steps to achieve them. </para>
          <para>Welfare politics in Australia today is currently dominated by powerful lobby groups representing the interests of the aged, the invalid and the veteran. Likewise, tax politics is dominated by powerful groups which seem to care more for general tax reduction than the attainment of a fairer and more equitable tax system. This insensitivity to fairness and equity is perhaps due to the fact that many of their supporters are able to minimise their tax liability under the present system. Family lobby groups must become more influential and press more strongly the interests of the family, so that tax and social security policies are reformed. The aim of these policies should be to ensure that the standard of living of a family with children compares favourably, or at least not intolerably badly with a family with no dependent children or with that of a single income man or woman. Until now, the Australian system of taxation and social security has had comparatively little effect on levelling out the fluctuations in income requirements associated with an individual &#39;s family life cycle. For some time the principle of social justice has not been explicitly recognised in the Australian wage system. In 1 974, the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission made it quite clear that the Commission does not see itself as a social welfare agency. He also declared that it was the Commission&#39;s view that &#39;the care of family needs is principally a task for governments&#39;. Notwithstanding this clear statement, governments, both Liberal and Labor, have gone on pretending to themselves and to the public that a breadwinner&#39;s wage is adequate, firstly, to keep a family with children above some ill-defined poverty line and, secondly, to enable it to cope with the increasingly expensive task of giving children a fair start in life. </para>
          <para>Our tax and social security systems must not be used only to safeguard individuals and families against unpredictable and catastrophic loss of income or to enable the chronically disadvantaged to maintain a decent standard of living; they must also be used to assist individuals and families to redistribute their lifetime income from the peaks of relative affluence to those periods of relative poverty which are today putting families under so much stress. It is only by considering the systems of taxation and social security together that rational and equitable results can be achieved. So long as the two systems are separate and one is based on the individual and the other on the family unit, no patching up will be successful and our income support arrangements will be more costly than they should be and our taxation system will remain unfair. </para>
          <para>The present tax and social security system contains many serious inequities and mean anomalies. They are too numerous for me to mention tonight. To overcome them we must harmonise and where possible integrate the two systems. The first essential step is to use a common unit of assessment for determining tax liability and entitlement to cash payments. The unit we adopt should be one which takes into account the situation of those who pay, those who receive and many who do both, not only as individuals but also as members of families or households. This we should do because the welfare of any individual is a function not so much of his own income but of the combined income of the family or household of which he or she is a member. </para>
          <para>The major problem of our present system of taxation is that families of the same composition and total income are required to pay substantially different amounts in tax. At present, a family&#39;s tax liability is not assessed according to taxable capacity. It is largely determined by the proportions in which each spouse earns the family income. Two-income families pay much less tax than the family in which one spouse is the only breadwinner. For example, single-income families with incomes under $16,608 pay $707 a year or $13.60 a week more in tax than twoincome families with the same family income. Where the household income rises that tax advantage in favour of the two-income family rises to $60 a week. Families paying the top rate of tax, if they can split their income, can save up to $7,500 a year. The present tax system is one of the chief causes of relative poverty and even hardship experienced by the majority of families with children. It takes insufficient account of family commitments. It regards most expenditure of a dependent spouse and dependent children as a way in which taxpayers choose to enjoy their after-tax income and not as a measure of the increased needs of the family or its reduced taxable capacity. It does not treat families alike. Surely the taxation system should be neutral, unless special tax incentives are intentionally being used to influence people in the way they behave. A family should be taxed according to its ability to pay. The proportion in which the income is received by one or both of its breadwinners should be largely irrelevant. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer himself has stated publicly that the present taxation system falls far short of the objectives of equity. Although I know he would like to, apart from a few band-aid cures, economic conditions so far have not yet enabled him to tackle the major causes of taxpayer revolt. It is wrong that tax cuts should be available to those who can arrange their affairs so that they can split their family income but denied to those who cannot or choose not to do so. In spite of the glaring inequities of the present system there are many defenders of the status quo. They may press for tax cuts across the board, thinking that that will help. Tax cuts given in this way will not provide the answer to the problem facing family taxpayers. It is essential that any future reductions in the community&#39;s income tax burden should be the result of tax reform rather than across-the-board tax cuts. In this year&#39;s Budget the Government decided to reduce rates of tax by abolishing the 1.5 per cent surcharge from 1 December. Whether to abolish the surcharge or to restore indexation or to reform the tax structure involved a political decision. </para>
          <para>I must say that had it been my decision I would have made the bold, imaginative, and in some respects tough decision to bring equity back into the tax system. The Budget outcome would have been the same. The deficit would have been as proposed by the Treasurer but the structure of the tax system would have been altered. Spouses would have been allowed, if they wished, to split their incomes for tax purposes. The desired overall level of income tax collections would have been achieved by sensibly reviewing and appropriately adjusting tax thresholds and tax rates. The special position of taxpayers who live alone and that of sole parents would have been recognised. </para>
          <para>Had such a reformed taxation system operated from 1 December, the standard rate of tax could have been reduced to the level proposed in the Budget and the tax-free income available to taxpayers with dependent spouses and those living alone could have been raised to the level that would have applied had those levels been indexed. Substantial tax cuts would have benefited those taxpayers whose needs are greatest and those whose taxpaying capacity is now heavily overburdened. Some taxpayers, mainly those in the higher income brackets, would have been liable for increased taxation. This would have been necessary on grounds of fairness and would have resulted in two-income families paying the same proportion of their incomes in tax as singleincome families. </para>
          <para>Because there are many who are reluctant to embrace a reform which has an adverse paypacket effects on some taxpayers even though it would give substantial tax cuts to the deserving, consideration of the proposed reform was deferred. In view of this reluctance there appears little chance of these far-reaching and just reforms being introduced in one move. But optional family income splitting could be phased in. This must now be done and it must be done before general indexation is restored, lt should be well known to all that I am a strong advocate of the principle of tax indexation. It imposes a valuable discipline on governments. It keeps them honest, it requires them to legislate for tax increases and prevents them from using inflation as a substitute. But the introduction of indexation in 1976 was premature and it was an outmoded and inequitable tax system inherited from the previous government, that was indexed. As a result, reform has been retarded; but now that indexation has been suspended, let us keep it that way until we have a tax system that is fair to all taxpayers and seen to be fair by them all; otherwise, tax minimisation will and should become the proper concern of every family. There are no grounds on which those who put their family&#39;s interests first in this way can be called tax avoiders, except perhaps by those who are blind to the inequities of the present tax system. </para>
          <para>In phasing in reform, we should have two aims: Firstly to reform the tax scales in such a way that no taxpayer pays more tax on the same money income that he does under the present tax scales, and secondly to reduce progressively the proportion of income paid by single-income families by way of tax until it matches the proportion which is now paid by two-income families with the same household income. These two objectives can be achieved by the selective reintroduction of indexation. At first, indexation should be applied only to the assessment of tax payable by families who are disadvantaged by the present tax law, sole parents and taxpayers living alone. Selective indexation should continue for a new optional family tax scale until it places single-income families in the same position as two-income households who split their incomes under the present arrangements. Taxpayers living alone should have a tax free income 20 per cent higher than that which is now the standard tax threshold and sole parents should have a threshold 40 per cent higher than the standard threshold. </para>
          <para>The phasing in of these reforms would be facilitated by the introduction of a new optional family tax scale. Under it, spouses, if they consider it to be to their advantage, would be given the option of being taxed on a notional partnership basis. At the present time, the per capita income of a taxpayer and his dependent spouse which is tax-free, is $2,837 compared with $3,893 per capita for members of a family splitting their income. At current inflation rates, indexation on the optional family tax scale without interruption since the last adjustment would mean that, within three years, the amount of tax-free income available to all families would be unaffected by the proportions in which the spouses earn the family income. </para>
          <para>Within this period also, those living alone and those who are sole parents would have a tax-free income in the correct relationship. As the thresholds in the new family income tax scale rose as a consequence of indexation, at first 1 V4 million single income households would receive substantial tax cuts and later more would do so. The benefit would go first to those who are low income families and their gain would be proportionately greatest. However, if the Government were to index the tax scales it could accelerate the rate at which the new family tax system was brought into operation, or it could use that revenue to increase substantially and maintain the real value of family allowances. Only when reforms of this kind have been adopted will families be given a chance of having a fair go. </para>

            <para>- This Budget is a practical extension of the politics of deceit which has been traditionally practised by this Government. Nobody in Australia believes that this Budget will lead to economic recovery or that it will solve the problems of inflation or unemployment in either the short term or the long term. We do know, and it is clearly demonstrable from the Budget documents of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> and his supplementary statements, that he expects inflation to get worse. He will not deny the probability that interest rates will rise before Christmas, and even the most stern apologists for this Government admit that currently within Australia some 410,000 people are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as seeking jobs. If one adds the figure indicated in the Norgard reportnamely, that 30 per cent of the unemployed do not register with the CES- then hidden unemployment in Australia means that as a result of four years of occupation of the treasury benches by this Government we are now looking at more Australians out of work than the peak of 477,000 which was reached during the Great Depression in 1933. </para>

          <para>The fact that the unemployed receive their benefits through the post has eliminated the dole queue, but it has not eliminated the anguish and the suffering of hundreds of thousands of decent Australians who simply want a job, or the plight of those thousands of families whose breadwinners are unemployed, who live below the poverty line and whose suffering prompted a significant and important statement by the Catholic bishops of Australia. The compassion which was shown in that statement was certainly not echoed, or even acknowledged, by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in his statement to the House today. The fact is that the Prime Minister and his colleagues, who told the people of Australia over four years ago that running the economy was really as simple as turning on the lights, now find themselves, after four years in government and with a majority in both Houses- the longest uninterrupted period in office of any government since the Menzies Government- with the greatest level of unemployment since the Depression. This cowboy Prime Minister, with his penchant for fast cars and his very own jet aeroplane, is leading Australia into the great depression of the 1980s. Whilst it is undoubtedly true that unemployment is currently a world-wide phenomenon bedevilling all Western based capitalist economies, on world standards Australia&#39;s unemployment level is amongst the highest of those countries with our level of wealth and industrial development. </para>
          <para>In his Budget statement today the Prime Minister not only failed to provide the answers but also indicated a monumental incapacity even to ask the right questions. He just reeled out the same tired old rhetoric. All that has changed in this, his fourth year in office, is the major argument. On the occasion of this Budget, whom do we blame? We do not blame this Government! We blame the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the declining state of the world economy! I am bound to say that the Prime Minister did not abandon altogether all of his past arguments. It is at least a step forward to see that not even the Prime Minister, or any other member of the Government, so far has tried to advance the dole bludger myth, which of course was part of the general level of propaganda under which they came into office- the view that if people are unemployed it is their own fault. Not even members of this Government are prepared to argue, in the face of existing statistics, that that is the case. However, in the Treasurer&#39;s statement we did see the other proposition not completely abandoned by this Government; that is, that wage increases and union demands are the cause of unemployment, or, to put it simply, one man&#39;s wage increase is another man&#39;s job. This argument ignores the fact that most of the wage claims of 1974 were to catch up to prices that had already risen If this thesis had any merit, how is it that by mid- 1978, when real wage overhand had almost entirely disappeared, the labour market continued to deteriorate? </para>
          <para>Then, of course, there is the Fraser thesis that it is really the private sector versus the public sector. In 1975 the Prime Minister promised that he would restore full employment by the simple process of cutting back on government spending which he claimed would release resources to the private sector, which in turn would use them to create employment opportunities. Since 1975 private sector unemployment has grown more than that of the public sector. Manufacturing, which is conducted almost entirely by the private sector, saw 155,200 become jobless between 1974 and February 1977. </para>
          <para>Finally, when all else has failed we still have the exercise which continues on a daily basis in this Parliament- that of rigging the statistics. This Government has continually tried to juggle the figures on unemployment and to time the release of statistics so as to minimise community awareness of the extent and nature of unemployment. With all the resources that are available to this Parliament and this Government, it is incredible to see from the debates that have taken place thus far that honourable members on both sides of the House are still arguing about the figures. I would have thought that any government which was concerned about unemployment could at least produce a set of statistics which was beyond argument. This Government has not been concerned to do that. This Government has been concerned to minimise and stack the figures so that the people of Australia will not realise the true dimension of unemployment. </para>
          <para>I think that it is true, and that this Parliament has to face the fact, that the great world boom period of the 1 960s is finished and that it is true that Australia is not merely into a period of cyclic recession. The great advance in technology- the computer revolution- means that whole areas of traditional training in white collar employment are rapidly becoming redundant. This is occurring at &#34;a time when no meaningful policy of manpower training, or even significant worker education, is emerging from within the ranks of this Government. Equally it is occurring at a time when Australia&#39;s economic development is increasingly being dominated by the operation of transnational companies whose size, economic strength, ownership of technology and resources give them more naked economic power than that of many nation states, with a capacity not merely to dominate the market place but also to destroy the myth of the freedom of the market place- a myth much beloved by this Prime Minister and this Treasurer. </para>
          <para>There is increasing evidence that these companies, which are forming such a large and significant factor in determining the fate of the Australian economy, are involved in transferring manufacturing capacity from high wage countries to low wage areas in Asia, not merely with a subsequent loss of employment opportunities but more importantly with a sacrifice of work experience and traditional skills. This process is only beginning in Australia, but it has played a significant part in unemployment statistics in the United States. I found it to be something almost bordering on the unbelievable that the Prime Minister of Australia could get up in this Parliament today and seek to belittle a decision of a Labor Party conference which adopted the policy that the Labor Party in office would monitor, check and make available to the government of the day, information about the nature, extent and control of our economy by transnational corporations. To the Prime Minister that was an incomprehensible suggestion. What is incomprehensible is that the Prime Minister who does have some responsibilities in this matter is unaware that the OECD countries after two years of very substantial negotiations, research, monitoring and information gathering, have in the course of only the last few weeks reached agreement and produced a code of conduct to monitor the activities of transnational companies operating in Europe. </para>
          <para>It is extraordinary that the Prime Minister in belittling and demeaning Labor Party policy that these activities ought to be investigated and subject to report, should have made the statements that he did. He did so in ignorance of the fact that in 1973, in the home of private enterprise, the United States of America, the Congressional Senate Finance Committee examined this problem: The implications of the multinational firm for world trade and investment for United States trade and labour. </para>

              <para>- I shall. It might enlighten the honourable gentleman. Testimony was given to that Committee and I will give the honourable gentleman the reference. The American Federation of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organisations testified that between 1966 and 1971 American-based multinationals transferred over 900,000 jobs based on union wage rates in the United States to low wage areas in Asia. No one can say that that would not have a significant impact on a country the size of the United States. If American-based companies are prepared to do that in their own community, then we in Australia ought to be having some regard to the impact that they may have in our own community. This was part of the evidence given by George Meany. No one could accuse Meany of being a young radical. As a spokesman for the AFL-CIO he said: </para>

            <para>The transfer of production overseas is making the United States a nation of hamburger stands- a country stripped of industrial capacity and meaningful work ... a service economy ... a nation of citizens busily buying and selling cheeseburgers and root beer floats. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On behalf of the AFL-CIO he went on to name the companies. He went on to name the jobs and the technology that was being exported from the United States to low wage areas in Asia. Confronted with that evidence, plus the fact that the United Nations itself has had for some years, as part of its permanent operations, a standing committee examining and reporting on proper codes of conduct in the operation of transnational corporations, is it not an action of political and industrial responsibility for any political party to say that any government that cares about the future control of its own economy ought to be monitoring those actions? That is all that the Labor Party did and it was the subject of very strong condemnation from the Prime Minister with his narrow, Tory-tunnel vision. The Prime Minister and the Government would reject that proposition out of hand. </para>
          <para>The Government has chosen to play the role of the economic Quisling in the Australian society. As far as it is concerned, any transnational company that is prepared to wave a fistfull of dollars in the face of this Prime Minister can buy whatever it wants. It can develop and abuse the resources of this country in any way it likes. I believe that it is time that the Governments role in our economy, and the capacity not only of the Government but also of this Parliament to play some meaningful role in the future development of our economy, were closely assessed. </para>
          <para>Like other members of the Opposition, I reject this Budget. We are talking about this nation&#39;s most important resource. I have heard the Prime Minister talk about our mineral and agricultural resources, but I want to place on record that in my view our most important resource is the Australian people. The present Prime Minister not only accepts the highest unemployment figure in the history of this country, but also is prepared to make that a permanent feature of the Australian society whether one likes it or not. If one looks at the Budget documents and what the Budget is doing to Australian society one can reach the conclusion only that this Budget lays the foundation for the great depression of the 1980s. A generation of young Australians are to be sacrificed to meet the odd economic theories of the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>The community must ask itself and we in this Parliament must ask ourselves whether any nation can survive with the human wastage that is involved in over 500,000 people being unemployed. That is the one issue that the Prime Minister and the Government have not faced up to in this Budget debate. One may talk about tax dodgers and unions, but the real question has not been answered: What is this Government&#39;s policy to tackle and reduce the problem of unemployment? To take it further, I say that the community must ask itself and we in this Parliament must ask ourselves very seriously whether we have to try to mould our people to meet the needs of the economic system or whether, with the great resources and wealth of this nation, we are prepared to restructure the economic system to develop this nation&#39;s most precious resourceits people. </para>
          <para>Given the problems of the cyclic recession, given the downturn right throughout the western world, given the advent of technology and given the increasing domination of our own economy by transnational corporations which have shown that their major duty is to multiply their profitsthey do not operate with any sense of national duty to this Government or to this nation and this has been the experience that has been monitored and on which there is a pile of evidence- I do not believe that this Budget or this Government can wrestle with the problem of unemployment and can look at getting our people back to meaningful and useful jobs unless there is by government a massive intervention in the economy. The view that the economy will regulate itself by leaving it to the free play of market forces in this day and age is economic nonsense. I say to this House that we ought to reject this Budget. We ought to reject the permanent dole mentality which is the underlying thesis of the Budget and we ought to reject the politics of deceit which has been perpetrated on the people of this country and on this Parliament by the Prime Minister. </para>

Where do the jobs come from? They do not come from the social services field; they are false jobs. People want proper employment. Where does the strength of the economy come from? It comes from business, both small and large. Why would we not have a businessman&#39;s Budget?

          <para class="block">Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd to build a replacement vessel for the Royal Australian Navy. Competitive costs enabled that Australian firm to win the contract. I would like the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> to note that I am commending the unions concerned for their assurance of support in maintaining good industrial relations at Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard and their offer to assist the company in recruiting expert staff in order that that naval vessel can be completed at the earliest opportunity. That is the sort of attitude that should be espoused by the Labor Party and by the ACTU, as well as all the cockatoos and screamers who are trying to talk down the economy and to give the lie to the fact that Australia is well on the way to recovering economically. This Budget sets the stage for giving Australia a lead in world economic recovery. In a recent edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Christian Science Monitor</inline> this comment appeared: </para>

            <para>It is hard to be pessimistic about Australia&#39;s economic future. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, it is hard to be pessimistic about Australia&#39;s economic future. It must be getting increasingly hard for the Leader of the Labor Party and its supporters to keep on talking down Australia, talking down the economy and talking down the development of this great nation. That is particularly so in view of what the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> have told us in this House. Only today the Prime Minister said that the expansion of aluminium projects would involve the expenditure of $4 billion, while expansion in the coal industry would involve the expenditure of $2 billion. </para>
          <para>Therefore, I ask the question: Where is Australia going? The Opposition is crying out that the national economy is failing. Its cry has been parroted by some of the media. Why are they not interested in the future of this great land, this well endowed nation? I just do not know the answer to that question. What are they trying to do? Why do they not live somewhere else? Why do they not live in the countries which they praise? If Australia is worth living in, it certainly is worth fighting for in every way. In the light of these constant and often quite erroneous attacks the future of the nation could be viewed with unease by overseas companies which are willing to invest in developmental projects of the size and type which I have mentioned. </para>
          <para>I come back to a matter about which we have heard all day and, for that matter, for some days. Why does not the Labor Government in South Australia get on with the Olympic Lake project? It has dogmatically refused to have anything to do with uranium and, although a mint of copper and gold happens to be tied up in the Roxby Downs project, it is not to go ahead. The South Australian Labor Government says that the project is being looked at and so on, but that is just one instance of where Labor could get in behind private enterprise and help employment and help the whole economic situation. Apparently Roxby Downs is one of the major mineral deposits in the world. </para>
          <para>It is time for a strengthening of Australia&#39;s national spirit. We as a nation should be taking stock and deciding where we are going. Are the people, from top to bottom, prepared to snap out of it, to decide whether this country is what it was in days gone by; whether it is what we fought for- the honourable member for Wills, who is just leaving, would know what I am talking about- and whether it is the place that we would all hope it would be? We have the assets. An era of prosperity is about to begin for all Australians. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding)</inline> said that an era of depression is about to descend upon us. I do not think that he is correct. But such an era of prosperity requires an awareness by us and a willingness for us all to be in it. For those who sit back and reckon that Australia and the world in general owe them a living it is time to start rethinking, to start considering employment. </para>
          <para>Why do we continually have a rush of figures being produced to mislead everyone as to Australia&#39;s future? I do not know. But it certainly is worth picking up the ball and running with it because we certainly have the ball right at our feet now. So why do the Labor leaders and others continue on this course? Why do we have consistent leaks of policy matters and other important affairs? Surely all those people who do those things are working against their own country. They should be trying to make this country, our country, a leader, a strong nation financially so that we can serve ourselves and all the people whom the Labor Party screams about- the aged, the unemployed or whomever. We would also be able to serve those in our own area, our Association of South East Asian Nations neighbours, for instance and those people in distress overseas. But we cannot do all these things that we should be doing unless our economy is in a very sound and strong condition. Of course we should also be strong militarily. The youth of Australia should realise that they have to do something about their own country. I do not mean that they should shoulder arms and go marching into the desert or the swamps or whatever, but they should realise that they have to serve their country, whether they serve in the Forces or whether they serve their next door neighbour. That is what they should be all about and that is why I am saying we should now be looking to see which way we are going. </para>
          <para>As I said before, Australia should be able to assist our near neighbours. This Budget leads the way with its incentives and with its attack on inflation, which is the key to unemployment. But this approach needs national team work. The Australian Council of Trade Unions made a statement regarding the construction of the Durance class naval vessel at the Vickers Cockatoo dockyard. I applaud that action and I only hope that the ACTU sticks with it. I urge Australia and all Australians to decide where they are going, where this nation is. It is becoming more and more obvious, with the way things are heading around the world right now, especially across the Indian Ocean, that we may be on our own before many years have passed. We should realise this and grasp the opportunities which now, at this time, are ours. They may not be ours in a few years to come. </para>
          <para>I support this Budget. Before I resume my seat, I would like to say something about the remarks of Labor members. I point out to the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young),</inline> who was screaming about unemployment, that unemployment more than doubled in just over two years, between 1973 and 1975. What happened to inflation during the Labor Party&#39;s term of office? As I said before, inflation rose from just under 5 per cent to 17 per cent. As we heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Denis</inline> Healey, inflation is the great enemy of employment. During Labor&#39;s nationally criminal reign, 1973-75, that is how inflation rose. From 1976 to 1979 inflation was reduced from 17 per cent to less than 9 per cent. Instead of inflation being 5 per cent over the OECD figure, the Government reduced inflation to about 3Vi per cent under that figure, which is where it is now. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Port Adelaide made the outrageous statement that the Government was going to sell its share in Ranger overseas. I cannot remember whether the honourable member said that the figure was $300m or $600m, but it was an amount such as that. He went on to say that if the Government&#39;s share were to be sold, it should be sold for a billion or more. That is a ridiculous statement for a party which only last week totally opposed and still totally opposes the mining and selling of uranium. The Labor Party now castigates the Government regarding its Ranger ownership policy. Labor bought 50 per cent of the Ranger take in exchange for a payment of 72.5 per cent of the capital expenditure, which would be at public expense. So the Government&#39;s presence in the Ranger set up has certainly assisted the selling strategy. But by way of the ill-informed land rights Act the development has been frustrated. However, I will say more on that at some other time. </para>
          <para>It is the Government&#39;s duty to check the demand for that continued expenditure of public funds- the 72.5 per cent of the capital, as I said before. The honourable member for Port Adelaide stands in this House and reels off these figures; but they are wrong. The Government has made no decision on the Ranger uranium deal. Forty-odd firms, including many Australian firms, have signified a willingness to purchase the Government&#39;s share. If the Government does sell any part or all of its interest I urge it to do so to an Australian concern. With those remarks that I have mentioned, can one believe Labor&#39;s misrepresentations? The honourable member for Port Adelaide said that the Australian Labor Party speaks the truth. That is utter rubbish! In saying that, I support the Budget. </para>

          <para>This Budget is a clear confession of failure. On the question of unemployment, like many of the promises this Government has made since 1 974, it has a track record about as barren as the Sahara desert. This Budget clearly reflects the Government&#39;s total lack of initiative. Nowhere is this Government&#39;s incompetence and bankruptcy more evident than in the field of energy. The Government&#39;s mismanagement of the energy policy over the past <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> years has been a disaster. The answer is simple. The Government abdicated its responsibility in the critical area by leaving all major energy decisions to the oil companies. Let us be frank about this: This Government&#39;s sole interest in the oil industry has been to rip off as much money as it can to finance its ballooning deficit. In the current financial year Australian refineries will pay over $3,000m for crude oil which is produced in this country. Of this the Government will get about $2,223m. Consumers throughout the length and breadth of this country will carry that burden of the cost. </para>
          <para>One of the Government&#39;s first acts in 1976 after it came into office was to reject out of hand the major recommendations of the Royal Commission on Petroleum. Perhaps its most important recommendation was the establishment of an agency to regulate the oil industry. Apart from leaving major decisions to the oil companies the Government deliberately downgraded what little oil expertise it had within the Bureau of Mineral Resources and Government departments. It also deliberately reduced the monitoring of oil company activities. It massively slashed public spending on public transport. It was predictable after the events in Iran and the oil squeeze that international oil companies would play every trick in the book to maximise profits. They have done that for 130 years. The primary role of all corporations is to produce profits, not oil. Their responsibility is to their shareholders, not to the Australian Government. For instance, if a tanker of crude oil originally destined for Australia can be diverted to the United States of America or Europe for a much larger profit on the spot market why should oil companies overlook a windfall profit and supply Australia instead? What loyalty do companies owe to Australian governments, indeed to any government? </para>
          <para>While the rest of the industrialised world has been building its stocks of oil as a buffer against future dislocation of oil supply, in Australia oil stocks have fallen to a virtually non-existent level. The Government has no idea of exactly what our storage capacity is, what our stocks of each product held are. It is obliged to ask the oil companies. In March 1978 I asked the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> for details of sales of fuel oil outside the capital cities of Australia. The following September he replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Detailed information concerning individual companies is not available to the Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Not only is this information unavailable to the Government but also the Government has deliberately endeavoured to keep itself ignorant of vital information about the oil industry. The need for an adequate stockpile of fuel oil is critical. As a trading nation we are almost completely dependent on imported fuel oil for the shipping of our minerals and rural products. Much of industry depends on fuel oil. Hundreds of thousands of jobs in every section of industry depend on oil. Why should oil companies maintain an extensive stockpile of oil when their interests are economic and not strategic? In November 1977 the  Deputy  Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> stated the position in one of his very few statements. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Prevailing forecasts indicate that a desirable timing for stockpile establishment, if this is necessary, would probably be the early to mid- 1 980s. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As with everything else, this Government is determined to do too little too late. Another option repeatedly rejected by the Government, yet taken by many overseas countries, to secure oil supplies has been direct government to government negotiations with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. This action circumvents profiteering by oil companies and is, as expected, bitterly opposed by them. Two years ago, when it was already clear that security of oil supply would be critical, I asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government would take action to diversify future sources of imported crude oil for Australia. His pious reply in September was as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australia already imports crude oil from a number of countries. It is not the Government&#39;s policy to become directly involved in commercial import or export transactions or to give any direction to Australian commercial interests as to where they should source imports. </para>

              <para>-In 1977. The Government deliberately ignored the possibility of trade deals with both Iraq and China although I noted recently that the Government is wavering on the issue of government-to-government negotiations, no doubt stung by the urgent realities of the situation facing Australia. I noted the recent response to this proposition by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Froggart,</inline> General Manager of the Shell company. He warned this Government, indeed any government, what would happen if attempts were made to deny oil companies their privileged role as sole marketing negotiators. Let me make a number of observations on that report. Firstly, many years ago in 1920 one of the most rewarding books on crude oil that I have ever read was published. It was entitled <inline font-style="italic">The World Struggle for Oil</inline> and was written by a Frenchman called Pierre de la Trameyre. He passed this very simple observation: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>The struggle for oil is no longer a rivalry between Trusts: it is a struggle between nations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">For almost eight decades we have failed to grasp what is a very simple fact. The second observation I make is this: OPEC has repeatedly warned consuming governments to police multinational oil companies&#39; marketing and distribution rake-offs. They need to be more effective and efficient to regulate and monitor, particularly the profits made by oil companies. My third observation is that we ought to have noted that Mexico has already entered into negotiations to trade off between West Germany and Canada oil for nuclear technology. Not three weeks ago the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A reduction in the proportion of crude sold to the big oil companies, which buy nearly three-fifths of Venezuela&#39;s exports, and a search for new markets, with attempts to sell more oil directly to consumers . . . </para>
            <para>Efforts to sell directly to consumers such as North American power companies will be intensified, possibly involving taking equity stakes in such companies in exchange for oil. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I make a fourth observation: The Japanese Government is becoming increasingly involved with OPEC to ensure continuity of supply. My fifth observation is that governments now are and will increasingly become, involved in international commodity price negotiations- they might not like it but it is inevitable- for minerals, rural products and, inevitably, energy. Such policies can be co-ordinated and integrated only if governments elect to provide the leadership necessary to make them effective, efficient and successful in the nation&#39;s interests. If this Government runs away from such a planned approach, I regret to say that crisis will be the order of the day in this country for a long time to come. The high water mark of the failure of energy policy was the statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in June of this year. Little was new, much was overdue. The statement was precisely what one would expect from a government that has shed itself of responsibility for energy matters only to be caught with its pants well and truly down. On the question of oil supply the Prime Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government expects oil companies to obtain imported oil supplies as necessary, to meet Australian requirements. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Presumably that was a plea to oil companies, not a threat, because he went on to promise the companies virtually an open go on what price they charge for petroleum. In other words, the new initiative is to allow oil companies even more scope to rip off Australian motorists. </para>
          <para>Let us consider an issue that I have raised in this place repeatedly- octane ratings. Another so-called new initiative is to vary the octane rating of super grade petrol. Three years ago the Royal Commission on Petroleum and later the Government&#39;s own National Energy Advisory Committee recommended that the octane rating of standard grade petrol be raised from 89 to 92 and that there be a larger price differential between standard and super grade petrol. In a Press release in June 1978 the Minister for National Development supported the recommendation. The Caltex company recently adopted the recommendation. But the more powerful oil companies such as Shell opposed it because it did not suit their marketing structure and instead opted for lowering the rating of super grade petrol from 98 to 97. The Prime Minister, predictably enough, capitulated to the large oil companies, again against the national interest. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the question of monitoring the oil companies&#39; activities. Another of the Prime Minister&#39;s new initiatives is for the Minister for National Development to write to oil companies requesting that they provide data on supply, consumption, stocks and export of petroleum products. I suggest that it is a disgrace that an Australian Government has not closely monitored this information before. It is a disgrace that a government has to rely on oil companies to provide the information. No matter how unpalatable it may be, the Australian Government sooner or later will have to establish its own organisation to regulate and monitor oil company activities, as suggested by the Royal Commission on Petroleum and as practised in many Western countries. The Government refuses to face the fact which was set out so well by the Royal Commission in its fourth report in the following terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In its socio-economic context motor spirit, as a staple consumer product, resembles electricity town gas, water supply, postal and communication services, meat, milk and bread supplies. All these areas have acquired distinctive forms of regulation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Yet another of the Prime Minister&#39;s so-called new&#39; initiatives concerns rationing and on this point he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government will also ensure that any allocation schemes implemented by companies follow sensible and fair practices across the industry and are co-ordinated with State and Territory Government emergency schemes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">For <inline font-style="italic">y/i</inline> years the Government has bowed to oil company pressure to stall proposals to reform unfair practices in the oil industry. The present shortage has allowed oil companies to axe competition in the retail side of the industry. They are using this opportunity to the fullest and we cannot blame them. They have 1 30 years experience behind them. In spite of anything that this Government might say about the fairness of allocation, the record shows that the will of the oil companies is always allowed to prevail. If it really wanted to inject fair play into the industry it ought to have introduced the Maryland-based legislation which was promised last year by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife).</inline> I received an answer today from the Minister stating that the Government may finally act on that promise. </para>
          <para>I have referred to the use of liquefied petroleum gas as a motor fuel on over, I think, 14 occasions in this House. A statement by this Government exhorted motorists to use LPG as a motor fuel which obviously impressed many people who were unaware of the Government&#39;s track record. However, they soon discovered that this Government was as ill-prepared on this aspect of energy policy as it was on all others. There is a lack of distribution outlets for LPG, especially in the city. There is a long waiting list for LPG conversions- up to two years in South Australia- and problems with safety in the absence of a supervisory body and appropriate standards. The Government has no excuse for not being prepared. Rex Connor&#39;s royal commission provided this Government with a comprehensive 250-page report on LPG three years ago and it was supported by the Government&#39;s National Energy Advisory Committee. In March 1 977 1 asked the Minister for National Resources about the use of LPG and its problems. On the question of standards, I specifically asked whether the Government would consider the adoption of propane specifications along the lines of the United States Natural Gas Processors Association specification HD5. He replied merely that the contents of the royal commission report were under consideration. A year later I ask the same question. The reply was that the report of the interdepartmental committee which was studying the royal commission report was expected to be considered by the Government in the near future. A year later the Prime Minister stated: </para>

The NEAC noted that the assessment of petroleum resources by the BMR was being severely retarded by a lack of expertise, statistical data and methodology.

          <para>In relation to exploration, about which the people opposite like to talk, this Government still continues to perpetuate the myth that its oil pricing policies are revitalising oil exploration. The figures on the number of wells drilled in Australia show that this is not so because only 52 exploration wells v/ere drilled in 1978 and fewer than 60 are expected to be drilled this year. In 1978, over 7,000 wells were drilled in Canada and 48,000 in the United States. The present problem with the Government&#39;s policies is simply that the oil companies are making considerable profits from oil production in Australia and they stand to make much more in the near future under this Government&#39;s policies. The Government&#39;s policy is to hope that oil companies will spend some of the money on exploration. Companies cannot be criticised for making what is for them the best investment. It is the Government, not the companies, which has the responsibility to ensure that profits are spent on oil exploration. The Government must introduce fiscal measures to ensure that oil companies plough sufficient of their profits into oil exploration. In Canada the level of taxation on oil company profits accruing from any price rises is adjusted so that the more a company ploughs back into exploration the fewer cents in the dollar it pays in tax. It has long been obvious that such a powerful incentive for oil companies to use their profits on oil exploration is essential for Australia. Summing up the situation far more effectively than I could ever do, Alastair Cooke three weeks ago on the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the <inline font-style="italic">Voice from America</inline> program, said: </para>

If they take the profits and invest them back in the exploration and. production of additional oil and gas in our country, then I Ve no objection to their profits being made. But what they have done is to buy restaurants and motel chains, they tried to buy circuses, they bought department stores, they&#39;ve taken profits from oil and gasoline and not put them back into the ground. </para>

          <para class="block">This Government- as we would if we were in government- has to accept that painful decisions are inevitable and that the sooner they are taken the less discomfort they will cause in the long run. If democratic countries such as Australia are to cope with these problems they must take the people into their confidence. So far, this Government &#39;s energy policies have attempted to deceive and to buy time before the next electionnothing more nor less. The tragedy for the Australian nation is that sooner or later delayed action will have to be paid back with interest. This country has to face up to some very severe problems in the years ahead and there is nothing more important than the energy question. Since 1975 I have repeatedly said in this House that what is needed is not a bipartisan approach to energy but for this House to set up its own committee of inquiry on energy. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> commands considerable respect from this side of the House even when he proposes a mixture of sound and quaint attitudes, ideas and suggestions. He sounds almost like a prophet when he presents himself as one who forecast present day difficulties in terms of the world energy crisis. One would almost think that he had had dialogue with the Ayatollah Khomeyni in Paris. But when he compared the number of exploration wells drilled in Australia with the number being drilled in Canada and the United States he completely dismissed and made no mention of what happened during the Labor Government&#39;s Administration between 1972 and 1975. Opposition members turned off the pumps and drills. The downward slide happened so quickly that, when we came back into power, not a drill was left searching for oil, from one side of Australia to the other. The same attitude which pervaded the latter sentences of the speech of the honourable member for Hawker existed then- kill, kill, kill. If somebody was about to make a quid, the Labor Party wanted to jump on him and destroy him. How do Opposition members think that Esso Australia Ltd found the Bass Strait oil? It was as a result of encouragement from previous Liberal-Country Party governments prior to the advent of the 1972 regime. There is no escaping the fact that some of our problems today are a direct result of the policies practiced by the Labor Government in 1972 to 1975. The honourable member condemned the Government of today. No one in his right mind could have predicted the overthrow of the Government of Iran. Nobody could have predicted the shortages of oil.

          <para class="block">Government has been following progressive policies. </para>
          <para>It is not my intention to get bogged down in talking on the matter which has been alluded to by the previous  speaker.  It is my job tonight- it is something which I willingly do- to speak in support of this Budget. Australia was like a ship that had been torpedoed from forward to aft and aft to forward again and again. The people changed the crew in 1 975. For the first couple of years, all the crew could do was to man the bilge pumps and work like crazy to save the vessel. The ship is now afloat and its recovery has been sufficient under the new crew to allow the crippled vessel to sail forward once again. Australia is going forward again. There is no way in the world that a majority of the Australian people will fall for believing that, because the Australian Labor Party has changed captains, the crew will behave any differently than the reckless, destructive way in which it manned the vessel between 1972 and 1975. The first mate for much of that period was the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden).</inline> He is now captain but neither he nor his crew has shown that they have learned anything about seamanship. This speech will not be an exercise in ALP bashing but I believe that almost every speech made this year by Opposition members indicates that they would do it all over again. While some of the Labor Government&#39;s changes were to the country&#39;s advantage Australians will continue to pay dearly for a long time for that disastrous era of 1972 to 1975. </para>
          <para>It is my intention to speak of the positive aspects of the Budget which will ensure the completion of the recovery of this nation. However, before I do so I wish to turn my attention to a matter of policy which causes me concern. Let no Opposition member say &#39;Hear, hear&#39;! That which causes me concern is the possibility that my Party might be adopting the Labor Party&#39;s policy in killing off the incentive of the better off and slightly better off in our community to care and to provide for themselves in the future. After my reference to the question of policy, I will allude to the Tax Commissioner&#39;s blunder of the century. I refer specifically to the upper limit of $1,200 on the taxation deduction for people who contribute to superannuation and insurance schemes. I recall with much pleasure that the Liberal Party&#39;s founder and father, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, and his protege, Harold Holt, were meticulous in keeping the taxation deduction figure for insurance and superannuation contributions updated in accordance with inflation. </para>
          <para>The insurance and superannuation deduction figure of $ 1 ,200 was set in 1 967. Since then inflation has devalued that figure to the point where a deduction far in excess of $3,000 would be needed even to equal the value which was set in 1967. We changed the Public Service superannuation scheme in 1977. In so doing, we probably gladdened the hearts of almost a quarter of a million Commonwealth public servants. They now contribute only 5 per cent of their salaries to superannuation. The scheme receives a massive injection from the taxpayers to make it workable. The only public servants who would feel this provision would be those who earn in excess of $24,000 a year. Private or self-employed citizens and non-government superannuation funds have no access to the subsidy that the taxpayer contributes to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. The non-government employee contributor has to contribute far in excess of 5 per cent of his income to have even a remote sense of security in old age. Therefore, 10 per cent of salary would be a normal contribution to superannuation. Anyone earning in excess of $12,000 a year comes within the group that I have broadly described as the more fortunate and the slightly more fortunate. Today, with an average income of over $200 per week, that involves many Australians. </para>
          <para>Unconsciously we are, like the Australian Labor Party when in office, destroying the ability and, more importantly, the will of the successful and moderately successful to care for themselves in their retirement years. Lest I be accused of caring only for the wealthy, let me say this: The competition for the available funds directed to welfare each year is well known in this place. If we are to kill the will, the incentive and the ability of the more fortunate in our community, in the future they will be putting their hands out to share in the restricted availability of welfare funds. I passionately believe that a government of my Party&#39;s persuasion has a very deep obligation to ensure that the stage is set not to allow people to dodge tax obligations but to ensure that the better off look after themselves so that when they reach old age their investments are caring for them and they do not become competitors for the restricted amount of money available for welfare. </para>
          <para>I now refer to what I believe to be the Tax Commissioner&#39;s blunder of the century. It is not often that politicians or parliamentarians have the opportunity to examine closely the fine print. This year&#39;s tax return Schedule &#39;A&#39; is very much the same as Schedule &#39;B&#39;. Tax returns have prob ably been filled in already by some 5 million Australians. The grave error which I have discovered occurred not just last year, 12 months ago, but also the year before. It was in that year, 1976-77, that the Commissioner- this is his responsibility completely; we cannot blame poor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> for this one- changed the format of the form. He inserted a concessional expenditure rebate section in the middle of the tax return. I seek leave to incorporate a section of the tax return in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I have the permission of the honourable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham)</inline> who is at the table. </para>

              <para>-In that section the Tax Commissioner tells people in a nutshell that, if their superannuation or insurance contributions exceed $1,200, not a cent above that amount will be considered as a tax deduction. Of course, that is a matter of government policy to which I alluded a moment ago. The instruction form tells people to disclose full details of payments made, particularly where they exceed $1,200. When they retire and become superannuated, the Tax Commissioner will look at the amount that they have paid in excess of their deductible contribution and offset that overpayment against the taxation that will be applied to their superannuation. Superannuitants are taxed. A person receiving $10,000 from a superannuation scheme would pay the same tax as any other individual who earned $ 10,000. But in this case the Commissioner of Taxation says: &#39;Okay, if you put in thousands and thousands of dollars in excess over the years I will work out how many years you are expected to live and then I will reduce the figure upon which I actually apply tax&#39;. That gives that person an advantage in terms of his not paying tax on the money that he never received a reduction or a concession for in the earlier years. That is what that form says. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I hold up the form to show it has eight pages of very close print. By comparison, it makes an insurance policy look like a daily newspaper. I take the form itself that every taxpayer would look at. On the top line there are the words &#39;Complete this page ONLY&#39;- the word &#39;only&#39; is in capital letters- &#39;if your total expenditure on items Al to A13 exceeded $1,590&#39;. This is the &#39;A&#39; return. I have worked it out that people not employed in the Public Service and who are lucky enough to have access to a superannuation scheme have to pay, as I said before, about 10 per cent to 12 per cent of their income to be in a scheme that is even remotely worth while. Therefore, those people receiving in excess of $12,000 per year who are healthy, who have not adopted a child, who have incurred no education expenses or who live in rented accommodation, will be ripped off when they need the money the most, in their retirement years. This happens because the form that the Taxation Commissioner gives people to fill out is totally misleading and is in total conflict with what is actually required. </para>
          <para>I do not know what the Government is going to do about this matter, but considering that this practice has been going on for over the past three years, I believe there is probably a real obligation on the Taxation Commisioner to get out all those returns of people who have not sent in that middle page in the last three years and write to them informing them of this very grave error. It is a poor reflection on the Taxation Office officers and on those people who make their living out of preparing income tax returns professionally that they did not pick up this mistake. If I had not picked up this discrepancy and it had been allowed to go on, Australians from one side of the country to the other would have been going on merrily, unaware of the fact that their entitlement was going down the drain because of the misleading advice given by the Taxation Commissioner. </para>
          <para>Whilst on this subject, I want to make one further point in relation to policy. It is a pity the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> is not here, but I notice the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> is here. I am quite sure he will relate what I say to the Treasurer. If the Government is going to regard as non-deductible for taxation purposes an amount in excess of $1,200 and people are contributing, say $2,000 or $1,500 and therefore paying an excess of $800 or $300, which is being put in reserve, then when that person who is now 30 years of age reaches 60 years of age the Taxation Commissioner will say to him: &#39;In 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80 you contributed $1,500 in excess. I will give you a reduction or offset this in your retirement years&#39;. With inflation- it is expected to continue at 10 per cent, as we have been told-the value of that $1,500 will be like a peanut. I strongly advocate that the Government has an obligation to ensure- if it is not going to correct a $1,200 upper limit figure for life assurance and superannuation- that this money is indexed to retain its value. What the Government is doing at present is sitting on a stockpile of money contributed by taxpayers and being held in reserve. Because of the effect of inflation, the value of money is diminishing and the people of Australia will not be really getting the return that should be due to them in today&#39;s values as a result of the contribution they are making. </para>
          <para>In my remaining two or three minutes I want to refer to a couple of the good aspects of the Budget, particularly the increase in the amount the Government is making available for the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship Fulltime Training. There has been an increase of $26m. This will have the effect of increasing the number of eligible apprentices from 56,500 to 85,000. It surprises me that no previous speaker in the Budget debate has alluded to this point. Here we have this tremendous increase in the number of young people who will be assisted to become apprentices. The actual increase in the subsidy to employers will be from 1 January next year when it will rise from $6.50 per day to $13 per day for apprentices receiving off-the-job training in the first year of training. </para>
          <para>I refer also to some of the allocations made in the Budget. Almost $9,000m is being set aside for social welfare. That is an increase of 9.6 per cent and represents a total outlay of 28.2 per cent of the Budget. Health has an allocation of well over $3, 000m, representing 10 per cent of the Budget. Without trying to cover too many more subjects, I conclude with the observation that here we have well over 38 per cent of the nation &#39;s Budget spent on social welfare and health. When people clamour for more and more expenditure in other arenas, they must realise that whilst the Government recognises their case, there is only so much money available. The only alternative to saying no at times is to follow the Australian Labor Party&#39;s policy of 1972-75 which would jack up taxes. If a Labor Government were ever returned I am positive we would see such a policy implemented because the only way it would ever finance some of the hairbrained schemes it proposes in this Parliament would be to hit the working man in the pocket by taking more taxation from him. I advise the Opposition to get its feet on the ground and recognise the fact that the working man wants to take home as much of what he earns as possible while at the same time recognising he does have to make a contribution to the welfare of the nation. </para>

It is the height of audacity to say we undermined consumer confidence in Canberra. This Government has presided over the greatest bashing of a particular community. It has presided over the complete demoralisation of the Public Service, the greatest escalation of unemployment in any part of Australia, and a record number of liquidations and bankruptcies in the small business world. It has presided over the gutting of the building industry, cutting it in half. The building force is now down to 50 per cent of what it was. It has sold off government enterprises, the property of the people of Canberra- the brickworks, the government sawmill. Above all, it has brought down a record low vote for the National Capital </para>

              <para>- Certainly. I do not have to ask the Minister that question. The answer is in the Budget Papers. The figure mentioned in the Budget Papers for new capital works this year is $ 13.7m. It is an appalling performance. Then the Government has the hide to point the finger at the Opposition and say that we are undermining consumer confidence. The Government has undermined my confidence. It has undermined not only the confidence of the consumers but also the confidence of the business people, the building industry and, of course, the unemployed. It has done nothing for the unemployed. It has done nothing in this Budget to hold out any hope for them. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Canberra has panicked. I do not blame him. If I were in his position I would panic too. He has pressed the panic button, as has the Government senator representing the Australian Capital Territory in the other place. They have both panicked and of course they have put the pressure on the Minister. The Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> has panicked too. He is now trying to pull some goodies out of the hat. He pulled some real beauties out of the hat today about things that are going to happen in the bright rosy future for Canberra. He is talking about casinoscasinos that he would have nothing to do with a couple of years ago and which the Government rejected. He is talking about a tourist centre for which he had available, I think, $3. 6m in the Budget last year, which he let go by default because he could not make up his mind where the tourist centre was to be built. He is now talking about a convention centre. He is sitting back and waiting for private enterprise to come in and build all these wonderful things and solve all our problems. These are very commendable projects. I support them. I support the proposals for the casino, the tourist centre and the convention centre. They are wonderful things, but we all know that if they happen at all they will not happen for two or three years and in the meantime many more people in Canberra will go out of business, particularly in the building industry. </para>
          <para>There were a few pluses in the Budget. I give credit to the Minister for the money that has been made available to build a new library in Belconnen and an in-door sporting pavilion- a very limited facility- at the Bruce Stadium and for the provision of a little more money for Commissioner for Housing loans. I understand that the Commissioner will be able to lend to another 160-odd people. There are 750 names on the waiting list, so in 12 months time instead of having 750 names on the waiting list we will have about only 600. No money at all is provided for government housing, of course. There is no need for it because there is no growth here. Against those few pluses, which I concede are good, although not enough, we have this tremendous cutback in the NCDC budget. For a number of years it was spending over $200m. I know that it cannot keep on doing that but to cut funding for new capital works back to $ 13.7m in one year is inexcusable. The Minister says: &#39;We do not want any more land, we do not want any more houses; there is no growth&#39;. I agree with that; there is no argument about it. But there are plenty of capital works programs which the Minister could have got underway and I believe should be got underway in the NCDC budget. The national museum has been talked about for years. We have a site for it. We do not have to wait for private enterprise to make a decision about building a national museum. All the Minister had to do was to convince the Cabinet that we wanted some funds injected into Canberra, not for the people of Canberra but for national projects. </para>
          <para>Of course, a great deal of the NCDC budget over the years has been devoted to national capital projects. They are not domestic projects at all. The High Court building and the National Gallery are not there to serve the local people; they are national capital projects. I think it is a very appropriate time for the Government to start some more national capital projects such as the construction of the national museum. The new coast road has been talked about for years. There is not a penny to get that underway. The convention centre could have been built by the Government. It did not have to wait another three years for private enterprise to come in with all sorts of projects. We could have had a full indoor recreation centre. It has been talked about for years. Instead of that we are to have a pavilion where people can play tennis or cricket or something. </para>
          <para>Against a few pluses we have a very imposing list of minuses and a deplorable record by a government in Canberra, the worst in history and one which the Canberra people will remember for a long time. It is not only the Minister for the Capital Territory who has let the Territory down. I do not believe that our present Minister is a Canberra basher at heart. I think he has a great regard for Canberra, but the fact is that he was not able to overcome the Canberra-bashing syndrome of the present Government. It has a very strong anti-Canberra lobby and he was not able to overcome it and get some funds to put Canberra on its feet. He has presided over a devastating demoralisation of Canberra. He is not the only one at whom we can point the finger. </para>
          <para>The other Minister who is very culpable in relation to Canberra is of course the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt).</inline> There has been some very bad administration, and some very bad decisions have been made which have caused tremendous difficulty in the health services in Canberra. The opening of the Calvary Hospital, without adequate funding, has been disastrous. That hospital was allowed to open only on the basis of taking money and resources from two existing hospitals. This has had a very demoralising and devastating effect on the whole of our health services. Of course, the Minister will say that we are spending so much and have spent so much on health, that Canberra is well off and all that sort of nonsense. There are spare resources only because Canberra has stopped growing. It has come to a standstill; therefore there is a surplus of resources. It is not due to bad planning; it is due to bad government. </para>
          <para>The performance of the Minister for Health has been deplorable. In Canberra we have unused resources. We have clients waiting to use those resources but we cannot use them because of staff ceilings. We have a hostel at Watson in which there are 20 vacant beds and we are not allowed to put on the staff, giving jobs to the unemployed nurses in Canberra, to service those beds. We have clients willing to pay for that service and to go into those beds. Do honourable members know where they are? They are in New South Wales. They are not in Canberra at all. They are sent away from their relatives and friends. </para>

              <para>- They are sent to places such as Kenmore, yes. The Capital Territory Health Commission is paying $800,000 a year for services to Australian Capital Territory residents who are in various medical institutions in New South Wales. At the same time we have empty beds in the hostels in Canberra. There is no excuse for that. This is one of the distortions which come about from this crazy pattern of across-the-board staff ceilings which does not give due consideration to the resources that are being wasted. I have written to the Minister about this. He has not even responded yet. Those beds are sitting there empty. Unemployed nurses are waiting to do the job. Clients are ready to go into the beds, but they are in New South Wales and we are paying out a lot of money while our resources are wasted here. </para>

          <para>I was rather surprised at the Minister&#39;s making a little speech recently saying that he wanted Canberra to be more like any other town in New South Wales. I do not quite know what he meant. I do not know whether it is a cult of mediocrity. Perhaps he does not want to acknowledge that there should be any great advantage in a wellplanned city, but believes that Canberra should be downgraded to the level of any other town or city in New South Wales. I do not think that he really believes that. I do not think any honourable members opposite would believe that. I think we all acknowledge that Canberra is a government town. There is no doubt about that. I do not think anybody should pretend that it will be anything but a government town. Certainly, we want private enterprise, and as much as we can get; but I think that is complementary to the growth of government and the growth of Canberra in an orderly fashion rather than in the fits and starts that we have had in recent years. Not only has it stopped growing in the last few years but also there is a possibility of negative population growth with people moving out because of the lack of employment prospects in Canberra. I think that it is a nonsense to say that Canberra should be more like other cities. I do not think that private enterprise is going to rush into Canberra if there is no prospect that it will have some growth as a government town. I would net support the idea of a rapid growth in the Public Service, but there should be some prospect of growth. Public servants should have some prospect of normal promotion and increased opportunity. I am sure that all this will come about when there is a change of government. </para>
          <para>We have seen this Government introduce all sorts of repressive legislation against the public servants and their unions in Canberra and this has further demoralised them. There was a deplorable attack a couple of weeks ago by a member of the Government on people being invalided out of the Public Service and on the government medical officers. He said that there was a racket because people were being invalided out of the Public Service. What is he saying? Is he saying that the Commonwealth medical officers are corrupt and that they are getting a back-hander or that the people who are getting out are obtaining false medical records? Under the protection of the House he makes these deplorable accusations against people who have served this country and the Public Service well for many years. What he does not realise, of course, is that many of these people are in poor health precisely because of the unreal staff ceilings that have been imposed on departments and because of overwork in various sections of the Public Service. The health of these people has deteriorated physically and mentally to the stage where they have to be invalided out. Is this member saying that all these people are telling lies or that they are . bribing a medical officer to get out? If so, why does he not get up and say that instead of casting aspersions on people who have served this country well? </para>
          <para>It is no wonder that the honourable member for Canberra is panicking. If I were in his position I would be panicking too. He is so concerned about it that he has given up very profitable businesses so that he can concentrate on retaining the electorate. I think that was a very wise move. He did not sell them, of course; he is leasing them in case he might need them later and I think that this too is a wise move. </para>

I have not heard of a more ridiculous proposal in all my life. The Government has done some crazy things but this is about the craziest. Here is a very expert professional research body which is world renowned and leads the world in many aspects of forest research, particularly in bushfire prevention and control and genetic breeding of new strains of softwoods for Australia. Nearly all of this division&#39;s research projects are based in Canberra. They are carried out in the Australian Capital Territory forests. Forest research projects take many years to bear fruit and to be completed, but here is the Government talking about transferring to Tasmania all of the 200 people in this Division. I wonder why it wants to send them to Tasmania, of all places. Not one of these officers wants to go to Tasmania. Does the Government want to close the whole place down? Why not move the Parliament to Tasmania and be done with it or move it overseas? </para>

          <para>Small business, of course, is in a terrible mess. There has been a record number of bankruptcies and people going into liquidation. I have business people coming into my office day after day. I have had dozens and dozens of them come in. Some are in critical circumstances indeed. I see people losing their homes and life savings and having no prospects at all because of the Canberra-bashing that has gone on and the way in which the growth rate has virtually stopped. Some of these people have been successful in business for many years. They are not amateurs who do not know what they are doing. They are proven business people, and yet they have run into a patch through which they cannot survive. We hear promises about what might happen in two or three years time- it is a bit like the new and permanent Parliament House- but many more of these people will be out of business before then. Many of the builders will be out of business and seeking sustenance further afield or some other way of maintaining their situation. But the damage will have been done. </para>
          <para>The tragedy of this Budget is that the Minister for the Capital Territory did not realise the damage that was being done until too late. All those things that could have been done in the Budget just were not done. Canberra got an extremely bad deal indeed, even in some of the existing industries. Canberra has its own egg industry here, Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd, a very fine production unit which set out to supply eggs for Canberra and it was doing this. What happened? The Victorian Egg Board came in and started cutting prices. A Board, set up to stabilise the marketing of eggs, comes into the Australian Capital Territory and starts undermining our own industry by selling eggs at a loss or at a much lower price than the price in Victoria. In other words, that Board is dumping on the Canberra market, eggs which normally would have been exported. This has been going on for a couple of years and the </para>
          <para class="block">Minister has done nothing effective about it. He has not stopped it. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> who has some responsibility in the Australian Agricultural Council, has done nothing about it. It has been allowed to go on. This industry represents the jobs of 60 or 70 people in Canberra. If this practice is allowed to continue these people will not be able to carry on and there will then be a few more added to the unemployment list. So, it is no wonder that the honourable member for Canberra is panicking. </para>
          <para>I am pleased to see that the Minister has come to life at last and has started to talk about the wonderful things that are going to happen in Canberra, but I am afraid that he has left the run a bit late. The damage has been done and has cut very deeply into the people of Canberra. They will not forget about it tomorrow or next month or next year and the honourable member for Canberra will have to bear the brunt of what this Government has done to Canberra. I have a lot of sympathy for him. He has tried but he has a hopeless task in the face of the Canberra-bashing that has been allowed to go on. I do not believe the Minister to be a Canberra-basher at heart but I am afraid we must admit that he has been ineffective in resisting the Canbeira-bashing that has gone on since this Government came to office. I am afraid we are going to feel the effects of that for many years to come. It is no good trying to pull something out of the hat at short notice. It just will not succeed. It will take several years for any project to get under way and in the meantime a lot more people will go to the wall. There were projects that the Minister could have got under way very quickly, projects which would not have taken two or three years to mature. Plans are already in existence for a lot of those projects. He had only to extract the money from the Treasurer, but the Treasurer and the Government were very tight-fisted in relation to Canberra. Unfortunately, the Minister failed to break through that Canberra-bashing syndrome and the people of Canberra have been asked to carry the can.

            <item label="(1">
              <para>) (a) The Government has not sought to encourage the production of engines optimised to use a particular grade of motor spirit. However, on 27 June 1 979, the Government announced a variation in the octane ratings of motor spirit sold in Australia. It was considered that the changes in octane ratings could be implemented within a month and could save up to one per cent of Australia&#39;s crude oil requirements. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The announcement noted that one major company would introduce a new grade of motor spirit of 92 RON. This grade of motor spirit is being introduced because most vehicles in use in Australia require a higher octane fuel than the present 89 octane regular grade but of these, including many imported cars, some do not need 97 or 98 octane premium grade. A 92 octane fuel will cater for many of these and, because of the lesser degree of refining needed to produce 92 octane than higher octanes, fuel savings can be made in refineries. </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>It was also announced that the octane rating of super grade motor spirit would be reduced from 98 to 97 RON. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Motor spirit with a 98 RON rating was the highest octane rating motor spirit commercially available in Australia. Most vehicles are designed in Australia or imported with this in mind. I understand that the decrease in the octane rating of premium grade will affect relatively few motor vehicles.

          <para>Applications for support grants under the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Program include details of other sources of funds. The level of funding from these sources is taken into account by the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) in recommending the level of Commonwealth support. I do not consider that it is appropriate for details of non-Commonwealth Government funding to be made available by the Commonwealth, regardless of whether the application for support is successful or not. I also do not consider it appropriate to release details of unsuccessful applications which are confidential to the Department and the applicants. Unsuccessful applicants may discuss their applications with my Department. This occurs frequently. </para>

          <para>Applications for support grants to NERDDC are carefully considered by the Technical Standing committees established under the council. The assessment takes into account the merit of the proposal, the priority accorded to the particular research area and the total funds available. Assessments are reviewed by the full council and the resulting recommendations are submitted for my consideration. </para>

            <para>The responsibility for construction of roads in Australia rests primarily with the States, and it would therefore be appropriate for the honourable member to direct his inquiry to the State Transport Ministers. With regard to road construction in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, I suggest that the honourable member direct his inquiry to the Honourable R. Steele, Minister for Transport and Works, Northern Territory, who is responsible for road construction in the Territory, and to the  Hon.  R. J. Ellicott, Minister for the Capital Territory, who has responsibility for road construction in the ACT. </para>

The reports I have seen do not forecast that a crisis will occur, as such; rather, they stress the importance of adequate energy supplies for future economic development. The Governing Board of the IEA met at ministerial level in May 1979 and concluded that energy supply and demand problems are serious and could produce major economic constraints in the next few years; if nothing is done to change present trends, available energy supplies will not be sufficient to support even moderate economic growth. Australia and other member countries of the IEA have been working towards policies which will help to reduce demand for oil and to ensure that adequate amounts of essential energy supplies are available. </para>

              <para>1 ) (a) and (b) The Government is pursuing a variety of practical measures which will achieve the objectives inherent in these recommendations of the Royal Commission. The Government has, through its crude oil pricing policy, established realistic prices for transport fuels. This policy approach is promoting, amongst other things, an increase in the sales of smaller engined vehicles at the expense of. larger engined vehicles and thereby improving fuel economy. In his energy policy statement of 27 June 1979, the Prime Minister announced that the Government was introducing a voluntary program of national fuel economy goals for passenger vehicles. This program has been developed in the light of advice received from the National Energy Advisory Committee. Under the fuel economy goals now stated, the weighted average fuel consumption of new passenger cars is to be reduced from the present 1 1 litres/ 100 km to 9 litres/100 km by 1983 and 8 litres/100 km by 1987. This should result in savings of motor spirit of approximately 5 percent in 1 983 and 12 per cent in 1987. </para>

This campaign, to be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the States (except Queensland) is to commence in October this year.

Officials agreed to recommend to ASEAN Economic Ministers and Australian Ministers a settlement on a package basis intended to meet the common objectives of the ASEAN countries and of the Australian low fare policy. My understanding is that ASEAN Economic Ministers have yet to consider the package developed between ASEAN and Australian officials. </para>

          <para>There have been indications from the Singapore authorities, which have been reported in the media, that some aspects of the package negotiated by officials at Kuala Lumpur do not meet their wishes. It is, however, for ASEAN as a group, rather than for an individual ASEAN country, to advise whether or not ASEAN is willing to accept the package settlement. In the circumstances, no talks are presently planned with ASEAN countries individually, but should Singapore or any other ASEAN country request talks with Australia, such request would receive the Government&#39;s close consideration. </para>

              <para>I am advised that nominally identical motor vehicles in the Australian fleet have substantially different fuel octane requirements. However, in general, vehicles will perform satisfactorily, other factors remaining unchanged, if they are run on a grade of petrol at or above the minimum octane stipulated by a manufacturer. They will perform with maximum efficiency when they are run on a grade of petrol which matches the minimum octane specified by a manufacturer in the sense that they are maximising the use of the available octane quality of the fuel. They will perform unsatisfactorily when they are run on a grade of petrol which has an octane rating which is less than the minimum specified by a manufacturer. The energy savings which result from matching octane ratings and engine requirements accrue in the refinery system. </para>
