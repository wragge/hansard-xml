            <para>- I ask the Prime Minister a question about uranium. I refer him to the fact that approval has been given for the development of the Ranger, Nabarlek, Yeelirrie and Roxby Downs uranium deposits- that is, excluding Pancontinental Mining Ltd- and that production from the first three mines will reach 8,000 tonnes per annum by 1985 with at least a further 3,000 tonnes from Roxby Downs. Given that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission estimates of annual world demand for uranium have dropped from 115,000 tonnes in 1973 to 54,000 tonnes in 1978 and that the surplus in world uranium production will be more than 30,000 tonnes a year by 1985, does this not mean that Australian uranium will be in acute oversupply and will be sold into a buyers market with tumbling prices and safeguards deterioration? Will the Prime Minister confirm that not one new uranium contract has been entered into since 1972? Will he confirm that the one small prospect of sales to the Philippines is now receding and that the only other likely prospect at the moment is for modest sales to Britain? Finally, will he expatiate upon his Government's bullish assessments for Australian uranium sales by telling the Parliament precisely where all this uranium is to be sold? May I ask respectfully that the answer be based upon fact and not upon rhetoric? </para>

            <para>-As to the details of the honourable gentleman's question, I will treat the question as placed on the Notice Paper and get a written reply to that as soon as I can. But, there are one or two general things that, I think, ought to be said. The Government has made decisions about the mining and export of uranium under the strictest possible safeguards because it believes that there is a need to supply energy in an energy-short world. I would have thought that some of the discussions on energy conservation and statements by representatives from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and others in recent days and the news in the Press this morning that there is a likelihood of a further price rise by some OPEC countries all indicate that there is at the very least a great scarcity of oil. I hope the honourable gentleman will accept that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is also an acceptance throughout European countries and in Japan and a great many other countries that if they are to have the energy that they need to keep their own industries going and to keep their homes warm in the winter, they will need to rely increasingly on nuclear generated electricity. Therefore, the trade is going to go on. I would have thought that it would be far better for the peaceful and proper prosecution of that trade for Australia to be very actively involved in it because that then strengthens our voice in non-proliferation matters and in making sure that the world nonproliferation regime is as effective as it possibly can be. That affects our security as it affects everyone 's security. It does not help Australian security at all for Australia to stay out of the business of selling uranium and let other people do it in the way that may be less secure and less safe than if Australia itself had been involved. So, Australian security in the longer term, as well as world security in relation to proliferation, is a significant part of what we are about. But also I think that there have been some notable comments made about this subject in quite recent times. Somebody recently said: </para>

            <para>I have been to Japan and talked with the people there.

I did not ask about Japanese workers; I asked about Australian uranium demand on the basis that the Australian Cabinet has approved the development of four major uranium mines in Australia. If Cabinet has considered this issue, the Prime Minister should be able to expatiate on his feet about market demand and give us some indication and not to put the question quietly on the Notice Paper. </para>

              <para>- It is perfectly plain that the candidate for Wills does understand the needs and necessities of trade in uranium. I know that he said- as part of the effort to get that preselection, I suspect- that of course he would stick by Australian Labor Party policy on the subject, but he has made his own view very clear and it expresses the morality of the position that the Government takes, and the reality of the world need for nuclear power. The honourable member for Blaxland can try to suggest that there is no need for them to move off their comfortable but hypocritical perch- not my term but, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> hypocritical- because he thinks there is not going to be a substantial need. There will be a market for Australian uranium. The honourable gentleman knows quite well that there has been a need to negotiate safeguards arrangements. He knows quite well that over the time there will be an expanding market for uranium from Australia. The honourable gentleman wants to suggest that there is a respectability in his position because, he says, there is not, and will not be, a demand for Australian uranium. As usual, the honourable gentleman will find his judgment very much misplaced. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. The Minister will be aware that a petition containing 8,818 signatures from Cairns has just been presented to this House. It calls for a delay in the signing of the fisheries agreement with Japan so that negotiations can be continued for a larger buffer zone to protect black martin. Last night the Minister had a meeting with fishing representatives from Queensland and New South Wales to discuss this very difficult problem. Can the Minister comment on the possibility of delaying the signing of the agreement? What steps can be taken to ensure that the black marl in are protected from long-line fishing, both now and in the future? </para>

            <para>- I regret having to tell the honourable member that under the international obligations we have in respect of this agreement there is no way in which we can delay the signing of the agreement. The signing will take place this afternoon. I should remind the honourable member of the important factor in this agreement that will allow for a consideration of the concern expressed by the 8,000-odd people who signed the petition which has been presented to the House. For the first time the 200-mile economic fishing zone now comes under the control of the Australian Government. For the first time there is an agreement between the Australian Government and the Japanese Government as to fishing in those waters, and for the first time there is also a capacity to negotiate with respect to long-line tuna fishing in those areas in the 12 months ahead. As I pointed out to the House yesterday, the present agreement excludes the Japanese from fishing in an area of some 80,000 square miles of waters. That is a very significant departure from the situation that existed while these were Commonwealth waters. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also pointed out to the House yesterday that there are a number of other protections that are important to the marlin fishing in that area. For the first time we will be able to co-ordinate the monitoring of the fishing that is taking place and we will be able to have Australian officials on board Japanese boats which are fishing in the area. The essential point is that the long-line tuna agreement is for 12 months only. Representatives of the game fishing clubs who met me last night agreed to the setting up of a joint committee consisting of Commonwealth, State and game fishing officials who would take part in the monitoring. Whilst to those who are concerned there may seem to be some negatives in the agreement, the fact is that there are a number of positives that should not be ignored. </para>

            <para>- I take it that my honourable friend is adverting to the matter which the honourable member for Melbourne raised in the House this afternoon. There is no provision that I am aware of in the Defence Act which would preclude any former member of the Defence Force entering into private employment anywhere in Australia. I am not aware of any such provision, and I am not aware of any convention or practice to that end. I am aware of the fact that the Public Service Board has recently provided guidelines which it is suggested should be followed by former public servants of the country. As things now stand I invite the House to accept the view that those guidelines would be persuasive only in character and would not have the force of law. This Parliament has not legislated to prevent former members of the Public Service or former members of the Defence Force from entering into private employment. That would be a matter for conscious government decision and for the authority of this House, and that is clearly a matter of policy. I think that the great majority of members in the Parliament would be aware that this matter has been considered by the Bowen committee of inquiry; with what results, we will have to wait and see. I would say that how a former member of the Defence Force behaves upon entering into private employment would be essentially a matter for his own sense of fitness and integrity. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I hold the view, and I hold it very strongly, that where there is no instinct for honour one cannot legislate for it. I am not aware of any abuse by any former member of the Service who has gone into private employment. Members of this Parliament, members of this House, have gone into private employment. I would regard it as a startling proposal to seek to place a complete embargo on all former members of the Public Service or the Parliament or of government or of the Defence Force entering into private employment. I remind the House that several members of this House have returned to pastoral duties. I would think any person who returned to pastoral duties out in the parish after a few years in this place would have a distinct advantage over his brethren. </para>

            <para>- The short answer is no. I am not aware of any obligation upon that gentleman to seek the approval of the present Secretary of the Department of Defence. I remind my honourable friend of what I said a few moments ago: Those guidelines as they exist at the moment are persuasive in character only. In my view they do not have the force of law. If the honourable gentleman does not wish to accept that opinion I hope he will pay promptly for another one. </para>

If members of the Opposition doubt that I invite them to look at what the former British Labour Government was doing to the job creation schemes that were established by the Wilson and Callaghan governments in the 1970s. I invite them to examine the communique issued by the interim committee of the International Monetary Fund after its meeting in Belgrade a couple of weeks ago. It stated, among other things, that the committee emphasised that the main task of economic policy was to contain inflationary pressures and to reduce inflationary expectations. I draw the attention of honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House to the increased emphasis now being placed by the United States Government on containing inflation. In that context I welcome the measures recently announced by the  Chairman  of the Federal Reserve which are designed to constrain the rate of growth of the money supply in the United States and also to introduce quantitative controls on the volume of credit in that country. </para>
          <para>All around the industrialised world governments are reaffirming in a stronger manner than ever before the importance of fighting inflation as a fundamental pre-condition to economic growth. There is no greater hoax in the economic debate in Australia at the present time than the proposition that one can defeat unemployment by allowing inflation to go up. Nothing has altered the simple economic truth that the only way effectively to fight unemployment in this country is to defeat inflation, and that is why more than ever before this Government does not intend to make any alteration to the fundamental basis of its economic policies. </para>

            <para>-Section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as honourable members will know, is the general anti-avoidance section which was inserted many years ago. As a consequence of successive decisions of the High Court of Australia, the section now has a more limited operation than was originally the case. The Government has been engaged in trying to rewrite the section for a number of months. A draft of the section was completed by Parliamentary Counsel and the Taxation Office some weeks ago and on my instructions the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor briefed senior and junior counsel in Melbourne and Sydney to settle the draft of the section. So far I have received one of the combined opinions from two of the counsel involved and I am presently awaiting the second opinion. When that has been received, I, in consultation with my advisers in this respect, will consider those opinions and their impact upon the draft. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government attaches a good deal of importance to the successful rewriting of section 260, for two reasons. Firstly, I believe that the Income Tax Assessment Act should, in the name of effective anti-avoidance, contain a general antiavoidance provision. I think that is a view that would be shared by honourable gentlemen on both sides of the House. Secondly, I believe that in the course of rewriting the section we should be careful that it is done in a way that makes it effective to detect tax avoidance but at the same time ensure that it is not written in such a general fashion as to cast an unnecessary pall over ordinary and thoroughly legitimate commercial transactions. It is for that reason that the Government is taking very considerable pains, through briefing private counsel, to make sure, to put it shortly, that we get it right. </para>
          <para>I do not believe, in view of the time scale involved, that it would be possible to expose a draft of the section before the House rises, but it is my intention, when I have completed a draft of it and it has been approved by the Government, to make that draft public and to invite comment upon it from all interested parties from both sides of the House so that, when the Parliament resumes in the New Year, we will be in a position, in the light of those comments, to present to the Parliament for adoption what will then be regarded as a satisfactory rewrite of section 260. </para>
          <para>While I am on this subject, I take the opportunity of publicly commending some remarks made recently in the Journal of the Institute of Chartered Accountants by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishop,</inline> the  President  of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. He drew attention to the obligations of members of that profession so far as advice in respect of tax avoidance practices is concerned. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishop,</inline> in giving that advice, displayed very considerable courage and displayed a conspicuous sensitivity to the responsibilities of his office. I believe that all of us who think that there is merit in members of the legal and accountancy professions accepting a sense of responsibility in these matters ought to pay particular tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bishop's</inline> stand and his remarks. </para>

After reading a transcript of the PM segment and after speaking to employees of the ABC <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program several hours later- I cannot give a precise time, but it was some time after 9 p.m.- a member of my staff made copies available to several members of the Press, particularly those who had been seeking information about the document.

            <para>- My question is directed to the Treasurer. He will be aware of speculation regarding the Government's Budget announcement of an $18,000 ceiling for depreciation purposes on passenger cars and station wagons. Is he also aware that some community uncertainty is causing a temporary loss of car sales? Does he agree that some speculation regarding the effect of this legislation is incorrect? </para>

            <para>-I thank the honourable member for Barton for that question because I believe that some unfortunate confusion and doubt has arisen from this Budget measure. I make it clear to the honourable member that the Government has given very careful consideration to many representations that have been received. As I indicated in the Press statement which I made yesterday, the Government intends to adhere to the Budget decision. I indicated in that statement that because of the application of the commencement date the measure will not affect cars and station wagons which were ordered or were on hand prior to the time of the Budget. In those circumstances, in effect, some kind of transitional period will be allowed. That will obviate severe liquidity problems that might- I stress the word 'might'- have been experienced by a limited number of dealers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I will arrange as soon as possible for details of the announcement and any anticipated questions arising out of it to be circulated to all motor dealers in Australia. I am aware, for example, that some dealers did not know that under the Budget decision all lease charges will remain totally tax deductible, provided a business use can be established. Equally, some people were under the impression that the measure in some way affects vehicles purchased entirely or partly for private use. Of course, that has never been the case. The measure was designed simply to put a ceiling on the amount that can be claimed for depreciation purposes for the business use of a motor car or station wagon. </para>
          <para>I think it is a fair measure that will be seen by the community as having been taken in the interests of tax equity. I think that the interruption in sales which has been alleged by a number of dealers in recent weeks has been due more to an anticipation that the measure may be reversed than the actual effect of the measure. Some of the evidence available to the Government, particularly that regarding motor vehicles which are priced only just above $18,000, indicates that this is almost certainly the case. I make it clear to the honourable member that the Government has looked very carefully at the measure. We have decided not to alter it. The modification I announced last night will be the only modification to it. The necessary legislation will be introduced in due course. </para>

He will recall that yesterday several questions were directed to him asking him directly whether he was responsible in some way or another, either through direct action or instruction to a member of his staff, for the distribution of a copy or copies of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples' letter to fellow commissioners of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. He will recall denying that he was responsible. He will also recall that subsequently I asked him a question directly whether any member of his staff was responsible for such a distribution. I ask whether he recalls stating: </para>

            <para>- I reiterate, because I think it needs to be said every time the allegation is made, that the original release of this document was not made by me. I would certainly not have released the document had it not already been released and had that release not been checked. I sought no evasion of the response to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. As I said, I had no intention of making this document public until it had become public, because, as the honourable gentleman would appreciate, there is no mileage in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples' letter so far as the Government is concerned. It is a matter of public knowledge that the contents of the letter are highly critical, in emotional terms, of much of the Government's legislation which has been through this House and which is now before the Senate. There is no advantage for this information to have been made available by the Government for that very reason, but when it had become a matter of public comment there was no point in pretending it did not exist. </para>

              <para>- PM did not have the document. The honourable member for Bendigo has said: That is right'. It is an improper allegation to state that a member has leaked a document.

The document was not available to <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> at the time, and I think such statements should not be allowed. </para>

          <para>- I am sure that all Australians will be delighted by the success of Australian wines at the important Paris Olympiad. Indeed, in one of the main classes for red wine, Australian wines won all four of the first places. I congratulate the wine producers. I am sure all honourable members will join me in that. Australian wines have consistently won international awards. Our exports of wine are increasing, but there is still a big job to do. Perhaps it ought to be noted that only about 2 per cent of Australian production is exported. Last year those exports were increased by about 15 per cent which was the first increase for five or six years. Traditionally, the wine producers themselves have undertaken the exports. Some markets in Scandinavia are new. Other important marketsJapan, Germany and the United Kingdom- are increasing. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Australian Wine Board has taken generalised promotion abroad and has recently appointed an international marketing manager, which we think will assist. The Government has made a number of efforts in respect of export market expansion and development. It has taken a direct interest in assisting those exports. Nevertheless, exporters of Australian wines, whether they be good South Australian wines or good Hunter Valley wines, are encountering difficulties in some markets, notably in Europe, in respect of labelling and certification, but the Australian Government is vigorous in endeavouring to remove those obstacles and to assist this worthwhile and high quality trade. </para>

I ask the Minister: What steps are taken to ensure that Australian Government aid truly reaches the scores of thousands of people in need?

            <para>-In relation to the aid purchased under previous arrangements and to previous Australian grants, and delivered by barge to Dili, Australian officials, as I have said in this House in answer to a question from the honourable member for Fraser, were satisfied with the storage and distribution facilities used for the aid. They were impressed also with arrangements that they saw for distribution of relief material. Indonesian authorities have, for that aid for that particular area and for those particular grants, provided satisfactory accounting for the distribution of that aid. We believe that the record of the Indonesian Red Cross in relation to its relief effort in East Timor is reasonably satisfactory. Similar conclusions were, in fact, drawn by New Zealand Red Cross officials following a visit to East Timor last January. There has been with later consignments of aid a hold-up which I have been concerned about. I have asked the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to investigate this and have the matter expedited. When I receive the Ambassador's report on that matter, I will advise the honourable member. </para>

              <para>-The honourable gentleman was concerned whether there would be an adequate demand for Australian uranium. It ought to be noted that there are 200 nuclear reactors operating in 22 countries at the present time and a similar number under construction in 29 countries. The reactors now being built have an average of around 70 per cent greater capacity than those now operating. Even if 400 or more additional reactors which are either firmly ordered or planned are excluded, what is now happening represents a three-fold expansion of uranium requirements over the next ten years. It is nonsense to suggest therefore, as some have done, that production from new Australian mines will not find a market in this situation. Indeed, after 1990, the question is not whether there will be a market for uranium but whether there will be productive capacity to meet the requirements of the reactors then in use. The interest already shown by companies wishing to acquire a share of the Government's participation in the Ranger project is an indication that industry shares the Government's view that a substantial future market exists for Australian uranium. </para>

            <para>- by leave- On 14 October 1976 the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> presented to the House on behalf of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence the Committee's report on The International Legal and Diplomatic Aspects of the Situation of Australians Possessing Dual or Plural Nationality'. This is a short statement on this matter. The report of the Joint Committee was presented on a realistic note by the honourable member with the comment that the problems of dual nationality are well nigh impossible of unilateral resolution by Australia. Further study has unfortunately confirmed that view. The difficulties that arise for Australian citizens from their dual nationality are however of continuing concern to the Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The House will recall that in my statement of 26 May 1 978 on consular services I dealt with the problems of dual nationality. Briefly, I indicated at that time that many migrants who are naturalised Australians, or in some cases their children who are natural born Australians, may be regarded by their countries of birth, or of their parents' birth, still to be citizens of those countries. Such dual nationals can be subject to the laws of the country of their first citizenship, who may claim jurisdiction over them in such matters as military service or taxation. My Department and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs attempt to make dual nationals aware of the problems they might encounter on return to their country of birth or ethnic origin. </para>
          <para>The requirement for assistance to dual nationals has inevitably grown as more foreignborn Australians return to visit their former homes. The problems of dual nationals cannot be overcome by citizens simply asserting that they do not accept their other citizenship. In some cases formal acts of renunciation are possible, but in other countries no such provisions exist; the requirements should be carefully established in advance. It is for the individual to ascertain and to bear the consequences of coming within the jurisdiction of another country which claims his or her citizenship, whether the individual or the Australian Government recognises that claim or not. I take this opportunity to repeat my earlier advice that consular officers can advise, but beyond a strict limit they cannot assist when in these circumstances the jurisdiction of another country is being asserted. My Department publishes a booklet called 'Hints for Australian Travellers', which is issued free with all Australian passports, and which is available from any office of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Australia and from any overseas Australian mission. This booklet contains information and advice on the problem of dual nationality. </para>
          <para>The report of the Joint Committee was referred to an interdepartmental committee drawn from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The interdepartmental committee's conclusions were endorsed by the three Ministers concerned. The committee's report and conclusions by departments have most recently been given consideration by the Government. </para>
          <para>The long-standing policy of the Australian Government of avoiding wherever possible the creation by its legislation of instances of dual nationality, while at the same time giving recognition to such status wherever it occurs, has been reaffirmed. The Government thus accepts the over-riding conclusion and recommendation of the committee. As I have indicated, responsible Ministers and departments are also active in disseminating information on dual nationality problems- another recommendation of the Joint Committee report. On the other hand, our conclusion is that there is no requirement as proposed in the report for new or additional machinery to investigate complaints by dual nationals. The recommendation that consideration should be given to replacing particulars of place of birth in Australian passports with particulars of place of residence has been dealt with in detail in my second reading speech on the Passports Amendment Bill. </para>
          <para>There remain two recommendations of the report calling for constructive action: That Australia should initiate relevant action in the United Nations and should give high priority to negotiating bilateral agreements to overcome dual nationality problems. Formidable difficulties of a political, legal and practical nature stand in the way of progress on dual nationality problems, either by way of bilateral or multilateral agreement. This cautious and, I might add, common assessment needs to be emphasised. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless the Government has decided, with respect to the report submitted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee, to study the prospects of negotiating bilateral agreements with certain countries. The Government also proposes to examine further the possibility of having the question of dual nationality examined in an appropriate forum of the United Nations. A further statement to the House will be made at a future time on this subject in the light of these studies. </para>
          <para>While speaking about this question of dual nationality I should mention that the Government is keenly aware of the concern felt by certain Australian citizens about the new Soviet law on citizenship which came into force on 1 July this year. The implications of this law are the subject of an urgent study in departments concerned, and the Australian Embassy in Moscow has formally sought clarification of certain points from the Soviet authorities. I hope that the Government will soon be in a position to provide guidance to those people who have made inquiries about this new law. In the meantime I can give an assurance that nobody will lose Australian citizenship through the operation of a law of another country. </para>

We are receiving advice in regard to that matter so that we can give detailed information not only to the honourable members who have made representations to me, but also to various individuals who have corresponded directly with me. The Soviet Union introduced fairly all-embracing laws regarding its citizenship and the ramifications of these laws should be responded to, I believe, with the best of legal advice available, both at private international law and public international law. That is why I say that I will be advising honourable members in due course. </para>

		      <para> by leave- It will be appreciated that I will be unable to refer to the Soviet law matter but I would like to make some other comments. We appreciate what the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> has done by making a statement. We are aware of the fact that there was a committee which reported some time ago as the Minister indicated. I am also aware of the conclusions and recommendations of that committee, which the Minister has suggested in good faith he will endeavour to implement if possible. </para>
			</talk.start>
            <para>We are aware of the situation in Australia. It is important that we try to get bilateral arrangements. If other countries are anxious to have us take their citizens- as many countries are because they are anxious to get the financial exchange which in many cases is remitted to them- it seems to be an appropriate time to suggest that those countries might enter into a bilateral arrangement whereby a citizen, on acceptance of nationality in Australia, is no longer obliged to be a dual national. I am aware of the international law which relates to the question of domicile of origin. It will be difficult to erase that law because the domicile of origin is related to birth. If one is born in another country there is going to be an issue always as to whether one is deemed to be originally a national of that country. Honourable members will notice that it is an accepted principle of international law that diplomatic protection may not be given by a state to a dual national of that state when he is in the country of the other nationality. So there are also problems in regard to international law. </para>
            <para>I am aware of what has been happening. The honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> is anxious to put certain matters before the Parliament,!^ Par and he is going to say a few words in a moment. We have made representations to other countries on the basis of those countries accepting passports which did not have the place of birth entered in them. From the answer given in the Senate on 1 1 October, it is pretty clear that many countries- such as Greece- are not prepared to accede to that request. We have the difficulty of countries not being prepared to accede to what I would say is a reasonable request. This will require further strong negotiation. The Opposition would give support to the Government in that area. We are also mindful of the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary </para>
            <para class="block">Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that the Hague Convention was of the opinion that a person should have only one nationality. Obviously it would be the nationality of the resident's permanent domicile. If honourable members look at page 5 of the report of the Committee, they will see that only 20 countries ever became parties to that particular Convention. Australia is one of those countries, but the major countries from which we obtain migrants are not parties to the Convention. </para>
            <para>We appreciate the efforts made by the Committee and by the Minister, but there is a long way to go. It would seem appropriate that we should be using some of our monetary muscle to indicate clearly to these countries that when citizens leave them and come to Australia, by a bilateral arrangement which we should negotiate at the time, and if they adopt our citizenship, they should be accepted by other countries as having one nationality only, namely, that of Australia. </para>

              <para>For example, between 1956 and 1958 the Soviet Union concluded bilateral agreements with Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, North Korea, Poland and Mongolia. These Conventions provide that persons who possess the citizenship of both contracting States and reside in the territory of one of them, may choose exclusively the citizenship of the other by filing a declaration to that effect with its Embassy within one year from the date of coming into force of the respective Convention. </para>

              <para>The declaration of choice is examined by the competent authorities to whom it has been submitted.

              <para>An example of a multipartite agreement to which the Committee made reference is the 1963 Council of Europe Convention on Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality and Military Obligations in Cases of Multiple Nationality. This Convention comprises two substantive chaptersChapter I concerns reduction of cases of multiple nationality and Chapter II concerns military obligations. Parties may apply both chapters, Chapter I with reservations and Chapter II, or Chapter II only. Only Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Luxembourg apply both chapters without reservations. Unlike the Conventions concluded between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, which require only that a person seek the consent of the State in which he is not resident but whose nationality he wishes to retain, Chapter II of the Council of Europe Convention requires that a person seek the consent of the State whose nationality he wishes to renounce. Such consent may not, however, be withheld if the person has not been a resident of that State for ten years and is at the time ordinarily resident in the State whose nationality he wishes to retain. </para>

          <para class="block">Paragraph 27 makes the following point: </para>

          <para>Persons who fail to express their choice of citizenship are to be regarded as citizens solely of their country of residence. Minors as a rule follow the citizenship of their parents. </para>
        </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the important point that we ought to aim at. If a person desires to have a citizenship of his new country of residence, as is the case with most of the people who have moved to Australia, he ought to be entitled to that citizenship, and exclusively that. That is the important point. The second point I would like to make is that the Council of Europe Convention on Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality and Military Obligations in Cases of Multiple Nationality in 1963, made a number of suggestions. I quote from paragraph 28 which reads: </para>
          <quote>
          <para>Unlike the Conventions concluded between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, which require only that a person seek the consent of the State in which he is not resident but whose nationality he wishes to retain, Chapter II of the Council of Europe Convention requires that a person seek the consent of the State whose nationality he wishes to renounce. </para>
          <para>Such consent may not, however, be withheld - </para>
        </quote>
          <para>That is important- if the person has been a resident of that State for ten years and is at the time ordinarily resident in the State whose nationality he wishes to retain. </para>
          <para class="block">My own view is that the Government ought to try to conclude bilateral agreements with the countries of Europe and other countries of origin of Australian citizens on the basis of either one of those criteria. As I said earlier I think that that would be of great satisfaction to Australian citizens whose origins were the co-called Soviet bloc countries- I admit that not all of them are Soviet bloc countries- and the countries belonging to the Council of Europe. </para>
          <para>The only other point I make- it was an important point that we raised in the report on dual nationality- concerns the question of whether the place of birth should appear on passports. The argument has been that the place of birth has to appear on passports because a number of countries will not accept passports if the place of birth does not apear on them. Paragraph 44 of the interdepartmental committee report states: </para>
          <quote>
          <para>The authorities of France, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa and Guyana stated that passports which did not show the place of birth would not be acceptable for travel to those countries. Jamaican authorities stated that if passports did not include this information, travellers would be required to provide other proof of place of birth. </para>
        </quote>
          <para class="block">The only point I make is that it is regrettable to my mind that a number of countries require the place of birth to be inserted in a passport before that passport is considered to be valid. I urge the Minister and the Department to take at least the first step in the right direction and to state clearly that Australia does not require foreign passports to contain the place of birth of the person carrying that passport before we accept that passport as being valid. I do not know whether at the present time we accept as being valid passports that do not show the place of birth. I think that it is purely a bureaucratic requirement or inertia and that we are used to having the place of birth put in passports. To my mind it is fairly irrelevant. There must be much better methods of obtaining the identity of a person, such as photographs or fingerprints, than the place of birth. </para>
          <para>I urge the Australian Government to state quite clearly that it does not require the place of birth to appear on foreign passports before it accepts those passports. I think that we should continue to press for the situation of passports for Australian citizens not being required to show the place of birth. The holder of the passport should have the opportunity either of not filling in that part of it or voluntarily having his place of birth inserted. Alternatively the place of residence, rather than the place of birth, could be shown so that Australian citizens born in certain countries are not afraid that they will be considered to be citizens of their country of birth, when they visit that country, or other countries, because their place of birth appears in the passport. I thank the House. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-In the last two weeks an issue has erupted that has angered Australian people, and Queenslanders in particular, in a manner that most members have not experienced in their lives in Parliament. This Government has announced that it is about to sign an agreement with the Japanese Government that will permit Japanese long-line fishermen to fish for black marlin within the Australian fishing zone. The size and scope of people's anger has quite clearly shocked and surprised both the Australian and Queensland governments but it appears to be insufficient to make them do anything about the matter. A number of members of parliament, including one Minister, have informed me that they have received more phone calls, letters, telegrams and petitions on this issue than on any other issue in their parliamentary careers. The arrogance and insensitivity of the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> is breathtaking. Despite the overwhelming opposition of the Australian people, and incidentally of many Government members, the Government insists that it will proceed to sign the agreement this afternoon. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It has been suggested by some quarters that the reason for people's anger is the fact that the fishermen are Japanese. In a few instances this may be true. Having flown to Cairns last Sunday to talk to people of north Queensland and to the fishermen in particular, I can assure the House, the Japanese people and the Japanese Government that the overwhelming majority of Australians are not interested in who takes the black martin, but only about the fact that they are being taken. If the long-line fishermen were French, American or British the objection to this act of negligence and gross vandalism would have been just the same. The reasons for Australians' anger over the Government's action or inaction is very simple. They know very well how important the resources of the Great Barrier Reef are to Australia. They know that the area off north Queensland is the greatest black martin fishing area in the world. The people of Australia have been made aware of the fact that, due to the past exploitation of the waters, the region is being denuded of one of its greatest assets. </para>
          <para>Let me make it clear that while the game fishermen may be leading the fight to save the black martin they are far from being the only people who are furious at the Government's action. North Queensland's prosperity depends to a great degree on tourism. I have said so many times before that the Great Barrier Reef is Australia's greatest tourist attraction. The thousands of people involved in tourism are equally concerned. The world knows that the Great Barrier Reef is one of the greatest ecological masterpieces in the world. In recent years the world has become aware of the threat to the Great Barrier Reef's survival from, firstly, the crown of thorns starfish, secondly, the Taiwanese clam fishermen, more recently the threat to drill for oil in its waters and now the long-line fishermen. Conservationists are equally concerned. The black martin is the symbol of north Queensland's tourist industry. If the black martin goes, so will a large part of the north Queensland and Australian tourism. </para>
          <para>This matter first surfaced, if that is the appropriate phrase, when the former Minister for Primary Industry, the right honourable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> announced the proclamation of the 200-mile nautical fishing zone. He stated in his speech to the House of Representatives on 25 September that negotiations were proceeding with the Japanese Government to provide access for Japanese fishing vessels to the Australian fishing zone. Within a matter of days it was announced that the Queensland Government would refuse to cooperate in the declaration of the Capricornia section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park unless the Australian Government renegotiated the agreement to exclude Japanese long-line fishermen because of the threat to black martin. From that moment the conflicting and confusing statements emanating from the new Minister for Primary Industry and the Queensland Government have been so conflicting and confusing that they would be laughable if the matter were not so serious. </para>
          <para>Without getting into this comedy of errors, let me point out that while originally professing great indignation at the agreement the Queensland Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline> now is an enthusiasic supporter of it. What became apparent when this matter was raised in the House was the incredible lack of knowledge of the Minister for Primary Industry and, even more, his lack of concern for the future of the black martin. When I asked him on 9 October on what scientific information concerning the population of black martin off the Great Barrier Reef did the Government decide to allow Japanese long-line fishermen access to fish for tuna and black martin, he provided the following priceless reply: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In all the discussions that have taken place in respect of martin fishing in these waters, whatever scientific evidence has been available has been used. One of the problems is that there is a complete lack of scientific evidence. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">When the House finally stopped laughing he went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The only evidence of any use at all is the experience the Japanese have gained from fishing these waters over the past 20 years. On that basis and on the knowledge of the history of fishing in these waters an agreement has been reached with the Japanese. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister is wrong on two counts. Firstly, scientific studies have been done and papers have been published on the black martin fishing area off north Queensland. Two papers, one published in 1965 by John Howard and Shoji Neyanagi and the other in 1972 by Isumi Nakamura, provided scientific evidence that the waters around Cairns are a major breeding ground for black marlin. Secondly, there is considerable evidence from responsible bodies that the black marlin catch is declining at an alarming rate. The United States Department of Commerce National Marine Fisheries Services 1978 report states that the catch rate from sport fisheries off Cairns had declined by 50 per cent from 1971 to 1976. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation statistics show a decline in the tonnage of black marlin landed in Japan from 2,200 tonnes in 1 97 1 to 772 tonnes in 1976. </para>
          <para>In 1975 the Japanese took 394 tonnes of black marlin from the Cairns region but in 1976, one year later, their catch dropped to 169 tonnes. This may not be scientific evidence but when these figures are considered alongside the fact that charter fishing operators from the Cairns region have reported a marked decline in the sightings of black marlin during the past two years one would have thought that the Minister for Primary Industry and his Department would have taken an educated guess and come to the view that something serious was happening to black marlin in the area off Cairns. A sensitive Minister would have said to himself: 'These figures indicate that something is wrong. Let us have a scientific study before we proceed with the agreement'. But no, the Minister prefers to take the risk and for a miserable $1.4m is prepared to allow the Japanese long-line fishermen to deplete black marlin stocks further to the point where black marlin may become an endangered species. </para>
          <para>I am sorry to have to say this but the Japanese record on conservation of the world's fishing resources is quite deplorable. We are all well aware of Japan's appalling record, along with that of the Russians, with regard to the whale. One could have some sympathy for Japanese fisher men if Japan were a poor developing country. But clearly it is not. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and it can well afford to buy other food to replace whale and marlin. The total value of the black marlin catch from Australian waters landed in Japan is an insignificant $750,000. To look at this in strictly monetary terms, Australia stands to lose a great deal more financially than the $1.4m that it will receive in licensing fees from the Japanese- the major portion, incidentally, being for tuna. At least 28 boats are engaged in charter for black martin sport fishing plus 10 mother ships for accommodation. Some 300 tourist fishermen pay more than $3m each year in charter fees alone, not to mention air fares, food, transport and a whole range of other goods and services that they pay for when they come to Australia, including of course the multiplier effect of - </para>

              <para>- As the honourable member for Parramatta reminds me, I imagine that those fishermen occasionally have a drink. There is also the multiplier effect on the tourist industry and the effect that has on the north Queensland economy. The publicity alone that people such as Lee Marvin and Jack Nicklaus bring to north Queensland is a major factor in building the aura of the region as an exciting tourist destination for hundreds of thousands of other visitors, both domestic and international, who come to the area even though they personally may never fish for marlin. In my view this answers the sort of charge made by my dear friend Mungo MacCullum, who wrote in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> that the campaign was to:  . . save the black marlin from marauding Japanese fishermen so that macho American actors like Lee Marvin can spend huge amounts of money coming to Queensland to catch one and be photographed with it. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">I point out to those who make this point that the sports fishermen catch only 100 black martin a year. The rest are tagged and released. The New South Wales State Fisheries Game Fishing Tagging Program, under which the catching and tagging in the region is supervised, reports that 1,200 martin have been caught and tagged during the past two years alone. So there is a very small ratio of one martin killed for every six which are caught and released. </para>
          <para>One would have thought and hoped that at least the Government would have insisted upon a provision in the agreement similar to that required by the United States Government. Since 1977 the United States has prohibited foreign long-line vessels operating in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters from keeping any billfish such as martin or sailfish if they are caught in the United States 200-mile fishing zone. United States observers are on board each fishing vessel at the fishermen's expense to see that all billfish caught are released. The Minister, who professes to be concerned about the problem, had not even heard about the United States regulation when I asked him a question about it yesterday. I understand that the United States is drafting similar regulations to apply to its Pacific waters next year. The Minister has made great play of the fact that Japanese long-line fishermen have been operating in this region for the past 20 to 30 years. That is totally irrelevant because, as the Minister well knows, under the previously existing law of the sea there was no way that we could have stopped them. The declaration of the Australian fishing zone under the new law of the sea enabled Australia to prohibit those fishing practices which we considered deleterious to Australia's resources. What the Minister has now done is to formalise and legalise these practices for a small fee. </para>
          <para>The agreement reached between the Commonwealth and Queensland supposedly restricts the Japanese fishermen from 80,000 square miles. The Australian fishing zone does absolutely nothing further to restrict Japanese fishermen other than to ban them from the Gulf of Carpenteria. Long-line fishermen would not fish in most of those 80,000 square miles anyhow. The agreement that prohibits them from 12 miles seaward of the 200-metre depth mark is absurd. In the Cairns area the 200-metre line is only 100 or so metres from much of the reef. Earlier the Queensland Government was publicly calling on the Federal Government not to allow long-lines any closer than 100 miles from the reef in an area 13 degrees south to 18 degrees south. This is still the call from fishing organisations and conservation groups. One of the most disgraceful episodes of this whole mess is the fact that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has not been consulted. This was made clear when on 1 1 October <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> the Minister for Science and the Environment, was asked a question about black marlin fishing. We have also been informed from reliable sources that the Department of Primary Industry is setting up a State-Commonwealth committee to investigate game fishing. It does not include representatives of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. When the Authority asked why it was not to be brought into the discussion it was told: 'You stick to tourism. Fishing is none of your business'. When one realises that the next section of the reef to be declared is likely to be the area between Lizard Island and Innisfail one wonders just what is going on. </para>
          <para>This is just another example of the total incompetence of this Government when it comes to protecting Australia's environment from predators. The Government still has not given an assurance that the Great Barrier Reef will not be drilled for oil. Taiwanese fishermen are still operating quite openly and taking hundreds of thousands of clams. And now we have an Australian government selling out the black marlin for a miserable few dollars. It is ironic that next week Australia Post will release four stamps dealing with fish that have a special significance to Australia. One of those stamps will be a 50c stamp showing a black marlin. If the Government does not move soon to end this outrage the only people who will see black marlin in future will be philatelists. As Lee Marvin has been mentioned in relation to this matter I finish by quoting what he said. He is one of our best known black marlin fishermen. He has made a public appeal to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> not to sign the fishing agreement with the Japanese because, he said: </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> does no service to the black marlin fishing industry, nor does he solve the problems facing it, when he speaks so emotionally, illogically and with a lack of information. It is interesting to note that this is the first time that the Opposition has started to take any interest in the welfare of Australia's fishing resources. Let us look at the current position. Till this point of time the Japanese have been fishing in Australian waters, unhindered, up to the 12-mile limit and in some cases, till 1 975, up to the 3-mile limit for the past 20 to 30 years. Why has not the Australian Labor Party expressed any concern about that? Till this point of time, fishing has been almost open slather. I can only say that the honourable member for Robertson is simply trying to score cheap political points. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One could readily ask the Opposition what its intentions would be, looking at its policy in respect of the 200-mile Australian fishing zone. Its policy states that a Labor government will without prejudice to the existing fishing industry establish Australian and joint international projects to exploit the 200-mile economic zone for control over fisheries. There is no mention in that policy of protecting the marlin. So let us not have any of the humbug that we had from the honourable member for Robertson. What the Opposition refuses to recognise in this matter is that as a result of the declaration of the 200-mile Australian fishing zone, Australia has been able for the first time to negotiate a fisheries agreement with Japan which places very considerable restrictions on its fishing activities within Australian waters. This agreement places on </para>
          <para class="block">Japanese activities limits which have never previously been imposed and with regard to the tuna long-line fishing the agreement can be renegotiated at the end of 12 months. This agreement is not life-long. It is re-negotiable after 12 months and within the period of the agreement it can and will be closely monitored. </para>
          <para>The Opposition completely and absolutely refuses to acknowledge the benefits of the agreement. It seems that fundamentally the Labor Party has adopted the view that Australia should not sign any fishing agreement with Japan and presumably with any other foreign country. That attitude totally ignores ALP policy, but more importantly it ignores Australia's international obligations and can be described only as completely irresponsible. In extending jurisdiction over a 200-mile fishing zone Australia gets certain rights but also has to assume certain obligations. Among these is a requirement from the Law of the Sea Conference 'that coastal States are required to have regard to the need to minimise economic dislocation in States whose nationals have habitually fished in the zone or have made substantial efforts in research and identification of stocks'. Japan fills both these criteria. The Japanese have been fishing these waters for 25 years. But despite this Australia has succeeded through the fisheries agreement to have Japanese fishing activities in Australian waters restricted over considerable areas around Australia, including the 80,000 square miles of water off Queensland. </para>
          <para>Let me explain some of the history which led up to this agreement. Preliminary discussions with regard to this proposed agreement took place in mid- 1978. Since then there have been consistent consultations through the Australian Fisheries Council, consisting of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and the Standing Committee on Fisheries, the South Eastern Fisheries Committee, the Northern Fisheries Committee and directly, as occasion required, by official discussions with the States concerned. In the last two weeks further discussions have been held on the martin issue. Last Friday a joint Commonwealth-Queensland officials meeting in Brisbane reached an agreed position on access by Japanese tuna long-line fishing vessels in waters off the north of Queensland. The Japanese Government has been notified of that agreement. Prior to signing the agreement the Japanese have been informed that the Australian Government will seek early consultations to examine the necessity or otherwise of an additional area off Cairns from which long-line tuna vessels should be excluded next year. Also more detailed studies will be undertaken during the period of the one year agreement to determine the full effects of Japanese long-line activities in Australian waters. The Japanese Government has been notified that in the ensuing months Australia will be paying particular attention to monitoring the arrangements as they affect game fishing stocks and activities in the Cairns area. Under the agreement the Japanese fishermen will be required to report the activities regularly, including catch information every six days. Their activities will also be subject to inspection by Australian officials at any time. These restrictions have not been imposed on Japanese fishing activities in the past. </para>
          <para>As I have already said, this agreement excludes Japanese fishing operations from considerable areas of Australian waters. Put in simple terms, these areas of exclusion on the east coast take in all waters inside the 200-mile isobath. This includes all the Great Barrier Reef and the continental shelf. In addition, on the east coast there is further exclusion of long-liners from a strip of water some 3,600 square miles in area between 14 degrees 20 minutes south and 18 degrees. This is the area fished by northern Queensland game fishermen. In both these areas, there is total exclusion of Japanese longline vessels accounting for a total area of about 80,000 square miles of water. None of these exclusions would have been possible without a fisheries agreement with Japan. Around the remainder of Australia Japanese long-liners are excluded from operating in large areas of waters in the south-east, across the Great Australian Bight and off the Northern Territory either completely or on a seasonal basis. Otherwise their operations are excluded from all waters within 12 miles of the Australian coastline or its islands. These conditions are precisely defined in the proposed agreement relating to Japanese longline access. </para>
          <para>Let me stress another point about this agreement in respect of long-line vessels. It will be an agreement for only one year. During the year, as I have said, we will be closely monitoring the working of it and the effects of the Japanese long-line activities. We will be taking into full account the views of interested parties, including the observations of game fishing organisations. I am advised that statistics do not indicate evidence that the operations of the Japanese longliners are seriously affecting martin stocks m waters off north Queensland nor that they are having an adverse effect on the appeal of big game fishing as a sport and tourist attraction. Members of the Opposition might be interested to know that the Japanese claim that this agreement will result in a considerably reduced fish take. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Robertson tried to make capital from what I said the other day in answer to a question about the lack of research information. Let me make the point again that there has been no Commonwealth funded or effective research into marlin or other bill fish, but there has been considerable research and scientific evidence available to and used by the Commonwealth in relation to fisheries. The Commonwealth has not involved itself directly because until now it has had no jurisdictional responsibility in this area. However, all information on the various examinations that have been carried out has been available to the Department of Primary Industry and has been used by the Department in its assessment of the situation. These research programs have provided information into breeding areas, fishing patterns, migratory patterns, the size of marlin stocks and age distribution within stocks. On the basis of all this information there is no evidence that marlin or tuna fish stocks in the Coral Sea are under any biological threat through present fishing activity. I think the honourable member for Robertson does a disservice by trying to build this up into an emotional issue. Indeed statements in recent days by game fishermen spokesmen bear this out, On <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> yesterday the  President  of the Cairns Game Fishing Club, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jock</inline> Izatt reiterated a point which he made on Australian Broadcasting Commission radio in Brisbane the day before. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is absolutely no evidence we have found that we have to hand to suggest that the black marlin is an endangered species. Catches have been variable from year to year over the past 30 years. But, definitely nothing to suggest that they are an endangered species. There's still plenty of good fish up here. </para>

              <para>- I suggest he would know more about it than the honourable member would. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Izatt,</inline> who is the  President  of the Cairns Game Fishing Club, said on Brisbane radio in the last couple of days. He also said- this is the truth- that the whole affair had become a political football. He said that the people who have been making statements have not the knowledge- I think he is referring to the honourable member for Robertson- or the right to make statements on behalf of the areas in the far north of Queensland. However, should there be any evidence of deterioration in the stocks of marlin or tuna fish during the 12 months of the agreement with the Japanese it will be within the power of the Commonwealth to modify any future agreements in order to protect Australian fishing interests. </para>

          <para>It is worth looking further at the protection and benefits that the 200-mile Australian fishing zone offers to Australia. The essential effect is that foreign fishermen operating within the 200-mile zone will be in breach of the law unless they have an Australian licence and they comply with terms and conditions of access determined by Australia. Australia will determine the total allowable catch; the catch that will be taken by Australians, and the allocation to foreign countries of any available surplus. Foreigners will not be allowed to fish areas fully exploited by Australians or likely to be exploited in the near future. The allocation to foreign fishermen will be reduced as Australians develop the capacity to operate in specific areas. Foreigners will not be allowed to fish areas fully exploited by Australians or likely to be so exploited in the near future. Allocations to foreign fishermen will be reduced as Australians develop the capacity to operate in specific areas. </para>
          <para>Let me summarise: Australia is now in a far better position than ever before with regard to Japanese fishing activities in our waters. For the past 30-odd years, the Japanese have been operating freely up to 12 miles off the Australian coastline. They are now required to report details of their catch and operation every six days. Their activities are subject to inspection by Australian officials at any time. Japanese tuna long-line vessels are excluded at present from a total area of 80,000 square miles off the Queensland coast; and that has never been the case before. All this is the result of negotiations among the Commonwealth, the Queensland Government, industry organisations and the Japanese. </para>
          <para>We have now served notice on the Japanese that we will be closely monitoring the effects of their fishing activities on the tuna and marlin stocks off the Queensland coast. If there is need to exclude their long-liners from additional waters, they will be excluded in future agreements. We will be conducting studies which will include input by game fishermen organisations throughout the duration of this 12 month agreement. Australia will not allow the marlin or tuna stocks to be dangerously depleted. There is no evidence at present to suggest that past fishing activities by the Japanese are leading to such a situation. For the first time ever, the entire question of Japanese long line fishing activities has been brought under control to a position where it can be monitored and its effects studied. </para>
          <para>As a result of a meeting that I had last night with representatives of New South Wales and Queensland game fishing organisations, a working committee is to be established to monitor the progress of the agreement. The committee will be made up of Commonwealth, Queensland and New South Wales government officials and representatives of game fishing organisations. </para>

              <para>-The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is not in it because it is not even in the zone of fishing. That is the simple reason. The fishing begins way beyond the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. It is as simple as that. I have also agreed to put to the Government as soon as possible a request by the game fishing delegation that Australia seek a voluntary withdrawal by the Japanese of their tuna long-line fishing vessels from operating in waters off the Queensland coast between 13 degrees and 18 degrees south during the period of the agreement. I can assure the House, as I assured the delegation which saw me last night, that the Australian Government is vitally concerned to ensure adequate protection of the marlin fishery off north Queensland. We will not allow long line fishing activities to jeopardise that fishery. </para>

That is what the motion moved by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> is all about. He is asking this House to agree to allow a Minister to gag a debate on the introduction of a police state. </para>

          <para>I remember speaking at a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Majorca how I astounded some of my co-delegates when I set out some of the complaints I had against the laws and the government of this country. I said that I lived in a country in which people could be forced to fight against their will in an undeclared foreign war; a country in which men could be sent to gaol for refusing to work at a rate of pay fixed by somebody sitting as an arbitrator. I said that I belonged to a country which had a Crimes Act which made it a crime to decide to withhold one's labour until one got a rate of pay that one considered to be justifiable. I went through all the complaints I had about Australia but I concluded my speech by saying: 'But with all the things I have enumerated with which I disagree I have one advantage over most of the delegates at this conference. The advantage is this: When I go back to Australia after condemning my own government in the manner in which I have, nobody will put his hand on my shoulder as I get out of the plane and say "Come with me".' I remarked that to me that represented an enormous advantage. It was something that distinguished my country from those of many of the delegates who had spoken at the same conference. </para>

              <para>-The proposal to gag the debate on a matter such as this must be unprecedented. I could not now go to another international conference and make concluding remarks of the kind I did at the IPU meeting in 1967. This Government is not a democratic government. It treats the Parliament with utter contempt, otherwise it would not have moved a motion such as that which has been moved. This Government is being governed by public servants who are not answerable to anybody. It does not care two hoots for the Parliament. We may as well all pack up, go home and allow the Government to ram through its dictatorial legislation without debate. One would have thought that the Government would at least have gone through the pretence of making it appear that we are living in a democracy. </para>

          <para>I do not know of any democracy in the world in which such a motion could be moved. In the United States a Bill such as the ASIO Bill could certainly not be railroaded through the Congress without proper debate. It was bad enough pushing through the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill without debate and without letting those who wished to make contributions have their say, but to push through a proposal that affects the liberty of every single human being in this country is the last straw. I asked in the debate yesterday- I repeat it now- why is my private residence under almost constant surveillance? That is what I want to know. The Minister will not answer the question. </para>

I warn the Government that once it has set the police state apparatus in motion there is no way that it can unwind it. There is no going back on it. We are taking steps from which there is no possible retreat. We are elected by our various constituencies to put a point of view. I remind the House that that view is widely held by people all over Australia. Those honourable members who will vote to gag the most important debate that any of us in the Parliament have listened to for the past two or three years are representing people who will not support them in what they are going to do. People do not agree with the police state propositions which the Government is trying to push through the Parliament without debate. </para>

              <para>-Of course it is a police state. I repeat that it is a police state and I make no apology for saying that. It is a police state purely and simply, without any qualification at all. The Minister can grin. He does not seem to care whether this country is a police state. His behaviour today is a behaviour of a Minister of a police state. Honourable members opposite should not grizzle. I repeat that the Minister's behaviour today is the behaviour one would expect from a Minister of a police state. No self-respecting democracy in the world would try to push this sort of legislation through without the people's representatives having the right to say what their constituents think about the matter. Honourable members are not cheating us. They are cheating the people we represent. They are cheating not only the people whom we on this side of the Parliament represent but also the people whom they represent. They do it smugly with an arrogant indifference to the effect of what they are doing. They do not care that the people's representatives are being prevented from saying what they want to say. They sit smugly, satisfied that because they have the numbers they can do what they like. I do not mind their using their numbers to win a vote after there has been a fair and reasonable debate but I reject and resent their using their numbers to prevent a proper debate before the vote is taken. </para>

          <para class="block">In giving the reasons for introducing this limitation to the debate, let me explain that it has been found necessary during this Budget session to create a balance between the Budget debate, the debates within Estimates committees and the debates on the Budget Bills as well as debates on other important legislation which is before the House. Included in those important Bills are those upon which this limitation of debate is being placed. Let me point out to the House that already there has been very extensive debate on all these Bills in the other place and in this House. The time taken in the Senate for debate on these Bills was just under 30 hours. Already in this House we have spent some 18 hours and 15 minutes in debate. With the time now allotted before completion there will be a total of 2 1 hours debate in this House. Therefore I think that all honourable members will appreciate that with 5 1 hours of debate on this Bill the Government has allowed very extensive time. I have previously advised the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> and the Manager of Opposition Business that the Government is anxious to complete the passage of these Bills by this evening. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table setting out particulars of the amount of time taken in debate in this House as well as the figures that I have mentioned relating to debate in the Senate. </para>

              <para>- Just in case the Opposition should think that the Government is using a heavy hand in bringing about this limitation of debate on these Bills, let me just compare the experience of the Parliament under the present Government since it was elected to office late in 1975 and the experience when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fred</inline> Daly was Leader of the House between autumn of 1973 and the Budget of 1975. I remember this very well because Fred Daly as Leader of the House for the Labor Government, was a very good mentor. Just to show the earnestness with which this Government approaches the operation of the Parliament and the opportunity for debate in this Parliament, I mention these total figures. Under the former Labor Government, Bills initiated totalled 694; Bills passed, 504; closures, 404; matters of public importance, 93; and guillotines 26. That was 26 guillotines involving 59 Bills. Under the present Government, the totals are: Bills initiated, 618; Bills passed, 581; closures, 296; matters of public importance, 154, against the Labor Government's 93; and guillotines, 3. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition rejects the motion moved by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner).</inline> I think it is quite a specious argument to talk about who moved so many guillotines in the past. There have been no Bills like these in the Government's legislation program before. There would be no more important pieces of legislation in Australia than these Bills. A report on the security service took some years to prepare. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope travelled the world to gather information on how an intelligence organisation should be run in this country. He said that it ought to be run on a bipartisan basis. I cannot think of anything more ridiculous or more confrontationist than to say at this stage that the Government will guillotine debate on this legislation. This action will guarantee that everybody in the country who feels that there is something wrong with this legislation will go out and agitate against it. So they should, as this is a democratic country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>How do we expect to maintain democracy in this country if these Rafferty rules apply to the consideration of this legislation which has been dragged into this Parliament as a stop-gap matter for debate over the past two months. The Government has never set aside a consecutive period of days for discussion of this Bill. We are talking about the liberties of the people. We are not talking about Fred Daly, how many guillotines he moved or how many pieces of legislation were passed by such a device. We are talking about the rights of the people. Not one of the amendments moved by the Opposition has been accepted. The Government has a Charlie McCarthy type of proposition here: Whatever we put up cannot be accepted. At least in the Senate the senators did have some discussions on this legislation. Some amendments were accepted. In terms of the Government adopting a flexible approach to or acknowledging any expertise in the suggestions that we make, this arrangement is a phony one. </para>
          <para>Let us put the argument very clearly. I discussed this matter with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> on a television program. He said that the Leader of the Opposition would be entitled to as much information as he as Attorney-General had. When we moved the amendment yesterday, that proposition was rejected by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. This is the sort of nonsense we get. It demonstrates the duplicity of standards in intelligence gathering in this country. Let us make this point very clear: If the Government does not get the co-operation of the Opposition, it will have no intelligence system. Let us make that very clear indeed because that is the very problem we face at the present time. How does the Government expect to maintain the democratic forces in this country if it is to deny to an Opposition the chance to move amendments. Honourable members should look at the dme schedule allowed for the discussion of the Bills. Within an hour and a half, we have to debate another 19 amendments. Government members have been participating in the debate as often as we have. </para>
          <para>The Government has allocated an hour and a half to the debate on the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1 979 (No. 2 ) to which we propose another 16 amendments. Why have a debate at all? Why not guillotine consideration of the legislation now? That is the Government's standard. Do not worry too much when eruptions take place outside, public meetings and national protests are held, or anything else occurs because of the standard that has been adopted by the Government. Does the Government think that it will hold the line on the basis that because it passes certain legislation by the use of the guillotine device here it will be able to explain to the people outside that it gave the Opposition the opportunity for a bipartisan debate on this matter. It did nothing of the sort. The Opposition has carefully prepared and circulated 25 amendments and they require a lot of consideration. We have now reached consideration of amendment No. 6. We therefore have 19 to go and only an hour in which to deal with them. I put it to honourable members - </para>

            <para>-I second the amendment and, in speaking to the amendment, I make this point: I have never heard two more specious arguments than those used by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> who is at the table. I listened to the constitutional nonsense that is involved in his motion. What we are told is that if a period is spent in the Senate debating a particular Bill, that is time, presumably in the view of this Government, that ought to be deducted from the debating time in this House. The logic of that argument presumably is that if the Senate spent double that amount of time in considering the legislation, there would be no need at all for debate in this chamber on these matters. That is not only constitutional nonsense from the Minister. He is a lawyer and he knows it is constitutional nonsense. It is also political hypocrisy of the worst sort. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of course, the other argument is that we look at what a government did at some other time. Many present members of this Parliament were not in this Parliament at the earlier time referred to. To say that what somebody did in the past is binding upon honourable members who were elected to this House at the last election is constitutional nonsense also. Let us look at the substance and the merits of the argument. What we are being told is that it is more important for honourable members to have two hours for dinner. This is the reality of the argument. The great </para>
          <para class="block">Liberal Party- the party that talks about liberty and freedom believes that it is more important for all members on the Government side to be able to go and wine and dine for two hours than to allocate more than an hour and a half to consider the main Committee stages of the legislation.

              <para>- The honourable member for Canberra wants to put a gag on himself. I do not blame him. Most of the things he says are so unintelligent that he ought to apply a gag to himself. But there are many of us who are concerned about the rights and the liberties of the people of Canberra. I do not believe that, because, the honourable member or some of his colleagues wander off into a room with a handful of food and some bottles of wine and talk about great matters affecting the Liberal Party and the nation, they are discharging their obligations. What honourable members opposite are saying is that they can have two hours for those sorts of meetings but only an hour and a half is to be allocated for members of this Parliament to debate this Bill. What honourable members opposite are paid for is to put their arguments in this Parliament, to stand up and argue the issues that are involved in this very important legislation. There is no single piece of legislation that deals with the rights and liberties of the Australian people that is as important as this legislation. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Braithwaite),</inline> who is trying to interject, comes in here only to put up his hand to suggest the guillotine. He has not been present for any stage of the debate on these Bills. Of course, he is in here now to give the Government the numbers. I endorse very strongly the views previously put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron).</inline> He said quite properly that the Government by virtue of the numbers that it has in this House is entitled to use those numbers in order to get whatever legislation it wants through the Parliament. We understand that that is how the process works. If this process is destroyed it demeans this Parliament. It makes a laughing stock of the Parliament when the Government uses its numbers to deny honourable members the right to argue these issues fully, within the framework of their conscience, and to put the argument that they want to put. That is what it comes down to. </para>

              <para>- I would defend the right of the honourable gentleman opposite to get up and put his argument. I concede that he has been in the chamber for most of the debate, but I, and the people who elected him, want to hear his argument. On an issue as important as this I believe the Parliament does itself a great disservice when honourable members opposite simply walk in, and put up their hand for the gag and say: 'We have the numbers and we are going to use them'. Honourable members opposite should not believe that by gagging this Parliament they are going to stop the debate. The debate concerning these issues will continue in the community. They are important issues, and the debate will go on. </para>

            <para>- I must say that I am somewhat surprised at this rather feigned anger to which we have just had to listen. Usually, when the guillotine is introduced, there is an immediate reaction. One hears cries from the Opposition at the way in which it is being treated. It was remarkable that today, when notice was given of this motion and the suspension of Standing Orders was moved on this most important question, as it was described by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> there were no cries of anger. </para>

              <para>- There was no concern expressed and there was no reference to jack-boots, as my honourable friend mentions. There were so few honourable members opposite interested in hearing the discussion that there were not enough of them to rise to their usual chorus. One of the honourable members opposite even had to go to the trouble of calling for a quorum. Usually members of the Opposition wait outside the door to make the Government provide the numbers- we all know about that tactic- but on this occasion an honourable member was madly waving to his friends to come into the chamber. One person to whom he waved was the honourable member for Bonython <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Blewett),</inline> who was wandering about outside, wondering whether to come into the House to help provide the audience to give us this demonstration of concern. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>One might be convinced if one thought that all honourable members of the Opposition were basically interested in this subject, wanted to see it discussed and had new information to bring to us, which matters they wanted to be put on public record. Of the 37 members opposite only 14 have spoken in this debate at any stage. There have been many opportunities for them to do so. Yesterday we had to listen to four or more honourable members opposite making speeches twice in order to ensure that the debate was continued as long as possible. Honourable members on this side of the House are expected to sit back and allow the proceedings of the House to be thwarted in this way. If honourable members opposite had been in that position, we all know what would have happened. We know from their record what has happened in that situation. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> quoted from the record of the Opposition. I am surprised that some of the newer members of the Opposition do not take the time to read through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in order to see what that record was. They might care to dissociate themselves from it. I would be happy to hear from them if they did. I do not think anybody really expects them to do that. During the term of office of the previous government some 59 Bills were dealt with in 26 guillotines. During the term of office of this Government only three such procedural mechanisms have been used. I am quite prepared to put that record against the record of the Opposition at any time. I admit that the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill is an important piece of legislation. If it were not necessary for the business of the Parliament to proceed perhaps I would be prepared to give honourable members opposite extra time. I enjoyed the debate so much yesterday when honourable members opposite demonstrated their differences of opinion on this question, that I would like to see them given more time to develop those differences. </para>

              <para>-I said that if it were not important to the procedures of this House that the legislation be dealt with I would be happy to give the Opposition an opportunity to do that. But of course we all know about the Opposition and its differences of opinion. We have started to see them emerging in relation to the debate that has taken place already. But one of the most remarkable propositions was put by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding)</inline> in relation to committees, when he referred to my friend the honourable member for Canbera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Haslem).</inline> He was suggesting that the Liberal Party decides matters behind closed doors and closets itself away to make decisions affecting the welfare of the nation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Now who is really fooling whom? Caucus is something that I have heard about. If the Labor Party thinks it can do without its Caucus to decide how it is going to vote on these important questions, or to bring everybody into line to ensure that nobody with a different view will be able to vote, let us have the Parliament meet on Wednesday mornings. Then we will see whether the Labor Party wants to do without Caucus. Even the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron),</inline> who has a different point of view, will not be able to vote and give effect to that point of view in this House. Honourable members opposite are the people who need the opportunity to get behind closed doors in order to decide their approach. When those sorts of remarks are made during debate it is clear to the people of Australia which party has an admirable record in relation to opportunities to speak on these questions. </para>

        <para>During the weekend just passed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples phoned me at my home to ask whether I knew whether there was any truth in the newspaper reports that the Minister for Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> had been the person responsible for leaking to the Press a copy of the letter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples. I told him- the ASIO tape recording of our conversation will confirm this-that I refused to believe that the Minister had leaked it; that I believed it had been leaked by other persons, perhaps from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I asked him whether he had sent copies to the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations, the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the employers. This had also been reported in some of the newspapers. He told me quite emphatically that no copy of his letter had gone to the ACTU. I then warned him that I had been informed on impeccable authority that his telephone was under tap. I said to him: 'If you want to say anything more to me that is likely to be of a confidential nature I ask you not to proceed because our telephone is under tap'. </para>

            <para>-He rang me to ask- I repeat what I said earlier- whether I believed there was any truth in newspaper reports that the Minister for Industrial Relations had been the one responsible for leaking a copy of his letter. I denied it. I said that I did not believe that the Minister would do it; that there would be no mileage in it for him; and I am now astonished to learn that somebody from his office, apparently without his knowledge, had done exactly that. I repeat that the tape recording of the conversation which ASIO has in its possession will confirm those remarks. </para>

        <para>It is terribly important that the Minister have the right to call for dossiers and for the files that ASIO might keep. I cite no better case than the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Lionel Murphy, as he now is. When he was the Attorney-General, one Thursday night after the Senate adjourned he decided to go to the headquarters of ASIO in Canberra with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kerry</inline> Milte and Maureen Barron to have a talk about concern that was being expressed by the Commonwealth Police regarding the security of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, who was expected to arrive in Canberra within a few days time. ASIO had previously said that there would be no threat to the Prime Minister's life. It had to say this, because this was the story it had kept feeding to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> when he was Attorney-General. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> got to the ASIO headquarters he discovered that in point of fact ASIO had received information that it was the intention of Croatian terrorists to put cyanide in the air conditioning system of the Lakeside Hotel. </para>
        <para>What I am telling the Parliament now has never been revealed before but it has to be revealed now because it is germane to the clause that we are talking about. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> asked the people at ASIO: 'What have you done about this threat?' They replied: 'We have put telephone taps on all the people who we believe might be involved in this attempt to kill the Prime Minister'. He asked: 'What does the telephone tapping reveal?' They replied: 'Oh, we do not know because we have not transcribed the recordings yet'. He asked: 'When do you propose to transcribe them?' They replied: 'Oh, it won't be for a while- perhaps a week or so after the Prime Minister leaves Australia'. He asked: Have you photographs of the Croatian suspects?' They answered: 'Oh, yes, we have photographs'. He asked: 'Have you given photographs to the Lakeside Hotel? "They replied: 'Oh no, but that is a jolly good idea. We have given the Lakeside the names'. He asked: 'Couldn't they change their names?' They agreed: 'Of course, but you have a good idea, Attorney-General. We will give the Lakeside the photos of the suspects'. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>then said: 'Now I want to have a look at the file, if I may'. So the people at ASIO handed over the file. Among other things, in the file <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> discovered that there had been a secret meeting among officers of the Department of Immigration, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General's Department, his own Department and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet at which these officers had decided that they would inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> that his answer to a question relating to Croatian terrorism should be in the form of a lie. </para>

            <para>-The honourable member says that Lionel Murphy told him that. I can tell him that somebody else told me the same so that confirms it. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> saw in the file was so disturbing that he decided that he would there and then make arrangements to go to Melbourne immediately next day to check on other vital, quite sensational revelations shown up in that file. He sought to make a booking on a VIP aircraft first thing next morning and could not do so because one was not available. But ASIO was immediately told of his attempt to get a VIP aircraft and started to prepare for his visit to the ASIO headquarters in Melbourne next day. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> went to the airport on the Friday morning- I was standing alongside him and I can bear witness to the fact that I heard Murphy go through this dialogue- he asked whether he could be given a seat on the aircraft. He was told to his astonishment that every seat was taken up. He said: 'It cannot be that every seat is taken up. Is everybody on yet?' The reply was:' No, but there have been some bookings made by ASIO for all the empty seats. It was not until Murphy discovered about the phantom bookings made by ASIO, for the purpose of preventing his getting a seat to Melbourne, that he asserted his authority as head of ASIO and demanded that seats be given to him. </para>

        <para>ASIO was quite prepared to pay for booked seats it was not going to use in order to prevent its own Minister travelling with one of its officers. On the flight Murphy found himself sitting next to an ASIO officer named Marshall who had been told by his headquarters in Melbourne to bring with him a particular file. Murphy said: What have you got there?' The officer replied: 'I have got a file'. Murphy said: 'I want to have a look at it'. The officer said: 'I am sorry, you cannot have a look inside this file because I am working for the Director-General of ASIO, not for the Attorney-General'. Murphy, it was reported, said: 'You are now working for me; hand it over'. When he had a look at the file what he discovered was nothing short of startling.

          <para>- I wish to make some brief remarks concerning the amendment. But first let me deal with what the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> said last night at 10.29. 1 think everyone in this chamber, certainly those on this side, would consider that outrageous allegations have been made, in effect, against the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> although the honourable member was not prepared to say that, because it is the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Attorney-General who must approve the issue of a warrant on the recommendation of the Director-General. The allegation was that a phone tap had been put on the private phone of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It is an outrageous allegation because, among other things, the honourable member would know that the present practice of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Attorney-General in relation to parliamentary questions concerning ASIO is not to comment, that is, neither to confirm nor to deny any allegations or presumed allegations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope in volume I of the fourth report at page 2 1 9 said that he thought that that practice should continue except in very special circumstances. Paragraph 781, at page 259, under the heading 'Parliamentary Responsibility' in the recommendations of that same volume, states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>That the present practice, whereby the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the ASIO Act do not confirm or deny any allegations, or presumed allegations, in respect of ASIO, continue in force. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I am sure the honourable member for Hindmarsh knew of that recommendation. Notwithstanding that, he was prepared to make those allegations. I also notice that it was reported on one radio station this morning that the honourable gentleman was not prepared to repeat the allegations outside the chamber. I should however point out that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has already had a number of briefings by the Director-General of ASIO. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to have a briefing concerning the allegation by the honourable member, the Government will certainly facilitate that briefing by the Director-General. As to the other allegations concerning the conduct of ASIO and  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy, it is a matter of rehashing what was a great political scandal at the dme. I do not intend to embark upon any comment on it. </para>
        <para>In directing my attention to the amendment moved by the Opposition, I would say that the Bill, as now drafted, gives effect to the longstanding philosophy that while the Minister responsible, that is, the Attorney-General, should in a general way be responsible for the activities of the Organisation- and I refer to the speech by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> in 1956- he should not concern himself with the details of the activities of the Organisation except insofar as this is necessary for the carrying out of the Minister's responsibilities. The Opposition's amendment assumes that the Attorney-General could police the activities of the Organisation by ascertaining the existence or non-existence of specific files but without access to contents. This is a fallacy because the mere existence of a file in the Organisation is virtually meaningless. The best example I can give of that is that files are kept on persons having a top secret clearance. Surely it can be assumed that the Director-General, whoever he or she is, having regard to the manner of his or her selection will truthfully and accurately report to the Attorney-General as required. Likewise, the Director-General must be prepared to answer the questions of the Leader of the Opposition in regular consultations. </para>
        <para>The proposal to give the Minister a right of access to files as a method of policing the activities of the Organisation is, with the greatest respect to the Opposition and particularly the honourable member for Hindmarsh, based on a crude misunderstanding of the real position. Furthermore, the Opposition directly seeks to intrude politics and political considerations into the operations of ASIO. The Government believes that the general power of direction given to the Attorney-General in clause 8 of the Bill, meeting as it does the longstanding philosophy, does provide the Parliament through the ministerial responsibility of the Attorney-General with a safeguard to watch over the affairs of ASIO together with the other safeguards that are built into the exercise of special powers, the requirement of an annual report and the requirement of regular consultation and briefings with the Leader of the Opposition. Therefore, the Government opposes the amendment. </para>

        <para class="block">The Opposition's amendment No. 7 seeks to omit from clause 18 the words 'or relates to the performance by the Organisation of its functions'. Under clause 18 a person is unable to communicate any information or matter that has come to his knowledge by reason of having been an officer or employee of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The clause refers to information or matter that relates to the performance by the Organisation of its functions. We think that provision is far too wide. It is important that there be freedom of information. We should bear in mind what has happened in America with the Central Intelligence Agency. A lot of information was disclosed by former officers. This is a healthy exercise. The disclosure of information that clearly indicates some clandestine operations which had been undertaken should not have been perpetrated. This is a democratic country. We do not want a position in which former officers and employees are unable to communicate information relating to the performance of the Organisation in relation to the way it works. We do not want detailed information. We want to know how the Organisation works. The clause lays down a heavy penalty. There is a discretion as to whether an offence can be dealt with summarily or on indictment. Upon summary conviction, the penalty is a fine not exceeding $ 1 ,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and on indictment it is imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. They are very substantial penalties indeed. </para>
        <para>From our point of view, this clause would be improved if we were to delete the reference which relates to the performance by the Organisation of its functions. We propose adding to the end of this clause this discretion which relates to the question of action being taken by way of prosecution either summarily or on indictment. We say that it has to be with the consent of the Attorney-General, 'which consent shall not be given unless the Attorney-General is satisfied that the communication the subject of the prosecution had, or would be likely to have, the effect of seriously prejudicing security'. In other words, it has to be pretty substantial offence. If we leave it as it is in the Bill we will really create a situation whereby public comment by ASIO officials will be denied. I do not think that that is at all effective, particularly if they are former employees, from the point of view of how they see, particularly from a conscience point of view, the operations of the Organisation. Where else can they go with that sort of conscience position? To whom can they go and talk about the problems that they have? They cannot go back to the Director-General; he happens to be their superior. They really are not able to go to the Attorney-General because that would involve all the other problems that we have been talking about. It is important that later on we have a judicial audit. We would like to think that, if there were some matter of close security, there could be an opportunity for an officer to talk to the judicial auditor about matters. But in matters relating to the Organisation in the performance of its functions, we think it imperative that there be as much information as possible given to the public and to the Parliament and that no penalty be imposed on employees on that basis. </para>
        <para>What we are proposing here is a better drafting exercise than has been perpetrated in clause 18. That is the whole idea of debate in the Committee stage. We are not here to say that there has not to be some obvious prohibition against the disclosure of information which relates to security or which would prejudice officers in that intelligence organisation. Far be it from that. But the proposal to leave it in the form of not imparting any information which would relate to the performance by the Organisation of its functions is far too wide. </para>

This would simply require the Attorney-General to be satisfied, before issuing a warrant, that no other form of obtaining the information would be successful. </para>

          <para>- It is very important that a qualification as proposed in new clause 23A as moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> be agreed to to make sure that, if the enormous powers of this section are in fact used, it must be on reasonable grounds. I draw the attention of the Committee again to the case that I mentioned yesterday, that is, the trial of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr W.</inline> B. Sutch in February 1 975 in New Zealand. That case provides the best example that we know about the organisation and operation of security services in the Southwest Pacific. There is no comparable case in Australia that we know of. This New Zealand case is the best example. It is the Mount Everest of security work in the South Pacific; the tip of the iceberg. Not only is it the best example; it is almost the only example. It provides the most clear cut evidence of how a security service works. I put the initials 'SS' in my notes and I think that perhaps in the circumstances they are appropriate. We are justified in assuming that the evidence adduced in the Sutch case is, at best, of superior quality to the evidence in the files that we know nothing of or, at worst, of similar quality or worse than most of the evidence in the files. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There was a series of incidents in New Zealand during the period of the Labour Government, first of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kirk</inline> and then of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rowling,</inline> which involved Security Intelligence Service activity, carefully leaked to the then Opposition leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Muldoon.</inline> The incidents involved members of the Labour Cabinet, Labour members of parliament and members of the Labour Party organisation. In the case of the Sutch prosecution, the Labour Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Finlay,</inline> was put in an excruciating position. He did not think much of the prosecution case but, if he failed to authorise the prosecution, inevitably it would have leaked through to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Muldoon</inline> and the Opposition would have said: 'There you are. The Labour Party is going against the Security Intelligence Service and is sabotaging the national interest'. So, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Finlay</inline> authorised the prosecution. I have no reason to assume that same type of activity as happened in the Sutch trial would not happen here in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and has not happened in the pastthat is, political harassment of a kind where it is very difficult to fight back. For example, they can tap our telephones but we cannot tap theirs. So it gives the ordinary citizen or even the ordinary member of parliament very little fight-back capacity. </para>
        <para>The New Zealand experience is a grisly example that we ought to examine very thoughtfully. The report of that trial is really instructive and I urge all honourable members including the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott),</inline> who is at the table, to examine it. I think that the most charitable description that could be applied to the prosecution case in the Sutch trial is that it was piffling and mindless. The great fallacy- a fallacy as big as the George Washington monument- is that the prosecution goes along and says: 'Look, in this manila folder we have such devastating information that if ever it got out the whole of society would collapse'. But if people say 'Can we see what is in the folder', the officials say: 'No, it is too devastating'. Then, once in every 25 years when the information does come out, one finds that the actual evidence that they are leading is evidence such as that brought out in the Sutch case to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Sutch</inline> was going around picking up his milk and talking to someone who used to come around jogging in the morning. There were conversations with this man and, worst of all, this man was an embassy employee of a foreign power- to wit, Russia. They said that they came to the conclusion that something sinister had gone on. As they said, they knew that he was a man who had been associated with some very dangerous causes, to wit after the war he organised a nationwide collection of old clothing to relieve the hardship of refugees in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. With a background like that it must have seemed like an open and shut case. That is what one might assume to be the best example of the work being done by security services in New Zealand and Australia. If that is the best example, we might ask: 'What are the worst ones?' </para>

          <para>- This amendment is an example of the sorts of amendments which have been put forward by the Opposition and which probably strike at the unreality of the situation. The unreality is that the integrity of the security service depends on two people. It depends on the integrity of the Attorney-General and the Director-General, as well as the officers in the service. No amount of prescription of requirements about being satisfied with this, that and the other can get over that fact. Any security service has to depend on the integrity of those two people. Having had experience of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation over a number of years and having been involved with it as Attorney-General I can only say that that is the conclusion to which any reasonable person who has some knowledge of the security service has to come. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If the Attorney-General has to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that other lawful methods of investigation have proved insufficient or would in all the circumstances be quite impracticable as a means of obtaining the information for which the warrant is proposed to be issued he would have to assume the character of a super Director-General. In other words, he would have to inquire as to all the methods that had been undertaken in relation to every warrant. He would have to say: 'Have you done this, that or something else', et cetera. A considerable investigation would be required. It cannot happen that way. The Attorney-General is not in that position. The Minister could never be in that position. If the question of a warrant is being discussed between him and the Director-General, needless to say the question of what investigations have been undertaken will inevitably be discussed. But the prescription contained in the Opposition's amendment would place the Attorney-General in an impossible position vis-a-vis the Director-General. He would never be able to satisfy that prescription unless he had almost a royal commission every time he issued a warrant. As I said, it does not happen that way. </para>
        <para>The Government rejects this amendment not because it wants to put the officers concerned, the Minister and the Director-General in some absolute position but because it does not meet the reality of the situation. We always come back to this simple proposition: The issue of warrants depends on the integrity of the two people I have mentioned. If one of them, particularly the Director-General, is not a person of integrity and presents to an Attorney-General a case which is not based on fact, obviously the Attorney-General can be misled. The great fortune in this country is that we have never had such a Director-General. Certainly, the Director-General we have at the moment is a man of considerable capacity and integrity. His appointment was recommended by the previous Government and he was actually appointed by this Government. The same sort of bipartisan attitude needs to be adopted every time. </para>

          <para>-In answer to the Minister, in my view the present incumbent of the position of Director-General of Security has neither a mortgage on wisdom nor longevity. Somewhere along the line the Parliament has an obligation to provide appropriate safeguardschecks and balances and the protection to which every citizen is entitled. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barry Jones)</inline> on what can be done by security organisations. I corroborate the point he made. I consider that the most horrific case to be recorded is the Seberg case. I draw the attention of the House to a letter from America by Alastair Cooke on 23 September from which I shall quote extensively. It stated: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para class="block"> I picked up the Sunday paper and read a story that I hope has given Americans the sort of pause that chills the blood. </para>
          <para>It was a postscript to the suicide of Jean Seberg, the young actress from Iowa and expatriate in France, who was found dead in her car, leaving an empty bottle of barbiturates and a note. </para>
          <para>The postscript was released by the Government, by in fact the FBI, and it 's certainly to the credit of its present chief that he released a detestable confession which reinforces the suspicion that for many years the FBI in the hands of J. Edgar Hoover, its first and long-time head, could hardly be matched by any government for malice and cunning. </para>
          <para>Miss Seberg at one time was a passionate supporter of Leftist causes and made no bones about it. </para>
          <para>In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoover's</inline> view she became, like the late Martin Luther King, a social nuisance who it was necessary to intimidate, then to bug, in the hope of breaking their will. </para>
          <para>Some anonymous source one day got in touch with the FBI and passed on to them a rumour, or an invented smear, that Miss Seberg was pregnant by one of the Black Panther leaders. The source suggested to Hoover that, if this rumour could be fed to gossip columnists, it would help tarnish Miss Seberg 's image as a glamourous young movie star from the Middle West. </para>
          <para>Very good, ' said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoover,</inline> 'a fine idea. ' </para>
          <para>So the Bureau fed the item; most papers turned it down, but a Hollywood writer, what is politely known as a 'lady' columnist, printed it. </para>
          <para>Pretty soon Jean Seberg saw it, living in Paris. There are always good friends alert enough to see that you get the nastiest clippings. </para>
          <para>From that moment on Jean Seberg was a doomed girl. She was pregnant by her husband, the French novelist Romain Gary. But, as he said last weekend, while she was intelligent and courageous, she did not possess a tough hide, the ruthlessness that can tolerate an outrage against oneself. </para>
          <para>She saw the item and within hours went into premature labour; was delivered, by Caesarean section, of a girl who died within days. She took the dead baby back to Iowa in a glass coffin as a glaring proof that the baby was white- an excessive reaction perhaps, but in 1970 she knew that the FBI could and did destroy hundreds of radicals .and non-radicals. </para>
          <para>Romain Gary says that on each succeeding anniversary of the baby's death she attempted suicide. Finally, last week, she made it. </para>
          <para>A former FBI man, who was with the Bureau at the time, had no other justification to offer for this barbarity than to say that getting involved in radical politics could get you involved in national security, that the kid with the picket sign might turn into the kid with the bomb. And, he said, you just keep going down the line. </para>
          <para>Well, for too long the FBI went down the line of its own improvised rules, as we can horribly see, once the Freedom of Information Act made it possible for you and me, the ordinary citizen, to go to government files, including the files of the FBI, and read anything and everything which had been kept under wraps as confidential government information. </para>
          <para>Congress has up for debate in this session- and its committees are already taking testimony on it- a new law, a chaner of dos and dont's, a legal chaner of behaviour for the FBI. </para>
          <para>Roosevelt once confided to a friend that, if the Congress had ever had a hint of the shifts and manoeuvres he was engaged in with the British, before this country got into the war, he would have been impeached. And many of these manoeuvres involved brutal decisions and secret tricks not at all unlike the techniques of James Bond. We can now salve our conscience by saying that after all Hitler was the enemy, we were fighting to survive, and that it was essential for us to go beyond any traditional code of open warfare. However, these tricks and shifts passed over, when the war was over, from the main secret intelligence body, the OSS, into the running of the CIA, which was set up after the war. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Watergate: </para>
        <para>Watergate, of course, more than anything, did enormous damage to the reputation of the CIA and the FBI. And when all the dirt was shovelled out from under, President Ford's Attorney-General re-vamped the FBI and set his own strong rules. It was the present head of the FBI who chose to make public the disgraceful treatment of Jean Seberg. Romain Gary said he was grateful. He always maintained that she had been destroyed by the FBI, but he said: if the postWatergate FBI had not issued a confirmation, to this day I would have been considered a ' 'mytho-maniac' </para>
        <para>I think if this sad wind has blown any good it must be in the thought that the Seberg case will quicken the conscience of the Congress and sharpen its wits, and make it get busy writing and passing a new legal charter of the FBI. </para>
        <para class="block">I pass a couple of simple observations. I have refrained from entering the debate on this Bill so far. The only part of the Bill I want to debate are the provisions relating to judicial audit. I ask the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> what safeguards are contained within the provisions of this Bill, what mechanisms are provided for in the Bill, and what criteria are laid down that will obviate the possibility of something like the Seberg case happening in Australia in the absence of a freedom of information Act? My next question arises from this statement by Hoover: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Well, for too long the FBI went down the line of its own improvised rules, as we can horribly see. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Do I assume from the lack of checks and balances in the current legislation that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is to go down the line with its own improvised rules? I think it is regrettable. This Parliament ought to institute checks and balances by way of its legislation to obviate what otherwise will ultimately be inevitable in Australia, as it was in New Zealand, and as it was in the United States of America. I would be grateful if the Minister could reply to this point. I see nothing in this legislation that provides for this type of safeguard, which is critically important. </para>

        <para>I would be grateful for the Minister's comment, as a former Attorney-General, on the excruciating situation in which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Finlay</inline> found himself in New Zealand, as Attorney-General in a Labor government. All indications were that the Security Intelligence Service was, in effect, leaking information like a sieve to the Government's political opponents. As the Attorney-General he was in a 'Morton's fork' situation. If he declined to go ahead with the prosecution, obviously that would be leaked to the Opposition and used to the detriment of the Government. Yet he really was obliged under very strong political pressure to go ahead with the prosecution in which he had no great confidence. </para>

'. </para><para class="block">These are the remaining amendments to Division 2 of Part III of the Bill. I think it is important at this stage to recall to the Parliament exactly what Division 2 provides. Division 2 grants powers to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation which we know it has used illegally in the past and which now, ironically, are to be made legal. Those powers relate to surveillance devices. Similar powers in relation to telephone tapping are provided in associated Bills. I wish to repeat some of the remarks that I made in an earlier debate on a related Bill about the problems and principles of electronic surveillance which are embodied in Division 2. </para><para>I think it is important when we discuss our amendments to consider why we are putting this stress on these amendments. This is because the power to bug citizens and to wiretap citizens which are provided in this Division of the Bill are I think abhorrent to anyone who believes in a citizen's basic rights- his right to privacy, his right to liberty and his right to say what he wants to say in the privacy of his own home. Indeed, unless we manage to preserve some irreducible core of privacy our whole system of civil liberty becomes simply a formalistic ritual. I think that the methods of electronic surveillance embodied in Division 2 of Part III of the Bill and the wiretapping provisions embodied in a related Bill are peculiarly insidious because these things are by design virtually unquestionable. The victim is usually unaware that his privacy has been violated. Very rarely is he in a position to challenge such actions in any court, simply because he does not know that his privacy has been violated. Thus this Division sanctions the taping of a person's most intimate conversations, his privileged communications and his utterances, whether they be conspiratorial, criminal or just plain silly. All this can be done without the victim 's awareness that his privacy has been totally violated. It is because of the existence of those very dangerous powers that we insist that there be an effective authority in relation to democratic control over their use. </para><para>Let me suggest how wide these powers for ASIO might be. The Law Reform Commission calculated, on the basis of United States experience, that the 107 wiretappings in Australia in 1972-73, which were acknowledged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> may have involved some 12,000 people and some 68,000 different conversations. This quite massive invasion of privacy is an extraordinarily high price to pay in return for the somewhat nebulous security gains that might be made. </para><para>We on this side of the chamber acknowledge that there may have to be some balance between security needs and the right to privacy. But we demand that ASIO be empowered to make use of electronic surveillance and wiretapping devices only under the most stringent conditions and that we control effectively the spread of this cancer in our society. The amendments which I have moved relate to that effort to impose stringent controls. We propose to impose these controls in three major ways. Firstly, by amending clause 26 as proposed in the tenth amendment moved by the Opposition, we try to limit the time in which one of these listening devices can be implanted. We think that six months is far too long a period. We suggest instead 90 days- that is, three months. There is a provision in the Bill for continuation, but it again requires ministerial approval. Our whole point is to try to limit these activities by ministerial control. So we suggest that the clause be amended to read 90 days rather than six months, which seems to be an enormous amount of time to have a device implanted without ministerial reference. </para><para>Secondly, we wish to amend clause 29, which is of course the emergency clause. We need to be particularly alert when emergency clauses are introduced into Bills such as these because emergency clauses can be used as breaches in the whole defence apparatus that we erect. Time and time again civil servants will fall back on the emergency provisions because they are the ones over which effective democratic control is much less. Therefore, whilst we recognise the need for emergency provisions such as those contained in clause 29, again we want to bring the democratically elected Executive into it. The three amendments that we move to clause 29- that is, amendments 11, 12 and 13- are all related amendments which give the Minister powers of oversight in the use of emergency provisions. The third way in which we propose to impose stringent controls is set out in the Opposition's amendment No. 14. We ask in that amendment that the report which the Director-General is required to provide on each warrant issued in relation to the implanting of a listening device be sent not only to the Minister but also to the Leader of the Opposition. This is to ask again that the Government be genuine in its bipartisan approach to this legislation; that is, that it involve the Leader of the Opposition in the reports that are made to the Minister. We regard these infringements, on civil liberties, the powers provided in Division 2, as the ones that are most worrying in this society. We agree and welcome that there must be a report to the Minister on each warrant issued. We believe that the issue is sufficiently important that the Government should carry through its minimal bipartisan contribution which involves the Leader of the Oppositions having the report on each warrant made available to him as well as to the Minister. That is the intention of the Opposition's amendment No. 14. </para><para>Thus we have tried to erect three strengthening devices to protect the citizens of this country against the misuse of the very great powers bestowed upon ASIO and the Director-General. We have tried to do this firstly by limiting the period in which a citizen, unknown to him, can have one of these devices implanted in his home or, in relation to the other Bill, in which he can have his telephone wire-tapped. Secondly, we have suggested that the Minister be brought into the emergency provisions so that acts empowered therein cannot be carried through simply by the Director-General alone. Thirdly,  we have suggested that the reports that are presented on the use of each warrant be made available to the Leader of the Opposition as well as to the Minister. </para><para>Amendments negatived. </para><para>Clauses agreed to. </para><para>Remainder of Bill- by leave- taken as a whole. </para>

        </amendments><para>In the past people have been seriously prejudiced by adverse security assessments. It has affected their careers; it has prevented their advancement; and, in many cases, it has guaranteed they were not able to continue in the service of their country. All of us know that, particularly  in political life, we are subjected to public opinion from day to day and we do meet those people who hold positions of authority who have developed a paranoia or a fixation and hold all sorts of prejudices. This is a normal hazard of humanity. But if in the process, cloaked around that sort of fixation or that particular human fraility there are the ramifications of this sort of legislation where, because someone holds a particular office in an intelligence organisation he is not going to be subject to review, all the weaknesses that flow from that particular personality are hidden. </para><para>Hoover and how he went right off the rails in America has been mentioned. We have noted it here in a number of areas. We are well aware of the events which have occurred in our own country in relatively recent times. It is for that reason that we think the idea of the Ombudsman is an excellent proposition. He has done excellent work already. It is a further safeguard. So, we would be anxious to press for the passage of that amendment. Again, we would like to see the Organisation keep proper accounts. In other words, it should have a financial accountability. We want to know what happens to the public moneys that are given to the Organisation. Are they properly spent? To whom are they given? We suggest that there be a financial accountability. The Auditor-General should have a chance to audit and to report on what he is able to ascertain. </para><para>We again urge that there be an annual report by the Minister to the Parliament to indicate all those details of invasion of privacy. That will guarantee that there is a parliamentary scrutiny of what has happened. It is on that basis again that we can give some safeguard to the people who elect all of us, to whom we are answerable and to whom we must guarantee that their rights have not unnecessarily been infringed or invaded. Appeals against these matters do not go to any court of law. Officers of this Organisation become the privileged group, can regard themselves as being a power unto themselves and are able to have that information. We would like to know the circumstances. If we had an annual report clearly indicating the number of telephone taps and warrants and the number of devices that are being used, that would be a further safeguard. </para><para>Finally, and more importantly from the Opposition's point of view, is the real safeguard contained in the Opposition's amendment No. 25 which relates to the judicial audit of the Organisation. Nobody can object to that proposal. Its acceptance would mean that a qualified judge of great experience would hold this judicial audit. We have mentioned that we would like one to be held every three years. We would tike to see one held more frequently where the judge will go in and have a look at how the Organisation is working and report to the Minister whether the Organisation has complied with its charter, whether the Organisation has unjustifiably infringed the civil liberties of any person and whether the Organisation has operated effectively and efficiently. Two such audits have been held, one by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting</inline> Justice White in South Australia and the other into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope. They found that the Special Branch in South Australia and ASIO had failed to fulfil their charter. Many people have been seriously and maliciously damaged because of such infringements. We cannot allow that to continue. No democracy can continue to sustain itself if that sort of infringement occurs and that sort of damage is done to people. </para><para>The ability of a judicial inquiry to test the veracity of evidence and to test the reason why files have been collated is a great safeguard of liberty. On that basis we press most strongly for an acceptance of that amendment which will guarantee to the people of Australia that some independent person will judge the situation. Anyone of us can be hauled or arraigned before a judge or tribunal of this country and dealt with according to the law. No officer of an intelligence organisation should be deemed to be above that law. But there is no court of law in which they can be arrainged. The knowledge that there will be a judicial audit will act as a sanction and guarantee that those people will not violate any of the rights of the citizens of this country. I know that one of my colleagues wishes to say a few words. Accordingly, I will finish my remarks on that point. </para>

          <para>- I wish to say a few last words about the amendments. I stress that these amendments have the intention of attempting to strengthen the power of the Parliament vis-a-vis the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, whereas the purpose of this legislation is to strengthen ASIO's powers vis-a-vis the Parliament. The Opposition wants to stengthen the standing and the rights of the ordinary citizen vis-a-vis ASIO. The Bill attempts to do the reverse. We are trying to attempt to strengthen the processes of the law relative to ASIO. This Bill attempts to do the reverse. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As I have suggested earlier, there is a serious side to ASIO and perhaps a more trivial side to ASIO. Most of what we know or what leaks out about ASIO suggests that ASIO in Australia really concentrates very much on easy targets -on targets on street marches, especially in Brisbane, Aboriginal land rights campaigners, pacifists, environmentalists, trade unionists and so on. But the ostensible reason for it all is to keep Australia free of subversion. In a sense that fundamental argument is based on a total fallacy, I believe; and that is that there is a secret or collection of secrets that can be put in an envelope somewhere and passed from hand to hand and that the handing over of that envelope can really fundamentally change the entire strategic position of and the entire safety of a nation. I think that the more we examine the contemporary world, the more it seems extraordinarily unlikely that this would be the case. </para>
        <para>There is abundant evidence, I think, that there is a great deal of collusion between the great international systems and that ASIO, MI6, the KGB and the Central Intelligence Agency have more in common with each other than with the democratic system in our own country. It may have a good deal more in common with the system of the Soviet Union. I believe that the points that have been made so eloquently throughout this debate by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> are absolutely right. It could not be said that the Hope report had the effect of destroying ASIO. Indeed, we are told that this Bill was, in a large part, a response to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope's report. I could add to the report being done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting</inline> Justice White in South Australia the fact that the former <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Nelson of the Victorian Supreme Court is performing a similar exercise in Victoria by going through and destroying files of the Special Branch of the Victorian Police Force when they are not considered to be relevant. </para>
        <para>I will close with a valuable quotation which illustrates the point I have been making earlier. I have only just located it. It is a quotation from the <inline font-style="italic">Far Eastern Economic Review</inline> of 14 March 1975. It refers again to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Sutch.</inline> It states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Five days after <inline font-weight="bold">Dr William</inline> Sutch was found not guilty of spying <inline font-style="italic">(Review,</inline> March 7), on a charge brought under the Official Secrets Act, he said in a television interview that he believed Dmitri Aleksandrovich Razgovorov, formerly first secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Wellington, wanted to defect and was about to seek his help. Sutch said his suspicions (which were not mentioned in court as Sutch was not called as a witness) were aroused when he learned from Crown evidence that the Security Intelligence Service (SIS) knew of his last meeting with the Russian, and its agents lay in waiting before apprehending him. But one rumour in Wellington suggests that that is only part of the story: Razgovorov wanted to defect and his masters wanted to catch him at it. The late Prime Minister, Norman Kirk, a romantic, wanted to disband or greatly restrain the power of the SIS. </para>
          <para class="block">The SIS needed public justification for its existence and Sutch stumbled into its path. The Russians got their man, but the spy-catchers of the SIS were empty-handed, even with the help of the Soviets. </para>

              <para>-Clause 9 relates to warrants authorising the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to intercept telecommunications. The Opposition amendment to that clause is in respect of the period of validity of the warrants. The clause provides that a warrant may remain in existence for a period that does not exceed 6 months. We think that is far too long to have in existence a warrant whereby premises can be the subject of telecommunications interception. Accordingly, we will move that the period be reduced to 90 days. I think that amendment is self-explanatory. It gives the further assurance to people that warrants will not be issued for a lengthy period. We think that 90 days is more than adequate. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Clause 10 deals with the issue of a warrant by the Director-General of Security in an emergency. We have been dealing with ministerial accountability and responsibility. Warrants issued under clause 9 of the Bill are to be issued only by the Attorney-General but clause 10 provides for a moving away from that responsibility and accountability of the Minister. It provides that the Director-General may issue warrants. It provides that the Director-General may, by warrant, authorise persons to do certain things. That is not good enough from the Opposition's point of view. We cannot really imagine a circumstance in which the Director-General would not be able to make oral contact with the Attorney-General. Accordingly our amendment to this clause proposes to remove the power of the Director-General to issue warrants without any consultation. 'Consultation' is a word we have heard much about recently. We propose to omit the words 'the Director-General of Security may' and substitute 'the Attorney-General may orally authorize the Director-General of Security to' issue a warrant. In other words, should the Director-General want to issue a warrant when he is in Melbourne and the Attorney-General is in Perth there would be no problem in getting some sort of telephone authorisation for the issue of the warrant. We do not want a situation in which the Director-General can issue the warrant himself. </para>
          <para>This clause is rather curiously worded. It provides that the Director-General has first to make a request to the Attorney-General. If the Attorney-General has not, to the knowledge of the Director-General of Security, made a decision, the Director-General can bring into operation his emergency powers. I fail to see how there would be such an inordinate lapse of time after the Director-General made a request, as he is bound to do, that, because he has not heard from the Attorney-General, he would issue the warrant himself. I think all of us in the Parliament would be very surprised if we thought that a request, having been made, had not been received. We would want to make certain that if it had in fact been made there would be no reason why the Attorney-General could not give the authorisation. If the request is made orally or by telephone why could the authorisation not be on that same basis? There would be no delay. Accordingly, the Opposition will move that the Attorney-General should have the direct responsibility of authorising the Director-General to issue those warrants. </para>
          <para>We propose other ancillary amendments to clause 1 1, which relates to the issue of warrants to intercept telegrams. As I said, clause 10 relates to telecommunications; clause 11 to telegrams. Our amendment proposes that the power of the Director-General of Security to take these actions on his own initiative be deleted. We think it is essential that the Attorney-General always be involved and informed and that he have the obligation of authorising the Director-General so to act. </para>
          <para>Amendment No. 5, relating to clause 1 1, proposes that 'six months' be omitted and '90 days' be substituted. We think that six months is far too long, and to be consistent we propose that the time be reduced to 90 days. The amendments are virtually self-explanatory if read in the context of the Bill. I have nothing further to add. I move: </para>

            <para>- The thrust of the amendments moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> are twofold. Firstly, they not only again re-emphasise the attitude of the Opposition on this legislation but also endorse the principle that we previously followed in respect of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill,  namely that we believe that the Attorney-General has to be placed in a position in which he is seen ultimately as having some real authority over the Director-General of Security. For that reason the thrust of the amendments is to strengthen the position of the Attorney-General as against the position of the Director-General in relation to the issuing of warrants. Secondly, the time factors are relevant. The amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are directed towards greater efficiency and to the establishment of an important principle. Therefore I commend them to the Committee. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">Our amendment seeks to strengthen that subclause. We want a more definite clause. Our  amendment proposes that a judge shall not issue a warrant in relation to an affidavit unless certain details are set out- we think this is important- on which the judge is satisfied that a warrant ought to be issued. We propose that the affidavit of the Customs officer should specify the facts and other grounds on which the issue of the warrant is sought, including the name and occupation of the subscriber to the service and that the Customs officer has given to the judge either orally or by further affidavit, such other information as the judge may require concerning the grounds on which the issue of a warrant is being sought. Our amendment proposes that the judge is to be satisfied as to the matters specified in the application for a warrant. The amendment also proposes that the judge is satisfied that other methods of investigation have been tried without success or would be unlikely to be successful or would be impracticable. </para>
          <para>This legislation deals with the interception of communications. Under the Bill some information on the facts has to be given to the judge before a warrant is to be issued. We say that the clause should be more specific. We say that the information should be provided in the affidavit and that the judge is to be satisfied that other methods have been tried but have proved unsuccessful. In other words, the issue of a warrant would be the last resort and it was necessary to go to that extreme length of interfering with the rights of citizens. Our amendment proposes that the judge will be satisfied that given the seriousness of the suspected offence the issue of a warrant would be in the public interest. Our amendment also proposes that where a judge issues a warrant under this clause he shall state on the affidavit furnished to him which of the grounds specified in the affidavit he has relied on to justify the issue of the warrant. In other words, we propose that the judge himself will indicate the position. That is a judicial test. Bear in mind that enforcement of the law will be involved. If action is to be taken the validity of the method of how evidence was obtained can be contested in the courts. There is the further safeguard that information in an affidavit would be available to the public and the proceedings would be made public. There would be an opportunity to contest the veracity of the information and the basis on which it was obtained. It is very important, in dealing with the rights of people, to bear in mind that this Bill goes a long way in providing that a judge has to be satisfied on oral and other facts which are put before him before he issues a warrant. We are merely spelling out that the facts which ought to be submitted and on which the judge relies are laid down in a affidavit and are on record. </para>
          <para>Our amendment No. 9, which is ancillary to what I said earlier, proposes that a warrant shall remain in force for 30 days instead of six months, as is provided in clause 20. We suggest that because of the enforcement nature of the warrants the period should be reduced to 30 days. There is no reason at all why warrants of this nature, particularly in relation to narcotic offences, should remain in force for more than 30 days. There is always an opportunity to seek the issue of another warrant, on the facts. If the Customs officers know the facts there is nothing to prevent them from getting supporting evidence in 30 days. I ask honourable members opposite to bear in mind the safeguard that is contained in our amendment. In tapping people's telephones every conversation between a person in his living room and the outside world is overheard. So it is important that there should be some limitation of time on warrants. They should not remain in force for a lengthy period such as six months. Those of us who are interested in the law know that it is important for prosecutions to be launched promptly when one is in possession of certain information. We suggest that a surveillance period of six months is far too lengthy. We think a period of 30 days is more than adequate. </para>
          <para>I have endeavoured to explain the Opposition's amendments to clause 20 in the few minutes available to me. They definitely relate to the fact that we recognise that the processes of law enforcement can involve the interception of a telecommunications service, but it should occur only when a judge is satisfied that a warrant is necessary to gain information of a suspected offence which is serious and which under normal methods of investigation would be unsuccessful. I repeat, that a warrant may be issued when the normal methods of obtaining evidence have proved unsuccessful. In dealing with narcotic infringements there has to be some evidence. A person cannot rely on verbal information that might be obtained over the telephone to launch a prosecution and hope to obtain a conviction. He has to have more tangible evidence than that. That is why we say there is a need for an adequate safeguard that a warrant is issued only when other methods have proved unsuccessful. It is important that we give consideration to the problems of policing the narcotics drugs trade which wreaks devastation on people and is controlled by the criminal element. It is well known that there are international links and the trade is not restricted to Australia. </para>
          <para>I think that honourable members opposite will agree that the Opposition's amendments to clause 20 in no way weaken the Bill. In fact, they strengthen the Bill insofar as there is a guarantee to every citizen that there will be no unnecessary interference with their rights of privacy. </para>

            <para>-Unlike the security area dealt with in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill which is highly subjective, highly emotive and liable to the grossest errors of self-deception, the drug area is a very real problem in which there are identifiable victims, measurable harm done and a quantifiable amount of social loss. Nevertheless it is still very important that procedures that deviate from the norm, so far as the tapping of telephones and the like are concerned, are carried out to the absolute minimum, provided there is some kind of judicial safeguard. I think that the procedures with regard to the kind of evidence needed before a judge will grant a warrant, as moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> are thoroughly justified. At first glance clause 20 ( 1 ) says that no warrant shall be issued, in effect, unless the judge is satisfied by information on oath'. A whole series of supporting sub-clauses is set out. In some ways it may be thought that by changing that provision to requiring the information on affidavit actually weakens it. I do not think that is so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Those of us who have had experience in magistrates' courts and so on will be aware of the fact that many things are said very glibly on oath where the constable grabs the Testament and gabbles off something very rapidly. There is an old legal maxim that the truth will out even in an affidavit. We believe that an affidavit must be presented by way of evidence and that it should be quite specific. In the circumstances it will not be possible to have the normal adversarial situation of the court where it is possible for evidence to be challenged. Therefore, I think it is perfectly proper that the judge who is hearing the application should satisfy himself that a whole number of points are set out quite specifically and quite cogently in the affidavit before him. He will then, of course, have an opportunity to test the validity of the arguments put forward in the affidavit. </para>
          <para>As a result, I think that the Committee ought to accept the amendments put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I do not believe that they weaken what the Government is attempting to do in this area, but they do make sure that, if there is to be a violation of the telephone system or the telegraph system, or any other form of communication under the responsibility of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, it is done by the following of due process. As a result, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. </para>

It seems to me that the answer to that question is that we are conferring very important powers upon our officers of the Bureau of Customs, and it is perfectly proper, in conferring powers essentially to tap telephones, that the judge who issues the warrant has before him all the available evidence upon which he ought to make a judgment. The granting of a warrant is not an exercise that ought to be taken lightly. The fact that it might deal with a potentially serious offence does not, in my view, of itself impose upon this Parliament the view that we should just simply adopt a set of standards which do not require a judge who has to consider whether he will grant a warrant with all the relevant evidence upon which he can make that decision. That evidence, it has been suggested, ought to be made available upon affidavit. It has also been suggested that when the judge grants a warrant on the basis of that evidence, he should indicate the basis upon which the warrant is granted and the time for which the warrant will last. </para>

              <para>- I do not follow the interjection of the honourable member for Holt. What I am saying is that I believe that all judges are trained to weigh evidence. I believe that they will treat the application seriously within the terms of the Act. Anyone who has had any dealings with judges in chambers knows that judges deal with a large variety of applications of similar import. All we are doing is specifying those standards and those evidentiary procedures which we believe are proper evidentiary procedures upon which a judge shall or shall not issue a warrant. I would think that the real test- and this might have been the argument of the honourable member for Holt- is whether in any of these amendments we are imposing standards upon Customs officers in the performance of their duties which are either too high or too onerous. Looking at the amendments moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, I do not think that it can be seriously argued that we are doing so. What we are giving to a Customs officer is a power to put a telephone tap on a citizen's phone on the basis that he just simply suspects that there is likely to be a breach of security. What we are saying is that if he has that suspicion, and he establishes the basis of that suspicion to a judge, the judge, acting on the information before him, can then make a decision. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I invite honourable members opposite to apply their minds to this question: Do these standards as proposed by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the amendments moved by him place a burden or a set of standards upon the operations of Customs officers which are onerous or which will prevent the proper implementation of the duties of those Customs officers? If the amendments are examined objectively and fairly, I do not believe that it can seriously be argued that it is too high a burden. All the amendments do is ensure that evidence will be properly presented to a judge upon which he will make his decision. That is the issue. We believe that the Act, as it is currently worded, does not give full protection to the rights of the average citizen. I am sure that all honourable members are concerned about the problems of drug trafficking and the problems that exist in this community in terms of the incidence of and the effect of drug traffickers. I am certain that all honourable members are concerned to see that those people are dealt with within the framework of the law. But it has not been unknown for Customs officers to abuse their powers and their responsibilities from time to time. </para>
          <para>If this Parliament is to give a Customs officer a power to place a tap on a citizen's telephone and to intercept messages, this Parliament must be satisfied that in granting that power we do so under circumstances and conditions which protect the innocent and which will, we hope, lead to the apprehension of the guilty. We believe- and </para>
          <para class="block">I think that both the Government and the Opposition are in agreement about this-that judges, with their training and their capacity to weigh evidence are suitable persons to make that judgment. The real question therefore is: What is the basis of the evidence and the standards that we impose upon the Customs officer in presenting the information that he puts before a judge? We believe that the standards, as they are established in the legislation, are somewhat slack, having regard to the very important powers that are being granted. </para>
          <para>The amendments that have been moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition are balanced. It cannot be said on any real analysis that they impose upon Customs officers standards which are harsh, oppressive or onerous and will make it less likely for Customs officers to be able to carry out their duties fully, but that in imposing these standards- and we say that they are proper standards- we can be satisfied that such warrants as are issued will be issued to fulfil both properly and adequately the genuine desire of all members of this Parliament that those who are prepared to traffic or deal in drugs are apprehended and the full resources of the law used. But those resources, when we are dealing with a power like telephone tapping, have always to be used within the framework of the law. The amendments moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, I think, ensure that that situation will occur. </para>

He accused me of only having had experience in the conveyancing area. I am pleased that we can look at these clauses now in detail and bring our minds to bear on the problem involved. I appreciate that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, having no experience in this area, was not able to adduce any evidence in support of his proposition, which would indicate from considerable experience and background in the courts where these matters are dealt with, that these are the sorts of procedures that are laid down for a policeman to satisfy a magistrate when he seeks the issue of a warrant. I suspect that what honourable members opposite are seeking to do is to fetter Customs officers to a far greater extent than any policeman is fettered in relation to the information that he is required to provide to a magistrate in relation to the issue of any other warrant. </para>

              <para>-Perhaps the honourable member for Lalor, with his considerable police court experience which he alluded to earlier- in fact he suggested that the standards that would apply in relation to these matters may be somewhat lax- will give us the benefit of his experience in a little while. But in this case we are dealing with a judge; we are not dealing with some police court in which procedures are treated with some laxity, and I assume that that was what the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barry Jones)</inline> was referring to. What we are talking about is a judge, a very senior and experienced practitioner, who has to satisfy himself by information on oath as to certain matters. What honourable members opposite, by their amendment, are trying to do is to fetter the basis upon which a judge will come to the conclusions that he is required under this legislation to make in relation to the issue of a warrant. Bearing in mind that I have not been informed of any requirements like this in any other legislation dealing with these matters, I ask honourable members opposite why Customs officers and judges of our courts have to be fettered by requirements of this sort. I draw the attention of the House to paragraph (d) of the Opposition's amendment. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member made the point a little while ago that we are required to make judgments of a qualitative type in relation to this legislation. He said that telephone taps are a significant intrusion into the rights of the individual. I accept that. But he also stated in his comments on this Bill that we were dealing with drug matters. He indicated the importance that he attached to that point. We are not embarking upon telephone taps lightly. They are not something to be used in relation to speeding fines or offences of that nature. They are to be used in relation to the distribution of drugs which are wreaking such havoc in our community. It is an important matter; it is not a matter to be dealt with lightly. That is why matters of this nature are to come before a judge. We have before us a number of requirements which I ask honourable members opposite to consider. In my view they fetter the basis upon which a judge will come to the proper conclusion as to the extent to which he is satisfied. Paragraph (d) of the amendment states: </para>

          <para class="block">I ask honourable members to imagine a situation in which we want to catch urgently a drug pedlar and we need a warrant for an urgent telephone tap. A judge may ponder for hours over what those words mean. Paragraph (e) states: </para>

What is the purpose behind these requirements? It seems to me that their purpose is to provide a framework in which smart people defending smart operators will have a basis for challenging the very evidence upon which a conviction might be sought. Such a challenge will arise not on the bona fides of that evidence but because we have provided a framework of law which is so complex and technical that until we have run the gamut of test cases and de1' " oed procedures of the sort with which the he ible member might be familiar in the police courts of Victoria we will not be able to get a conviction. I do not think that that is the way in which these matters ought to be dealt with. </para>
          <para>I think that a judge who is asked to make findings in relation to these matters and required to satisfy himself by information on oath as to the matters specified in sub-clause (1) (a) and (b) will genuinely turn his mind to the adequacy of that evidence. I would be much happier if the judge had to turn his mind to the evidence placed before him in the individual case to decide whether he himself is satisfied. I am perfectly happy to leave him with a discretion in that matter rather than to put down a catalogue of requirements which will only confuse and create circumstances in which the smart operators who are dealing in hard drugs and doing so much harm in our community will find ways and means of getting off charges when they are caught and when we have the capacity to deal with them. </para>

            <para>-When I hear the honourable member for Dundas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ruddock)</inline> he reminds me of the Buddhist koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The point he is making is absolutely nonsensical. What he forgets is that we are not dealing with the ordinary situation in court where a judge hears a case put by a prosecutor and another case put on an adversarial basis on the other hand. The judge has to form an opinion. The other point is that the issuing of a warrant to tap a telephone is on a different basis and of different seriousness from most of the warrants issued by magistrates. Of course it is proper that a warrant be issued by a judge rather than a magistrate. But what we are simply saying is that if it is good enough for evidence to be given on oath that evidence ought to be particularised in writing in the form of an affidavit so that there is a permanent record of it if there is any subsequent inquiry about it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think there is a large amount of hypocrisy in this matter. If there were a suggestion that we should use telephone tapping for the purpose of dealing with tax avoidance or tax frauds I wonder whether we would get the same kind of reaction from members on the other side of the House. </para>

              <para>-I am dealing very strictly with the clause. I was so carried away with the splendid drafting of the amendments by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> that I was lost in admiration and lost my place in the voluminous document for a moment. The point is this: We ought to be able to apply the general principles of law right across the board whether in drug cases, security cases or tax avoidance cases. But, of course, this Government has not got round to legislating on tax avoidance and the use of telephone tapping in this regard. I believe that the power to tap telephones is an extremely dangerous power because of the consequences of the information that might be secured. If the wrong person's telephone is tapped and his conversations are recorded a person who is completely innocent may be under sur.viellance when his activities ought not to attract the attention of the law enforcement bodies. This is a very dangerous precedent. Those of us who have been in Russia have always had the uneasy sense that when we go into an hotel room we are not sure whether we are there to watch the television or whether the television is there to watch us. I regard as absolutely repellant the thought that somebody who wanted an instant warrant from a judge could approach him by telephone- we hope that it would not be bugged- in order to pick up a warrant. I beg honourable members to think of the seriousness and the implications of that happening. In a curious way the honourable member for Dundas in his naivety seemed to be arguing for our case. He conceded the real significance of the matter. He said that we should not fetter the people who are seeking the warrants. </para>

              <para>-No, what I am saying is that obviously if there is a case that is specifically involving Queensland it would seem quite logical to me to approach a judge in Queensland. If we wanted to approach a situation in TasmaniaGod help us- I would want to see probably a relative of the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman),</inline> a Tasmanian judge, involved in the matter- somebody closer to the actual scene. In amendment No. 7 to clause 20 one sees we want particularised which judge may grant a warrant and we want the evidence that goes before the judge to be particularised. </para>

              <para>- I said earlier today, and I remind the honourable member for Prospect of it, that I would rather have a sick throat than a sick mind because my throat will be better in a couple of days; I hope his mind similarly improves. I say to the honourable member for Lalor that the Opposition's amendments may very well create a situation that will defeat the very objective which it is trying to obtain. Is the honourable member telling me- we are now talking about Tasmania and Western Australia, which have no resident Federal judge, and therefore under section 19 the application will go to a State Supreme Court judge- that the Customs officers will attempt to pick a judge in Tasmania? In Tasmania there are five judges, two of whom might be sitting in Hobart at one time, one in Launceston, one in Burnie and one on reserved decisions. When one is dealing with small numbers like that it is rather difficult to pick and choose which judge will hear an application. If the honourable member is talking about Federal Court judges at large- </para>

              <para>- I beg your pardon. I will make my speech and the honourable member may make his. The honourable member suggests that the officers would pick a judge in the Federal Court. How will they get on in the Northern Territory? Look at paragraph (c) of clause 18. There are three judges in the Northern Territory. Will the officials be able to pick and choose? With the greatest respect, the honourable member for Lalor shows a fine academic appreciation of the way the law works but not a very fine practical appreciation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The second point I put to the honourable member is that we are talking about judicial proceedings. These are proceedings in a court of record. He knows very well that even in ex parte applications, the court of record insists that it have documentary evidence either at the beginning of the hearing or by the end of the hearing. Whether that comes in the form of a transcript taken in chambers or whether it comes in the form of an affidavit which is subsequently sworn- an affidavit which is presented in escrow at the commencement of the proceedings and sworn subsequently- or whether it comes in the judge's notes, is the honourable member suggesting for one minute to me and to the members of this Committee that a judge, on a matter as important as the tapping of a telephone, is not going to ensure that he has evidence in black and white upon which he can justify his decision, albeit he knows that that decision may not be reviewed in a superior court? What is the situation if a judge or his associate is called to produce the records of the proceedings? </para>
          <para>Does the honourable member- I turn to the amendments- seriously think that any judge in Australia is going to make an order for telephone tapping without knowing the name, address and occupation of the subscriber? It would be lovely if the judge made an order to tap a telephone if he did not know the name, address and occupation of the subscriber or the number given. Great effort! With the greatest of respect, this is an insult to the intelligence of Australia's Federal, Supreme Court and Northern Territory judges. Are judges really going to give an order to tap a telephone and not ask what number it is or whose phone it is? I turn to the next point. Proposed new clause 20 (3) (b) states: the officer of Customs has given to the Judge, either orally or by further affidavit, such further information as the Judge requires concerning the grounds on which the issue of a warrant is being sought; </para>
          <para class="block">Do not tell me that the judges of Australia need to be told in an Act of Parliament that they have power to say to a witness: 'Your evidence is not sufficient. I want more, either viva voce oral evidence or by affidavit'. Is the honourable member really suggesting that a judge needs to have it stated in an Act of Parliament that he has power to say to a witness: 'Go away and come back with more evidence'? Paragraph (c) of proposed new clause 20 (3) states: the Judge is satisfied as to the matters specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section ( 1 ); </para>
          <para class="block">That is what the Government put in. Proposed new paragraph (d) states: the Judge is satisfied that other methods of investigation have been tried without success- </para>
          <para>Just contemplate that point. The Opposition issaying that the Customs official has to try another method without success before he can get an order to tap a telephone. Is that not terrific? If the officers hear about the offence only three or four minutes beforehand and they know a telephone call is coming through whereby an arrangement will be made to pick up drugs - </para>

              <para>-We are talking about catching people involved in the trade of narcotics. Why does the Opposition say that Customs officers have to try a method which will be unsuccessful before they try a method which will be successful? The amendment goes even further and states: or would be unlikely to be successful- </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>This really puts the investigating officer in a wonderful situation. He has to choose between giving evidence to the judge that he has tried something already without success, or that he has not tried it but if he did try it he thinks it would be unlikely to be successful. I reckon the judge would certify an officer who said: 'I have not tried it but I am pretty sure if I did try it it would be unsuccessful'. I am not making fun of the matter. I am trying to point out that whilst the honourable intentions of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition are clear to me, this amendment shows that the Opposition is virtually creating one of the most extraordinary legal circumstances I have ever seen in my life. The amendment continues: or would be impracticable . . . </para>
          <para class="block">Let us look at the amendment analytically. If the officer tries a method and it is unsuccessful, he can get an order to tap a telephone; but if he has not tried the method because he thinks it would be unlikely to be successful or it would be impracticable, then he would also get an order. With the greatest respect, I do not think that the Opposition ought to suggest that the judges of Australia should cop that sort of nonsense. Then we come to the next part of the amendment. Paragraph (e) states: the Judge is satisfied that, given the seriousness of the suspected offence, or suspected likely offence, the issue of a warrant would be in the public interest. </para>
          <para class="block">I want to be heard to say in this Parliament that I hope every judge in Australia, prima facie, is against the issuing of warrants to tap telephones. I believe that every judge in Australia, learned in the law, and appreciating the civil liberties of this nation, prima facie would be against the issuing of a warrant. On that basis, to suggest that a judge has to have it spelt out to him as though he is a first year law student that he has to take into account the seriousness of the offence, in my respectful submission, is again insulting to the judiciary. I repeat that I am not against the spirit of what the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition seeks to do, but I am saying that, intended or otherwise, the Opposition is creating a legal nonsense, an insult to the judiciary. Quite frankly, as the honourable member for Dundas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ruddock)</inline> said, in the minds of some the amendment may well be fettering the exercise of judicial discretion. Lastly- honourable members should listen to this; it is as if one were talking to a jusdee of the peace- the Opposition's proposed new sub-clause (3A) reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Where a Judge issues a warrant under this section, he shall state on the affidavit furnished to him by the officer of Customs, which of the grounds specified in that affidavit he has relied on to justify the issue of the warrant and particulars of any other grounds relied on by him to justify the issue of the warrant. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is almost like tick-a-box justice if we say to the judge: 'We trust you so little, Joe, that we are going to make you say on which ground you have relied'. It is almost intimidatory. I repeat that it is a lawyer's argument. I do not dispute the intentions of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, but, really, whoever dreamt this provision up for him has a most fertile imagination. Perhaps he has entertained the Parliament a little but really he has insulted the judiciary of Australia and has suggested that the judiciary does not know the first thing about human rights, whereas I believe it is the fundamental protector of human rights in this nation. </para>

            <para>- I wish to make a couple of observations. I recall that not very long ago I asked the Government to persist with a procedure that had been followed in this country for many years in dealing with corporate defalcation. I asked that the procedure be maintained for Ministers exclusively to have the power to withhold a passport where it was considered that a person had committed corporate defalcation. That proposal was rejected by the Government on the grounds that it was an infringement of civil liberties. To get to that stage would have required a recommendation from the Corporate Affairs Commission or the Insurance Commissioner. That proposal did not involve telephone tapping. The Government made it law that a passport can be withheld only on the grounds of a judicial warrant. Now, I follow that, but the important difference between the two matters is that in this case the question of civil , liberties is involved to a much greater extent. We are not going to apply telephone tapping in the case of corporate law, but in the area, principally of narcotics. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I suppose that of the members on this side of the chamber I would take one of the hardest lines on narcotics. The thing that worries me is that Customs officers, the people who initiate a warrant, who are not trained in the law and who do not have a mortgage on wisdom, are to apply to intercept the telephone of an individual. Such action could lead to a criminal indictment because ultimately if a charge is pressed it comes before judicial proceedings. I ask the lawyers this question: In those circumstances is an oath satisfactory? If such action ultimately is tested in a court, which has the greater force of law and credibility- an affidavit or an oath? I do not know, but I come down on the side of an affidavit. </para>

              <para>- All right. I am just making a point. I am not a lawyer. I think this is an extremely serious area. There is no question about that. I suppose that I am more conscious of these matters than are many honourable members, but I do not know how one ever really adds up the social cost of the downstream of the distribution of narcotics. It is horrific, and the penalties ought to be much higher. I am extremely concerned about the procedures which are necessary to get a warrant. I think that a judge, whether he be a Supreme Court judge or a federal judge, surely ought to be more than adequately satisfied that when he issues a warrant the warrant in fact is justified. Surely a judge has some indication at that stage that ultimately there will be judicial proceedings on that case. The constructive aspect which I am looking at is this: Whoever the individual may be, whatever grounds the Customs officer has- he may be as sure as anything that a telephone ought to be tapped- those grounds will not be tested until the case is finally determined judicially. I think that that individual, whoever he may be, has a right to the full protection and full force of the law at that stage. The only question in my mind is whether the procedures to achieve that protection are better as set out in the amendment or in the proposed legislation. At this stage I must confess that the answer is on the side of the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I enter this debate to deal with some of the points raised by the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman).</inline> In doing so I make two points. The first is that in considering a narcotics offence I think we always presume that we are dealing with the merchandisers of hard drugs. In fact, if one looks to the definition of narcotics in the Customs Act and to the actual reference to narcotics in the Bill one sees that a whole series of offences can be covered. They certainly do not go as far as the purveying of hard drugs. A young man or woman returning to Australia carrying enough of what is fashionably termed pot, or marihuana, to fill his or her personal use, could be caught within the provisions of this legislation. I make that point because I think it is a point that ought to be considered. That does not delete in any way from the thrust of the argument in relation to what I think we are all basically concerned with, the trafficker of hard drugs. I think our approach to that is uniform. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am disappointed at the approach of the honourable member for Denison who takes the view that the requirement to set out the details as proposed in the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> is an insult to the judiciary. I wish to make several points about that. First of all, the honourable gentleman, who is a lawyer, has only to pick up copies of the rules of practice in the Supreme Court of Tasmania, the Supreme Court of Victoria or the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to see set out in great detail the forms which professional practitioners have to use in making applications to judges in chambers. The forms are set out in some detail. That is not regarded by the judiciary as an insult to them, neither is it regarded by legal practitioners as an insult to them. It is in order that when dealing with these matters judges will have before them what is basically a uniform set of standards by which they can make a determination upon facts. </para>

              <para>- Let me just deal with the honourable gentleman because I think he was a little glib in his handling of this situation. Setting out the details as the amendments proposed by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition does achieve two things. First of all it acts as a guide to all Customs officers who make an application. If this amendment were to be adopted by the Government, a Customs officer would be far less likely to be caught in a situation where a judge is entitled to say that he regards their application as not containing sufficient material. In fact, the Act itself sets out the criteria that the customs officer would have to fulfil in making his application. That provision does one very important thing. It establishes the set of criteria and the standards which Customs officers know and know that they have to deal with. </para>

              <para>- Or three weeks or whatever- that the circumstances of this case make the use of a warrant to tap a telephone imperative because there is no other effective method available, having regard to the nature of the suspected offence, which is likely to be successuful. That is a reasonable statement and, if contained in an affidavit, that simplifies the function for the judges. It is very important to try to establish, as far as possible, uniform standards. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I disagree with my friend, the honourable member for Denison, when he says that, of course, all judges instinctively have an opposition to telephone tapping. I do not speak with that degree of authority because the honourable member for Denison knows as well as I do that judges in all courts, in all jurisdictions, within our system- I have a great respect for them- often approach particular offences in quite a different way because of all sorts of different fundamental attitudes. There are some judges, for example, as the honourable member would know, who take a far more serious view of crimes against the person than they do crimes against property. As an experienced practitioner, has not the honourable member for Denison ever stood at a listing of cases and decided that he wants a particular case- it may be an assault case or a larceny against property- on one list in preference to another. Of course, he nods his head in agreement. Why does he seek such a listing? He knows that if he gets a client before judge A as against judge B and given the nature of the offence, he is far more likely to get a better result for his client. That goes on every day in our courts. Experienced practitioners know it goes on. It is no insult to the judiciary. But it is important, therefore, that we understand these things. To say that every judge in Australia in every jurisdiction will have an automatic instinct against granting a warrant, I do not believe can be justified. Judges are like other human beings. They have all sorts of social attitudes towards these issues and they govern their attitudes. There is nothing wrong with that. That is known and understood by all practising lawyers. </para>
          <para>Now the benefit and the advantage of the amendments moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition are that they create, as far as is reasonably practicable, given the very seriousness of the issues with which we are dealing, a set of facts which are clear and known to the Customs officer. He knows that if he wants to make an application there are certain things that he has to put in his document otherwise he does not get to the first bench. </para>

              <para>-Well, the honourable member might scoff at that but if he has seen some of the sloppy applications presented by solicitors and members of the legal profession, who do not know their jobs, that from time to time have to be dealt with by judges he would not be scoffing quite so hard. If he wants to pick up an ordinary book of practice, he will find far more detail set out in that for the guidance and direction of practitioners- men experienced in the law- than is contained here for the guidance and direction of Customs officers who do not always have the benefit of that sort of detailed training. So there is a real benefit in this kind of detail. It makes the approach to be taken by Customs officers uniform. They know what is required of them in making these applications. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Secondly, the fact that that is done also, I believe, over a period, will provide a far more uniform approach by the judiciary in handling these matters than if they are just left open. That is why I believe that they are beneficial. I am sorry to say to my friend, the honourable member for Denison, that I do not believe that he did his cause any real service by suggesting that somehow these procedures which operate, I believe, to the benefit of and to provide clarity to Customs officers in the pursuit of their duty are just a set of silly standards. I could show the honourable gentleman and he could show me in any practice book which exists for the guidance of members of the legal profession a set of standards which require far more detail than is suggested here. That, I believe, is the argument. </para>
          <para>I invite the honourable gentleman opposite to argue whether these amendments, if adopted, would make life more onerous for Customs officers. No one has joined issue on that claim. What they have endeavoured to do is to say that by providing a proper set of standards we are making requirements which are unnecessary. I believe that if the amendments are adopted it will be easier for Customs officers to know the requirements that they have to meet in making these applications. I believe that it will lead to a uniform practice by members of the judiciary and I believe that that will be a good thing. </para>

            <para>-My comment is very brief. I only wish to say that these rules, of course, are for judges, not for practitioners. The sorts of rules that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding)</inline> has been talking about are the sorts of rules that are laid down to enable practitioners who are going to appear before a judge to regulate their forms and to give them some guidance. This is not what we have here. This is a statutory obligation on judges telling them how they will exercise their discretion. It fetters the judge. It is not dealing with the matters relevant to the practitioner. That is my first point. Secondly, does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports really think that the Customs officers are going to be trotting off with their facts in relation to these sorts of matters, looking at the other questions that are involved in clause 20 of this Bill, without the assistance of very skilled Crown law officers? </para>

            <para>- With all due respect to the frog-like arguments of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding),</inline> everything he has said is destroyed by the Opposition's proposed new to clause 20a. After saying everything has to be written down in forms, that the Customs officer has to know exactly what he has to say and that the judge has to know exactly what he has to do, this amendment makes provision for telephone applications. Ring him up in the middle of the night on the telephone. Now, with all due respect, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports took me to task and he spoke about pleadings. I do not think we have pleadings in the Supreme Court of Tasmania in its criminal jurisdiction. I am sure that the honourable member does not have it in Victoria. However, I will let the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> speak, but how is someone going to do affidavits by telephone? He will make legal history. They do not even do that on the <inline font-style="italic">Muppet Show.</inline></para>

For the benefit of the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman),</inline> he will notice that before these warrants can be issued the same sort of affidavit evidence has to be obtained. I have not time to debate this matter but this is to be found within the amendments. In respect of the other matters that have been mentioned, the honourable member will notice that we want the same sort of affidavit evidence before warrants are issued. The Bill itself talks about oral evidence or otherwise being furnished to a judge. I see no difficulties arising from what has been said by honourable members and I welcome the spirited debate that has taken place. However, the most important part of what I am about is a report to the Parliament, which is contained in our amendment (16). It reads: </para>

          <para class="block">That report will include information on the number of warrants and, where they apply to telephones, the total number of services, et cetera. In other words, further information will have to be supplied. This is a further sanction. The whole idea of affidavits and everything else is to guarantee that these intrusions into privacy are not readily sought or granted. The Parliament itself is always interested in, for example, the amount of money spent in some department. It would be very important to know what sort of action has taken place under this Bill. I have formally moved the amendments; I invite my colleagues to participate in the remaining few minutes. </para>

            <para>- I would like to speak to the Opposition's amendment (16) and to relate this amendment to amendment (24) to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill which, unfortunately, was guillotined, giving us no chance to discuss it. It is important for the Committee to realise that, for all practical purposes, once this package of Bills has passed from this House, the House virtually has washed its hands of ASIO. For instance, it is quite clear that questions about ASIO will not be answered. Secondly, there is no annual report to Parliament by ASIO, so there can be no check through that means. There is no effective parliamentary audit of ASIO and, in the Opposition's view, we have ineffective ministerial control of ASIO. We are in the paradoxical position where Parliament has no effective control in relation to </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">ASIO, yet ASIO is empowered to investigate individual members of Parliament. </para>
          <para>As a result of this Bill we are in the extraordinary position where honourable members of this House may be examined by an organisation over which, for all practical purposes, this House has no effective supervision. This is why we are proposing an annual report to the Parliament, both in the ASIO Bill and also in the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill, in relation simply to warrants involved with telephone tapping in this Bill and to listening devices in the ASIO Bill. I want really to ask all honourable members on the Government side, particularly those honourable members who outside the House posture as defenders of civil liberties, what is wrong with having an annual report on the issue of telephone tapping and listening devices. I give due credit to the honourable members opposite I have had my doubts during this debate, particularly in regard to some of the remarks made by honourable members opposite, but I do give them credit- in believing that none of them believe that telephone tapping and listening devices are desirable things in this society even though sometimes they may be necessary.If it is an undesirable feature of our society it is very important that the Parliament retain some oversight of the development of that cancer in our society. </para>
          <para>All that we are asking in this report is that each year the Parliament be told the number of warrants issued in relation to wire taps and in relation to listening devices and be given some details in that regard. I do not believe that anyone who honestly says that he is concerned with civil liberties can object to that. It in no way endangers the security operation. We are simply asking that this Parliament be told the extent of this development in our society. It in no way threatens any particular security operation. It in no way affects any Customs operation in toto because we are asking just for general fig toto beures. Unless this Parliament gets that information there is a real danger that year after year this cancer will creep through our society without this Parliament having any effective supervision. I would hope that all honourable members opposite who talk about civil liberties will support this particular amendment proposed by the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- I know that  Colonel Lipton  did ask those questions and I realise that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harold</inline> Macmillan probably replied to the best of his ability. I am not actually dealing with that point, though it is a very important one. The question of sovereignty of Parliament is paramount. I talked to the  Clerk  of the House about this matter and I am convinced that a resolution of this House would be sufficient to demand that anything to be required of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation would have to be provided to this House. That could be done by a resolution of this House. Therefore, I accept fundamentally that if a resolution of this House demanded something from ASIO it would have to be known. The honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barry Jones)</inline> will agree that that is the maximum that the Parliament could demand, and it is a maximum power which would be used only in the most exceptional cases. The Opposition has asked for something which could be reasonable. I do not think what it is suggesting is unreasonable. </para>

          <para>I ask for the attention of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> who is at the table, as he might not be listening. I realise that the discussions between the chief Whip and the Minister are probably more important than what I have to say. I was just suggesting that the Minister might like to look carefully at this amendment, and, when he comes to the report stage, having discussed the matter with those concerned in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> say to himself: 'Which is to prevail, the sovereignty of Parliament or the Executive?' That is fundamental. I hope that the Minister is listening. Which is to prevail; the sovereignty of Parliament or the Executive? I would hardly think it possible that, without disclosing anything dangerous, this Parliament could not be provided with information as to the number of times warrants were granted or matters of this nature were dealt with. In fact honourable members probably would be happy to think that, if there were 20, 30 or 40 operations, they were probably doing their duty very well, whereas if there were only one or two operations they would be wondering whether they were worth the millions of dollars which they get. </para>

            <para>- This Bill involves an amendment to the Customs Act. Normally one would not contest such a Bill. However the amendments proposed in the Bill follow the amendments already dealt with in respect of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill 1979 (No. 2). The amendments are saying that we approve of the use of listening devices in accordance with the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill and we also give the warning that anybody who gains information by such interception is not to disclose it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Honourable members will recall that when we were debating the ASIO Bill and Telecommunications (Interception) Bills we proposed amendments to both Bills. </para>
          <para>The Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) normally would be a machinery Bill. It amends the Customs Act 1901 in respect of the use of listening devices. That was dealt with in the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill. The Customs Act is being amended in respect of certain information not to be disclosed. That was dealt with in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill. I reiterate that the Opposition opposed the ASIO Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill and moved a number of amendments. Accordingly, consistent with our attitude we oppose the Customs Amendment Bill. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill merely replaced a section in the Act, so there was no need to object to it. In respect of the Customs Amendment Bill there is a need for the Opposition clearly to indicate that although our amendments to the ASIO Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill in respect of accountability, warrants, annual reports and the question of the Leader of the Opposition being fully briefed on all matters were not accepted the same arguments apply to this Bill. The amendments which we proposed earlier also apply to this Bill, so it is logical that we would oppose it. Accordingly, the Opposition disapproves of this Bill. </para>

              <para>-I think it is unfortunate that the honourable member for Bendigo seeks to make a joke of what I consider to be a very serious matter. The case I refer to is that of a women who, having been widowed, subsequently has a child and that child is treated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs as nonexistent where the woman receives a war pension. The Department of Veterans' Affairs takes the position that the child, not being the child of the husband as a result of whose war service the woman receives a war widows pension, is not the responsibility of that Department. That may be an acceptable argument. It is an argument which previously applied to social security widows pensions but which, in a period of some enlightenment, was changed. I do not think that it is the responsibility of Acts of Parliament to moralise on the conduct of people to the extent that they are fined and their children are disadvantaged. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I raise this matter in this House for the second time because I hope that at least some Government members will have sufficient concern to take the matter up. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann),</inline> in answer to correspondence from me, has indicated that he is not going to do anything about the matter. He has left it to the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle).</inline> The situation of a woman who has a child not covered by a war widows pension because it is not a child of the deceased ex-serviceman whose offspring attract a pension, is that if she applies to the Department of Social Security for coverage of that child, the war widows pension is applied as a means test against her in assessing whether the childrens allowance will be paid in respect of that child. If she were receiving a social security widows pension, the child would be covered automatically, but because she is receiving a war widows pension, she is denied cover for the child under either form of pension. In one case the Department of Veterans' Affairs says that it is not the child of the ex-serviceman and in the other case the Department of Social Security says to the woman: 'Your widows pension is such that it excludes you, because of the means test, from getting coverage for that child '. </para>
          <para>I consider that this is a simple anomaly which should be able to be corrected. It was corrected in the case of social security pensions where such children who were born subsequent to a woman being widowed were excluded. They are no longer excluded. But they are excluded under this system. I consider it to be an anomaly and I hope that sufficient members of the Government will be prepared to take it up with the Minister concerned and with other Ministers to have the situation reversed. </para>
          <para>Society sets certain moral standards. I do not believe that it is the place of veterans' affairs or the social security legislation to moralise to the extent of discriminating against people in lowincome brackets for making mistakes that other people can make without any cost at all. I do not believe that an Act of Parliament should prescribe celibacy for anyone, whether they are married or not. But that virtually is what the present legislation does. What it is really saying to that woman is that she has to give up her war widows pension and take a social security pension in order to get coverage for that child because of the cross use of the means test. This is the second time I have raised this matter. I hope that someone will do something about it. </para>

            <para>- I draw the attention of the House to a measure being taken by the New South Wales Government which will seriously reduce employment in my electorate and increase the cost of living in my electorate. I refer to the amalgamation of county councils in my electorate. This action is being forced on these county councils despite the clearly-stated wishes of the residents and despite the strong objections of Labor Party officials in my area. This is happening throughout the coastal area of New South Wales and even in the electorate of St George, I am told. Whatever the effect in metropolitan areas, the reality of what is happening in the country areas is absolutely shattering. </para>

              <para>- It is temporarily in government in New South Wales. The New South Wales State Labor Party, with its steamroller approach, not caring for the wishes of the residents, has imposed its will on the people as is the normal style of that kind of centralist organisation- the people will be able to express their view at the next opportunity- and has forced the amalgamation of these councils. Some people might say that it is a great thing, that it will make for greater efficiency. The facts are that that is not so; it will not lead to greater efficiency. In the case of all the county councils in my electorate, it will lead to higher costs because they will be forced to amalgamate with councils with higher rate structures to the disadvantage of my constituents. But, even more serious, there are small areas like Picton in my electorate where the removal of the county council to Parramatta, of all places- and what a curious place to move it towill mean the removal of jobs from a decentralised area to a city area. We all know that the Labor Government in New South Wales hates decentralised areas, does not like the bush and wants to kick the guts of the people in Picton. Let me quote from a recent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Illawarra Mercury,</inline> a paper which the Labor Party appears to love because it quotes it so frequently.

            <para>It appears that the Department of Industrial Relations played no part in the drafting of the amendments, that no member of this Commission was consulted and no trade union or employer or peak council representing employees or employers was consulted. </para>
            <para>The Minister, in his second reading speech claimed that the "initial proposals" (but not, apparently, the final proposals) were shown to some persons present at the National Labour Consultative Council, but he admits that no trade union representatives were present at that meeting. He does not claim that those "initial proposals" were forwarded to the trade union representatives who were entitled to be at the meeting, or left in the possession of the employers' representatives present. He does not claim that the final proposals were shown to any member of the National Labour Consultative Council or to the Council as a whole. Nor does he offer any reason for his failure to take the final proposals to the Council before their introduction into the legislative process.

                <para>Law reform is often proposed on two grounds: </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>Firstly, it may have the purpose to restate in more concrete and substantive manner values which are not obtaining expression in the decisions of persons, judges or administrators. So, a rule must be stated or restated so that its intendment may not be avoided in its application in particular cases. Secondly, law reform is often directed to procedural questions. Most commonly, procedural changes are proposed so as to simplify and expedite, with a reduction in cost, delay and complexity, the trial of issues of fact and law. Procedural reforms set the quality and import of the substantive rules of law. It has been said that the substantive law is secreted in the interstices of procedure'. </para>
            <para>Measured by these considerations the present Bill is not reform: it is reaction. It introduces complexity and delay. It is not argued that the procedural changes are required in order to achieve expedition and economy in the trial of issues. Such a contention would fall before a timeconsuming, cost-incurring, delay-provoking system of resorting to Full Benches on issues which have hitherto been dealt with by one person under the sanction of an appeal procedure, (which is now in practice to be broadly removed with all its benefits taken away). </para>
            <para>The denial of the right of appeal is a step backwards. I take the liberty of reproducing what I wrote in a recent Full Bench decision: </para>
            <para>Institutions such as ours, however, should be structured so as not to afford even the appearance of arbitrariness of judgment, fickleness of decision or other waywardness. That is why an appeal tribunal is put here behind the arbitrator within reach of a dissatisfied party. Law systems that do not provide opportunities for appeal invite suspicion. Thus, the existence of the opportunity to appeal may serve from time to time to condition the manner and the terms in which a decision is brought down. The presence of an appeal tribunal gives confidence to parties to enter into a procedure having a binding result. A decision is more authoritative if it has been confirmed on appeal; it may sometimes fetch authority precisely because it has not been appealed.'

                <para>The Bill proposes to require Commissioners to consult with Presidential members in certain circumstances, in a smoke-filled back room, as it were, to deal with the interests of absent parties. In every sense this proposal deprecates the competence and integrity of Commissioners. They are directed to submit their will and their judgment in the discharge of an office (in which they have given their oath faithfully and impartially to perform the duties of that office ') to the overriding determination of another. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>The evil of this proposal is that it can only shake the confidence of parties before a Commissioner in the integrity of any ruling to which he ultimately puts his hand. No party knowing that a Commissioner reserves his decision and submits it to another can have sure confidence that he will report each party's case accurately to the Presidential member or that the Presidential member will accurately understand that party's case. The understanding may be conditioned by the manner in which the Commissioner sees fit, in all good faith, to present it. </para>
            <para>The Minister justifies this astonishing departure from established standards of behaviour by claiming that there is a complex range of awards and agreements within the jurisdiction of the Commission.

              <para>Time lost through industrial action. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Minister in his second reading speech described his amendments in terms of 'time lost' and 'industrial action'. It is to be noted that 'industrial action' embraces conduct not involving a strike, e.g. bans. Such bans do not necessarily involve any loss of working time. Nonetheless they may attract the amendment. To the extent that the Minister adopted the phrase 'dme lost' he has not stated accurately what is embraced by the proposal, which is directed to claims in respect of a period during which the employees are engaged in industrial action'. This need not necessarily have involved the loss of time as in a strike. The claim may arise in a period in which work was done. The Minister seeks to enrich employers by saving them from paying for what is done. </para>
          <para>This amendment seeks to defeat the common law and to deny employees access to this Commission in the interest of employers. It can only serve to depreciate the status of this Commission in the eyes of the millions of employees who contribute by their taxes to its support, for it is proposed to forbid members of the Commission to attempt to prevent and settle by conciliation and arbitration industrial disputes. </para>
          <para>It occurs under the same speech in which the Minister complains that some unions have failed to bring their disputes to the commission and have 'rejected the proper processes for settling their disputes'. Yet here there is a denial of all process for settling a dispute. </para>
          <para>Other members of the Commission have mentioned to me cases in which they have given decisions which they believe would be caught by the amendment. I wish to add to the count a ruling I gave in a dispute between the Union of Postal Clerks and Telegraphists and the Australian Postal Commission on 26 April 1979 (Print D9961)-a ruling which provoked a certain displeasure in high places at the time. It was a 'no work no pay' case. In the particular case an employee had carried out 99.999 per cent of his duties, omitting one of trifling significance as a work task but of monstrous import to the bureaucratic mind, for by reason of a union ban he had declined to sign a document which was otherwise authentic, complete and accurate, lacking merely his mark. He had performed in every other respect his duties faithfully and well but for none of it would the employer pay him. It was plain to me that the employer had requested implicitly, if not explicitly, the doing of the work for which it would not pay. Inter aiia, I had this to say on the 'work-on but no pay ' principle: </para>
          <para>My understanding of the law and the position is perfectly clear. A servant has certain entitlements of his master and he has certain duties towards his master. If the contract of employment requires of the servant that he should perform certain duties then a refusal by the servant to perform those duties provides an option to the employer. Where a servant declines to perform a task within the duties contemplated by the contract of service the employer may treat the contract as being at an end. It is voidable at his option; he may, if he wishes, dismiss the servant; he may, if he wishes, ignore the refusal. But he is not entitled to take the benefit of services rendered by the employee, by the servant, without paying a fair price for them. It may be that the price that is deemed fair and which ought to be paid by the master to his servant for such services as the master accepts, explicitly or implicitly, from the servant ought not to be remunerated by reference to the amount due if the service that is refused were given and taken into account. In other words, a fair price for the service that is rendered by the servant may not be one that is determined by reference to the wage due in the ordinary circumstance, but it does not follow that a fair wage for services that are offered and accepted may be refused out of hand. The master is under a duty to pay for what he accepts from his servant. The master, however, has another resort and that is to sue the servant for damages if he declines to dismiss him, and he may recover damages from the servant simply for the mere refusal to carry out the full intent of the bargain. The mere breach of the contract gives rise immediately to a right to nominal damages arising from the fact of the breach. Whether the master is entitled to recover damages that are not nominal but, indeed, are substantive is a question that needs to be determined by reference to the loss suffered by the master as the result of the breach. </para>
          <para>In the present case the position taken by Australia Post is ' We will accept the servant and we are accepting the service*. Indeed, it has been represented to me that they actually threatened someone against withdrawing service, or more accurately, perhaps, required of that person that he should actually continue to render service and not go home, although he was on no pay. </para>
          <para>It is not conceivable to me that any authority can be found in the common law which will support a result that the Postal Commission is entitled to take the services without payment on the facts that I have been dealing with here. The Postal Commission, one would have thought, consistent with its being a creature of statute law would at least seek to justify its position by argument about the consequences of the common law rules. However, here they seek to evade the obligations that may appear to be cast upon them by the common law by arguing that in this tribunal there is no jurisdiction to deal with the matter, and further they put that the employee if dissatisfied can take them to law in another place. </para>
          <para>Let me just put the position as I see it. Every citizen in this community has a duty to adhere to the rules of law and has no privilege to escape his obligations by reason merely that he has not been ordered by a court to carry out that which the law prescribes, just as I have a duty to conform to the rules of law as I understand them to be and am bound to do my best to carry them out without the command of a court. </para>
          <para>In my view the Australian Postal Commission, being a creature of the parliament, is acting inconsistently with the public's interest in the upholding of the law if they decline to act out the rules of law of their own volition and sit pat waiting until someone sues them in a court properly vested with the jurisdiction to make the orders appropriate in the circumstances. People should volunteer to obey the law, the Australian Postal Commission should volunteer to obey the law, and the law includes not only the statutes but the rules of common law; in this case, contrary to what one would expect of a great statutory corporation, we find people sitting pat and asking others not nearly as equally placed as they are to call on the courts in their aid if they have a complaint. </para>
          <para>Not only in my view is the Postal Commission at law misconducting itself on the facts revealed to me, but they are misconducting themselves in that they are seeking to impose a situation of total inequality upon their employees. In my view, the proper position for Australia Post to take up at this dme is to pay the employees and then sue the employees at law if Australia Post feel the law is on its side. The resources available to Australia Post to conduct litigation on its own initiative are infinitely greater than are the resources of ordinary employees, and if the law is on its side and it is justified in pursuing the line of conduct it would lead to the consequence that Australia Post should do the right thing and pay these people for the work taken from them, and if it feels it has suffered a loss that goes beyond nominal damages, it can sue to recover the losses.' </para>

          <para>The power to remove a matter before a member of the Commission from his hands falls somewhere near a power already in the Act (s. 23 (3) ), under which Presidential members may allocate work to members of the panel who are bound to comply with the directions of the Presidential member. There is no basis for concluding that the power of a Presidential member to organise and allocate the work of a member of his panel permits what is here proposed. I had occasion, not so long ago, to give a direction to a member of my panel not to take any step in a matter which had been previously under his active attention, and which came before me in his absence. My direction gave rise to certain misunderstandings. </para>
          <para>The member of my panel affected was away on vacation when a matter was notified to me and was urgent. When it was last before my colleague certain recommendations he had made had been rejected. The matter had been stood over generally. When it blew up again, I conferred privately with the parties. I gained a strong impression that a manoeuvre was on foot, notwithstanding the urgency of the matter and the absence of my colleague, to delay a further hearing in the Commission until he returned and became available. I had the strong impression that this manoeuvre was founded on two considerations- firstly, to ensure that I did not hear the matter and secondly, to ensure that my colleague did. To put a short word on what I believed to be going on, some persons were intent on selecting the judge of their cause. I gave the direction, of which I immediately informed the parties, without explanation, in order to make it perfectly plain that I would not permit it to appear that outsiders could influence the procedures of this Commission. Whether the particular means I chose to quash the ambitions that I detected were politic is a matter that others may question. It was not my purpose to act against my colleague's stature, rather to uphold his and mine and the independence of the Commission. This amendment strikes at the concept of judicial independence. </para>
          <para>Moreover, the amendment curtails a provision in the Act which is intended to serve the interest that justice shall appear to be done. Section 22 provides that where a member of the Commission has exercised powers with respect to conciliation he shall not participate in an arbitration, if there is an objection. </para>

We have already seen a number of examples recently where the present Government's will has been declared to have been thwarted by the decisions of this Commission. So, amendments have been brought into the Act and are now proposed again for the Act in order to promote the authority of the Government over our deliberations. Under this amendment, if the Government can empower the Commission to make a declaration it can, as well, amend the law so that it may proceed without the need for our declaration. We shall be left with the power only so long as we exercise it to the pleasure of the Government. </para>
          <para>One could write a treatise on the unconstitutionality of this proposal taken as a whole. It is not a proposal to prevent and settle industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration. Its purpose is to proceed to put an end to relevant industrial action by Government harassment, oppression and expropriation. Furthermore, a choice is given to the Government either to cancel registration or to set at nought the rights of a particular employee. By stripping a man of his civil rights, he becomes to that extent an outlaw. It is not to the point to clothe this diminution of status under the misleading phrase suspension'.

            <para>- I wish to give to the House a view in relation to the Executive and the judiciary or conciliation and arbitration commissioners. It may not be the view that is always adopted in practice. I take the view that the Executive, the legislature and the judiciary should remain separate. We have a separation of powers under our constitutional system. There should be at all times a clear and guiding principle that we maintain the separation of those functions. The Executive and the legislature, although composed of persons who are elected to the Parliament, have separate functions and the judiciary has separate functions. The position of commissioners and members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission who are presidential members is one that needs to be considered especially. However, because they carry out functions that are very much analogous to those of the judiciary and because they carry out important matters of conciliation and arbitration and lay down rules which bind- at least we hope that they bind- those parties to the various disputes, I believe that there is for the purposes of considering separation of powers no real distinction between their position and that of the judiciary. We should re-emphasise that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The point I want to make is that I do not believe that on matters of substantive law as against procedural matters there ought to be any consultations or discussions between any of the judiciary or commissioners and members of the legislature or the Executive. I believe that that is a fundamental principle. Perhaps it has been eroded at various times by practices that, understandably, have come onto the scene in the industrial relations field because of the wish of parties to try to provide the maximum amount of prior consideration of proposed amendments. But this can lead to difficulties and the types of problems which have arisen recently. I do not believe that a conciliation and arbitration commissioner, a presidential member of the Commission or a judge ought to write to a member of the legislature or the Executive- that includes the appropriate Minister- on matters of substantive amendments to an Act. It is up to the judiciary or the Commission to take the laws as they are amended and to interpret them in accordance with their office. I do not believe that the Executive should seek to contact the judiciary or the Commission in respect of substantive laws and tell them what it believes should be an approach to those laws. </para>
          <para>Procedural matters are different. One would not suggest that matters such as delays in court proceedings or how to ensure that the business of the court or the Commission is best conducted should be the subject of such a rule. Procedural matters obviously ought to be considered prior to their implementation to provide the smooth running of the court or the Commission. In this case procedural matters have been alluded to and the provision in the Act- I will not go into itrelating to consultation was procedural. But there should not be these types of discussions on other matters. This would avoid the problems that have arisen. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples sent a copy of some criticism of substantive matters to members of Parliament, including members of the Opposition, as I understand he did, or to the Minister for Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> I do not believe that he should have done so. Those substantive matters should have simply been returned to him without any comment. Procedural matters are different but I think it is most important that we understand the basic principle. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr FitzPATRICK</inline>(Riverina) (10.48)- During the adjournment debate last night I referred to the great value of country newspapers. I was about to mention the north-south road when I was sidetracked by someone saying that I should not retire. I believe that the <inline font-style="italic">New South Western Standard</inline> has every justification in reviving interest in the north-south road. The honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fisher)</inline> and I have raised this matter in this House on several occasions. Recently, members of the Broken Hill City Council, the secretary of the Barrier Industrial Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fred</inline> Smith, and others have asked me to raise the matter in the House once again. I inform the House that interest was first taken in the north-south road when a picture was taken by an out-of-course satellite in its dying days. This was during the greatest inland flood in living memory in 1974. At that time the inland of Australia had been deluged by rain and the inland road system was impassable to traffic. All roads to the east were cut by flooding in the Channel country. The low roads south from Alice Springs were a quagmire. The route of the proposed north-south road follows the high ridge of land dividing the two great drainage basins of this continent, the Lake Eyre and Murray-Darling Basins, and continues along the eastern edge of Lake Eyre connecting with Sturt 's Stony Desert. The satellite picture showed that the route was flood free even in the record flood. It not only showed the proposed route to be flood free, but also showed it to be the most direct route to the north from the populated east of Australia. Much of the proposed highway is already in existence. From the south, from Melbourne through Mildura to Broken Hill the road is fully sealed. To the north, Darwin is already linked by a sealed highway through Tennant Creek, Mount Isa and Boulia. The portion of the road we are worried about is from Boulia through to Tibooburra. This portion has not been constructed. </para>
          <para>The Committee asks that the Army do a survey of this road. I think it is important that this road survey be carried out at this time. The debate last week on roads pointed out the value of road work to employment. We were told that 75 per cent of the cost of road work goes to labour. Soil tests have been taken of this road which show that the material is already there. One can see the great advantage now of investigating this road further. It has caught the imagination of all of the people in the area who have had a look at this road. I think it is up to the Government at least to say that it will put the Army in to do this survey. I believe that during the period of the Labor Government the Army stated that it was anxious to make this survey and I believe it still would be. </para>
          <para>I ask the Government to give further consideration to this road and to remember that it is of great benefit to Australia's tourism, beef roads, agriculture, natural gas line servicing, et cetera. Australians would be able to travel and explore the interior of their own land. Darwin would not be isolated during flood periods and it would become a greater consumer of goods from the south and possibly a port for overseas goods for the inland. I ask the Government to take an interest in this road once again because I think there are great benefits to be derived for Australia. </para>

            <para>- I was delighted this evening to receive from the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> a full copy of the letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples,  Deputy President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, about the Government's proposed changes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. On page 4 of his letter appears a statement which I think honourable members will be most interested to hear. It reads: </para>

            <para>The Bill proposes to require Commissioners to consult with Presidential members in certain circumstances, in a smoke-filled back room, as it were, to deal with the interests of absent parties.

          <para class="block">I never read anything of that sort in the Bill. I wonder whether this is written by a man of the law or a politician?

          <para class="block">I think the media, for the first time, were quite right. I am amazed to find an occasion when one would really think that the media were perfectly fair. What were judges in pre-war Germany? Were they some sort of saintly organisation? I thought that in pre-war Germany the nazi government was in full power. What is the Opposition complaining of? I am amazed to think that the honourable member for Hindmarsh could be so sensitive. I would say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples has stated his view quite clearly. What he does not like is any action of this Parliament to decide that we should reinforce the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to protect the members of smaller unions and give job security. My own electors do not care about what goes on in this high fandango of arbitration. They want job security. They are saying: 'Does the legislation of the </para>
          <para class="block">Government give me more chance of job security or not?' The perfect answer is that it will. What is more, the Opposition has not woken up to this fact- the electorate knows it will increase job security. This honourable justice has complained that the Government is going to strengthen the powers of the  President  of the Commission. What is wrong with that? Does the Opposition object to that? Why has it not said so? If the Act asks a Commissioner to consult with the  President,  does that mean to say that when he has consulted the  President  he will say to the two parties - </para>

His  remarks in the main were acceptable but he is now proceeding to debate the contents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. If he continues to do so he will be out of order. </para>

I say quite frankly that this proposition put before us by the honourable member for Hindmarsh does not stand up to any examination by any honourable member of parliament. The honourable member for Hindmarsh is greatly mistaken. The letter I have read is political pamphleteering and I cannot see that it has any justification whatever. </para>

            <para>-This evening I bring to the attention of the House the plight of the Canterbury Community Youth Support Scheme. Today I received advice from the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> that that scheme had received $26,616 for the half-year program this year. That amount is a reduction of 10 per cent on the grant that that scheme received last year. In real terms it is a reduction of about 20 per cent. When one considers that this Canterbury scheme is a most successful multilingual, multicultural scheme- probably one of the most successful schemes in the metropolitan area of Sydney- it is a crying shame that the Minister has seen fit to provide a 10 per cent across the board reduction to it. Those running the scheme receive enough subsidy to provide three salaries. In fact, they have four part time workers- two Arabic speaking people and two English speaking people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In 1977-78, 960 young people went through the scheme in the Canterbury area. This month nearly 800 people under 21 years of age who are out of work are registered with the Campsie Commonwealth Employment Service office, and 30 job vacancies are registered as being unfilled. Arabic speaking people constitute 45 per cent of those who have gone through this scheme in Canterbury. I submit to the Parliament and to the Minister- unfortunately he has not seen fit to come into the chamber tonight even though I did ring his office to let him know I would be raising this question during the adjournment debatethat this is a special case that should receive a sympathetic hearing from the Government. There are very few community youth support schemes that have such a high ethnic content as the Canterbury one. Very few schemes have taken positive steps to ensure that the cultural and work experience of all the people in the electorate are taken care of. </para>
          <para>I submit that the Minister should reconsider his decision to reduce the Canterbury scheme funding by 10 per cent and that in view of the very good job that is being done for migrant children in the community in Canterbury in my electorate of Grayndler he should give the scheme personnel some special consideration to ensure that they can keep up the job they have been doing over the last three years and do not have to dismiss staff. </para>

Air Navigation Regulations define an aeroplane as 'a power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft deriving its lift in flight chiefly from aerodynamic reactions on surfaces remaining fixed under given conditions of flight.' Assuming 'home-made' to include those aeroplanes including rotorcraft built to a set of plans provided by the designer, or those assembled from a kit of parts, which may include some completed sub-assemblies, there are two categories of aeroplane to consider: </para>

          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>Yes. Not all chronic conditions require continuous specialist treatment. Ideally the specialist orders a course of treatment to be supervised by the patient's general practitioner. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Yes, if they wish to qualify for the higher rate of medical benefits for the charges raised by the specialist </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The fact that a new referral is issued after 12 months does not necessarily mean that the specialist would charge an initial consultation fee which would attract the higher rate of benefit. However, where the specialist has not seen the person for a considerable period, or is commencing a new, or reassessing the current, course of treatment it would not be unreasonable for the initial consultation fee to be charged. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Because of the wide and to some extent unpredictable variations in circumstances which may arise in relation to medical treatment, there are obvious difficulties in developing referral procedures to meet all cases. From the viewpoint of any particular individual who is fortunate enough not to require the services of a general practitioner between annual visits to a specialist, the system may be seen as involving some personal inconvenience and small added expense. From the viewpoint of efficient and economical administration of the Medical Benefits Scheme, it is a necessary safeguard against unnecessary expenditure by the Commonwealth and by the health insurance funds. The amount of medical benefits paid for visits to general practitioners to obtain referral renewals once a year would undoubtedly be less than that involved in paying the higher rates of medical benefits for visits to specialist for attention to conditions that could be adequately cared for by general practitioners, which is regarded as being the likely result if there were no referral system or if no limit were placed on the life of referrals. This is particularly relevant where, as frequently occurs, the specialist recommends a course of treatment which can then be supervised by the general practitioner, with only occasional reassessment by the specialist. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>With some 35 million specialist services each year, of which only a small proportion relate to continuing treatment by specialists of chronic illnesses, it would be administratively impracticable to consider each individual service separately to decide whether or not a new referral should be required in that particular case. The only practical course is to lay down a system which is capable of uniform application. </para>
          <para>Since 1970 there have been a number of reviews of the referral system undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the Australian Medical Association. The latest review was specifically directed at the question of treatment of chronic illnesses. The outcome of each review has been the general consensus' that the system is necessary, is a good one, and is working satisfactorily in the overall interests of the Medical Benefits Scheme. </para>

              <para>1 ) Yes. The Australian Radiation Laboratory does provide a radiation monitoring service at Nabarlek. This service is available to uranium mining companies as an extension of the normal national film badge service although the severe temperature and humidity conditions encountered at uranium mines have required the development by the Laboratory of a new badge using thermoluminescent phosphors in lieu of the normal radiation sensitive film. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The badges are normally worn for a period of 4 weeks and then returned to the Laboratory for processing. Total radiation exposures for the wearing period are reported to the mining company and to the Northern Territory supervisory authorities. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The highest exposure recorded for any individual at Nabarlek up to 14 September 1979 (when the latest series of badges was recalled) is 378 millirem accumulated over a 6 week period thus corresponding to an average rate of 63 millirem per week. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>It is difficult to provide a meaningful average figure for the entire workforce as it is distorted by the large number of employees who wear badges but whose work does not normally take them into areas of significant radiation and whose badges accordingly indicate only a normal background level of about 2 millirem per week. However, of those whose badges indicate exposures significantly above the normal background level the weekly rate lies within the range of 8 to 63 millirem per week with an average value of 27 millirem per week. </para>
          <para>Under the 1975 Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores which is currently in force in the Northern Territory, the maximum permitted whole body exposure for an occupationalry exposed employee is 5,000 millirem per year or approximately 100 millirem per week. </para>

          <para>Port dues- depending on the port up to $ 1 00 per day for each apprehended foreign fishing vessel. </para>

            <para>The honourable member's question of 1 1 September 1 979 relates to the charges to be introduced on 1 November 1979 for certain services to be provided by my Department. Of these services- and there are seven of them- only one appears to have direct relevance for the question asked: obtaining information by way of cables initiated by applicants/clients. </para>
            <para>Applicants for entry to Australia often seek expeditious processing of their applications or information on the progress of the application at overseas offices by cable communication overseas. The proposed charges are intended to recover those costs which are incurred by the Government at the initiative of the applicant. </para>
            <para>Where normal processing of an application warrants cable communication, current practice will continue: the Department will pay for the cable. </para>
            <para>In this context, it is usual for State or Federal Parliamentarians to seek answers, without specifying the means by which these are expedited. It is thus a matter for my Department to decide what information, if any, is needed from overseas and how this is to be obtained. In such circumstances, no charges would apply to parliamentary representations. </para>
