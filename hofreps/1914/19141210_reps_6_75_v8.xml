                        <para>- By leave of the House, I desire to make the following statement: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The investigation into the position of  the Broken Hill Company and other companies engaged in the metal industry has not disclosed any offence against the law, but it is, on the other hand, quite clear that a position of affairs exists quite incompatible with our attitude towards the vital interests at stake during the present war, the commercial and industrial supremacy of the Empire, and the development of the resources of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Shortly stated, the facto show beyond all question that German capital and German influence exercise a monopoly of the base metal industry of the civilized world ; that this monopoly is for all practical purposes so complete as to exclude effective competition ; that it covers the whole sphere of the industry, limiting output, controlling markets, determining the channels of distribution, and fixing prices; that the war, by closing most of the channels through which the metallic products were distributed and the markets in which they were disposed of, has very seriously affected the industry, throwing large numbers of working men out of employment, causing great loss of wealth production, retarding the development of our great resources, and seriously menacing the welfare of the whole community; that peace holds out no prospects satisfactory or even tolerable to British and Australian interests, since it would but revive that complete domination of the industry by German influence, which insures the building up of German  instead of British and Australian interests. </para>
                    <para>No patriotic citizen can contemplate such a prospect without the most serious misgivings. This war will have been waged in vain ; the blood of our best and bravest citizens shed without purpose ; the Empire will have endured the dreadful horrors of modern warfare to no purpose, if, at its conclusion, when victory tardily and at a dreadful cost has been won, we are again compelled to pour into the lap of Germany the lion's share of the wealth created by Australian enterprise and Australian workmen. </para>
                    <para>Before the war, German capital and influence had created a splendidly organized system by which it was enabled to levy toll upon the world. The cream of the profits arising out of the metal industry of the world - profits upon a turnover which, at a rough estimate, cannot fall short of £200,000,000- found its way through various channels to the pockets of the great German financiers, thus strengthening Germany's position commercially, industrially, and nationally, enlarging the scope of her operations in other directions, and maintaining and perfecting that terrific instrument of destruction by which she now seeks to batter all who dare withstand her, into submission. It is a humiliating but irrefutable fact that Australian capital, enterprise, and labour have materially aided the enemy in this dreadful conflict. </para>
                    <para>A few figures will clearly establish this position. The value of the metals, lead, zinc, copper, and tin produced annually  in Australia, estimated upon an average price for the year 1912, amounts to nearly £13,000,000, or, including silver and gold recovered in the extraction of these commoner metals, £15,000,000. Even upon a fair average price for the past ten years the gross value is not less than £13,000,000. All this wealth was produced in Australia, but - with the exception of gold and silver - the industry was and is controlled by German influence, so that output, destination, and price were matters in which Australia had no say whatever. </para>
                    <para>The methods by which the industry was controlled are characteristic of the modern German spirit and enterprise. Everywhere agencies were established which assumed the cloak of the nationality in which they found themselves. In America, for example, it was known as the American Metal Company; in Africa, the African Metal Company. </para>
                    <para>A convention controlled by German influence fixed and fixes the price of lead. Lead can be sold only through a  German controlled  agency. The British Government is compelled to buy through this agency, which dictates the price. Lead cun only be bought through this agency, or with its approval, and at the price fixed by the convention, which is under the same control* as the agency. For all practical purposes, the agent is the convention. </para>
                    <para>Zinc is controlled as to price, output, destination, and manufacture into spelter, the zinc of commerce, by a German combine of three firms - Beer Sondheimer, Metallgesellschaft, and Aaron Hirsch and Sohn. British firms cannot obtain supplies of concentrates for purposes of making spelter, because the Germans have control of the supplies, and have contracts with the mines in this country until 1920. </para>
                    <para>Copper is controlled in much the same way, if not to the same extent. The same may be said of tin. </para>
                    <para>Germany thus levies toll upon the whole industry; it holds its destinies in its hands. We produce the ores, but we do so to the extent the Germans determine, and must be content with the price they fix. They determine - in effect - the output of our mines and the manufacturing processes of the products of those mines in which we may engage. </para>
                    <para>This is surely an intolerable position. Common sense, self-interest, and patriotism alike impel us to put an end to it. </para>
                    <para>The inducements to do so are very considerable. Wo obstacles that cannot be removed stand in the way. The metallurgical treatment of lead, copper, and tin can be successfully accomplished within the Commonwealth with an expenditure of an amount of capital easily obtainable. The treatment of zinc involves a very large expenditure. It is hoped that British enterprise may be induced to take this latter in hand without delay. </para>
                    <para>The basis of any successful undertakings of this nature here or in Great Britain must rest upon a market free from the control of that German influence by which it is now dominated. British capital can hardly be expected to invest in an enterprise so gigantic without an assurance of an adequate supply of concentrates, and these cannot be obtained while the existing contracts still hold good. We are communicating with the British Government, setting forth the position, and strongly requesting their co-operation in these matters in which the interests of the Commonwealth are so vitally concerned. </para>
                    <para>The present position in which the Australian and certain British companies are tied up by contracts with agencies dominated by German capital and influence may call for legislative action in Great Britain an'd here. </para>
                    <para>The success of any proposal to divert the control of the industry from German to British hands depends largely upon the co-operation of the Australian companies. If they prefer to be tied up by contracts which provide for resumption of business after the war, and if they prefer that the control of the industry shall rest with the alien enemy, the task before us will be rendered very difficult. </para>
                    <para>We hope, however, for their cordial cooperation - we have every reason to believe they are very ready to co-operate - and we believe that, with the aid of the British Government and British enterprise, much wider avenues may be opened for British and Australian interests, and for the employment of British and Australian workmen. We ought no longer to play the part of building up the power and influence of a nation whose avowed intention is to humiliate and crush us. </para>

Has the Department of Trade and Customs any power to prevent a country like America carrying on operations which may have the effect of preventing the establishment of industries in Australia? </para>

                        <para>- I saw the cablegram, but I confess that I had not time to read it. The only power we have is the power to prohibit the export of material; and we should be very reluctant to exercise it. If the industry referred to is a profitable one, I have no doubt that capital will be found to carry it on in Australia; and I am sure we should all be glad to see such industries established here. All we could do, as I say, would be to either impose an export duty or prohibit export altogether. Such a step as the latter might be taken in time of war, but it would certainly be rather a strong step to take at any other time. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask a question of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and it will be necessary to preface that question by a few explanatory remarks. Last Friday I sent my secretary to the Customs Department to ask for certain information concerning the probable exports for the year. I was given to understand that the information would be obtained. When my secretary called for the information yesterday the head of the Department quite properly said that he would let me have the information when it had been seen by the Minister. To-day, when my secretary again called, he was informed that the Minister regretted that he could not supply the information. I should like the Minister to explain why I cannot have the information. I want it for no party purpose. </para>

The Secretary of the Navy Office telephoned to the works, and the reply given to him was, as I told the House, that the Commonwealth had not imported a German motor lorry and had had nothing whatever to do with it, hut that there was a motor lorry at the works with which the State Government was concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Having had several complaints from men who have left Australia to fight the battles of the Empire, I made inquiries from the Postal Department and was informed that there is no power under the Postal Act to allow the franking of letters posted by men while on active service. As soon as a member of the Imperial Forces goes on active service, his letters are franked by the British Government, for the reason that he cannot be expected to carry stamps with him, and that stamps are not always available at the nearest post-office. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will introduce an amending Bill of one clause giving the Defence authorities power to frank the letters of men on active service? </para>

It is unreasonable that soldiers should be required to burden themselves with the provision of stamps, and before the session closes I shall interview my colleague, the Postmaster-General, and see if what the honorable member suggests cannot be done. </para>

Can the Minister take any urgent action to relieve this congestion, which is so. seriously affecting country interests? </para>

If the opportunity offers, I hope to make that alteration. </para>

Surely the Prime Minister should have been communicated with in this matter. He ought to know whether the Inter-State press is excluded, and, if so, why. </para>

                        <para>It is only in the case of certain classes of estimates, whore it is considered sufficient information for the preliminary quotation is already in possession of the Department, that the inspection of proposed routes is dispensed with. The basis of the estimate in these cases is the accumulated data as to the costs of construction of different classes of line, and the probable revenue to be derived, which is held by the Department's officers. This new procedure has the twofold advantage of enabling preliminary quotations to be given to applicants with a minimum of delay, and of effecting economies in administration in the case of a large number of cases for which working estimates have in the past been prepared, but where the proposal has not been further proceeded with. </para>

There is no Supply business on the paper, except the motion that the  Speaker  shall leave the chair under standing order 241, which is the ordinary motion on grievance day.

                        <para>- We had a long discussion on this question of practice in 1901. Objection was taken in that year, or later, to bringing in any resolutions at all, because the practice in some of the States - and certainly in South Australia - was to have a message sent down without any resolution. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton who drew attention to the matter in Committee of Ways and Means; and there was a ruling, or rather a direction, given by consent by the  Chairman  that the debate could be taken in Committee of Ways and Means, and that every matter in the Budget, and every separate fiscal proposal of the Government, could be referred to. A similar ruling, I believe, is laid down in <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - We begin the discussion of the Budget this year under circumstances that are quite abnormal, including the time of year at which it is introduced. I, for one, have no intention to open up a wide field of debate. I should imagine that, having regard to the fact that our proceedings are to be wound up on Tuesday or Wednesday next, the discussion on the Budget will be of limited duration. However, something needs to be said, and it is my duty to refer to some of the aspects of the Budget brought prominently before us and the country by the Prime Minister. One expects the Prime Minister in these years to begin all his discussions of finance with a reference to that blessed word " surplus," and on the present occasion we are not disappointed. In his very first sentence he solemnly calls the world to witness that on such-and-such a date in the year 1912-13 there was art audited cash surplus available for expenditure. That forms the subject of a distinct paragraph in his speech. What follows does not necessarily relate to the surplus, and we can only imagine that the Prime Minister, true to the instincts of himself and the party behind him, seeks to impress the country once more with his wonderful financing which gave him the surplus of £2,643,000. </para>

                            <para>- The deficit of £450,000 had been increased to £1,100,000 in the same year, and all of it liquidated out of the rolling millions the Liberals left him for that purpose. One is apt to imagine, when rolling in wealth inherited from somebody else, that it is the result of one's own merit, and, accordingly, the Prime Minister and his party plume themselves on their wonderful financial management. They never once refer to the fact that the whole financial dispositions were due to the arrangements made by previous Liberal Governments, who gave the Government the inheritance that they have tried their best to dissipate at the very earliest moment. In three years the Government increased the expenditure of the country by over 100 per cent. ; but the Prime Minister tells us nothing about that. </para>

                            <para>- Still he has a surplus, thanks to the money we left him. The blessed word " Mesopotamia " is not. in it with the word "surplus,"no other word is in it except, perhaps, the word "referendum." The Government remind us of that large number of people who have come down in the world ; and, perhaps, the Prime Minister's intention, after all, is to show how, from the affluence of a year or two ago, he has reached the condition of being financially out at elbow. It may be his way of pointing out that the Government have now reached an unenviable position, in which every stratagem must be resorted to to make the Budget balance and to present the accounts in a way that they may be readable at all. This position is not wholly the Prime Minister's fault, and I am not blaming him ; I merely wish to say that it is time the word " surplus" was less on his tongue. I hope we shall hear less of the word from his party, for whatever advantage they may have gained by its use - and they have gained much in former times - they are now down in the financial world, and "making heavy weather." </para>

                    <para>Notwithstanding the surplus and the wonderful financial ability which we are told is possessed by honorable members opposite, the present case is a desperate one, indeed. I am not now speaking of the calamitous consequences of the war. In what I have to say I shall confine myself to a review of events as they relate to the ordinary current expenditure of the Commonwealth. Prom that point of new, I say, the case is most desperate, and needs attention at the earliest possible  moment.  What are the facts ? Notwithstanding the surplus, and all the extra taxation which has been mounting up, the Treasurer to-day has to drag in the savings of former years, to resort to further all-round taxation, and to begin to borrow, in order to square his ledger, so far as the ordinary business of the year is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I candidly think it could - in a large measure, at any rate. I cannot help feeling that this is a most unfortunate time to be imposing all this heavy taxation. Consider first the land tax, notice of which has just been given by the right honorable gentleman. It is a fact, made due note of by the right honorable member for Swan, that the people who are being hit hardest at this time are the people who are faring worst, the people who are suffering most from drought and other adverse natural conditions. That is a fact we may note, apart altogether from party views and feelings. Then there is the new probate duty, and the way in which that imposition appeals to me is this : we have men trooping away to the war to fight for us, and while they are absent from the country, notwithstanding all the risk they are taking, we are making it a little bit harder for their wives and families in the event of anything happening to the bread-winners. It is most unfortunate and inopportune that these taxes "should be imposed in the particular way in which they are being imposed. I shall say nothing to-day in regard to the general taxation per medium of the Tariff and Excise. That will come in for discussion later on, and, I have no doubt, will receive adequate treatment at the hands of honorable members on this side who have been studying these schedules, and all the wonderful doings of this most wonderful Ministry. I will only say, in passing, after a cursory perusal of these schedules, that it seems to me that the right honorable gentleman would have done better to have waited until he had received the report of the Inter-State Commission rather than present this thing of shreds and patches - this complete botch of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> Tariff, as even his best friends outside, who clamoured loudest for Tariff revision, are beginning to see already. But the Government had to fulfil their obligations to certain interests and individuals from whom they gained large support in the recent election. I do not blame them for carrying out their election pledges, but I do think they should have gone about the matter in a sensible, reasonable, and business-like way. They are under no obligation to make fiscal fools of themselves for the purpose of carrying out any promise to the country, either now or at any other time. </para>

Somehow or other, they can fix up the beer interests, and the temperance interests as well, as they are so assiduously trying to do just now in connexion with certain papers which every honorable member is receiving in such large shoals. I congratulate honorable members on their dexterity in exploiting every sentiment in the community. </para>

                    <para>I am drawing attention to the way iu which taxation in Australia is towering up, particularly in those spheres where Labour men do congregate. I have in my hands a statement of what has been done in some of the other States under the  ages-  of Labour government. In Tasmania, for instance, the Government are withholding all increments from officers in the Government service who are receiving over £200 per year. In the Federal sphere we are increasing them. Then they are graduating the tax upon the unearned increment of land, and increasing the amount obtainable from that source. They are putting the screw on the income tax a little more, and by that means hope to get £14,000 extra. In regard to the taxation of deceased persons' estates, there is a duplication of what the Federal Government are doing. They are taxing all tickets for public amusements and entertainments, and so getting a little more from that source. They are increasing the stamp duties, and the taxes on motor vehicles and such-like things. It seems to me that in Tasmania there has been an all-round endeavour to get a little more revenue somewhere or other. We are following after them with the same kind of imposition, and just where this double taxation is going to cease I do not know. It is becoming a very serious problem in Australia as to how far this double banking is to proceed. </para>

                    <para>In my own State of New South Wales the Liberal Government are resolving their difficulties by imposing a supertax on the income tax, which they increased only a few months ago. There is also an additional tax on motor cars. We are told that all this taxation in New South Wales is temporary, although how the war has hit the Government in that State I do not pretend to know. I rather see the way in. which they are throwing money about order to popularize themselves in the various electorates, and so make their own' calling and election sure - a praiseworthy" objective, no doubt, within certain limits, but when you have to tax people in a' period of stress and strain like the present, it is time to draw the line. I shall not go into the details of what the Government in Western Australia are doing, but there they are putting on the same kind of taxation as the Government arc proposing here in such large and generous measure. </para>
                    <para>I desire to refer to the Budget statement of the Prime Minister for a few minutes, in order to make apparent exactly what we are doing in the Commonwealth. The right honorable gentleman dealt with a period of three years - his last year in office, the year in which the Liberal Government were in power, and the present year - and he began at the point where his precious surplus was iu the Labour party's safe and secure possession. I call attention first to the curious way in which the right honorable gentleman set out his figures when stating the anticipated revenue for this year - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>J estimate that the total revenue for the currant financial year 1014-15, inclusive of the surplus balance of £1,222,401, will amount to £24,495,401. " I estimate this to be the revenue for the year." Not one word is mentioned of the extra taxation involved in the make-up of this revenue. He told us of the extra taxation in another part of his speech some time later, and the impression will be created outside, particularly amongst the honorable gentleman's own followers, that these taxes do not go to make up this revenue, which is therefore deficient by the amount of such taxes. The honorable member adds the taxes first, and then says, " I estimate that the revenue will be so much," without saying a word about the taxes which are included in the estimate. I submit that that is a very tricky way of stating the figures; and, whether there be a political purpose or not in that method, the fact remains that it is not a fair way of setting out the revenue. What would 0have been a fair way would' be to say: "I estimate the revenue for the year at £21,695,401, and I propose to augment that amount by £1,000,000 from land taxation, £1,000,000 from probate duties, and £800,000 from further fiscal taxation, and by issuing Treasury-bills for £1,346,000." Instead of doing that, the right honorable gentleman said, " I estimate that the revenue will be £24,000,000, the estimated expenditure is £25,841,000, and, therefore, the estimated deficit will amount to £1,346,000." As a matter of fact, there is a deficiency on this year's income and ordinary expenditure of £4,000,000 odd. That is a fact I desire to get before the country; a fact that the right honorable gentleman seems to be studiously covering up - the difference between the income of the year on the old basis and the expenditure for the year is over £4,000,000 sterling. </para>

When he referred to the revenue was the time, surely, to have mentioned the taxation proposals. But not a word of them was mentioned at that stage. The right honorable gentleman assumed the taxes at this point, and gave the House the total figures - " I estimate the income for the year at so much, the outgoing at so much, and the deficiency at £1,346,000." People outside, when reading that statement, would naturally come to the conclusion that that is the whole of the deficit on the year's operations. </para>

                            <para>- Never mind what we did. I am discussing now the Budget of the right honorable the Prime Minister. Whatever the right honorable member for Swan did was candid and straightforward, and he would never have dreamed of stating the revenue of the year at what was to be the revenue after the imposition of taxation not yet authorized or collected. There is no statutory authority for such taxation so far, and I complain of this tricky way of presenting the Estimates of revenue for the year. </para>

                    <para>Here are the facts: Last year the revenue was £21,740,000. This year's expenditure is estimated to be £25,841,000, a difference between last year's revenue and this year's estimated expenditure of £4,101,000. The right honorable gentleman has been very fortunate this year in regard to a number of items which we had to pay last year, but from which he is absolved this year. For instance, last year we had to pay £149,244 for sugar bounties, and £41,310 for other bounties. The Science Congress cost about £15,000 extra. Advertising in connexion with the London Office amounted to £36,979; but that expenditure has been completely wiped out this year. The right honorable gentleman gets credit for these amounts, which total £241,000, and if, in order to make a fair comparison between last year and this year, we add that £241,000 to the £4,101,000, the right honorable gentleman is short of his expenditure by £4,342,000. </para>

                            <para>- I am not twisting figures. I am making a plain statement, though a very different one, I admit, to that made by the Treasurer. My point is that, taking as a basis of comparison the revenue of last year and the estimated revenue of this year, the Treasurer is not financing the year's ordinary expenditure by a sum considerably over £4,000,000. Else, why does he bring in these new taxes - the land tax, probate duties, and additional fiscal taxation amounting to £2,800,000 - and then, on top of that, need Treasury-bills for £1,346,000, giving a total of £4,146,000 extra to be got somewhere in order to finance the ordinary expenditure of the year ? The war has little to do with this kind of thing. The Minister of Trade and Customs says that the total effect of the war upon the Treasurer's estimated income is £1,500,000. </para>

                            <para>- That is precisely what I am saying. In order to liquidate through the Customs the deficit, which the Minister informs us is £1,500,000, extra impositions to the extent of £4,000,000 are to he placed upon the people. Clearly, therefore, had there been no war and no drought, the Treasurer would still have had to resort to this further heavy taxation in order to square his ledger for the year. </para>

                    <para>This new taxation is not war taxation. My friends on the other side will tell the people that it is all due to the war ; but, happily, the war expenditure is all earmarked and set down in the Budget, and the way in which it has affected our revenue has been definitely expressed in figures by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Clearly, therefore, the ordinary income and expenditure of the year, quite apart from the influence of the war and the drought, necessitate all this heavy taxation announced by the Treasurer. </para>

                            <para>- Here is a different tune. We came into office right at the end of a financial year, a little over a year ago, but, nevertheless, the right honorable gentleman took good care to saddle us with the whole of the responsibility for the year ; yet now, after being in office all these months, he is trying to get rid of the responsibility for the financial position this year, it changes his tune as he steps from one side of the chamber to the other. Although we came in at the end of a financial year, the right honorable gentleman and his colleague, the Attorney-General, went all over the country denouncing our finances to some purpose; they piled up the millions and set them rolling in fine style, and got all they could out of them. I do not blame them ; but what are the facts? Last year the Liberal Government spent £1,636,000 more than in the previous financial year, but this year, for the ordinary purposes of government, not for the purposes of the war, and not to meet any falling off in Customs revenue, the present Treasurer proposes to spend £2,680,000 more than was spent last year. If the Liberal Government were extravagantly financing last year, the present Treasurer must be having a high old carnival this year, so far as the ordinary expenditure of the year is concerned. Making a comparison between the two years, putting them both  on the same basis, and bringing in the £241,000 which the Liberal Government had to pay last year, and which the present Treasurer is exempted from paying this year, and adding the £2,680,000, there is a difference of nearly £3,000,000 between the financing of the two years in regard to ordinary expenditure. </para>

                                the Commissioner of Taxation, in a statement he made public the other day, said that from the increment of the land tax alone he expected to get £700,000 or £800,000 for the balance of the year, irrespective of leasehold taxation. I cannot be told that ho is to get only £200,000 a year from the taxation of holders of leases. I should estimate that from this source he would get at least the balance of £2,000,000. Therefore, I think that my estimate of about £5,500,000 extra taxation per annum will be near the mark. This is to be imposed in a full year.

                    <para>Taxation is towering up in Australia. The increase proposed by the Treasurer means about £1 2s. 6d. per head of the population on the basis I have named, and in New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> has imposed another 12s. 6d. per head for the year. As New South Wales contains 38 per cent, of the population of Australia, I can take it as an example of the effect of this new kind of financing we are getting. With 12s. 6d. per head imposed by the State, and 22s. 6d. per head imposed by the Federal Treasurer in one fell swoop, this additional taxation will come out at about £8 15s. per family in New South Wales, and I venture to say that the figure will come out about the same in the other two Labour States. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline> had had his way in Western Australia, the additional impost would be much more, and, in relation to her population, Tasmania would not be very far behind. All this taxation will be passed on. There can be no mistake about that. All experience proves the absolute impossibility of making watertight compartments in regard to  taxation. Taxes filter through and down to the man who works for his daily living, and who has to bear the brunt of it. </para>

                            <para>- None at all. Such a statement is a mere commonplace. When Lloyd George came down with his increased taxation he told the people that it would be taken off when the war was over. Could not the right honorable gentleman make a similar statement here? Could he not tell us what is his attitude regarding this taxation and the war ? There are certain well-known war appropriations which have to be resorted to in every civilized country. Great Britain, for instance, always resorts to an increased income tax, and other taxation of the kind, but there is always given to Parliament a distinct intimation that such taxation is for war purposes only, and the anticipation of relief is' always well founded. The relief, indeed, invariably takes place. I ask the right honorable gentleman if that is to be so in connexion with these taxes? </para>

                            <para>- That is a sufficient answer. The right honorable gentleman tells us that these taxes have nothing to do with the liquidation of war liabilities. We are, therefore, to assume that they are for the purpose of liquidating his ordinary liabilities - liabilities incurred in carrying on the ordinary services of the Government for the year. </para>

We are imposing additional taxation on the people to the tune of nearly £3,000,000 in respect of the rest of the financial year, and probably to the extent of £5,500,000 for the whole of next year for the purpose of carrying on the ordinary government of the country. </para>

We have only to study the Estimates to see that a great deal could be done to avoid the additional taxation now being imposed on the people. Is it not time to ask, in this National Parliament, where economical management comes in ? Is it an affront to my honorable friends opposite to ask if they propose to begin to exercise a little economy in, for instance, the Postal Department? The Treasurer tells us that these are the Estimates as presented to him - that he did not interfere with them in any way. </para>

                            <para>- We hear nothing from the honorable  member  this year as to the necessity for cutting down the ordinary expenditure of the Defence Department. He and all his colleagues will remain silent - like Jeremiah dumb dogs. I call attention to the fact that the ordinary Defence expenditure this year is 38 per cent, more than last year. In other words, there is an expenditure of £1 6s. 3d. per head in respect of ordinary services, having nothing whatever to do with the war. Last year we spent 19s. 6d. per head all told; this year there is to be an increase of 6s. 9d. per head, or a total Defence expenditure of £1 6s. 3d. per head on ordinary services. I hope that the Public Accounts Committee will get to work speedily and see if this expenditure is really necessary. If they find it to be absolutely necessary in order to maintain an effective organization, then no one on this side of the House will criticise it. But we ought to know the facts. We ought to know whether we are getting 20s. in value for every sovereign that we spend in the Department. We ought to know that the  money  is being well spent. We do not begrudge a liberal Defence expenditure, as long as we know that there is corresponding efficiency. </para>

                    <para>What are we obtaining just now for our expenditure? The Minister told us the other day that altogether we were sending 42,000 men to the war- that 20,000 had already gone, that 13,000 were to go this month, and that during the next six months 9,000 were to be sent, but only as reinforcements. The effectives that we propose to maintain on the battlefield, therefore, number only 33,000. If these represent the total proposals of the present Government, I do not think them adequate. I hope the Government will reconsider this matter. The war is for us a life and death struggle, and having regard to the purpose that we should have in view - the extinction of the enemy .-it the earliest possible moment - to say that we are going to maintain only 33,000 soldiers on the battlefield is to make an entirely inadequate proposal. We are under an obligation to do more, and I shall be much surprised if Australia does not expect us to do more. I hope that this statement by the Minister does not represent the final judgment of the Government on what is undoubtedly the greatest war in the history of the world. We must have more than 33,000 men on the battlefield. . It is idle to talk about giving our last man and our last shilling if this is all that is to be done. Our last man and our last shilling, if left in Australia, will bring the battle over yonder no nearer a conclusion. We must, if necessary, send our last man and our last shilling over there, where the fighting has to be done. If the proposal represents what the Prime Minister meant when he spoke of our last man and our last shilling being at the disposal of the Imperial Government, I venture to submit, with great respect, that it is time he revised his opinions of this war and of its range and scale. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the Postal Department, another huge spending service, and I do not hesitate to say that it must soon be tackled seriously. It is a perfect sink of money and something must be done to place it upon a business footing. It is not so at present. The estimated increase in the revenue of the Postal Department for the year is a trifle over £60,000, whereas the estimated expenditure is £546,000 more than was expended last year. These figures are exclusive of loan expenditure. I find that the ordinary expenditure of the Department this year is to be £6,845,000, while its income is put down at £4,604,000, or a deficiency of £2,241,000. If we add to that the loan expenditure of £459,000 we have a total expenditure of £2,700,000 more than we shall get out of the Department this year. In other words, leaving loan expenditure out of consideration, the ordinary expenditure for the year is to be £2,241,000 more than is earned by the Department. We are to receive practically no more revenue, whereas the expenditure is being increased by 81/2 per cent. If this kind of thing is to go on, the Department will be waterlogged and bankrupt financially. It really is so at the present moment, and I suggest to the Treasurer that he directs his attention to it. </para>

                            <para>- I say deliberately, after consideration of the whole of the circumstances that there is money to be saved in connexion with the Department. The question must be grappled with. We must not be content to talk; something must be done, and done at once in this Department, which is using up money which ought to go to the ordinary purposes of government. There is another fact in connexion with the Postal Department to which I should like to call attention. According to the Budget papers the salary expenditure of the Department has increased in inverse ratio to its income. In 1910 we paid an average salary of £124 per official, and earned an average revenue of £265 per official. This year we are paying an average salary of £140 and earning an average of £213 per official. Whereas in 1910 an income of £140 was earned in excess of each salary paid, this year the excess will be only £73. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Each official represents a departmental earning power only half as great as that of four years ago. The position may be stated in another way. Whereas in 1902-3 it required a salary expenditure of £51 to earn £100 of revenue, in 1909-10 that amount of revenue was earned with a salary expenditure of £47, and in 1914-15 there must be a salary expenditure of £65 to earn it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire that our officials should be paid badly. I wish them to have the utmost farthing that we can afford to give them; but the position disclosed by the Budget papers shows an utter and absolute want of effective management in the Postal Department. I urge the Treasurer to take the matter in hand and to grapple with the difficulty confronting us. In my judgment he will not achieve anything so long as the present system of control is continued. In this matter he should listen to the voice of the honorable member for Gwydir. We require business men to control the Department independently of Parliament, so that the administration may be in accordance with business methods. Every year the situation becomes worse, and our efforts to remedy it only increase the muddle. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that the Post Office should be put under a Commission, and managed like the railways and other big business Departments of Government. Under the present management the more we pour out money the worse things become financially. This is not a party matter; neither party can stand the present state of things for many years more, because the situation gets worse every year. </para>

                            <para>- Then those senses must be turned upside down. No one on this side, so far as I know, has been opposed to the issue of paper money, which is quite proper so long as that money has an adequate gold backing and is easily convertible. I understand that the Treasurer proposes to issue about £30,000,000 worth of notes altogether. </para>

                            <para>- In my judgment, it will be going very near to the danger limit. The banks have now about £35,000,000 in gold in their coffers. If the Treasurer gets £10,000,000 of that gold, the banks will be left with only £25,000,000. Altogether there is just about enough gold in the banks of Australia and in the Commonwealth Treasury to back this note issue, and make it readily and easily convertible. </para>

                    <para>Reference has been made to the issue of paper money elsewhere in this time of war. For instance,  avo  have heard of the issue of £1 notes and 10s. notes iu England, and it is quite true that such notes have been issued; but they are all convertible, and to-day there is a sovereign for every £1 note that may be presented at the Bank of England. The result is that the Bank of England note is worth its full value in every part of the globe. In these times of dislocation of financial credit and of war emergencies, the Bank of England note retains its full value, because behind it there is the value of the English sovereign. That is a lesson the Prime Minister is, I hope, learning; and, if so, I congratulate him on his prudence with regard to the issue of paper money. The right honorable gentleman, in his speech, made a statement that I desire to put right. He referred 1o an all-parties Conference, at which a unanimous agreement was made to give the States notes on the presentation of 25 per cent, in cash. It is due to myself that I should let the House know that when I placed the final proposition before the Conference, I told those present, candidly, that my judgment did not go with it. </para>

                            <para>- No. I understand it is not. It appears that the Treasurer was to give £10,000,000 in notes for £10,000,000 in gold; and that was a perfectly safe thing for the Treasurer, so far as that step was concerned. But I now ask the Treasurer - Does he propose to utilize this £10,000,000 in sovereigns, which he gets from the banks, for the purpose of paying over the loans to the States at the rate of £1,500,000 a month? I understand that the Prime Minister is lending to the State, for public works purposes, £1,500,000 a month, or £18,000,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>-I am not concerned or interested personally, except as a taxpayer, but does the honorable member for Batman think that the people of this country have no right to know what the Prime Minister is going to do with the £10,000,000 in gold at a time like this? We should not find a financier in any other country of the world just now covering up his transactions in this way. There is no need for this reticence; there is nothing secret about the matter. </para>

Everything depends upon whether the honorable member is going to furnish the States with £18,000,000 worth of notes over and above the £17,000,000 now in circulation, and the £10,000,000 he proposes to give to the banks. That would be dangerous. It is a question of the difference between £30,000,000 and £48,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I am addressing the Chair, and I am asking for information about public accounts ; but I have received nothing but impertinence and insults. The reason I desire this information is to ascertain what the ultimate destination of this gold is likely to be. If it goes to the States, it will go back to the banks at once, and may ultimately find its way to London, and out of Australia altogether. These are operations that we are interested in, and any man who seeks to uphold the credit of his country is entitled to know what the destination of that £10,000,000 worth of gold is. It is a simple question, and ought to be susceptible of an answer which is not a piece of impertinence. </para>

                            <para>- There is bound to be a shrinkage in imports, but to nothing like the extent of the shrinkage in exports during the next year. If our imports are to balance our exports this year, our consumption will require to be £20,000,000 less than it was last year, and I do not think that is at all likely to be the ease. I venture to say that we shall have a strenuous time in purchasing the imports which Australia will require, owing to the decreased value of our exports. All this is operating on the credit and resources of the Commonwealth, and bears, too, on the question of the destination of this £10,000,000 worth of gold, particulars of which I am asking from the right honorable gentleman. I may say that, so far as the honorable member has gone, I have no objection whatever to his method of financing if he will stop where he is with his paper money ; but he ought to tell us the whole of his proposals, and where he expects to ultimately find himself with regard to the credit and resources of Australia. This question of paper money has a very important relation to us in our present circumstances. While the Bank of England notes remain at par, the Bank of Germany notes have gone all to pieces. We are told that Germany made very elaborate and deliberate preparations for this war, but, notwithstanding all her foresight, her credit has been shattered, despite the war loans she raised so easily within her own borders. </para>

                    <para>These are some of the precautions Germany took in connexion with this war. She issued £15,000,000 worth of extra silver token money; during the first two months of the war Reichsbank notes to the value of £130,000,000 were issued, specie payment was suspended, and the notes were made inconvertible. Yet, early in October, only two months after the commencement of the war, in Holland and Switzerland, two contiguous and friendly countries, that note issue had' depreciated 35 per cent. </para>

They are inconvertible: but their depreciation was checked, as far as internal transactions were concerned, by fixing maximum prices. </para>

A moratorium has thus been rendered unnecessary. The whole position, therefore, has been placed upon an artificial paper basis, dependent upon the credit of the Government. That our less drastic methods will prove much better in the long run we cannot doubt.

                            <para>- Yes, but to preserve the maximum value of the notes the Government also fixed the maximum prices of goods which the notes could buy. Despite all that, in Holland and Switzerland, the notes have already depreciated to the extent of 35 per cent. That is a lesson to the right honorable member for Wide Bav and his friends over there. </para>

I regret the manner in which the right honorable gentleman brought forward his interrogations with regard to the note issue, and the manner in which he referred to the Conferences, which I understood were quite secret, to emphasize his own position. It is necessary for me now to emphasize the position of myself and my colleagues. From the time that war was declared I stated publicly- </para>

I did so, even to the extent of effusiveness, as the honorable member for Flinders, who was then the Attorney-General, described it in a remark attributed to him in the press, whether he uttered it or not. The right honorable gentleman knows that after I had expressed my views at the Conference, whatever the policy of the Government was, I supported it. I could not have done more. </para>

Therefore, we conferred with the representatives of the Associated Banks, and came to a certain agreement whereby the banks will advance to the Commonwealth gold to the value of £10,000,000, which has to be repaid to the banks by the Commonwealth at the end of the war. </para>

                            <para>- The agreement was contingent upon the Australian money market and credit being relieved at the other end of the world by raising sufficient credit there - whether it was in gold or in old boots does not make the slightest difference - to enable the credit here to be absolutely secure, and to prevent any difficulty to a financial institution, or to the States, or to the Commonwealth. . To find that credit at a reasonable rate of interest was a difficult process, but 'it was found, and, without demur, the banks agreed to advance £10,000,000 to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The banks have no apprehension at all regarding the acceptance of notes in respect of the gold deposit, nor in regard to a considerable extension of the note issue in addition, which, in our opinion and their opinion, can be well secured, and will enable the States to be financed to the extent we have indicated, namely, £18,000,000, at the same time enabling the Commonwealth to be financed during this financial year. There is no reasonable doubt on that point. There is a substantial advantage in the fact that the advance will be in gold, because the statutory provision for a gold reserve against any note issue will thus be provided. </para>

                            <para>- I have said that it is to be during the term of the war. I should like to have a conference with the leading members of the Opposition before entering upon another point with which I have been challenged to deal. All that I can say is that the financial position of the Commonwealth is infinitely stronger to-day than it was a little time ago, and that the people have reason to congratulate themselves upon that fact. The States have provided for their loan expenditure for twelve calendar months from the present month to the extent of £18,000,000, not including Queensland's expenditure, a larger loan expenditure than has been incurred in any other year in the Commonwealth ; and this money has been provided by the Commonwealth at a lower rate of interest than the States have been able to borrow at during the last eighteen months. I am not in the position to say what will be the exact rate of interest, but it is almost certain to be less than £4 5s. per cent. </para>

                            <para>- At the second Conference with the State Premiers, which took place after we came into power, an agreement was drawn up under which the Commonwealth undertook to advance to the States for public works purposes during the next twelve months a sum of £18,000,000. I was asked, just before we adjourned for dinner, what rate of interest was to be charged. I can only say that the agreement provides for a minimum of 4 per cent., or such higher rate as the Commonwealth Government may be required to pay for an equivalent amount, but for all practical purposes the States, in my opinion, will obtain this loan for about £4 5s. per cent. Under the arrangement made with the Associated Banks the Commonwealth undertook to carry out part of the agreement originally suggested and approved at the first Conference, to the effect that we should assist the banks, as well as provide loans for the States. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. As I remarked on a previous occasion I do not think it would be advisable to publish the names of the banks to whom this assistance is granted. In every instance we ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank for a report, and in each case his report has been favorable, with the result that the application has been granted. These are special times, and I think we should deal with them in a special way. I claim no financial ability beyond the capacity to deal with this matter from a commonsense stand-point, but from my knowledge of the position I feel justified in saying that there is no indication of any substantial failure of credit, either on the part of the banks or of any of the institutions of Australia. The depression through which we are passing is merely temporary. It arises from the development of a great war, drought, and from what may be described as an excusable apprehension in the minds of a great many people. But that the credit of the Commonwealth is sound no one who has taken the trouble to examine the actual facts can doubt for one moment. I repeat what I have said before in this House, that our financial position to-day is stronger and our credit more flexible than it was at the commencement of the war. I do not think it advisable to discuss the intricacies of the loan transaction any more than to say that part of the £18,000,000, which we advance to the States, will, of necessity, include some proportion of the £10,000,000 to which I have already referred. But to say that that £10,000,000 will be part of the loan of £18,000,000 would not be correct; it certainly would not convey a proper impression. The advance may be made partly in notes and partly in gold. I come now to a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition regarding a statement published by the representative of a large organization in Victoria that our note issue was going up to £45,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I have not read the article, but a gentleman, whose word I can take, has assured me that the statement was made. I ask honorable members not to accept it. Eminent as the writer may be in other fields, I think this statement on his part may be discounted very considerably. Evidently he arrived at his statement by totalling up two items of £18,000,000, plus the existing note issue. As a matter of fact, there is only one item of £18,000,000, so that his statement is £18,000,000 out. So far as we can see there need be no apprehension at all on the part of the banks, the States, or the Commonwealth, for at least the next seven or eight months. Parliament will then be in session, and should any new situation arise it can then be dealt with. I do not think that honorable members can be too often reminded of the fact that the States themselves, in the matter of loan money, are in a stronger and better position to-day than they have ever been since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. Their position is secured for practically the whole of 1915. They can see ahead of them for the next twelve months, so far as the loan of £18,000,000, plus what Queensland may be able to raise, is concerned. The material part of the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition was a criticism of our expenditure at the present time, but I did not hear the right honorable gentleman make a single suggestion as to how that expenditure might be reduced, nor state in what respect any portion of it was unwarranted. It is true that he pointed out that certain salaries were high, but were not being attacked. I have already told honorable members, in answer to a question, that it is a difficult matter to deal with Commonwealth salaries and emoluments. </para>

                            <para>- But the right honorable gentleman stated that these salaries remained untouched. Why is it? It has been the custom, as the right honorable member for Swan knows, for the Government of the day to deal only with the increments and so forth of the administrative heads" of departments. This Government felt that none of the administrative heads could be recommended for increases at the present time. The  President  of the Senate and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> occupy the position of the Public Service Commissioner in the matter of the salaries of the officers of Parliament, and the Public Service Commissioner ever since his appointment has been in the habit of obtaining the Estimates from the Treasurer and adding to them the increments, &amp;c, due. The Estimates have then gone directly to the Government Printer. </para>

                            <para>- Treasurers have not done so, but I am not in agreement with that rule. Parliament is the proper place in which to discuss such matters, but it is not for me during a crisis such as that through which we are passing to inaugurate an entirely new practice without making the facts known to Parliament. I do not admit for one moment that the Treasurer has not power to deal with the Estimates as he thinks fit, and notwithstanding what any official may wish. But if he were to exercise the power which, as representing the Executive authority of the Commonwealth, he undoubtedly possesses, and if he were to discriminate, then the authority of the Public Service Commissioner in this respect would be at an end. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. Nothing can take away from the Executive the power to deal with the expenditure of the country in any way it thinks necessary from time to time, and more particularly in connexion with the annual Estimates. I need not deal further with the matter. I understand that the Opposition do not intend to give us the Estimates before we adjourn for the holidays - that they want the Estimates to stand over until we come back. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. There is nothing in the Supply Bill touching new payments. It will be based on last year's expenditure. But I remind honorable members that in times like this the Treasurer's Advance for a period of four or five months must be a considerable sum. That is made necessary by our constitutional limitations. In my opinion, it would be better, at this particular time, to intrust the Treasurer with too much than with too little. We may err in asking too much, but we shall not use the whole sum asked for unless its expenditure is necessitated by some emergency. Regarding the Post Office, its administration has been a matter of anxiety to me for many years, and, no doubt, has made every other Commonwealth Treasurer anxious. </para>

Notwithstanding, the Post Office is to-day in a better position than it has occupied before under Commonwealth administration. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is probably correct ; but it is no reflection on this Government that when we had money to spare we spent it on capital construction to help to make good the deficiencies and defects of the departmental equipment. The time is coming when money will not be available from revenue for that purpose, but the Department has been strengthened by the expenditure already made from revenue. It is only fair to say that the Department, in its balance-sheet of profit and loss, debits itself with interest on all expenditure in excess of its earnings. </para>

                            <para>- If properly maintained. The railways have to be kept in a state of efficiency, and they appreciate with the development of the country; it is different with Post Office works. The desire in the administration of the Post Office is ever to give cheaper and better, and more facilities. When a new Postmaster-General institutes a reform which means a loss of revenue, he is cheered as a good man; but, following his reform comes the criticism of postal expenditure and revenue. I am in favour of making the Post Office a business concern. It must be a business concern with us, though it was not with the States. Were, we in the position of the States, I would not ask that the Post Office be made a business concern, that is, a profit and loss concern. If we had control of the land, it would be the duty of the National Government to provide the cheapest communication by telephone, telegraph, and post-office over the immense area of the Commonwealth, and we should get our reward in other ways besides, the direct earnings of our services. At the present time it is in the big centres of population that the losses are being incurred. That is worse than an anomaly; it is an injustice. We intend to do something to remedy this state of things, and to put the Post Office on a business footing. Having said so much about the Postal Department, I wish to add that, in my opinion, the Commonwealth has a great organized Public Service of which it should be proud. I think that it is a well managed Service, and has been well cared for by this Parliament. I am not accustomed to give praise, but I must give my word of praise for the devotion and patriotism of a great many public officers with whom I have come into contact since the war began. I have never known more loyal and faithful service than that which has been given by them without thanks, and without remuneration of any kind. We have no reason, as a Commonwealth, to be anything but proud of the character and efficiency of our Public Service. We cannot, before the Christmas vacation, deal with any of the larger financial obligations, but I ask members to accept my assurance that all the parties concerned are satisfied as to the strength, stability, and security of the Commonwealth, and believe in its ability to maintain its position unimpaired during the present struggle, and to assist the States, the banks, and all who may need help. I think that the Leader of the Opposition does not desire further information about the note issue than he has already had. As I do not wish to trespass on the time of the Committee, I shall only add that I shall be glad to answer any question of importance that may be addressed to me during the debate. </para>

                        <para>. - Some rather heated words passed across the table before the dinner adjournment, it being evident to me now that the Prime Minister was, at the time, confused as to the point that I was trying to make, he having one thing in his mind, and I another. I assure him that I have not seen the report to which he referred, the knowledge of which, no doubt, coloured his remarks across the table. The point I was trying to make was that he had already arranged to issue notes to the value of £27,000,000, and that the note issue would, in all probability, reach £30,000,000, the understanding being that the £10,000,000 worth of notes which were to be issued to the banks were to remain in their coffers, and not to go into circulation. </para>

                    <para>As to a Supply Bill, if the Treasurer has not money to meet the usual mid-monthly payments, he must get it, and whilst asking for it, he had better ask for sufficient to cover the period during which Parliament will be in recess. But it must be remembered that the Estimates are those of this Government, for which Ministers must take responsibility; we, having explained our position in relation to them, can do no more. By passing the Supply Bill we shall probably agree to £10,000,000 of the year's vote before the Estimates are considered, and, therefore, we shall not be able to re-open matters later by making reductions. However, that is the responsibility of the Prime Minister, and those behind him ; we have done our part. I see no objection to the passing of a Supply Bill to-night. </para>

                        <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition has dealt with many points of the Budget; I propose to discuss but a few of the matters contained therein. There is not much time at our disposal, and no advantage is to be gained by reiterating statements that have already been made! Before I go further, I may say that the difficulties of the Government owing to the war and the drought would have been  much  greater if they had not been fortunate enough to possess themselves of. practically, £28,000,000 in gold- £18,000,000 under loan for fourteen years from the Imperial Government, and £10,000,000 under loan from the banks for, at any rate, a year. Their position would have been much worse if they had not been fortunate enough. - and I use the word deliberately - to obtain possession without difficulty, as was stated by the Treasurer, of this immense sum of money. Had there been a normally good season, the position would have been far better than it is; and I am sure we all like to see the Commonwealth in as strong a position as possible. We can only live in hope that the terribly bad season we are experiencing will soon pass away, and that our war and other difficulties will soon be overcome; and meanwhile we must all "be strong and of a good courage." There are only two or three matters to which I desire to refer to-night; and, first, I should like to deal with the means of financing the country on ordinary account during the current year. It is not my intention to deal with the financing of the war, because that is provided for under an arrangement with the Imperial Government to lend us the money for a term of fourteen years, so that, until the time arrives for the repayment of the loan, all we have to do is to pay the annual interest. I shall, however, devote a little time to the means that have been taken by the Treasurer to finance the Commonwealth during the year, and I shall also say something about the effect of the new </para>

                    <para class="block">Tariff proposals, and the inopportune time chosen for imposing extra taxation on our half -ruined, drought-stricken producers. In introducing the Budget, the Prime Minister could not help referring, for, I should say, the hundredth time, to the chance surplus of £2,643,305 which he left when his Government were defeated eighteen months ago. I refer to this because the Prime Minister and his supporters, not content with misrepresentation, in order to gain a political point, made a great deal of the fact, when they were before the country, that there was this amount to their credit when they left office, and endeavoured to disparage the efforts of their successors to economize and in doing their best not to spend the whole of this surplus. They forgot to tell the country that we could very easily have spent the whole of the surplus during the year 1913-14, but that we did not do so. On the contrary, at the end. of the year we left a sum of £1,222,401, which, ' I have no doubt, the Treasurer has found very useful in the terrible circumstances that have arisen. </para>

                            <para>- I mention this in order to emphasize my view that it is time that we showed a little generosity to one another. The Treasurer knows very well that when he began the year 1912-13 he did not expect to have any surplus at the end. He brought down Estimates which absorbed the whole, but, owing to the fact that he received more revenue than he looked for, and spent less than ho anticipated, he was able to leave the large balance I have mentioned. This, it seems to me, is what, may have happened to anybody who is careful in the management of affairs; sometimes there is more, and sometimes there is less than is expected. I think the right honorable gentleman has been very fortunate indeed, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, because on a previous occasion he came into office just when the operation of the Braddon section ceased, giving him, during his three years, a sum of £14,000,000 that he would not otherwise have obtained. Of course, I am very glad that he was so placed; but, when we know the reason of the greatly increased revenue, it is not well on the part of those who benefit to boast of the circumstances, and to  endea- your  to disparage those who preceded them and had not the same advantage. </para>

                    <para>There is a serious matter which was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, namely, the simultaneous exercise of the power of taxation by the States and by the Commonwealth. This, it seems to me, is becoming a danger to the community. For a long time double taxation was never suggested; and it was held, times out of number, by our most eminent men that land and other taxation would never be part of the Commonwealth taxation policy, but would remain the business of the State, and that unless under dire necessity or of great calamity, when such a step was absolutely necessary to keep the country afloat, there would be no invasion by the Commonwealth of the avenues of taxation hitherto entirely within the control of the States. This was the idea acted upon continuously for many years in this Parliament; but it has now been departed from by the Labour Government. At present, the same piece of land is- taxed by three powers - the municipalities or shire councils, the State Governments, and the Commonwealth - and this, in my view, is a dangerous position. It is now proposed that the Commonwealth shall impose probate and succession duties; and it would appear that before long every source of taxation reserved for the States will be exploited by the Commonwealth. Personally, I do not see how this can be permitted, if it is desired, in the first place, to maintain the individual ownership of property. I am quite certain this dual taxation was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, nor do I regard it as justifiable or reasonable. If it is persisted in, it means the destruction of the States altogether; it means spoliation and confiscation and the abrogation of the Federal principle of the Constitution. Of course, if it is desired to destroy the Federal principle, and to repudiate the bargain entered into by the States when they handed over certain powers to the Commonwealth, that is another matter. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that my honorable friend realizes sufficiently that the people, as a whole, do not have the opportunity of altering the agreement. Absolutely, two States in the Commonwealth may, under the Constitution, be coerced, and have their powers taken from them. That, no doubt, could be done under the Constitution; but, at the same time, I do not think it is either fair or justifiable. </para>

I do not approve of the methods he has adopted, nor do I think them necessary in existing circumstances. Leaving out of consideration the war expenditure of £11,742,000, which is to be provided by loan from the British Government, it is proposed to expend during the financial year, from revenue, £2,680,338 more than was expended last year. In my opinion that is neither justifiable nor necessary. </para>

                            <para>- That is for the Government to say. It is not justifiable, and it is not necessary to spend more this year from revenue than we considered it necessary to spend last year. While the revenue is decreasing the expenditure is  increasing. Surely that is not prudence. We would not adopt that policy with our own private affairs, and we all know that the affairs of a country are not very dissimilar from a man's private affairs. In both cases we must make both ends meet ; we must not go to leeward. I say emphatically that there is nothing in the position of the country at the present time which justifies us in spending more money out of revenue this year than wc spent last year. The increase of expenditure is made up of : Ordinary services, £1,540,299 ; works and buildings, £1,004,288; and increased contributions to the States, £135,751; totalling, as I have already stated, £2,680,338. While the present Government are piling .up the expenditure chargeable to revenue, and, as a consequence, imposing ruinous and unnecessary taxation, they are not increasing to any material extent the expenditure from loan funds in the construction of public works. Last year the expenditure from loan on public works was £2,154,564 ; whereas the proposed expenditure from loan this year is £2,162,580, while the expenditure from revenue is being increased by £2,6S0,338, as I have previously mentioned. It seems a strange sort of business that, in a difficult and disastrous year like this, you should pile up your expenditure from revenue, and relieve the expenditure from loan. Expenditure from loan only means that you pay the interest and charge it to revenue, whilst expenditure from revenue means that ordinary income has to bear the whole capital cost. In order to carry out this expenditure from revenue and make the accounts balance, the Government have found it necessary, to provide by increased taxation and borrowing £3,436,319. The additional land taxation is estimated at £1,240,000 a year, but it is expected to realize this year only £1,090,055 more than the receipts of last year. An additional million is to be obtained from probate and succession duties. Yet, in spite of that extra taxation, there is to be a deficit of £1,346,264. I would have made ends meet somehow. I would not have finished up with a deficit, as the honorable member proposes to do. </para>

                            <para>- I will. I am not here to find fault without suggesting an alternative. Surely this is a fine piece of financing, to impose additional burdens on people who are already weighted down, and to then finish the year with a deficit of £1,346,264, which the Government propose to borrow, in aid of revenue, by charging Treasury-bills to the Note Account. The present Budget differs from : the ordinary Budget only iu respect of the effects of war and drought on trade and production, and the consequent falling off of revenue, especially from Customs and Excise. If we omit the estimated receipts from the proposed extra taxation, namely, £2,090,055, the estimated revenue for this year is £21,182,945. Adding to that the amount standing to credit at 30th June last, £1,222,401, the total amount available for the services of the year is £22,405,346. The estimated expenditure, excluding the war expenditure of £11,742,050 odd, is £25,841,665, and, as there is only £22,405,346 available, it follows that £3,436,319 has to be obtained in order to make revenue balance expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- I will tell the honorable member. There is provision on these Estimates for an expenditure from revenue on public works of an amount of £4,403,870, and if I had had the arranging of this Budget, instead of imposing ruinous taxation and finishing up the year with a deficit of £1,346,264, I should have considered it far easier, better and fairer in this year of war and drought, to have charged to revenue only £867,551 for public works, and paid the balance of £3,436,319 out of loan funds. </para>

                            <para>- By that policy there would have been no deficit, and the charge on loan would have been a perfectly justifiable one, especially in a year like this, when the very first duty of the Government is to place as few burdens as possible  on the people. At this period that course would have been the easiest and the best. The money could be obtained from the note issue, and would not have cost the Commonwealth anything at all, in the same way as the many millions which have been spent on the trans-Australian railway have not cost the Commonwealth a farthing. We might charge up the interest, and carry it to account, but there would be no actual charge on the people. I am absolutely surprised at the course which has been followed, more especially as the Treasurer has already arrived at the conclusion, which I have voiced in this House so often, that " it will be necessary in the future that more of the expenditure for permanent public works shall be defrayed by means of loan." </para>

                    <para class="block">These works are of a permanent character, and are of a kind that are defrayed from Joan by every State Government in Australia at the present time, and it would have been easy for the Treasurer to have borrowed the necessary money by means of the note issue, which would have been no burden at all, instead of placing extra and ruinous burdens on the producers of the country. </para>
                    <para>I have now to say something which I do not care about saying, but the facts must be stated, because I feel that this is not a time when one should allow to pass without protest things of which he disapproves. Is this time of drought and war opportune for the placing of extra burdens on the people ? I am informed that, with the exception of Queensland and the north-eastern portion of New South Wales, the present drought is the worst in the history of Australia. The official rainfall figures show that the present year has been the driest on record in Western Australia, South Australia, the Riverina, Tasmania, and Victoria. In Victoria the season has resulted in the almost total failure of the wheat crop, and it has been very disastrous to the wheat crop in South Australia and Western Australia. The loss of stock has been enormous, and I am informed that, unless a break-up of the drought occurs in a month or two, the loss of sheep will be probably from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- Deducting the £974 from the total value of imports in 1913- £1,449,878- we see that it is proposed to place a duty of 10 per cent. on the balance of £1,448,904, which will mean that the producers from the soil must pay on cornsacks and woolpacks, which principally come from India, a tax of £144,890, based on the importations during 1913. The value of the imports of chaffcutters for 1913 was £124,164. Deducting the imports from the United Kingdom - £25,431 - we have a balance of £98,733, and as it is proposed to levy a duty of 5 per cent. upon chaffcutters, the producers from the soil will contribute an additional Customs taxation of £4,936 on this item. </para>

                            <para>- But while the grass is growing the horse is starving. Perhaps the honorable member will presently give us some of his enlightened ideas. The value of the imports of other agricultural machinery iu 1913 was £175,486. Deducting the imports from the United Kingdom - about £34,000 - we have a value of £141,486 from countries other than the United Kingdom, which, with the increased duty of 10 per cent., will mean another £14,148 that the producer will be called upon to pay. Taking these items, cornsacks and woolpacks, £144,890; chaffcutters, £4,936; harvesters, £2,508: mowers. &amp;c, £7,297; and other agricultural machinery, £14,148; we have a total of £173,779 increased Customs burden upon the producers from the soil. This sum, with the additional land tax, £1,240,000, makes an additional charge of £1,413,779. What justification can there be for imposing this burden on the 14,000 land-owners who are suffering from a terrible drought and great loss ot stock and income ? I urge that our drought-stricken producers have had a sufficient burden in providing, in the first instance, for the whole of the cost of the Australian Fleet, of which we are all so proud, and which has stood, and is still standing, us in good stead. This year £1,610,000 was paid by them as a Federal land tax. I should like to know what these land-owners have done that they should be singled out for destruction. The present proposal is to increase the land tax by £1,240,000, in addition to their paying increased land taxes in the respective States. </para>

                            <para>- I know, because the honorable member has just said that he was born in Australia; but if he will interject, and say ungenerous things that are not nice, he must expect retorts. However, I apologize to the honorable member. I cannot see what the landowners have done that they should be singled out for destruction at this time of difficulty and partial ruin. Coming to that portion of the Tariff dealing with our farmers and graziers as producers from the soil, what justification can there be in a year of difficulty and drought for imposing additional taxation to the extent of £144,890 on cornsacks and woolpacks, and make a show of giving preference to the Mother Country of £97, while charging the producers £144,8901 </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so; and if I am given a little time, I shall explain my position. The primary producer has to compete in the world's markets, and requires all the assistance we can give him by the removal of duties and burdens to enable him to do so. He has to compete with the cheap coloured labour of the world, and the price he receives for his products is often based on similar products in countries with the lowest wages, and with lower standards of civilization and conditions of living. Yet it is proposed to further tax him and make his burden greater. I wish to point out that my profession of a desire to help and do all I can for the producer from the soil does not mean that I am not most anxious at the same time to help the manufacturer of agricultural machinery, which is so valuable to the tiller of the soil. I am most anxious that the manufacturer should' be protected ; but, at the same time, the primary wealth-producer from the soil should not be called upon to bear the whole of the burden of protecting the manufacturer as he has done in the past. I maintain that some means should be devised to save the primary producer from this unreasonable and unfair position. </para>

                            <para>- Surely there is, in the brain of the honorable member, some fertility that will enable him to find a way of doing it other than placing the whole of the burden on the wealth producer from the soil so as to make it impossible for him to compete in the world's market, where he is opposed by all sorts of coloured and cheap labour. Is there no other way of protecting the manufacturer ? If there is not, the fertility of the brain of the honorable member for Maribyrnong is not what I thought it was. Could anything be more suicidal and unwise than that, at a time like the present - whilst we are in the throes of a ruinous drought - the producers from the soil should have additional burdens placed upon them to the extent of £1,413,779 a year? </para>

                            <para>- It was not possible to do anything. We had very little time, and we had practically no majority. Given such a majority as the present Government have, we should not commence our Tariff proposals by placing additional burdens on a section of the community which is already more heavily weighted than it ought to be. Instead of placing only on the producer from the soil the burden of protecting the manufacturer, we should distribute it over a larger number of the people. From the interjections of honorable members opposite, it is clear to me that the Prime Minister and his party have no concern whatever for the producers from the soil of the Commonwealth. The extra burdens which they are placing on people who are now practically ruined, because of the terrible drought, show that the Government have absolutely no sympathy with our primary producers. I do not intend to say more on the Budget. There are others on this side of the House who will deal with different phases of the question, and I certainly do not desire to cover any ground that has already been traversed. There are many points with which I should like to deal; but I shall not attempt to do so at the present time. </para>

The right honorable gentleman has given the Government a certificate for capacity and efficiency of which we ought to feel proud. He has told us, although he did not say so in so many words, that the Government are to be commended for the manner in which they have organized the finances of the Commonwealth. He has told us that we might have done more by using the bank note issue in connexion with the loans to the States. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman admitted that the Labour party, when they were in office on a previous occasion, accumulated a substantial surplus, which was inherited by the late Government, and he seemed to claim it as a virtue for his party that, during the twelve months they were in office, they expended only one-half of that accumulated surplus. One sometimes almost regrets that they were not returned at the late election, in order that we might have seen what they would do; but, whatever our curiosity may be in that respect, the people are to be congratulated on the fact that they are to have no such experience. The right honorable member for Swan has talked a good deal about the primary producer, and of those who are going to be affected by our revised land tax proposals. I admit that, to some extent, the rise in the maximum of the land tax will be an additional impost upon a large number of land-owners; but the class to which it will apply cannot be described as small land-owners. This tax will not affect the men who the right honorable member said were being ruined - the men owning land of the unimproved value of £5,000 or less, nor will it strike very heavily the smaller leaseholders. I think the Government are treading on somewhat dangerous ground in extending the land tax to the leaseholders of the States, but I do not propose to discuss that phase of the question to-night. I hold certain views upon it, and sooner or later we shall have an opportunity to deal with the whole question. I should like, however, to emphasize the point that the Federal land tax will not fall on the small man at all. No leaseholder will come within its scope unless his holding is worth £15,000 or more. And these are the men over whom the right honorable member for Swan has been shedding crocodile tears ! If there is one section of the community who, in all equity, should be called upon to meet the exigencies of the present position, it is those who have had the good fortune to secure the best lands in the country at very low rentals and in very large areas. Those who have more than a living area - those who hold either the leasehold or the freehold of more than a living area, and who are thus able to make large profits and build up fortunes for themselves - are the people who, according to the Opposition, have a stake in the country; and we are asking them to bear their proportion of the cost of governing and protecting the country. No one can justly cavil, on economic grounds, at the methods which the Government are adopting to meet the exigencies of the present time. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I fully admit that the present drought, in some parts of Australia, is perhaps as disastrous as was that of 1902, but it is by no means as widespread or as injurious in its effects as was the drought of twelve years ago. We in Australia often speak of droughts as if they were some malign visitation of Providence. We are inclined to rave at Providence for their occurrence ; but those who have studied nations and countries know that, just as in Great Britain, Canada, and elsewhere, it is necessary for the snow to fall and to lie upon the land to sweeten it, so it is held that in Australia the drought is Nature's way of resting the country, which otherwise would never be rested by some men, who tear the very vitals out of the earth and return nothing to it. We sometimes fly in the face of Providence. We do not look for the reasons why the droughts come. </para>

                            <para>- That is not very often. Only since his election to the Federal Parliament has the honorable member come to learn the value of silence. I watch him carefully, because he has the reputation of offering a fine example to those who are looking for guidance in the political world. I rose more particularly to refer to the Postal service. At the commencement of the session I gave notice of motion relating to it, but, owing to private members' business not being taken, I was unable to reach it to-day. I shall, as is my custom, give notice of it again as soon as possible after we return, and shall endeavour to impress the House with the necessity of making something more than a mere pretence to carry out the reforms that are much needed in that great institution. The Prime Minister stated tonight that the Post Office is now in a better position than  ever  before under Commonwealth control. So it ought to be. For much energy has been spent in trying to reform both its finances and its administration. Certainly, you can improve it by spending money, because almost anything can be made passable if you spend enough money upon it; but no permanent improvement will be made in the affairs of the Post Office while they continue to be directed by a man who receives only £1,000 a year. This great institution spends £5,000,000 a year out of revenue alone, and in no private business having a turnover of £1,000,000 would you obtain the services of a manager for £1,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- I would get the best men available, no matter where they might be found. For an institution like the Post Office, we must obtain the best men and the best material, in the interests of the people of the country. 1 shall not refer to the Postal administration under the State <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> because that is not necessary, and it is altogether too confused a matter to speak of now. Out of the conglomeration of State systems arose the Commonwealth system which has caused so much trouble. During the first eight years of Federation, the Postmaster-General, the Treasurer, the Ministry, and the Parliament, had no information to guide them in controlling the Post Office. There was no such thing as an audited balance-sheet. No board of directors controlling any private business affair would allow the manager to continue year after year without presenting a balance-sheet and a statement showing what services were paying and what were not paying. Yet, until last year, we had not a balance-sheet covering the operations of the Post Office. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane's</inline> second report has not yet come to hand. He is the accountant who, for the first time in the history of the Department, has made an attempt to establish a system which will show the true financial position. During the first eight years of Federation, we lost £2,300,000 on the Post Office. That amount had to be written off when the Postal Commission's report was presented to this Parliament. Since that time, we have been steadily going back, although our expenditure has increased. This expenditure has alleviated the trouble, but it has not cured the disease, and cannot do so. The first and only report on the finances of the Commonwealth which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane</inline> is a highly creditable production, though I have not time to deal with it to-night. It proved that what the Postal Commission recommended could be done, that is, that separate accounts should be presented showing the revenue and expenditure of the Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone Branches. While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane's</inline> report is not complete, iE has gone a long way to solve the difficulties of those responsible for the proper conduct of the Department. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has a <inline font-style="italic">penchant</inline> for remarks of that character; it seems to be almost a disease with him. But it is not seemly to act frivolously when serious questions are being discussed. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane's</inline> next report will be as instructive as his first one was. In spite of his recommendations, we find, from a report of the Auditor-General, that the stores management of the Department is still far from satisfactory ; that there are leakages and inefficient control. That shows the difficulty of controlling the Department from Melbourne under the authority of one man. No one man could control so big a Department, the operations of which spread over a vast continent. </para>

Not only do they convenience the domestic life of the country, but they are also a source of profit to those who make use of them. No service gives so great a return at such a low rate as the telephone branch gives. Yet in one of the States an expenditure of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 14s. was required to obtain <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> of revenue from the telephone service, and <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 7s. 6d. waa expended to obtain £1 of revenue from the telegraph service. The difference between the revenue and expenditure has to be made good out of the pockets of those who have not benefited either directly or indirectly from the service. </para>

                            <para>- The figures that I have used apply to one State only, but the loss on the two services in all the States ranges from 5s. to 14s. for every <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> of revenue. This has come about because of a mistaken idea of patriotism, and a mistaken idea of emphasizing Federation. One object was to make all telegrams one price throughout Australia, although there is no other country in the world that would entertain such an unbusinesslike proposition. We have immense distances to cover, necessitating repeating stations and the employment of a large staff, and yet Parliament decided that the charge for a telegram from the furthest west to the furthest east should be no higher than that of a telegram sent across the border from one State into another. </para>

                            <para>- It is not for every one to go out-back, and I venture to say that the honorable member would not, if he had to " hump his bluey." We must always remember that a man who owns land in the back-blocks has got his land at a proportionately cheaper rate, and that he and his family have advantages which are not enjoyed by many who have to pursue unhealthy trades, and live in unhealthy surroundings, in our metropolitan areas. It will probably surprise some to hear that 1 represent a purely pastoral and farming electorate, but I am not always crying out about " the man on the land." The honorable member for New England thought he could easily dispose of me at the last election in such a constituency, but his opposition was about the best recommendation I could have to the people I have served so long. </para>

Be that as it may, the Postmaster-General, in my opinion, is doing the right thing in proposing to raise the rates within a State. Something, however, will have to be done to make the whole service pay better. The further we go afield, the more expensive our system becomes, and the larger the deficiency. It is of no use being patriotic with other people's money; we have to do our best for the whole of the people and not only for a section. Any man who fails to recognise that duty does not comprehend the responsibility of a member of the National Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I grant that, and if I had had my way it would not have been introduced under present conditions. In this connexion Victoria proved the stumbling block in anticipating Federation with penny postage; and this put the Commonwealth in an anomalous position, involving the necessity of raising the rate in Victoria or making it uniform at a penny. </para>

                            <para>- The electors do not believe everything we tell them, even if we tell the truth. I do not propose to discuss the general working of the Department, its relations with the Public Service Commissioner, and so forth, as I might have clone on another occasion, with some hope of tangible result, but have merely desired to mention a few matters that may help the Postmaster-General to mould his policy in a manner that will be of benefit to the Commonwealth and a credit to himself. This is not an appropriate time to deal with the question of the general reform and re-organization of the service on thoroughly practical business lines. On a future occasion I shall endeavour to show that what is absolutely necessary is a board of management consisting of a man of financial and organizing ability, a second member to take charge of telephone, telegraph, and wireless communication, and a third to take charge of the postal matters. With such a combination as this we ought to be able to prevent the recurring deficit, and do justice to the people of this country. </para>

                        <para>- We could do with Supply for four and a half months; but I assume -that honorable members do not wish to split a month in two. The Supply Bill does not in any way touch the increments provided on the ordinary Estimates. The payments will be made on the basis of last year's Estimates, except as regards those  officers drawing up to £210 a year. It is the rule, unless exception be taken, to pay officers of the fifth class their increments in advance of the passing of the Estimates. Increments for any officers drawing salaries above £210 are deferred until Parliament has approved . of the Estimates. This Bill, like the previous Supply Bills, has a clause to cover any failure to do the right thing prior to our coming into office. I think such a covering clause ought to he in all Supply Bills, until we get the annual appropriation. It makes sure that if there was any defect iii expenditure in the transition from one financial year to another, such defect is rectified and placed on a legal footing. In other words, if there has been a surplusage, it is a good surplusage. I shall be glad to give honorable members any information, and I shall be grateful for the cooperation of the Opposition in getting the Bill through. </para>

                    <para>. - Somehow I cannot make myself understood by my right honorable friend. I should like to whisper in his ear that I had not in mind a question of Supply for four months, or four aud a half months. I know that four aud a half months' Supply would be utterly and absolutely absurd; but may I suggest to the honorable member that to  extend  the  recess for another fortnight in April would not be absurd at all? </para>

                        <para>- I am not bringing anything. I tell honorable members that had the Liberal Government been returned to power, there would have been no session of eight or nine months, perhaps not of six months. The sessions of this Parliament ought to be less than they are. We should do our work quite as effectively, and the country would be governed just as efficiently, if we sat for a less time. After all, the great functions of this National Parliament under our Constitution are largely administrative, and administration goes on just as well when Parliament is not sitting as when it is in session - perhaps it goes on a little better. I say quite frankly that I look forward in no spirit of elation to the prospect of sitting for nine months next year, because when we resume our work we shall sit on inevitably till Christmas time. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member for Moreton represented a metropolitan constituency which is accessible at week ends he would find that his constituents practically demanded his presence every week, and if he were not prepared to attend to his duties in the way they expect they would soon elect somebody else. At this time of widespread distress and unemployment it is more than ever necessary that a member should be accessible to his constituents. Travelling practically 1,000 miles every week is a great tax on members, and I feel it keenly; no doubt older men feel it more than I do. Nevertheless, a change has come over the scene. I had not anticipated that the Tariff would be introduced before Christmas. </para>

                        <para>- I can honestly say that I did not. It was never mentioned to members of the party. So far as my influence might go in this matter I shall be no party to anything more than a temporary adjournment over the holidays, because a new Tariff dislocates commercial and industrial enterprises far and wide, and this in turn disturbs the great masses engaged in these pursuits. There is quite enough dislocation and uncertainty while the necessary discussions on a Tariff are taking place in Parliament, but when there is added three or four months of recess, during which the matter cannot be discussed at all, when the captains of industry do not know whether to go forward or backward, and business people are probably suffering losses of thousands of pounds, such delay is an absolute injustice. </para>

There ought to be an opportunity for correcting that mistake, instead of the matter being held in abeyance for months. </para>

The question is not what profits are made by the picture-show proprietors, but whether this arbitrary act on the part of the Government, as it really is until Parliament decides whether the duty is to be kept on, inflicts an injustice on the industry. If it does, there should be an opportunity of correcting it. The Minister has assured me that, in this case, he proposes to endeavour to correct- </para>

                        <para>- There are many serious aspects unavoidably associated with a re-adjustment of the Tariff. The Government are proposing duties on stimulants and narcotics, which will probably have the effect, not of bringing in more revenue, but of bringing in less revenue than we are now receiving. This will be a national loss. It should be corrected without delay if such is the case.  Yet this  matter will be held up for some months until Parliament has the opportunity of dealing with it. </para>

Before the elections we had a very hard session, particularly those of us who were sitting opposite and bearing the main brunt of the fighting. The elections followed, and we had hard work in our campaigns: and in my own case I acted as campaign secretary in the largest State of the Union. </para>

                        <para>- I have not played six games of bowls in my seven years in Parliament. The honorable member gets off some of those "gags," thinking that his constituents will read them and regard him as a wonderful man, who is always seeking to work. The Honorable member may pass off that sort of business outside, but not here, where he is known. The endeavour of an honorable member to score off a colleague by an interjection is one of the meanest acts that I know of. There are some very big interests in my constituency affected by the Tariff who have made appeals to me to try to have certain matters dealt with; and I wish it to be known that,_ although I am as anxious as any other honorable member for some spell, for mental rest, so as to fit us for the long and strenuous session on which we must enter when we meet again in the new year, I shall be very glad, in- the interests of those who sent me here, to have the shortest possible adjournment, in order that we may deal with the Tariff. If that matter were not to be dealt with, I should not have so much anxiety about the adjournment. I hope that the Prime Minister, in fixing the dates, will take into consideration the fact that the Tariff is hanging over the community, and that the uttermost expedition should be displayed in meeting again, so that this particular matter may be dealt with. </para>

These are times when Parliament cannot be adjourned for any considerable time. Therefore, the adjournment must be contingent on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> on the advice of the Executive, calling Parliament together at any time during the interval, provided that in no case shall it extend beyond the 7th April. </para>

An important point which must not be overlooked is the question as to whether, during an adjournment of this kind, honorable members will be considered to be absent from duty, and common sense and wisdom will be displayed, I think, by all honorable members obtaining leave of absence. That protection will cost them nothing, and at least assure them something of importance. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true. When gentlemen of the type of the Leader of the Opposition make these suggestions, suspicion is at once generated. To have the Government loaded with all the inconveniences and all the extended trouble that will accrue from a Tariff in suspense - because that is the position - is a very fine thing for the Opposition; but while the Tariff is in suspense men will not know what to do. They must make temporary arrangements to temper its incidence to their customers or pass it on. </para>

                        <para>- That makes the position so much worse, and the sooner we know where we are the better it will be for the whole of Australia. We owe the duty to the whole of the business community to end the suspense they are working under as soon as possible. There may be additions to the Tariff, or reductions made. At the present time we need to have our industries stimulated. Before we meet again unemployment will be extended and suffering will be more intense. There is already tremendous poverty and distress. In New South Wales, with men on half time and others out of employment altogether, there are 70,000 people suffering from the effect of the crisis through which we are passing. The effect of the Tariff should be to alleviate matters to a considerable extent by stimulating our industries and so creating work, and the sooner the Government undertake the task the better. Whether we get to work early or late matters little to the Leader of the Opposition; the responsibility is not his, so that I am sorry the Ministry has retreated from their previous position. There is much to be done. Even if the war ends shortly, Australia will suffer from the effects of. the war, and this suffering can be best remedied by stimulating our industries. </para>

                    <para>.- As the Treasurer intends to introduce a Bill amending the Land Tax Act, I wish he would consider whether it is possible to do something which will give relief in the matter of appeals. Under the law as it stands now, no matter how small may be the amount in dispute between the taxpayer and the Government, the taxpayer has to go to the Court. That is his only means of relief. In a case brought under my notice recently a man who appealed against a valuation and lost the appeal would have been infinitely better off if he had paid the tax for ever instead  of going to Court. Even if an appeal is successful the expense is so great, particularly as applying to comparatively small men, that, however great an injustice may be done to them, they prefer to pay up rather than go to Court individually, and risk the chance of losing. I ask the Treasurer also to take into consideration the remarks recently made in New South Wales by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ferguson. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Treasurer to consider whether it is not possible to institute some other Appeal Court. In my district, where there is a large area of valuable land, there are small holdings that come under the tax, the owners of which pay amounts varying from £3 to £30 a year. These people may be paying twice as much as they should pay, but the cost of appeal is frightfully expensive, and the experience of those who have gone to Court has been such that if they happened to lose they would have been infinitely better off in paying the tax for ever. There should be some alteration to relieve the position of these taxpayers. They are quite willing to pay any tax they should pay, but in some cases the valuations are too high, and yet they have practically no redress under the law as it now stands. </para>

My view is that, once a Tariff is presented to Parliament, the Ministry have nothing more to do with it - that it becomes the property of the Parliament, and that the Parliament alone can amend it. If the Government are going to tinker with the Tariff, as the Minister of Trade and Customs told us to-day they intended to do, then other people should be given the same chance as the picture-show people have been given to place their grievances before the honorable gentleman. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care whether we do or do not. I am here to do the work of my constituents, and do not wish to shirk my duty. It is all very well for the honorable member for Maribyrnong, who is able to return to his own home every night, to talk about sitting on; but I remember how, after the first Tariff session in this Parliament, which extended over something like eighteen months, I went home, and my youngster wanted to know next morning who was the strange man in bed with mother. There are in this House some honorable members who have not seen their homes for several months. During the last two years I have not spent six weeks at home. No one can say that that is a fair thing. Is it any wonder that so many of us break down ? If the Government are going to bring down an amended Tariff Schedule, there are five or six different deputations from the several State capitals which I could introduce to the Minister of Trade and Customs to submit reasons why certain increased duties should not be imposed. One item which particularly affects the poor man in the western part of Queensland is that of cane-bottomed chairs, on which a duty of 175 per cent. has been imposed. These chairs are not made in Australia. When the first Federal Tariff was under consideration, some of the Protectionists in this House went wild. They wanted Protective duties on various articles of trade, and we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McColl,</inline> then the honorable member for Echuca, appealing for the abolition of the duties on three-legged glue-pots, on the ground that they could not be made here. </para>

                        <para>-Will the honorable member for Indi, who takes a broad, national view of these matters, tell me where cane-bottomed chairs, or any substitutes for them, are made in Australia? I heard the Prime Minister tell the House the other day that he was going to protect the industries of Australia. If this is how he is going to protect them, God help the Commonwealth. What I, and every man with any Australian backbone would like to see is an attempt to encourage the iron and steel industries. We could not place too heavy a duty on iron and steel in order to encourage their manufacture here; yet the Tariff provides for a duty of only 5 per cent. This is not a Protectionist Tariff. I do not pose as a Protectionist, but I should like the iron and steel industries to be developed in all the States. We have the material, the brains, and the money to establish such industries in the Commonwealth. These are the sort of industries to protect - industries that will do some good for Australia. The Minister of Trade and Customs poses as a really good Protectionist, and yet he puts a duty on cane-bottomed chairs which can not be made here, and which are in daily use all over the country. I do not profess to know anything about Tariffmaking, but I venture to say I could compile a better Tariff than that put before us last week. </para>

                        <para>- If the right honorable member and myself were left to frame a Tariff every one would wake up next day to find a Tariff that would delight them. I could pick from both sides of the House a Committee which would frame a Tariff that would give satisfaction to the whole of the people, and not to only a section, as this Tariff is doing. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - the great Protectionist organ of Australia - says that it is not a Protectionist Tariff, and when the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is not satisfied with it, how can I be expected to be? Several red-hot Protectionists in our party, who are always clamouring for more Protection, were members of a deputation which waited on the Minister yesterday to ask for the removal of the duty on cinematographs. What is to be said of their consistency? If there is one enterprise in Australia that is making money in these hard times it is the enterprise of the picture-show man. Great fortunes have been amassed by some picture show proprietors, and the records show that shares in the picture-theatre companies are continuing to rise. I know a man who has made over £60,000 out of the picture-show business. One has only to walk down Bourke-street on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night to see how such shows are paying. If ever there was a fair tax imposed it is the tax on cinematograph films, and if the Minister goes back on it he will have less backbone than I think he has. If the Government are going to bring down an amended Tariff schedule let them tell us at once, so that we may introduce to the Minister deputations of those who desire that various alterations shall be made. </para>

If he is going to bring down a Bill to alter the duty on cinematograph films, let him deal at the same time with the duty on cornsacks. There must be a mistake in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- We hear complaints on all sides concerning the high prices that producers have had to pay for cornsacks during the last three years. I reside in a farming district, and know that these complaints are well founded. Cornsacks from Great Britain are free, but those from other parts of the world are dutiable at 10 per cent. I understand that sacks are not made in Great Britain, save at Dundee, and oven there the output is not very large. I am advised that nearly all our imports of jute sacks come from India. While this item will not in any way protect an Australian industry, it will place a heavy burden upon the primary producers. If the Minister intends to submit an amended Tariff schedule before we rise for the Christmas vacation, I hope he will include the item of cornsacks in it, and give us an opportunity to review the duty as soon as possible. The producers have been hit hard enough this year, and as the season for the use of these sacks is now upon us, action should be taken at once. The producers throughout the Commonwealth have been badly hit, but, notwithstanding, they are being asked to pay a higher land tax, and to pay through the nose for the cornsacks they use, although the duty on cornsacks will not increase employment in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Government will take into consideration the simplification of the methods of appeal against land tax assessments. At the present time the difficulties in the way of appealing are stupendous, cases having to be brought before the High Court or before a Supreme Court Judge. I suggest that where £20 or under is the sum at issue, appeals should be heard before a police magistrate. The magistrates in the Small Debts Court deal with civil claims between man and man in regard to such sums, and I do not see why cases between a man and the Government should be treated differently. It is not to be understood that 1 support the proposal to increase the taxation of the people on the land; I am wholly opposed to it. This is the most inopportune time in the history of Australia in which it could have been brought forward. The drought this year is a record so far as Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia are concerned, and it affects also many parts of Queensland and two-thirds of New South Wales. I travelled from Melbourne to Adelaide recently without seeing any grass at all, and in many places in my constituency that I visited during the electoral campaign it was impossible to distinguish fallowed land from sown land. Many graziers have lost all their sheep, and have no pasture, and no corn, wheat, or other produce. That is the state of things in many parts of the Riverina. How can people in such districts afford to pay higher taxation ? We were told by the mover of the Address-in-Reply that, with the advent of the Labour party to office, the farmers would come into their own, yet the Labour party is putting a tax upon the producers by levying £144,000 in duty on cornsacks, and £28,000 in duties on farming implements, and is also imposing a graduated land tax, which is expected to return £1,250,000. Seeing that the banks have lent the Government £10,000,000, and that it has other money, it might well forego this taxation, and leave the farmers alone. </para>

                        <para>- When big firms, like Anthony Hordern and Sons, Farmer and Company, and David Jones and Company, are charged extra taxation, they increase the price of their commodities. Certainly this is not an opportune time for increasing taxation. I do not know where the people in the cities would be if it were not for the people on the land. Without produce from the country, a city like Melbourne could not last for two months. We have had quite enough of  high protective duties. We have reached high-water mark in this respect. I was elected on the Free Trade ticket, and I say that the Tariff will injure the poor and the working classes. It is all very well to talk about the trusts and combines injuring the workers; the Tariff will do infinitely more to injure them. The duty on wheat sacks, at8s. 6d. a dozen, means8½d. to the user. We are told in the Scriptures not to muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn ; but our friends opposite are muzzling the farmer, the producer of the corn. It is in the interest of the country to encourage the primary producer as much as possible, and I put an record my emphatic protest against the proposal to tax them further. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to enter into a debate on the Tariff, but I wish to say that never before, in my experience, has a Tariff been introduced, and then left several months before being considered by Parliament. The present arrangement may be a good one for the Treasury, but it is a bad one for the people as a whole. Even the most rabid Protectionists - and we have a lot of them here - will find out that duties have been imposed on raw material which must increase the cost of manufacture. That is a left-handed sort of protection for the manufacturer. By leaving the Tariff unconsidered for three or four months, an opportunity will be given to traders generally to rob the public. Nothing could be more barefaced than the action that has been taken by the publicans. It is proposed to increase the duty on whisky by 3s. a gallon, and the public is to be robbed of over 30s. a gallon, there being at least ninety-six nobblers in a gallon of whisky. No Tariff has ever been introduced which did not contain a lot of anomalies and mistakes. The present action of the Government will more or less paralyze trade. No man will start a new industry until he knows how it will be treated. From whatever stand-point one views the matter, it is a bad thing to allow the question of the Tariff to stand over. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems impossible to get any satisfaction out of the Postal Department. A case has come before me where two poles erected in a town in my constituency were placed on the footpath, and, under section 85 of the Act, the Department claims that the local municipality should pay for moving them, and asks the municipality to pay £35 before they send the necessary men. Then, at Apollo Bay. down the coast, the shire council found it necessary to cut away sand along a roadway in order to make a formation. On this work being done the Postal Department considered it necessary to lower four telegraph poles each 2 feet, owing to the road having been taken away to a certain extent. The Department would not allow the shire council to do the work, but sent down two men from Melbourne, with the result that a bill for £11 7s. 4d. was sent in to the council, although two of the council's own men could have done the work in one day. The bill was made up of the following items : - Two men for 3½ days, and one man for 2 days, £4 10s.; travelling allowance, £2 12s. 8d.; coach fares, £2 ; cartage of tools, 10s. ; hire of horse and dray, 5s. ; and, as this did not make up the £11 7s. 4d., the Department carefully put in, " office expenses, £1 9s. 8d." Of course, the shire council have refused to pay : and the case is a beautiful example of how the Department carries on its business. The public are not getting the value for their money from the Department, while a lot of money is being wasted. </para>

So far as I am concerned I am prepared to come back at any time the Prime Minister summon us, and to stay as long as he pleases to ask us. There is a very adroit move on the other side to place the whole responsibility for the postponement of the Tariff on to our shoulders; and I repudiate any such responsibility. It comes with particularly bad grace from the honorable member for Macquarie to lecture me in the way he did. The honorable member, we know, is a perfect "whale" for work - while he is here. No man knows better than he does that there is no hope for the unemployed in this kind of Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to know why the expenditure for loan on the Expeditionary Forces is mixed with the ordinary appropriation. It seems to me that the course that ought to be followed, and which . I understood would be followed, is to introduce a Loan Bill in connexion with the Expeditionary Forces, and keep that expenditure free from the ordinary appropriation. </para>

                    <para>. -  The method suggested by the honorable member for Swan would be very convenient up to a certain point, but we cannot tell how much we may require, although we estimate our requirements. A Loan Bill would make the position much more difficult. Although we are voting the money here, it will be my duty as Treasurer to introduce a Loan Bill later on. If we introduced a Loan Bill now, the amount might prove insufficient, whereas, if we charge the expenditure as part of the general appropriation, we can later on bring down a Loan Bill covering the whole amount. According to the promises I made, the accounts are being kept separate. </para>

                    <para>.- This question of insurance came before us in connexion with the High Commissioner's buildings in London, and I came to the conclusion that it is bad policy not to insure. I thought there was a fallacy underlying some of the assumptions, and, if I am not mistaken, an insurance on the Commonwealth building in London has been effected. In regard to the Expeditionary Forces, I may mention that in the case of the South African war the Imperial Government periodically gave a statement to the House of Commons of the expenditure incurred beyond the ordinary annual expenditure. This statement did not include merely loan expenditure, but all expenditure, whether from revenue or loan, caused by the war itself. </para>

                    <para>. -  When I asked a question about the increased old-age pensions, I was told I should have the information afforded in the Budget, but I have not  yet got it. I seem to be particularly unfortunate in the asking of questions. I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs an important question about Red Cross cargo having been removed in favour of other cargo from a Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's boat, and informed him that, in my opinion, this company were not treating people well, inasmuch as when it was proposed that some contributions of clothing and so on, that had been made in Melbourne, should be sent over with a soldier going to the front, it was treated worse than ordinary cargo. This shipping company should remember that, if it were not for men fighting at the front, they might not be able to carry on their business. When I ask questions about important matters of this kind, I do not desire perky replies from the Minister of Trade and Customs. It is a time-honored custom, when a question is asked without notice, for a Minister to make some inquiries, but the Minister in question seems to be a law unto himself. If the honorable gentleman continues this sort of thing, and is offensive when asked questions, I shall exhaust the forms of the House in order to get my rights. I ask the Prime Minister whether Red Cross cargoes have not been removed in the way I have indicated, and suggest that the flippant Minister of Trade and Customs should be required to make inquiries? The Minister of Trade and Customs may grin, but he does not know all there is to be known on these matters. The honorable member takes it upon himself to promise alterations of the Tariff when he knows very well that he cannot make an alteration without the approval of this House. He knows that, in some instances, the duties on raw materials are heavier than the duties on the finished article. That is what he calls Protection. The honorable member may gull his own constituents in that way, but he cannot gull me. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member does not know what he is talking about either. He may interrupt with his flippant interjections, but I know as much about Protection as he does, and perhaps more. The Government policy of imposing high duties and thereby getting plenty of revenue is not Protection. That is what the new Tariff does, and as such it is not a good Tariff. It is the high revenue duties that are killing this country. I have heard the Minister of Trade and Customs speak about differentiating between Protection and a revenue Tariff. I ask him to let us see something of genuine Protection. I would like him to give me the information I want before we go any further; otherwise, I shall feel it my duty to divide the House. He may think that he can follow the German policy of " Might is right," but I will show him that he is wrong. I ask him now whether he does not know that some of the duties are heavier on the raw material than they are on the manufactured article. I ask the Prime Minister if, when big increases in high salaries are being given, and when German prisoners are being paid by the Commonwealth £1 a week to do nothing, he thinks that 10s. a week is enough for our old people and invalids to exist on. We know that the cost of living has risen, and some of these old people will not be able to have their Christmas in comfort. Honorable members opposite had a very different cry when they were on the hustings. If they will treat honorable members on this side unfairly when they ask for information, they must expect unpleasant things to be said about them. I regret that we cannot proceed with the Tariff at the present time, because I believe that we would have some interesting disclosures. This Tariff is a hybrid affair for the purpose of imposing taxation, and is not based on genuine Protection at all. The Minister must admit that the purpose of this Tariff is not to encourage Australian industries, but to fill the Treasury to- overflowing; and if the Treasury is to overflow, is it not right that we should give a fair deal to our old-age pensioners? If the Minister thinks that he can treat honorable members in the flippant way he has adopted to-night, we will show him that might is not right, and that we are entitled to fair consideration, which we have not received from him to-night. </para>

                    <para>.- I think this measure ought to be entitled the " Contingency Bill," because of the enormous amounts which have been put down opposite the word "contingencies." On page 13, for instance, under railways, there is provided for salaries and various items, £1,575, and then follows £70,125 for contingencies. It, is an insult to our intelligence to put down so little for particular items, and then to put down £70,000 for contingencies of which no details are given. </para>

                        <para>- I choose to say it now, and if the honorable member does not intend to listen, he may go home. The treatment meted out by the present Government to the producers on the land is characterized by great severity, and in the land-tax proposals the Government are quite indifferent as to how much these poor unfortunates have to pay. We find in this Bill that the cost of collecting the land tax is an inordinately large item, salaries alone accounting for £15,000. Here, again, our intelligence is insulted by £15,000 being put down for salaries, and £22,000 being provided for contingencies, in regard to which no information at all is given. That is not a reasonable procedure, and I raise my protest against it. Under the heading of "Military Purposes," various contingency amounts of £20,000, £27,000, £81,000, £7,000, and so on are provided. In the postal expenditure the amount allowed for contingencies is greater than the cost of the conveyance of mails. Surely there is something radically wrong when the business of the country is transacted in this way. We are asked to carry this Supply Bill for over £10,000,000 through all its stages to-night, and I suppose one-half of that total amount comes under the heading of contingencies. </para>

In regard to the Tariff, one of the great defects and glaring evils in Australia is the continual growth of the cities as compared with the country. That evil is becoming more marked every day, and the present Government, as far as I can judge them from their Estimates, their Budget, and the Supply Bill, appear to "be determined to make the city still more attractive by making the country less attractive. </para>

                        <para>- And so is my honorable friend, who, because he is a builder in Sydney, claims to know everything about the producer in the country. He is the comic gentleman of the House, and is always speaking with a plum in his mouth. I am a country representative, and I believe that the prosperity and welfare of Australia depends on encouraging the people to develop the back country. Therefore I would give mail facilities even in places where such services would not pay, and I would decrease the taxation in every way possible. The more we can produce, the more we can have to export, and the more produce we have to export, the better for the community. I am grieved to find that the present Government are apparently determined to adopt the very opposite policy, and think that they can foster the best interests of the people by imposing taxation on those who undertake the hardships incidental to work in the interior. Their conditions are naturally harder and less attractive, and the Government seem determined to make them less attractive by imposing additional burdens upon them. Why should the producer be singled out by the Government for special notice when, all the time, we know that there is an incentive necessary to attract people into the country? </para>

Honorable members cannot increase the wealth of the country by taxation, nor can they tax any one into a happy state. The people who are unduly taxed, and who are beginning to realize that fact, are resenting the conditions, and flocking into the cities. Every one recognises that the evil is being intensified. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, if the wealth of a country is what it produces; then people must be located where the production can be brought about. It cannot be brought about in the cities; it must be done in the country. The manufacturing interests are being fostered by the protective incidence of the Tariff, and, to a certain extent, we would concede that that is right and proper. But when a Tariff is adopted which administers a snub to those who venture to go on the land, and prevents them from getting a fair return, honorable members are not acting in the best interests of the country, but are bringing about conditions which are fatal to those interested. Therefore, I, as the representative of a country constituency, consider that it is my duty to point out to town members who do not understand the position how the question is regarded from the country point of view. </para>

                <para>Mr.FISHER (Wide Bay- Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.12]. - The main charge which the honorable member for Echuca brought against the Supply Bill is the large amount for contingencies. But every item explains itself. The honorable member is on a Committee of the House, I think. He will find that items for contingencies are a necessary part of a Supply Bill in order to prevent the measure from being a replica of the Estimates. The Bill is founded on the Estimates. Take the vote for the Library, which is governed by a Committee of the House. The amount set down for salaries is £1,370, while the amount required for contingencies is £1,700. </para>

A sum of £1,000 is required for salaries and £1,150 for contingencies. The references which have been made to contingencies prove nothing. It would be to the credit of honorable members if, instead of using terms that might mislead honest electors, they would simply address themselves to the more solid affairs of Parliament and give the public the facts of the case. </para>

                        <para>- The details are all set out in the Estimates. The items are grouped under the head of contingencies for the sake of simplicity instead of repeating what is contained in the Estimates. Regarding the question raised by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, it is not possible, with the present means  at our disposal, to increase the invalid and old-age pensions. It is not possible, without fresh taxation, to add thereto the widow and orphans pension which it is the intention of the Government, as opportunity offers, to bring into existence. All the sentiment which may be expressed about what should and would be done can be given effect to, not by talking about reducing the taxation, as is proposed on all sides, but by providing means to raise the necessary taxation to provide the pensions. It cannot be charged against this Govern.ment, or any Labour Government, that they have failed to carry out social legislation when opportunity offered. It is only the stress of circumstances occasioned by the war that has prevented this legislation being carried into effect. I sympathize with invalid and old-age pensioners in the position they occupy; but it will, perhaps, be some satisfaction to them to realize that the matter of the expansion and extension of the principle has only been delayed by circumstances over which we have no control. </para>

                    <para>.- Will the Prime Minister give me an answer to the question I raised about Red Cross goods ? The Red Cross Society in Sydney put some goods on a Peninsular and Oriental steamer, expecting that they would go to the war: but these goods were bundled off the steamer at Melbourne and other cargo put in their place, and they will probably be lying about the wharf in Melbourne until the winter is over, and the soldiers will not get the benefit of them. As a young French soldier who is going to the war has an aunt who is in charge of a field hospital, certain people collected comforts, clothes, and goods, and were anxious to send them direct to the hospital, but the shipping company has given them no consideration or facility to do so, apparently forgetting that the efforts of the men at the front have rendered it possible for them to carry on their trade. But the flippant Minister of. Trade and Customs has declined to take any notice of the matter, though I brought it up in Parliament last week, and it was reported fully in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If he continues to do this sort of thing I shall make it uncomfortable for him. Members coming from his own State probably do not resent his attitude, but I shall have to teach him that he cannot treat honorable members in this way, and I shall have to use the forms of the House to block business until I can ascertain why this action has been taken by this shipping company. It is an outrage. The Minister has neglected his duties in not making inquiries. When I asked the Prime Minister about the matter he referred me to the Postmaster-General, and then I was referred to the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, with a flippant sneer, passed me off, and said that I would have to give notice of the question. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister tells me that he did not say that to the honorable member. I ask the honorable member not to pursue the matter now. If the statement is true that the company have unloaded goods of that kind and taken on other cargo in its place it was an action they should not be proud of. </para>

It is proposed to sit to-morrow night and also late on Saturday night, and on Monday morning, afternoon, and night, when I hope we will be able to finish our business and adjourn. I thank honorable members opposite for the consideration they have shown. I hope that we shall be able to co-operate as far as possible and get the work through early. </para>

                        <para>.- I understand that a large number of married men volunteered for our Expeditionary Forces under the impression that in addition to their daily pay an allowance would be made to their wives and children. That allowance was paid whilst the members of our First Expeditionary Force remained in camp, but ceased immediately upon their embarkation for active service abroad. If it be essential that an allowance should be granted to their wives and children during the time that the men are in camp, it is equally essential that that allowance should be continued during the period that they are engaged on active service. I hope that the Government will take this matter into consideration, with a view to continuing this grant to the wives and children of our soldiers. </para>
