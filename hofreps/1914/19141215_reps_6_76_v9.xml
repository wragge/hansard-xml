The Government of Western Australia asked that a certain quantity of maize should be allowed to enter the State free of duty, but the Commonwealth Government, having all the facts before it, considered that, as maize was available in the eastern States, it  would  not be fair to remit the import duty. </para>

I am afraid that the information referred to would not be sufficient, because shipping and other charges might absorb any difference in the rise or fall of the price of wheat. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that the possibility of interference with letters posted in the pillar-boxes is a very serious thing. We have been trying to devise better-designed pillar-boxes which will not give opportunity for theft. I am not aware of the occurrence to which the honorable member refers, but I shall have an inquiry made regarding it. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware of what the honorable member has said. It appears to me that there are obvious defects in the plan submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin.</inline> If the honorable member will kindly put a question on the notice-paper he will get any information bearing on the subject. I think that he is confusing surveys which have been made for the departmental plan. So far as I know, there are no surveys by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> which " the man in the street" or an ordinary man can form any conception of. </para>

We could take that action if we thought that our herds were being unduly depleted by the slaughtering of cows; but I am afraid that the only result of prohibiting the export of cow beef would be that it would be retained for disposal in the States. </para>

                            <para>- The newspaper reports in question have been confirmed by a telegram received by the Prime Minister from the Premier of Western Australia. Trouble has arisen at Broome, but the local authorities have been able to cope with it. As to the second portion of the honorable member's question, it is doubtless convenient to convey the impression that the pearlers are without funds necessary to return these men to their homes in the distant islands. The pearlers, however, are under an obligation to return them, and we shall exhaust every means to compel them to discharge that obligation before considering the deportation of any of these natives at the expense of the Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members generally will join with me in regretting the necessity for legislation of this kind. It has fallen to the lot of a Labour Government to introduce this Bill, but I am quite satisfied that if the party represented by honorable members opposite had been in power they would have introduced a similar Bill. In the circumstances I take it that this will not be considered a party measure. The object of the Bill is to provide for the grant of pensions upon the death or incapacity of members of the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth and members of the Imperial Reserve Forces resident in Australia, whose death, or incapacity results from their employment in connexion with warlike operations. The Bill has two main principles. The first is that a pension is to be provided for the nearest dependent, and for his children if he is married, of any officer or soldier who by reason of the war meets with his death. It is proposed also to provide a pension in the case of total incapacity arising from injuries received during the war. Any member of the Expeditionary Forces, or any person who has signed on in the Navy, who is totally incapacitated, will receive a pension during his lifetime, while his wife will be paid a half pension, and the children an allowance until they attain the age of sixteen years, without distinction of sex. In cases of partial incapacity, as I shall show later on, the pension will be determined by a Pensions Board, subject to certain conditions. The Bill provides that every person who has enlisted, or been appointed for, or employed on active service outside Australia, or employed on a ship of war shall, together with his dependents, be entitled to a pension or an allowance. The Bill is retrospective as far back as the declaration of war, so as to embrace casualties and deaths which have occurred since then. According to the definition clause " incapacity " includes incapacity arising from disease, not due to default of a member of the Forces, contracted by him while on active service. This means, I take it, that if a soldier contracts pneumonia, consumption, or any other disease in consequence of his enlistment he shall be entitled to a pension. </para>

The administration of the Bill is to be vested in a Board appointed by the Government or Minister of Defence, and one member of the Board must be a medical practitioner. The fact that a medical practitioner is on the Board will insure due regard to the rights of all claimants, because he will be able to grasp the merits of any application from an expert point of view. Power is given by clause 7 to the Pensions Board, if it see fit, to review any assessment or determination that it has made. Any assessment made by the Board is subject to the approval of the Minister of Defence, so that any claimant who feels aggrieved may, on application to the Minister, have his case re-heard. </para>

                            <para>- Yes.  Colonel Fetherston,  who is the commanding medical officer of the Forces, has been consulted, and he considers that six months is ample time to allow for the lodging of a claim. The rates of the pensions are fixed by clause 8, under three heads - death, total incapacity, and partial incapacity. In the case of death the widow will be paid a pension varying, according to the rate of pay of the deceased, from £52 to £156 per annum, while each child until it reaches the age of sixteen years will be paid 5s. per week. One feature of this allowance to the children will, I think, appeal to honorable members. Whether the child be that of a brigadier-general, an officer, a captain, or a private the allowance is the same amount. In the event of total incapacity a member of the Forces will receive the full pension set forth, while his wife will be paid 50 per cent, of the pension, and each child 5s. per week. In the case of partial incapacity the amount of the pensions is left to the Board to determine. It will be seen that the Bill definitely lays down the amounts to be paid in case of death or total incapacity, whereas it becomes a matter for the Board when the incapacity is only partial, and the payment will vary with the injury. Provision is made for taking into account any compensation, pension, retiring allowance, and so forth, received by the claimant under other Acts. The Bill, in the opinion of the Government, is a fair and reasonable one, and makes due provision for our soldiers, their wives, children, and dependents. </para>

                            <para>- I mean the provision for which the Government can take full responsibility. It is quite possible that many persons who will be eligible for a pension under this Bill will also be entitled to some other pension or gratuity under another Statute. In such cases the amounts to which they are entitled under other Acts must be taken into consideration, and the Commonwealth becomes responsible in the aggregate only for the sums which they can demand under this Bill. Consequently, soldiers will not be able to receive different pensions under different Acts. </para>

                            <para>- Clause 9 provides that where the Board is satisfied that the rate of pension payable under this Bill will not be more than 30 per cent, of the rate which would be payable upon the total incapacity of any soldier, it may, with the sanction of the Minister, substitute the payment of a lump sum which, in its opinion, is equivalent to the pension. That is to say, the Minister is vested with power to buy out the right of any such soldier. For instance, a man may be allowed a pension of £15 a year for all time on the ground of his being partially incapacitated. This provision will enable him to approach the Minister, and to accept a lump sum in full satisfaction of his claim. </para>

                            <para>- In clause 10. Clause 13 proposes to extend pensions to soldiers of the Imperial Reserve who are <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> residents of Australia. In determining the pensions to which they are entitled, the amounts which they receive from the Imperial authorities must be taken into consideration, and must be deducted. If they do not get from the Imperial authorities as much as they would receive by way of pension under this Bill, the deficiency is to be made up to them. In other words, they are to be treated just as are our Australian soldiers. </para>

Taking the community as a whole, probably more than half of the males of early adult age have dependents either lineal or collateral, but as the existence of dependents will exercise a restraining influence on the desire to volunteer, it may, perhaps, be sufficiently accurate to assume that of those who die one-half leave dependents. </para>

That is the minimum amount which it can be said, roughly, it will cost the Commonwealth for one year's fighting. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I suppose such pensions would be included in the amount quoted. This Bill is drafted in such a way that I trust it will receive very little opposition from any member of the House. It is non-party in character, and it is the best provision that the Government can make in the circumstances. But if, in the future, we find that there has been any omission or defect whereby some person is not receiving exactly what he or she ought to get, I am sure the Government will be only too willing to bring down an amending measure to make this a complete Statute. In the circumstances, I ask honorable members to give the Bill a rapid passage through the Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- It will have the effect of including as taxable land extra leaseholds, in addition to any which are at present taxable. Land-holders are to be taxed on the aggregate of the estate, whether held in fee simple, under perpetual lease, or under conditional purchase, and the Bill will also apply to the taxable value of Crown leases. Practically speaking, all property of a taxable value of above £5,000 will bear its proportionate burden, both individually and in the aggregate, according to the size of the estates. There is an exemption in the case of mining leases to the extent that the value of any minerals reserved to the Crown shall be excluded from the assessment. </para>

                            <para>- It was done on the gold-fields of Queensland. It is a well-known practice in that State to assess only the surface value of a mining lease, and not the value of the minerals within the mine. I do not think that this provision is likely to cause any difficulty. The surface value of leases must have a taxable value, altogether apart from the minerals won from the ground. </para>

                            <para>- There used to be a royalty and a dividend duty, and in the case of Mount Morgan there was a royalty of1s. per oz., but I think the royalty was removed some time ago. The royalty was imposed, in the first instance, because it was discovered that the company had no legal right to the gold. When the concern was worth about £12,000,000, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Harding decided that the gold belonged to the Crown, and that the company had no title in it, and a Bill was thereupon hurriedly put through Parliament to give them the title; a small royalty being imposed, which was afterwards discontinued. I do not know the Victorian law on these matters. It is not proposed to ask lessees whose leases are merely annual to furnish assessments ; but all others must send in assessments, and the Commissioner will have the right to make investigations and independent assessments should he think it desirable to do so. Under that flexible arrangement I do not think that grave injustice will arise. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to mention to the House a rather unfortunate matter which is ancillary to the measure, and directly connected with it. I stated, and the Government believed the statement to be correct, that the new scale of taxation was a true gradation, that the amendments would affect and include other taxable areas. I am informed now that there is a small angle in connexion with the proposed tax in which the increment of the rate of tax exceeds the limit provided for in the Bill. That was not the intention of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it was, but the discovery was only communicated to me this morning. We will seek a method of adjusting the difficulty. The question raised by the honorable member for Grey can be discussed better in Committee. So far as it goes the principle of this machinery is good, and will be a protection to the persons who may be taxed under it. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that this little piece of machinery will prove to be entirely inadequate so far as the whole scheme of taxation now proposed is concerned. Moreover, I think it is time that the whole machinery in the principal Act was overhauled. I have no doubt that when we meet again another amending machinery Bill will be ready for the House. Already we hear that things are not turning out as they should. I do not wonder at that, because the Government have undertaken a most difficult and delicate operation, and one, the end of which I do not pretend to foresee or appreciate properly. However, the Government say that they have mathematicians in the Departments who are setting all these things right by rule and rote. I hope that it may be the case, so far as the ascertainment of the value and the imposition of the tax are concerned. My attitude is a very simple one. I am opposed to this taxation at every point. In my judgment, nothing has occurred in connexion with the whole scheme of finance that the Government have submitted to the House which could not be rectified without the imposition of this taxation. It is wholly unnecessary, and for that reason I am opposed to it, without considering too closely the details. </para>

                    <para>.- There are one or two features of this clause to which I desire to direct attention. In the first place, there is a provision in subclause <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> which practically means that perpetual leases, which are liable to have their rentals re-appraised, shall be subject to taxation. I do not consider this to be consistent with the leasing principle. It is certainly inconsistent with the principle of land nationalization. In South Australia, for instance, we are not taxing perpetual leases that are liable to reappraisement of the rent, every fourteen years. The perpetual leasing system is not likely to be extended, and will certainly never become popular if lessees know that they are liable to be subjected to taxation between the intervals of valuation . A vital blow at the true principle of leasing is aimed by this part of the clause; but I am afraid, in view of  the result of the recent division, that it would be hopeless to move an amendment. In South Australia, we made an effort to substitute the perpetual leasing system for the freehold system in 1888 and 1889, and I had a good deal to do with that attempt. On several occasions, I think even members of the then growing Labour party voted to take away the principle of re-valuation. But now certain perpetual leaseholds which are not liable to appraisement are subject to taxation under the State as well as under the Commonwealth law. All leases which are liable to have a revaluation every fourteen years, so as to give the Crown the true economic rent, are now, by this Bill, brought under our taxation principles, but not under the State taxation law. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in respect of some of the leases ; but, unfortunately, the principle of appraisement was taken away from other leases. It was a wrong step to take, but it has been done. I think we should leave the section in the Act as it stands. Under the Act as it stands it is only perpetual leases, not subject to the reappraisement of rental, which are liable to be taxed ; but we are now bringing under our taxation law leases that are subject to re-appraisement, and which represent the true principle of Crown leases, or, if you like to call it so, land nationalization. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I know there is between some of them a difference only in degree. Where we give a pastoral lease for, say, 42 years, there is only one re-appraisement in some cases; but there is a distinction between these and the perpetual leases which were substituted for freehold with the object of giving the economic rent to the Crown. There is another matter to which I desire to refer. Under this clause, mines like those at Broken Hill will be taxed upon their unimproved value, and the value of the minerals will be taken into account since they are not reserved to the Crown. It is only the minerals that are reserved to the Crown that are not to be taken into account in settling the unimproved value. But all the Broken Hill mines are subject to leases at comparatively low rentals which give the minerals, during the duration of the lease, practically to the lessee. Is it right that we should bring in here a principle which I do not think exists in New South Wales - the principle of taxing the unimproved value of Broken Hill leases ? If we do we shall take away one of the greatest inducements to prospecting which is undertaken in the hope of a big return being secured after an expenditure of many thousands of pounds. </para>

                        <para>- I do not like to say that that will occur. It might be held that a royalty was part of the minerals, and to the extent to which minerals are reserved as royalties you may not make a deduction. But in the case of the great Broken Hill mine the royal metals, I think, are not reserved as minerals. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly so, but in New South Wales they are not taxed on the value of the discovered minerals. The leases were granted presumably because it was known when they were applied for that the minerals were there. There was no accidental discovery of those minerals by the owners. The one or two herdsmen who struck the outcrop of the lode in the first instance discovered the minerals. Jam afraid that this provision will act against a principle which to some extent I cherish as well as do some honorable members opposite, as regards perpetual leases with revaluations, and I fear that it will impose a very severe burden if we drag in the value of the minerals on these leases. I shall not move an amendment, but I felt that my duty required me to draw attention to this matter. </para>

                    <para>.- The first significant amendment made by clause 2 is to strike out the words " without revaluation." Under the old Act leases with revaluation were exempt, and the amendment now proposed will bring in all leases in Queensland under the seven years' revaluation, and all leases in South Australia under the fourteen years' revaluation, together with- the Western Lands Leases of New South Wales. It may be fairly assumed that where revaluation is at such short periods, the State sees that it gets the full economic value in the shape of the rents charged; and yet these lands, if added to others owned by the lessees, may be taxable. The clause will also include pastoral leases, grazing, cultivation, and homestead leases, and mining leases; though it does not cover the whole variety of leases in existence. For instance, in New South Wales there are settlement leases, conditional leases, and conditional purchase leases. The conditional purchase leases, so far as I understand, will be subject to taxation, but the conditional leases, which are not subject to purchase, will be exempt. Then there are improvement leases and annual leases, which, so far as I can see, will not be subject to taxation, together with what are called special leases. </para>

                        <para>- They may or may not when they are joined with other lands owned by the same man. However, whether the rental value is considered to be the economic value or not, the occupant is not saved from making a return, or from having the value added to his existing holdings, whether in town or country. It is quite clear that, though there may be no economic value, he will, under such circumstances, have to pay taxation. It is here, I think, that the increased revenue is going to be obtained. In Victoria, there are what are known as Mallee lands, and it is a question whether or not they will come within the proposed amendment. There are also what are known as grazing licences which would certainly not come under the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- In South Australia there are a number of what are called miscellaneous leases with twenty-one years to run ; and, as I read the amendments, these leases would certainly not be subject to taxation. The clause describes the nature of the leases which are taxable, and to that extent it limits the operation of the section. The simplicity with which we are supposed to arrive at the value of land is remarkable. The problem is thrown at us as if it were something that any schoolboy could understand. The Land Tax Assessment Act provides that the unimproved value means the capital sum which the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller would require, assuming the improvements made by him or his predecessor had not been made. It is quite clear that the improvements made on a lease or freehold are to be deducted from the unimproved value. But how will an owner arrive at a basis on which to assess himself? There are thousands of miles held in Australia under pastoral lease at a rental which varies from 2s. 6d. to 30s. per mile. How are we to arrive at the unimproved value of that land? </para>

                        <para>- I think that would be a very fair proposition. If the present rental, in the opinion of the check assessors, is considered to be the economic rent, there will be no revenue for the Commonwealth Government, but an immense expense will be incurred in maintaining a large staff of officials to go over the  whole  of the country and make the check valuations. Assuming, again, that there is no margin  between  the economic value and the rental paid, and, therefore, no tax due, the lessee, if he has other property in 1 he city or elsewhere, will have that added, and will thus be called upon to pay considerably more than he does at present. </para>

                        <para>- The reservation referred to in the proviso relates to the mineral rights reserved to the Crown when disposing of the surface rights of Crown lands. When a man takes up a mineral lease, he takes it up for <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> specific purpose, and obtains the right from the Crown to obtain the mineral contained in the ground, whether it be coal, gold, silver, copper, lead, or even oil. The Crown parts with its rights to the leaseholder subject to the latter carrying out certain labour covenants and paying an annual rent. The States in leasing the surface for grazing or other purposes reserve the mineral rights, but when a man takes up land under any form of mineral lease, he has a clear right to all the minerals contained in the area he leases. </para>

                        <para>- No. He uses the land for the purpose of getting any metals he can out of it. My view is that when the Department determines the valuation of land in any district, the minerals will be taken into consideration in estimating the taxable value. This will be serious to Broken Hill arid to  all mining companies operating throughout the Commonwealth. In assessing the Unimproved value, the leaseholder may deduct the value of machinery and improvements; but, apart from the figures so arrived at, the total value of the lease will be the amount taxable under this Bill. All mines proved to contain valuable minerals will realize at sale considerable amounts, so that the leaseholders will really have to state in their taxation returns what the mines will realize at sale, less the value of improvements. </para>

                        <para>- The royalty and rental paid on coal mines in New South Wales will have to be considered in the light of whether they represent the economic value. The leaseholders of coal-mining areas, on being asked to furnish returns as to the unimproved values of their leases, must furnish values which cannot be nominal, and they will be taxable at the higher amounts. The trouble is that the Government propose to take the machinery used for freeholds and apply it to leaseholds. An honest return as to the unimproved value will be very difficult to obtain. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that fact, but I recognise the great difficulty the mining leaseholder will have in sending in a return based on the value of what his lease would fetch if sold. A return sent in on the basis of the rental would be considerably under the actual value of the lease. The proviso, which says that in the assessment of a mineral lease the value of any mineral reserved to the Crown shall be excluded, does not affect mining leases; it only affects men holding surface rights; it does not clear the point as to how the leaseholder will make up his return. If he makes up a wrong return, there is a heavy penalty provided, and, although he may have submitted an assessment that is higher than the departmental assessment, months, and perhaps years, elapse before he can get the matter dealt with and secure a refund. Large sums of money are held in this way through decisions not being arrived at. </para>

                        <para>- The more we look into the matter of taxing mining leases, the more complicated it is. This taxation proposal will lead to considerable expenditure in the direction of checking assessments in order that the Department may make sure that it is not being deprived of legitimate revenue, but we cannot secure revenue from a large number of leaseholders, while in the case of others the tax will mean confiscation of their properties. There can be no justification for taxation imposed with the purpose of causing subdivision of leaseholds. There may be certain favoured localities in which the leasehold system can be applied to small holdings, but there could be no subdivision with occupation of the western part of New South Wales and the northern portion of South Australia, extending right through to Queensland and New South Wales. A one-time Commissioner of Crown lands in South Australia had the insane idea that this land could be held in smaller holdings. But the result of his policy was to cripple the whole of the pastoral area of the district, and years passed before the State Government could reconstitute the pastoral interests. The Royal Commission which investigated the matter, containing Labour representatives and practical men, realized that the country must be held in large holdings, and that only the continuance of large 'moldings could justify putting men on to occupy it. While the subdivision idea may apply to freeholds it does not apply to leaseholds, and any intention on the part of the Government to mulct leaseholders to such an extent that it must mean subdivision or surrender of their areas would be criminal. The severe ravages of wild dogs in South Australia  have caused the subdivision of the whole of the northern area into vermin districts. Money is advanced by the Crown on twenty years' terms for repayment, but no lessee can surrender his lease during that twenty years unless he pays his total share of the cost of the fencing. </para>

When the honorable member was speaking the other day, I cited the case of a leaseholder who had to spend £60 a mile on a fence, and had to pay a rate of £1 per mile for twenty years for the area enclosed in order to repay the cost of the fence, but the honorable member said that this was an annual payment, and could not be deducted from the valuation of improvements, though it is clearly added rental. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister said that if, at the end of the lease, the lessee had an interest in the improvements, they could not be deducted, as would be the case with onerous conditions attaching to a lease. As a matter of fact, in many cases wire netting will not last twenty years, and will probably have to be replaced before the expiration of that period. It is of no value to the lease at the end of twenty years, but, at the same time, it is an added annual rental. If I am compelled on a lease, on which I pay an annual rental of 10s. per mile, to put up a fence costing annually £1 per mile, it is clearly added rental; because without that it is impossible to occupy the land. I raise these points because I am quite satisfied that there are a lot of anomalies and misconceptions in regard to what this Act is going to do, and I would again seriously suggest that the Government should allow this measure to be postponed. The House will be re-assembling in four months' time, and in the interval we can get information from the Department, and investigate particular cases, so as to be sure that we are doing no injustice. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot allow this clause to pass without expressing my strenuous opposition to it, because this is the main clause in connexion with the proposed taxation of leaseholds. Without this clause it would be impossible to put any tax upon leaseholds. Therefore, we desire at this stage to emphasize our opposition to the whole of this additional impost. In regard to paragraph c, I first read it to provide exactly what we required, namely, that in connexion with mining leases from the Crown the value of the mineral reserved to the Crown, and leased by the Crown to individuals, would be excluded from the assessment. On further consideration of this paragraph it seems to me to be intended to mean the opposite. For. the gold-mining leases in Western Australia, for instance, only a nominal rent is paid ; I think it is about £1 per acre for a lease of 24 acres. </para>

                        <para>- No; only a nominal rental is asked by the Crown, because it is recognised that a great deal of capital has to be expended on the lease before a mine can be developed. In some instances the leaseholders make profits, but I think in the majority of instances they do not. What, then, is the meaning of this paragraph ? The unimproved value of the mining lease before it is explored and opened up is worth nothing. The gold, silver, and precious metals are reserved to the Crown, but the mining lease hands all those metals over to the lessee, and anything he is able to find in the lease becomes his own. What will be the position of the lessees under this proposed clause ? </para>

                        <para>- No. There was a royalty of 2s. 6d. per oz. at one time, but that was withdrawn. A great deal of the money earned by gold mines is paid away for wages and other expenses incurred in the carrying on of operations. Only a few mines pay good dividends. I would ask the Attorney-General to inform the Committee what the paragraph means.. The taxable value of a mining lease cannot be based on the output for preceding or  subsequent  years. The output for the current year might possibly be made the basis of taxation, but that would be an unfair basis. If it is possible to obtain any revenue from these mineral leases, that revenue should go to the States, which have incurred vast expenditure in the development of the mining industry. The Commonwealth is now imposing a tax which the States have not imposed, because they know that, although there are some productive leases, mining as a whole is a struggling industry. If it is the intention of the Government to exclude the value of any minerals that are reserved to the Crown, that point should be made perfectly clear. I shall do my best to defeat this clause imposing taxation upon the Crown leases of Australia. We ought not to judge the proposal according to its effect on any particular State, because in some States there is very little leasehold ; we should judge it by its effect on Australia as a whole. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government would be wise to accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Grey that the Bill should be withdrawn until inquiries can be made as to the effect the proposed taxation is likely to have upon the lessees throughout Australia. The interjection of the Attorney-General that, if the wild dogs depreciated the land to such an extent that it retained no taxable value, such land would not be taxed, was, in effect, saying that if the dogs did not attack the leaseholder the Labour party would, and if the dogs had left anything of value in the land the Labour party would collect it. Parliament was wise in exempting certain leasehold properties from the original land tax, but this measure proposes to bring all those properties into the dragnet of taxation. Are we to regard this as an admission that the tax is not intended for the bursting up of estates, but only for the raising of revenue ? The majority of the rank and file of the Labour party have in their minds the idea that this tax will make available to the people land that is at present locked up and, incidentally, will bring revenue to the public treasury. The Land Tax Commissioner holds that all taxation assessed against an individual is charged on the whole of his property, and no part of the  charge  can be allocated to any one property. A man owning a freehold property of the value of, say, £20,000 a year on which he has to pay taxation, and having in addition leasehold property on which this tax will operate may find himself in difficulties as a result of the drought and this further impost. He may decide to dispose of his leaseholds in order to meet his liabilities, but, by the decisions of the Land Tax Commissioner, and also according to the provisions of the Act, the land-holder will be prevented from disposing of his leaseholds until he pays up the whole of his liabilities. It seems to me that it will be a hardship on quite a number of property owners and leaseholders if they cannot realize on their holdings, because this taxation legislation ties up the property. I hope the Government will see their way clear to see that such leaseholders are not debarred from realizing on portion of their holdings, simply because the Land Tax Act provides that all those holdings shall be assessed as one property. The Prime Minister is making good his promise to the country that Australia's last shilling would be spent in defence of the Empire, but, unfortunately, he is taking that last shilling out of the pockets of one class and leaving untouched the great mass of the people. Every one is only too anxious and willing to do his or her share towards bearing the burdens imposed upon the finances of Australia at the present time, but this taxation is seeking out one section of the community who are being hard hit by the drought and by the falling off in their production. In that way it is a double tax. The land-holders have come nobly to the assistance of the Government, and the House was informed this morning that the pastoralists in Queensland had given nearly 900 horses to the Expeditionary Forces. In addition to that they offered to equip a complete regiment to go abroad to fight the country's battles. Now the Government comes along with these taxation proposals, which exploit, not only the resources of private individuals, but also the revenues of the States, whose financial difficulties at present are, perhaps, even greater than those of the Commonwealth. The proposed taxation will depreciate the value of Crown lands held by  lessees.  In Queensland about 94 per cent, of the area of the State is still unalienated, and very large tracts of country are held by lessees, the leases being subject to periodic reappraisement. This tax must depreciate the  value of those leases. I hope that, if the Government will not withdraw the Bill, it will at least accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Grey, and postpone its further consideration until Parliament meets in the New Year, when we shall be in a better position to know what effect its imposts will have on the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. -  I can understand honorable members objecting to the clause, and to the Bill, on the ground that the proposed tax will not yield much revenue to the Treasury, but I cannot understand the argument that the taxation of Crown leases is inequitable. The parent Act and State Acts attempt to tax interests in private leaseholds, and to allocate between lessor and lessee the taxable value of property, and why should the tenant of the Crown be in this matter in a position different from that of the private lessee? </para>

                        <para>- And so do others who have studied the question for a long time. The honorable member for Grey seems to think that the assessment will either produce injustice or prevent revenue from being obtained. If the Commissioner is going to assess much above the rent of the lessees and to make the tax a rack tax by placing his economic value much above the rent paid to the Crow, he will produce injustice that will bring about com plaints. I am not particularly influenced in my consideration of this question by the formula on which the Government relies. I say from acquaintance with many of the leasehold interests in my State, which, it is true, are not so large as those in other States, that in nine cases out of ten the lessee will assess the value of his property for taxable purposes at the amount which he pays in rent to the StateWhatever the duration of his lease may be, he will argue that he has made a fair compact with the State, and that, having undertaken to pay a rental of Id. an acre, or whatever the amount may be, he is paying the full value of the land. Then the Commissioner will have to determine whether the lessee's self valuation is a fair one. If the Commissioner makes an assessment which is very much higher than the rental, there will be trouble and injustice in some cases. On the other hand, if he does not, there will be little or no revenue for the Commonwealth. I do not think that section 29, exempting Crown lessees, should have been inserted in the principal Act, but I do not think that the present proposal will benefit toe Treasury much. It is a case of much cry and little wool. </para>

                        <para>- Experience will show that it will depend largely upon the discretion of the Commissioner whether the principle can be applied with justice in individual cases. I cannot see my way to vote for the continuation of an exemption which, on the ground of high policy, I think should not have been granted. The taxation of mining leases will be found somewhat difficult. The States have attempted such taxation, but not with complete satisfaction. As the Bill stands, it is plain that in assessing the value of a mineral lease the value of the minerals in it which are reserved to the Crown are excluded, the assumption being that all other minerals must be included. </para>

In other words, the Crown taxes the value of mineral deposits passing with the right to mine them to private individuals or corporations who have leased the land in which they lie. I am not sure that that is not right.

                        <para>- The average assessor in dealing with a property which was not yielding any return would say that, judging by results to date, it had no taxable value; but that could not be said of the big properties owned by the mining companies at Broken Hill and Newcastle and some other places, where huge sources of wealth are taken from the bowels of the earth to enrich private individuals. That wealth ought to be as taxable as if it lay on the surface. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; if the minerals were not reserved to the Crown, but passed with the lease to the lessee. These huge deposits of minerals are the gift of God to the nation. Like the land itself, they are for the sustenance and support of the whole people. I do not think that they should pass to private individuals without the Crown having the right to tax them. The fact that they lie below the surface does not alter matters. We tax freely enough, indeed, much too freely, everything lying above the surface, and the fact that wealth lies below the surface should not give it immunity from taxation. The honorable member for Grey feared that where the same individual had freehold and leasehold property, and the value of the leasehold was equal to the rent paid to the Crown, the addition of that leasehold to the freehold might increase the taxation of the freehold. For instance, a man might have an estate in fee-simple whose unimproved value was worth £10,000. He might also be the lessee of other land whose economic value was equal to the rent he paid for it to the Crown. If it were admitted that he had no taxable interest in the lease, how could the possession of the leasehold increase the taxation of his freehold ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that either term sets out exactly what is apparently in the mind of the Government, but that used probably gets closer to it than does the word rack-rent. You try to get the full-use value of the land under conditions in which you can use it. You try to assess it, and to see if there is any difference between that and the rent which the lessee is paying to the Crown. If there is, then the Commonwealth declares that to be the taxable interest that it is assessing at that particular stage. </para>

                        <para>- Let us assume that the rent is 99 per cent, of the economic value of a particular lease. One per cent, is added to the taxable interest of the freehold or leasehold interest of the owner in other respects. I do not think the Ministry would be justified in holding up the present session in order to affirm this principle. It is, after all, largely the affirmation of a principle which they seek, and they will not obtain very much revenue from it. </para>

In that case there will be no re-appraisement by the State Department for three and a half years. Meantime the Commonwealth steps in, ascertains the taxable interest, and taxes it in respect of the three and a half years' period. But when the next reappraisement is due, the State gets level, so to speak, with the Commonwealth. It says, in effect, " Up goes our rent to the full economic value," and then out goes the Commonwealth as the authority taxing that particular interest. </para>

                        <para>- Whether the period is long or short, the Crown, as represented by the State, will say, " We will not let this revenue drift indefinitely into the Commonwealth Treasury. We shall put up our rents to represent the economic value," and the Commonwealth taxation will be affected accordingly. This proposal does not seem to me to touch the question of land settlement. There can be no desire of an earnest character on the part of the Ministry to effect their dispersal policy by means of this addition to the principal Act. I quite agree with those who represent the back country that in nine cases out of ten these leasehold areas cannot be settled in any better way than they are at present. Having regard to the opinions expressed by representatives of Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, it is doubtful whether there will be any form of closer settlement on many of them in  our  time. Even if railways were pushed into such country, they would not in some cases lead to a higher form of production on these leaseholds. It is therefore idle to try to secure the incidental effect of dispersal from a tax on leaseholds in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. We had an experience some- little while ago in the North-Western District of Victoria, to which I shall refer. We had there what to us seemed very extensive leaseholds, although, compared with some leases in the larger States, they were not big. We came to the conclusion that it was time that we had a better form of settlement in "Ned's Corner," as we call the country to the west of Mildura and on the South Australian border. We therefore cut up the leases on a totally different principle from that previously followed. We expected to push out the larger lessees and to bring in a number of smaller men. </para>

                        <para>- We had a number of favorable conditions, because all the leases, as we cut them up, bordered on the Murray, and there was a prospect that railways from South. Australia or Victoria would be pushed out and would serve that part of the country, at all events for stock purposes. Notwithstanding this favorable conjunction of prospects, however, we were disappointed. We did not secure any fresh tenders worth talking about, and eventually, when we let these areas in a number of small leases, the conditions secured were no better than those which first obtained. That probably will be our experience in this stage of development all over Australia, at least so far as the less thickly populated parts of the Commonwealth are concerned. But even if the Crown, through the Commonwealth, could effect a better form of settlement, any attempt in that direction would be an interference with State functions. I believe that the States are tackling this problem and doing the best they can with it. They know more about local conditions than we do, because they are in closer touch with them. In other words, they are the best custodians of land settlement interests at this particular stage of our national development. </para>

                        <para>- One honorable member opposite, who is unofficially attached to the Government - the honorable member for Gippsland - crossed the chamber and voted with the honorable member for Darling and his colleagues on this side of the House. This need not be a party question. It is one that is susceptible to a difference of opinion, but it has always appeared to me that a mistake was made - and I say this with the greatest respect to the legislators of those days - when they embodied section 29 in the Principal Act. But with the amendments which this Bill will make I think not the weight, but certainly the area, of land taxation throughout the Common wealth will be more equitably spread.I do not wish it to be thought that, because I speak in this way, I support the land tax proposals of the Government generally. I think that their proposals to tax at this stage, and at the rates set forth by them, are burdensome and wrong, but if they are to go on they should go over the proper area, and not merely over the freehold interests hitherto taxed. </para>

                    <para>. - There are two points which deserve the attention of the Attorney-General. One of them is highly technical, although very important, and the other is of a more substantial character. In the first place, the effect of this provision, introduced into the Act as it now stands, will be to make the lessees under future pastoral or agricultural leases liable to pay on the whole freehold, fee-simple value of the estate without any reduction in respect of the rental payable to the Crown. With regard to leases hereafter existing section 27 governs the position. It provides that the owner of a leasehold is to be deemed the owner of the fee-simple. He will not be able to deduct any rent payable by himself to the Crown. The section declares that - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">That does not apply. Then sub-section 3 is intended, I think, to get him out of this difficulty, but it does not do so, because it says that - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Notwithstanding anything in this section, where the owner of the fee-simple of the land is exempt under section 13 of this Act from taxation - the lessee of the land is to be taxed as if his lease were created before the Act. Then, under section 28, it would be merely an assessment of his leasehold estate. The highly technical point which the Attorney-General should take into consideration is that sub-section 3 does not apply at all to these cases, because the Crown is not included under it. Where the owner of the fee-simple of the land is exempt under section 13, then the next section is to apply. But the Crown is not the owner of the fee-simple. Section 13 exempts the Crown, it is true, and most of the other exemptions are exemptions of the fee simple; but the owner is not the owner of the fee-simple until there has been created an estate known as the fee-simple. Therefore, this would not have any effect. The difficulty can be got over by a simple change of words. As it stands, the Crown is not the owner of the fee-simple, and, therefore, the actual effect would be to make all future leaseholds the subject of this tax without any reduction for the rent payable by the Crown. </para>

A pastoral lease only authorizes a man to occupy the surface for pastoral purposes, and, of course, reserves to the Crown all rights in regard to metals and minerals under the surface. But, according to the method prescribed, the Commissioner is directed to take, not the unimproved value, but the full value of the whole of the land, including all minerals and metals under the soil in which the tenant has no right at all, and from that subtract the value of the rent calculated actuarily. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Where a - tenant has such rights he ought to be taxed on them, but not otherwise. The object is, of course, to tax the actual usable interest which the tenant has. If we turn to the definition of the unimproved value we find that it means the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such _ reasonable terms as a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> seller would require. The fee-simple of the land includes not merely the right to occupy the land for pastoral or agricultural purposes, but the right to all minerals and metals under the soil. The Commissioner, under the clause as it stands, would be obliged to say, in the case of a lessee in Queensland, for instance, "My duty is to find what is the value of the land, including all minerals and metals - everything from the centre to the sky." </para>

Let us take the case where a pastoral lease is granted over land known to be auriferous in parts. The valuer, if this direction is left as at present, is bound to take the value of that land - to take the whole value of it, as known to possess auriferous deposits - as the basis of his calculation, and subtract from it only the rent on an actuarial basis which the tenant pays. </para>

                        <para>- I am not telling honorable members what I think is desirable, or arguing for the policy. We all desire to attain the same end, namely, the full value of the leasehold interest; and I am endeavouring to show that a direction is imposed which will not enable us to arrive at that end, but a totally different one. The Court, for instance, in hearing an appeal from such a valuation, would say, " It seems a strange thing, and probably it was never intended by Parliament, to tax this man on a value based on an auriferous deposit known to exist under his lease." My only object is to find a way in which the measure of a lessee's interest may be the actual, and not an absurd, measure. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely. I have no doubt that in a great many cases the valuers would reject such a conclusion as absurd, and one that Parliament never intended ; but that does not exonerate us from the obligation of giving directions that can be strictly obeyed. I suggest an amendment of the proviso as a means of getting over the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I have considerable doubt as to whether mineral leases should be included in a general system of land taxation. The general principle on which land taxation is based is that land is in the nature of a monopoly, permanently possessed, and that owing to the increased value given by the efforts of the community the States should derive some portion of it. The principle in regard to mining leases is quite different. A mining lease is a wasting property, a possession given to a man to use and exhaust. The value of a mine has no accretion of unearned increment. A mine does not stand in the same position in regard to the principle of land taxation as the occupation of ordinary land in the city or in the country. </para>

                        <para>- Means of communication and transport are of importance in regard to nearly all mines, and this fact should be regarded in assessing their valuation. The principles of unimproved land values taxation are not to anything like the same degree applicable to any mining propositions, and they are not at all applicable to precious metals. The State gives away property which is to be exhausted during the operation of the lease, and, therefore, .there is no reason for the application of the principles of land taxation. As a matter of practical policy, mining operations are purely speculative. It is almost impossible to ascertain an estimate of the value of metals not yet investigated. </para>

                        <para>- That is my view. But at the same time I think that the taxation of mining propositions, at the present juncture, would be imprudent. We are not really taxing a monopoly. The State makes a rough estimate of the royalty or rent it gets based on the probabilities of successful mining for precious metals, and our .taxation would be imposing a handicap on an industry which, being purely speculative, would bie very liable to be affected in the extent of "its operations by any additional burden we throw upon it. I do not hold very strong views on the matter, but I make the distinction between the two things, and I think that we should be careful before imposing any additional burden on the mining industry. </para>

                        <para>- If the contention of the honorable member for Flinders is correct, that the clause, as drafted by the Attorney-General, provides that a man who takes up a pastoral lease is to have the value of the lease calculated on the speculative mineral value, in my opinion it is absurd. I do not know how any valuator can arrive at the speculative value of any minerals that may be contained in a pastoral lease. But if the view taken by the honorable member for Flinders is correct, the clause should be amended. </para>

Where there can be clearly no intention of defrauding the revenue, the section should be given a wider scope. Relief is granted where an estate is vested in a trustee in severalty, even though not actually parcelled out, but is still held in trust; but in more than one case the Court has determined, in the case of intestacy, that the best interests of the widow and children would be served by carrying on an estate as one estate, instead of realization. I do not propose to debate the main principle of leaseholds, except to say that the view which has appealed to me in connexion with the broader principle of taxation of State leaseholds is that the State has reserved certain lands to itself ; and the leaseholders of those lands have been tenants and caretakers, exercising police  authority  over those estates. In some instances the letting of these lands at low rentals is something in the nature df a reward for police services performed ; but arbitrary conditions in respect of vermin and preservation are very often imposed, which are a factor in determining the leasehold value. If the Federal authority comes in and taxes those interests, the people will not take the same responsibility on the land as caretakers as they have done previously. </para>

                    <para>.- Admittedly, the issues raised by this Bill are complex. On the other hand, it has been received in a most unusual spirit. I think it is the first measure of taxation in regard to which there has been such a happy disposition of members, so that we seem to have arrived at the golden age, in which party is forgotten, and each man speaks out of the conviction that is within him. I fear, however, that there are certain reservations in the minds of honorable members which leave us very much as we were in all essentials. I wish to reply very shortly to the honorable member for Wannon, who raised a most important question in regard to the position of beneficiaries in trust estates. I quite admit that there may be cases in which hardship will arise, or has arisen. Where a great estate has been cut up into such relatively small parts that the interest accruing to each beneficiary is in itself so small as to be fairly entitled to come under, the lowest rate of tax, it frequently happens that, owing to the manner of assessment, the estate is assessed at the higher rate. The question is a difficult one. We must not open the gates too widely; but when- the House meets again an amendment of the Land Tax Assessment Act will be introduced making certain necessary improvements in the machinery, and I promise the honorable member tit at in tha- interim th&amp; matter he has raised will be carefully looked into. If possible, the Government will introduce such an amendment as he suggests, or, at any rate, the honorable member will be given an opportunity of introducing an amendment. </para>

                <para>The honorable and learned member for Flinders has invited the attention of the Committee to certain highly technical and extremely interesting points. I can best serve the purposes of the Committee and of myself by stating at once that these matters will be most carefully looked into. But I am of opinion that the honorable gentleman's contentions in regard to section 27, and the non-application of sub-section 3 of that section to lessees under the&gt; Crown,, must fail. At the same time, the suggestion which he has been good enough to make to me, that wo should amend sub-section 3 by inserting after the words " where the " the words " Crown or," so as to remedy any ambiguity in the term of " ownership," which might exclude the Crown, will be looked into carefully, and, if the position be as "the honorable gentleman has stated, an amendment will be proposed in another place. In regard to the other point, as to how far the definition of unimproved value covers, or ought to cover, mineral rights, I say no more than that the term " unimproved value " is one which is already well settled. It has been current in the economic world for half a century. If anything is well known and definite in meaning, what is connoted by the term "unimproved value" surely is. </para>
                <para>That  being so. I cannot for a moment accept his contention that there must be ambiguity as to the rights conferred by pastoral leases, and as to how the value of that form of lease is affected or can be affected by the reservation or granting of any mineral rights. Unimproved value has relation only to the user,, granted by the lease-, and in the case of a. pastoral lease it is not material to the unimproved value of that lease,, whether the Crown reserves the mineral rights or not. These things are, in any case, included in the value put upon the lease. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming mora particularly to the details in a moment. In my opinion, in each case the unimproved value must be based upon tha user which the individual has, and not upon what he could have if it were extended. It is perfectly well known that the right of the pastoral lessee to mineral, rights is limited in exactly the same way. Surely unimproved value is a term that can have relation, so far as this measure is concerned, only to the rights which the individual has in the land held by him. Applying that principle now to the incidence of taxation under the measure, I desire to deal with some objections directed against it. We have been told that this tax is undiluted confiscation, and the right honorable member for Swan said that the proposal to tax leases was the last straw. I say, in fairness to a Government who are confronted with a most difficult situation, that we have a right to hear what alternative our critics would suggest. If honorable members had been in our place they would have had to find money in some way. What way would that have been ? I should like to hear of a scheme of taxation to which no objection would be raised. </para>

                        <para>- It is easy to criticise a scheme of taxation, but I never yet heard of any scheme that was not greeted by a howl of denunciation from those whom it affected. The fact remains that this tax, as part of a scheme of taxation, is on the whole fair. It is not necessarily more permanent than any other scheme of taxation. It is open to review, and if, as we contend, the money proposed to be raised is necessary for our present purposes, honorable gentlemen ought at least to tell us how, had they been in our places, they would have raised the money, and, at the same time, trodden on nobody's corns. But on this vital matter they are discreetly silent. I read with considerable interest a criticism in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> this morning, which seems to embody the very quintessence of, shall I say, the venom of honorable gentlemen's criticism. That article attempts to' show the -effect of this land taxation. It is full of inaccuracies and misrepresentations. If the views therein expressed are generally held, I am not at all astonished at the hostility displayed towards the measure. The article declares that a new method of assessment has been introduced. That is quite untrue. The method is unaltered. The rate of tax has been increased, but the method remains the same. This writer signs himself - I suppose on the <inline font-style="italic">lucus</inline><inline font-style="italic">a non</inline><inline font-style="italic">lucendo</inline> principle - " John Jolly," although I imagine him to be the most miserable man on God's earth at the present time. </para>

                    <para>The new proposal provides that, commencing with a tax of Id. and l-15,000th part of Id., where the taxable value is £1, the rate shall increase " uniformly with each increase of £1 sterling of the taxable value by l-15,000th part of Id." This looks like the same thing expressed in other language, hut the difference is more than that between Tweedledum and Tweedledee - it is radical. In this new scheme, instead of each additional £1 alone canning an increased tax of l-15,000th part of Id., the presence of that additional £1 throws an additional l-15,000th part of Id. on each and every preceding £1. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That statement is absolutely incorrect, however simple and conclusive it may appear to the gentleman who penned it. It contains two quite inaccurate assertions. In the first place, the existing tax does not proceed by l-15,000ths of Id., but by l-30,000ths of Id., and the increments under the proposed tax will not affect each preceding £1. </para>
                <para>It has been pointed out, however, that on £75,000 the increment of tax, calculated by the proposed formula, would be lid. upon the last pound of £75,000. This was not intended. I therefore propose to alter the formula, substituting l-18,750th of Id. for l-15,000th, which will make the increment of tax exactly 9d. in the £1 at that point. </para>
                <para>Honorable members have spoken of the tax as confiscatory - a hard expression, which should not be used unless it can be based on solid fact. But no attempt has been made to support this charge by recourse to the facts. The actual effect of our proposal can be best seen in the examples set out in the following table : - </para>

                <para>It is to be remembered of an estate whose total unimproved value, adding the exemption, would be £20,000, the improved value would be probably at least £40,000. The rate of tax upon such on estate would be 1 4-5th and the tax payable £112 10s. Therefore, on the great body of large land-owners, the tax will press very lightly, and will be much less than most of us pay to the municipal authorities. I should be very pleased if my municipal taxation were at the same rate. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. I come now to the principles on which the taxation of leasehold is based, and in particular those which must guide the Commissioner in determining the value of mining leases. In my opinion, no difficulty should arise in regard to any, even the latter, the same rules applying to freeholds and leaseholds generally. As to mining leases, the honorable member for Parramatta has stated that output must be the main factor in determining the value of a mining lease. No doubt output is one factor, but not necessarily the main factor. The principles upon which the value of such as lease should be determined I conceive - and the Commissioner agrees with my view - to be as follows: Regard must be had first to the value of the mineral contained in the property, so far as that can be ascertained. Next we must consider the output of the mine and the amount of capital invested in it. The output will determine the period in which the ascertainable quantity of mineral in the land will become exhausted. Cost of production, including depreciation, interest, and so on, must then be borne in mind - that is, the cost of bringing the metal to the surface, wages, cost of superintendence, and other charges. The cost of production, allowance being made for the amount of capital invested, must be deducted from the value of the ascertained mineral average or actual output, the total ascertained or estimated value of the mineral contained in the lease being, of course, considered, and the rent and royalty, if any, paid by the lessee to the State under the lease. We thus get at what the lease is worth to the lessee. The taxable value of the leasehold estate is then easily determinable. Shortly put, the position may be thus stated : A lessee pays rent or royalty, or both. When royalty is paid in addition to rent, it must be added to and regarded as part of the rent. Deducting from the value of the lease as ascertained from the quantity of mineral contained therein and accessible, the capital necessary to develop the land, the interest upon it, the cost of production, and the rent paid to the Crown, we get at the unimproved value of the lease. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Flinders suggested an amendment so that the reservation of mineral rights to the Crown would apply to all leases, and not to mining leases alone. I shall look into that suggestion, and see if it can be adopted. I desire only to say, in conclusion, that the principles embodied in the principal Act have been in no way altered by this Bill. The rate of tax has been increased, but the method of taxation is unaltered. It does not, as alleged, go back over the whole of the estate any more than it did before. The effect is to increase the rate on each particular £1 of taxable value from £5,001 to £75,000, from which point a flat rate of 9d. in the £1 is being imposed, instead of 6d. in the £1 as before. I have already given concrete examples of the effect of this tax. As for the equity of taxing leaseholds, it is generally admitted that the principle of taxing the difference between the rent paid and the economic rent is a fair one. It is contended, however, that it will be difficult of application. Whilst I do not deny that, I hold that in practice many of these difficulties will disappear. Very many leases, for example, will in the very nature of things be outside the scope of this measure. In the first place, all leases the unimproved value of which is less than £5,000 will be outside the scope of the Bill. If we are to accept the statements of honorable members opposite as indicating the value of leases generally, very few will come within the scope of this measure. It follows, therefore, that, if their own arguments be sustained, this tax will affect very few. Those to whom it will apply will be very large lessees, who have a very valuable estate, which is, to all intents and purposes, a freehold. The difference between freehold and leasehold is largely a question of degree. Some leaseholds are as valuable as freeholds. And, certainly, there is no real and substantial difference so far as the right of the community to tax them is concerned. I trust that the Committee will agree to these proposals, and will allow me, in due course, to submit the necessary amendments. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to the Attorney-General's very interesting speech, and desire now to put before the Committee one or two considerations. It appears to me that the honorable gentleman has indicated only some of the difficulties that are likely to crop up in the application of this principle under the machinery provided for by the Bill. The only comforting assurance we have had from him is that he proposes to review the entire machinery by the time that we meet again. The honorable gentleman says that the only difference being made is one of assessment; but the machinery which is provided for one form of taxation may be oppressive and quite inadequate when applied to another form. </para>

                <para>One difficulty that I foresee is that the Government, all through, are setting up two valuators in respect of the same piece of land. If the Attorney-General has ever known two different authorities to agree upon the same tax, he has met with a great rarity. There begins the difficulty. It is a difficulty connected with the ego, with human nature, and which leads to all sorts of inequalities. Under our present method of taxing, valuing, and leasing, it is rarely that we find two men agreeing as to the valuation of a piece of land. In our case, however, we shall be "top dog." What we say will be law. </para>

                        <para>- We should have truth and justice and perfection. The honorable gentleman himself should be perfect; but he is not. Our difficulties will only begin when we have two taxing authorities in respect of the same piece of land and the same lease. </para>

                <para>My position in relation to the whole system of taxation now proposed may be briefly stated. I do not agree with my honorable friend that had we remained in power we should have had to propose some other form of taxation. My position is that this taxation is not necessary for the ordinary purposes of government - that after the Government had financed their war expenditure as they were proposing to finance it, and as we should have assisted them to do, this form of taxation for ordinary purposes of government would be totally unnecessary. That is the ground I take up. It is not, therefore, a matter of logic with me, although it is evidently with my friend, the honorable member for Balaclava. T listened with great interest to his observations, and had we been in a school of political economy I should have greatly admired them. He said, for instance, that, inasmuch as we were taxing freeholds up to 9d and lOd in the £1, therefore we must tax leaseholders to the same extent. </para>

                        <para>- It is this differentiation in assessment that is causing half the land grievances to-day; and to the differences that we find now between the valuation of different leases, will be&gt; added a difference in the valuations of the same leases. Many of these variations in the valuations are due to local circumstances and conditions, and are made for good State reasons; and by. means of the proposed taxation we shall take from a man the reward which the State has given him for doing some service or other. It seems to me that, under this Bill, the Commonwealth will find itself in the Law Courts half the time; and by the time the litigation is finished there will not be much left to wring from the taxpayer. </para>

                <para>Then the Attorney-General lays down a basis of assessment that I cannot accept. He says that in the case of pastoral land it is the right of user to the grazier that can be taken as a basis, and not what can be done with the land. If there is one thing more than another that is intended by land taxation to-day, it is securing the best possible use of land. The Attorney-General's argument is that if a man in the city has land on which there is a one-story building, the basis of his taxation is to be the use he is making of the land, and not the use he could make of it. As a matter of fact, in the city, if a man has a building of one story alongside the land of another man on which there is a building of ten stories, the man with the one-story building has to pay just as much tax as the other, the idea being to force him to make the fullest possible use of the area. It is idle to suppose that if there be good minerals below, a pastoralist is. only to be taxed on the surface or grazing value; because it is the actual or full value of the land that is the basis. The effect oF t'ae Bill will be that where a State, for reasons of its own, is charging a man only the surface value of the land, our valuator will be able to go and fix what is the real value of the land above and below. We shall have two entirely different assessments on two entirely different bases; and I can foresee a merry time for the High Court. But really, it seems to me idle to discuss the details of taxation of this kind at the present time, because it is absolutely unnecessary. With prudent management of the ordinary public expenditure' we should have been able to do quite well without this mean3 of raising revenue; and I tell the Treasurer that, when the year's end comes, he will find that he has not been able to spend this money, by over £1,000,000. This Bill means an unnecessary, unjust, and unfair impost on a section of the community, who, in times like these above all, require sympathy and forbearance. Of course, we have been promised a new Assessment Bill when we meet again, to remedy all these machinery troubles which have already arisen. According to the Minister of Trade and Customs, the only deficiency in the Customs revenue this year will amount to £1,500,000; and yet it is proposed to aid revenue by over £4,000,000 in order to balance the ledger. To meet the deficiency there is already £1,200,000 surplus; and yet it is proposed, by the taxation measures now before Parliament, to raise £2,800,000 extra. </para>

                    <para>. - I fail to see the force of the arguments of those who have preceded me, because the action of the Government at the present juncture is only that which justice and equity demand. Rightly or wrongly, we, two or three years ago, enacted a system for the progressive taxation of land in fee-simple, and it does not require a statesman or a logician to observe that, alongside the taxed owners of freeholds, there may be pastoral lessees who escape scot-free. </para>

                        <para>- The Board can  only  do so subject to an Act of Parliament. They are not superior to Parliament. When a drought or a partial drought affects any State, there is generally an agitation from leaseholders that they are paying too high a rental, and they must have a reduction. They generally get a reduction, and in many instances they are entitled to it, but they do remarkably well in good seasons. Of course I am not complaining about that. Although I am the representative of a big centre of population, I know something about the pastoral leases of South Australia, and I know that men who go out and work that portion of the Commonwealth are entitled to what they make. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not gather from the Attorney-General what he proposed to do in the matter of taxing mining leases. There are in Western Australia certain timber leases which run for periods of from fourteen years to twenty years, and pay a certain rental, but .are not re-appraised. These timber leases give great employment, encourage the settlement of country, and open up avenues of trade, and the State thinks that it gets its value out of them in that way. In the case of pastoral leases in Western Australia, many of them have fourteen years to run, and at the end of that period the leases are terminated subject to payment for improvements. The timber leases simply permit the lessees to take off the timber. There is no right to the soil. To propose to alter the Bill at the present stage would be of no avail, and would be inconvenient, but I ask the Attorney-General to consider what effect this legislation will have on timber leases, pastoral leases, and mining leases. To tax them heavily would be a serious matter, because in many instances the leaseholders do not pay dividends, and where they do they have to pay a State dividend tax. Of course I disapprove of the whole principle of taxing these leaseholds, but I. merely ask the Attorney-General now to make a note of this matter. </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General has said that when the House meets next year he will introduce another Assessment Bill. I ask him whether he will add certain words to the definition of " absentee " which will remit the tax on land purchased by people who are not able to come to Australia for twelve months or perhaps two years. These people should not be treated as absentees. They have bought the land here, and if they were actually present in the Commonwealth they would not have to pay any tax, because they would be covered by the exemption. The Treasurer, when speaking last night, regarded my suggestion favorably. We should not treat these would-be settlers in a hostile way by imposing this taxation upon their holdings. The revenue we gain by doing so is practically nothing, and the imposition of a tax in this way might cause us to lose settlers. </para>

In other words, there are only 3,340 assessments above £10,000. On page 13, the Commissioner states that there were pending or unsettled at the time at which the report was made, 1,027 appeals, only four of which had been put down for hearing.

                        <para>- The Commissioner gives in columns the number of appeals withdrawn, pending, settled, and set down for hearing, and of 1,027 pending, only four were set down for hearing. By reference to pages 33 and 34 of his report it will be seen that fully 80 per cent. of the assessments affect estates of an unimproved value of £10,000 or less, and the presumption, therefore, is that there is a similar percentage of the appeals pending, and in which a sum not exceeding £35 is involved. In many cases the amount involved would be only £3 or £4, or less. At the present time it is impossible for a taxpayer to get an appeal heard, however small the sum involved, without incurring great expense. In one instance which came under my notice, a land-holder whose tax came to £28 a year brought the matter before the Court, and, losing his case, had to pay £800 in costs. I think that in that case the Court arrived at its valuation in a manner which was wrong, but the result is that, although there are many taxpayers in the district who consider that they are suffering grievous injustice, not one of them dare appeal to the Court for a remedy. No doubt, when the Act was passed, it was thought that the appeals would concern only very large estates, and in the first place all appeals had to be made to the High Court. As a matter of fact, however, the sum involved in a great, many instances must be very small. Much larger sums are often involved in municipal and shire valuations, but appeals in regard to such valuations can be heard by police or stipendiary magistrates, and the same provision might well be extended to appeals in regard to. the Commonwealth land tax. When a man is suffering an injustice facilities should be provided for an appeal to a Court without incurring enormous expense. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will accept the amendment. I have not endeavoured to provide for an altogether different kind of Court. The Commissioner of -Land Tax suggests arbitration, but where small sums are involved it would be cheaper to have appeals dealt with by police or stipendiary magistrates than to go to the cost of appointing arbitrators. </para>

                    <para>. - Obviously, on the representations put forward by the honorable member for Richmond, the Act needs amendment, and, assuming the case to be as he. has said, I agree with him that greater facilities for appeal should be given to the taxpayers. That the sums involved are often small is not to the point; the taxpayers have a right to speedy justice. Still, I ask the honorable member not to press the amendment. I shall discuss the matter with the Land Tax Commissioner, and if I find that the facts are as the honorable member has represented them to be, or in any degree approaching it, an amendment of the Act will be proposed in due course to provide greater facilities for appeal. I do not know yet whether stipendiary or police magistrates should be appointed to hear appeals, but if, as the honorable member for Richmond has said, appeals from valuations under Local Government Acts are heard <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> those magistrates, there seems no reason why appeals from valuations under this Act should not also go before them. When the House meets again, and the Amending Assessment Bill is introduced, a clause will be drafted to deal with this matter. </para>

I was successful in consequence of representations made to me by gentlemen in my electorate in getting a Court appointed, but they have been very sorry about it since.

                <para>This report was published on the 26th June last. The Attorney-General and his Department have been approached by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who has pointed out the injustice under which taxpayers are labouring; but from June last to the present time the Government, although they are now amending the principal Act, have taken no steps to remove this serious cause of complaint. In New South Wales alone. 718 land tax assessment objections are pending. I think I am well within the mark in saying that not half-a-dozen cases have been dealt with in that State. What chance, then, have land-owners who, in accordance with the demands made by the Commissioner, lodged their extra assessments, amounting, in some instances, to several hundreds of pounds, to secure the determination of their appeals ? Some of these cases have been pending eighteen months, and during all that time landowners have been deprived of the use of this money. No step has been taken by the Crown to set the appeals down for hearing. What possibility is there of their being dealt with, and justice obtained, within an early date? Honorable members opposite have always advocated the principle of conciliation and arbitration. Apart altogether from industrial arbitration, we have in the Telephones Lines Purchase Act provision for the settlement of claims according to the arbitration laws in force in the different States. </para>

                        <para>- Surely my honorable friend is not going to say that, for that reason, conciliation and arbitration should go by the board. If the Labour party are consistent in their advocacy of the principle, then they must vote for my proposed new clause, which will enable the people concerned to secure justice in a speedier and cheaper way than is now possible. Instead of having the subject-matter of their appeal inquired into by a Court of law sitting in a city where witnesses have to be brought from a considerable distance, at heavy expense, and where the Court sits for only five hours a day, we should have, under my proposal, a ready means of settlement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ferguson has said that he would like the assistance of assessors to guide him and to render it unnecessary for him to take a little off the Crown value and to slightly increase the valuation of the appellant with the object of arriving in that way at an assessment. What speedier way could be devised in dealing with an appeal than that proposed by me, that the Crown should appoint an arbitrator, and that another should be appointed by the appellant, both being practical men, and that they 'should °meet on the ground, bring their expert knowledge to bear, and decide upon a proper assessment? It would be unnecessary for their expert knowledge to be conveyed, as at present, through a conduit pipe into the mind of a learned Judge in order that he might come to a decision. They would meet on the ground, and, having made an inspection, would say to the appellant, " John Brown, your tax is so much and you must pay it." If there was any difference of opinion between them they would call in a third party, and his decision would be final. Having had considerable experience of valuations and of resumption inquiries, I say, with- all respect to the honorable member for Richmond, that my proposal is better than that advocated by him, although I recognise ,lab in eases where the tax does not exceed £40 or £50 police magistrates should have power to deal with them, and that if it were adopted an end would be put to the heartburnings prevalent amongst land-owners to-day. I press the Attorney-General to say whether there is in this proposed new clause anything opposed to the principles which he advocates, or to the contention of the Commissioner. If the Government believe in the principle of conciliation and arbitration, then what better or speedier method can they suggest for dealing with the appeals which are now pending? I ask the Attorney-General to consider this proposal apart from party politics. If it be accepted, I am satisfied that many of the present-day troubles of the Land Tax Department will be cleared away, and that pending appeals will be settled at a very early date. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member' is in effect putting forward an alternative method to that which the honorable member for Richmond proposed to extend. Without committing myself in any way to the principle which the honorable member desires the Committee to adopt, I promise that I will look carefully into the matter, and see to what extent the principle of arbitration can be usefully adopted in this connexion. More than that I cannot say. At the present time I am not disposed, nor should I be asked, to accept the proposed new clause. It is our intention, as I have already said, to bring in a comprehensive Bill to remedy a great many weaknesses which experience has exposed in the law as it stands. This- matter will be looked at. The principle of arbitration is, of course, not new, and there is no material reason why it should not be applied to this particular case, if it is found, on examination, to be expeditious and cheap, and a substantial improvement on the existing method of determining appeals. I ask the honorable member not to press the matter at this stage. </para>

We all deplore the absolute impracticability of appeals in matters of this kind, and the immense expenditure incurred; but I cannot help thinking that both the proposals which have been made this afternoon would involve, if not quite as great expense, at least expense of a kind which ought not to occur. The greatest expense in connexion with any form of appeal, no matter what the tribunal may be - whether it be a High Court Justice, a District Court Judge, a police magistrate, or arbitrates - is that relating to the presentation of evidence, to the calling of witnesses, and the whole procedure of what is practically a judicial tribunal. I would suggest to the Attorney-General that, instead of the appointment of arbitrators, whose function it would be to hear evidence and to decide upon it, he should consider the practicability of enabling the taxpayer concerned 0 to appoint a valuer and the Crown to appoint another, subject to the condition that if they could not agree upon a valuation an umpire should be appointed. A great improvement would thus be effected in the present system. The essential difference is that under such a system we should get rid of the judicial procedure of calling witnesses, and so forth; and that we should have thrown upon these  independent persons, as experts, the obligation of arriving at their own values. If they could not agree upon the valuation to be placed upon the property, it would be for the umpire to make a settlement. The only way in which it is possible to avoid the great expense attendant upon any formal appeal is to do away with what is called the judicial procedure of these appeals, and to try to substitute for it some mode by which the parties could have independent valuations made and be made to abide by the result. </para>

                    <para>.-I do not know whether the honorable member for New England realizes the fact that there is more than one system of arbitration in the several States. My own experience is that legal or judicial determinations by arbitration are not greatly less expensive, but very often more expensive, than judicial proceedings by way of appeal. I confess I have a good deal of sympathy with the view put by the honorable member for Richmond. My belief is that the solution of the difficulty will ultimately be found in the appointment of special magistrates. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether that would prove the cheapest or the most expeditious, but it would certainly be better than the present plan. It is intolerable that these cases should be mounting up in the way they are, for it amounts almost to a scandal. I know from experience that the solution will not lie in appealing to the arbitration laws, as we have them here, nor in the creation of judicial arbitration tribunals which are so vastly different from our industrial arbitration tribunals in which we desire to get rid of all that circumlocution and delay incidental to ordinary judicial proceedings. I hope that the Attorney-General will sympathetically consider the suggestion of availing ourselves of the services of special magistrates. </para>

                    <para>. -There is much to be said for both the proposal of the honorable member for Richmond and that of the honorable member for New England. The former might be applied to cases with a limit of £10,000, and the other to cases over that amount. From my experience, living in the country, as I do, where we have appeals on shire rates and so forth, a great advantage is found in having the cases heard locally, where the witnesses are. There could be as many Courts as there are country towns and villages, and justice would be practically brought to the very doors of the appellants. I am very glad that the matter is being taken up as it is by honorable members on both sides. I have had private conversations with honorable members supporting the Government, and I know that they are quite in accord with both the proposals that have been put forward. I hope the Attorney-General will give the suggestions his sympathetic consideration. </para>

                            <para>- The detailed provisions of these Bills will be explained by the Attorney-General, who is better acquainted with the technicalities, but we might reasonably consider the point as to whether the estates of persons who are fighting the battles of this country should be taxed. I think that they should be exempted. They are taking exceptional risks on the battlefield, while we are stopping at home. Whereas those who remain at home should be called upon to bear the full tax, those who are at the front should, in my opinion, be exempted. </para>

                        <para>. - In this measure there is no great principle such as that underlying land-values taxation. We are confronted with a tax that is admittedly imposed for revenue purposes. The basis of the taxation is not novel; it is a. form of taxation included in almost every modern fiscal system. All the States of the Commonwealth have adopted it, though such is the diversity among the systems adopted by them that any attempt to base the Commonwealth tax upon the foundation of the State systems is impossible. The tax has been so arranged that estates below £1,000 are exempt. It starts at 1 per cent. on estates over and above £1,000, and runs up to 15 per cent. on estates over <inline font-style="italic">£70,000.</inline> In many of the State systems the point at which the highest maximum of taxation levied upon probate, succession, or estate administration falls is £20,000. In New South Wales, according to information I have read, the rate goes up to 15 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The point at which the rate reaches the maximum differs in almost every State. In Queensland the maximum is 10 per cent. on estates of £20,000 and upwards, but the duty is reduced to one-half when the successor is the wife or husband or the lineal issue of the predecessor, and double when the successor is a stranger in blood to the settlor; that is to say, the rate is 20 per cent. on estates of £20,000 and upwards where the successor is a stranger in blood to the settlor, 5 per cent. where the wife or husband or the lineal issue inherits, and 10 per cent. when the successor is a brother or sister. In Victoria the maximum is reached at £20,000, when 10 per cent. is charged. Where the total value of the estate after the payment of all debts does not exceed £2,000, half rates are charged in the case of property left to the widow, children or grandchildren ; but where the estate is over £2,000 no special consideration is extended. There is no consideration for persons who are relatives except the widow or children or grandchildren. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is quite right. I now have the Act before me. Whereas for strangers the rate is 10 per cent. on all estates that exceed £20,000, for the widow and children it only reaches 10 per cent. when the estate exceeds £100,000. Section 16, paragraph e, of the Victorian amending Act says : - </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by going over the whole of the conditions which apply to the probate and succession duties in the various States. I may briefly say, however, that they differ very widely, and that in the majority of cases, if not in all, a lower rate of duty is imposed in the case of widows and children, and also in some States in the case of brother and sister; whilst in most cases, if not all, a stranger in blood pays a higher rate than widows and children. </para>

                            <para>- I have some figures here, but I do not know that I can regard them as reliable for our present purpose, because, in Great Britain, there are other estate duties besides probate and succession. <inline font-style="italic">Whitaker's Almanack</inline> for 1914, at page 414, sets out that " in the case of every person dying on or after 30th April, 1909, where the principal value of all property, real or personal, settled or not settled, passing on the death of such person exceeds £100," the duty shall be 1 per cent. The rate then increases till at £100,000 it is 9 per cent., and at £1,000,000 15 per cent. As I have already remarked, however, there are . other duties payable upon  estates of deceased persons which must be taken into consideration in this connexion. I desire to now deal with the proposals in the Bill, and to explain to the House the principles upon which it is based. In every Act to which I have had access there is a distinction drawn between strangers and relatives. No such distinction is drawn in this Bill. In Great Britain, there is apparently no such distinction drawn, but I hesitate to assert that there is not some qualifying legislation. However, the fact remains that in this Bill no distinction is drawn; all parties pay alike. I may frankly say that this measure is imposed for the purpose of raising revenue. In its present form, without consideration for the next of kin, it can hardly be regarded as a model measure of taxation. It is not contended that it is so, but it is contended that it is a measure which raises revenue with the least possible disturbance and hardship on those who are called upon to pay. There are the usual provisions for the lodging of objections and appeals, but the portion to which I particularly wish to direct the attention of honorable members is the manner in which the tax is assessed. It is set forth in clause 39 of the Bill that - </para>

                        <para>As, notwithstanding the admirably lucid yet simple phraseology in which the Parliamentary Draftsman has robed this section, the precise intention thereof may have eluded some honorable members accustomed to a more verbose style, I will endeavour to explain it. In doing so, I am animated by the pious hope that by the adoption of an alphabetical method we may arrive with some degree of order at a happy conclusion. I begin therefore with <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> : Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> says - </para>
                        <para>The duty shall, in the first instance, be apportioned among all the beneficiaries in proportion to the value of their interests. </para>
                        <para class="block">Let me explain what these clear and simple words mean. We will assume that an estate of £100,000 has been bequeathed as follows: - To A, B, C, D, E, and F, legacies of £150 each; to G a legacy of £50,000; and to H the residue of the estate - that is, £49,100. Under paragraph a the legatees who receive £150 each would pay at the rate of 15 per cent., as also would G, who received £50,000, and the residuary legatee, who received £49,100. But, in order to remedy this obvious and glaring injustice, it is proposed, in paragraph 6, that the amount of the tax payable under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> by the beneficiaries whose interest does not exceed £200 shall be paid by all the beneficiaries equally. Reducing this to its lowest terms, I mean, of course, terms of general coherence, and applying it to the proposition I have put before the Committee, we find that the residuary legatee, who would be drawing £49,100, and the beneficiary who drew £50,000, and the six legatees who drew £150 each, would pay the legacy duty between them that otherwise would be paid by the whole, and they would pay that duty in proportion to the interest each enjoyed in the whole estate. So that if the duty payable by those six legatees collectively were £135, that duty would be paid in the proportion that £90,100 bears to £900, or, in other words, the six legatees whose aggregate interest in the estate was £900 would pay roughly one-hundredth of the duty paid by the two other legatees. Thus stated, the clause is seen to be lucidity <inline font-style="italic">in excelsis.</inline> It is at such moments as this that one recalls with intense satisfaction that cannot be put into words the epitaph which our dear old friend Euclid used to subscribe at the conclusion of those little problems by which he reduced us to chaos, <inline font-style="italic">quod erat demonstrandum.</inline> However, the proposition is perfectly simple, and is the basis of a very sound principle which will be easily applicable. If it were possible to introduce a diagram into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, I would represent the corpus of an estate as an oblong, and divide off a small portion  of  it by means  of  a series of parallel lines. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">This small portion would represent legacies of sums under £200. The duty would be spread over the whole estate, each beneficiary, including the legatees, paying in proportion to his interest in the estate. </para>
                    <para>This proposal finds its explanation and its justification in our present circumstances. I do not pretend that, in its present form, it ought to be permanent, though that is not a declaration that probate, estate, or succession duties will not form a permanent part of the Commonwealth scheme of taxation, I merely say that this scheme as it now stands does not take into consideration the differences between strangers and next of kin, and other differences which are generally taken into account in legislation of this kind. If, despite my exposition, doubts still remain in the minds of honorable members, I shall be glad to supplement it as the debate proceeds. </para>

                        <para>. - In my judgment, this proposal is penal, and almost predatory. The tax is unnecessary, and to impose an unnecessary tax at a time like this is little short of criminal. It is proposed to impose death duties, State and Federal, amounting to 30 per cent., a land tax of 9d. in the £1, Tariff taxation, and income tax and super income taxes "in the States ; every penny that you can rake in you are trying to take from the pockets of the people. There is no need for this orgy of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently, so long as you tax all round, you think that it does not matter what you do. In my opinion, the less you tax the people the better for them. The more money you leave in their pockets, to be spent as they please, the better for them and for the development of the country. </para>

                            <para>- It is a sound principle to pay your debts as you go on, and we can pay our debts without this taxation. The Government's Estimates are inflated; their proposals for expenditure are unnecessarily high. They will not be able, though they may try their best, to spend the money for which they are asking, and at the end of the year there will be a big surplus. Therefore, there is no need for taxation such as that proposed. It shows how little accord there is between the National Government and the Governments of the States, when the Attorney-General could not say what are the death duties in the States. </para>

                            <para>- I am not against taxation of this kind on principle. Death duties are fairly imposed on wealthy estates. But to impose a duty of 30 per cent., and thus to take away one-third of an estate at a time like this is unjust. It means that we are systematically penalizing success, which cannot be good for a young country like this. One could understand high death duties in an old land such as Great Britain, where there is a large accumulation of wealth. But, notwithstanding the millions of capital that have been accumulated there, the rate on estates over £100,000 is not more than 9 per cent. The rate proposed here is 30 per cent. on £75,000. Such an im position cannot possibly be called a tax; it is a penalty. You could, of course, impose a rate of 99 per cent. and call it a tax, but that would be a misnomer. If there were some overpowering urgency - if we were fighting a life and death struggle against some foe, and our resources were strained to the uttermost - this proposal might be justifiable, but under no other circumstances. A young country should be careful how it taxes the capital necessary for the development of its lands, and should not impose predatory and confiscatory taxation. Fair and reasonable taxation is justifiable. But the proposed taxation is not justifiable. The war is being specially provided for, and there is no need for special taxation to cover our ordinary outgoings. I, therefore, do not stop to inquire how the legatee, or any other beneficiary, may be affected ; those are all secondary considerations at present. This taxation is unnecessary, and therefore .it would be unjust to impose it. </para>

                        <para>. - We should have appreciated the humorous exposition of the Attorney-General were it not that the subject-matter is so grave and serious. I do not think that honorable members opposite have thoughtfully considered this proposal. The introduction of a land tax aud an estate duty in conjunction amounts to a severe penalty, and is bound to have a disastrous effect on the introduction and investment of capital. Honorable members opposite do not realize the far-reaching nature of this legislation. Our desire should be to encourage the inflow of capital, and to give every reasonable inducement to its investment here. When measures of the kind before us are introduced, that timid bird is liable to be frightened away. I say this because my business associations cause me to realize how keenly proposals of this kind make themselves felt. The Attorney-General's speech made it evident that the Government have not given any comprehensive consideration to this measure, because its predatory provisions completely outdistance anything and everything of the kind in the way of taxation within the British Empire. We find that the probate and estate taxation of the Mother Country is of a nominal character compared with the taxation for which this Bill provides, more especially when we take into consideration the fact that similar taxation exists in the several States. The rates of estate duty payable in the Mother Country are as follow: - Where the principal value of the estate exceeds fi 00, and does not exceed £500, 1 per cent. ; exceeding £500, and not exceeding £1,000, 2 per cent.; exceeding £1,000, and not exceeding £5,000, 3 per cent. ; exceeding £5,000, and not exceeding £10,000, 4 per cent.; exceeding £10,000, and not exceeding £20,000, 5 per cent.; exceeding £20,000, and not exceeding £40,000, 6 per cent.; exceeding £40,000, ' and not exceeding £70,000, 7 per cent.; exceeding £70,000, and not exceeding £.100,000, 8 per cent. Compare these rates with the proposal now before us. In the case of an estate exceeding in value £70,000, this Bill provides that the duty payable to the Commonwealth alone shall be 15 per cent. In addition to that, there is 15 per cent, payable in New South Wales, 10 per cent, in Victoria, and 20 per cent, in Queensland and Western Australia. The position will be that in some of the States where the estate of a deceased person exceeds £70,000, there will be payable something like 35 per cent, of the amount left by the deceased. In other words, something like 35 per cent, of the estate will be appropriated by the Commonwealth and States concerned. In the Mother Country, instead of 35 per cent, being payable in such a case, there would be payable only 8 per cent. Let us go a little further. In the Mother Country, where the value of an estate exceeds £100,000, and does not exceed £150,000, the rate is 9 per cent.; where it exceeds £.150,000, and does not exceed £200,000, the rate is 10 per cent.; exceeding £200,000, and not exceeding £400,000, 11 per cent.; exceeding £400,000, and not exceeding £600,000, 12 per cent.; exceeding £600,000, and not exceeding £800,000, 13 per cent. ; exceeding £800,000, and not exceeding £1,000,000, 14 per cent. Where the value exceeds £1,000,000, the rate is* 15 per cent. Where the value exceeds £70,000 in the Commonwealth, the same rate of duty, namely, 15 per cent., is payable to the Commonwealth Government over and above the duty payable to the several States in which the estate happens to be. I ask my honorable friends opposite to seriously consider the confiscatory character of the proposals now before the House. I do not for one moment suggest that they deliberately intend that they should be so ; but they should realize that they cannot introduce legislation of this character without doing infinite injury to the general welfare of the community. In the Mother Country the death duties are seven in number, namely, the estate duty, the settlement estate duty, the legacy duty, the succession duty, the probate duty, the account duty, and the temporary estate duty. All these are in force ; but, apart from special circumstances, the general duty payable on an estate is that which I have already quoted. Where certain settlements have occurred there are payable certain amounts  in respect of the property affected by those settlements, and where legacies are specially devised, there is a certain amount payable by the legatee. In other cases duties of an alternative character are imposed. But, speaking broadly and generally, the corresponding death duties payable in the Mother Country would be exactly the duties I have quoted. There is one point that I would specially emphasize. In nearly all the States, in the case of widows, children, and grandchildren, and, in some of the States, in respect of the brothers and sisters of the deceased person, half duty only is payable. Here no such concession is allowed. That is most unjust. Speaking from experience as a practising lawyer - and I am sure that the honorable member for Gippsland and a number of other lawyers in the House will bear me out - even the present probate duties result in grave and . serious hardship in the case of a mortgaged property. Where the property is mortgaged there is often the utmost difficulty in borrowing the probate duty that is payable. Where a mortgage exists, additional money can be raised in  many  cases only by a second mortgage; and to obtain a second mortgage with a comparatively limited margin means the payment of very heavy rates. One cannot borrow with any degree of advantage, and in many instances it means that valuable property has to be sacrificed. That is the every-day experience of every practising lawyer, and I submit that it cannot be disregarded. With the probate duties of the State superadded to these, nothing short of confiscation can result. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. The Government have succeeded in passing their land tax and other financial measures, and I would earnestly suggest to them that, in view of the unconsidered character of the present measure, they should either withdraw it, or consent to a very substantial modification. If they persist in it, they will do a class of the community grave and serious injury. I ask them to consider this matter from the practical stand-point to which I have referred. I have demonstrated that these duties, payable to the Commonwealth, to say nothing of those payable to the States, are largely in excess of those payable elsewhere. That, I submit, is a sufficient reason for a very substantial modification. In Victoria, the duty payable on an estate of die value of £70,000 is only 10 per cent, at the present time; but we have received an intimation from the State Government that it is proposed to increase it, and the probabilities are that' it will be raised to 12 per cent., or 15 per cent., so that it will correspond- with the rates in force in other States. Probate duties are essentially State imposts, and we are depriving the States of an important source of revenue. By this Bill we are adding seriously to the financial difficulties of the States. It is true that some little concession is granted by clause 39, so lucidly explained by the Attorney-General, where proportionate rates are payable; but that is a mere passing circumstance, unworthy of consideration, having regard to the larger issues which are involved. I hope that my honorable friends opposite will see their way to consider this measure in the light of the facts and circumstances that have been brought before them. I urge this from the stand-point of the general welfare of the community, and if the Government will not give a broader consideration to the matter, I trust that, at least so far as widows and children are concerned, they will grant the same concession as is extended to them by the ."States. </para>

                        <para>.- I regard this legislation more from the point of view of the Commonwealth than from that of the taxpayer. Undoubtedly a probate duty is not felt in the same way' as another tax is felt by those who pay it; but by reason of its very nature, it ought to be imposed with discretion. Those who pay a probate duty are in a position to invest their money where they will, and to. shift themselves and their money where they please. The persons from whom we are likely to collect probate duty of any real value are those who, in the evening of their days, in order to protect their children from a confiscatory tax, must shift themselves and their interests, lock, stock, and barrel, outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Not the mine, but the title. Our honorable friends opposite picture rich men travelling about loaded with gold mines and coal mines, which, by means of their unaided Atlas-like activities, they succeed in carrying about with them. The title-deeds of wealth, however, can be shifted. Almost every form of wealth is easily negotiable. In estates where heavy probate duties are payable they are almost liquid, as a rule, in their nature, and could be very easily shifted. </para>

                            <para>- If you sell a large parcel of shares as a rule they are bought, not by one person, but by hundreds. And herein lies the great danger that the Government run in connexion with a confiscatory tax of this character. They seem to be in. danger of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.We cannot put a 30 per cent. tax upon a man's property, payable at his death, without that man, in certain circumstances, wondering whether, perhaps, he is not doing an injustice to his children by failing to shift to some other part of the British Dominions. That is the position we have to face, and from that point of view I face it. It is a pity the Commonwealth has invaded this particular sphere of taxation, for obviously we cannot equalize things, taking into consideration the various charges already imposed by the States. </para>

                            <para>- We have double-banked the land taxes, and are double-banking the probate duties; and the honorable member takes credit to himself because the public are not robbed in some other way. There is only one sane way of imposing taxation, and that is to have one taxing authority. Let us find some means of taxation apart from that already taken in hand by the States. The Attorney-General has said this is the most customary form of taxation throughout the world, and that we can hardly imagine a State without probate duties. No doubt this is a very proper tax; but I challenge the Attorney-General to point to a single State where we have the Crown calling for two sets of probate duties from the same people. </para>

                            <para>- At present we are discussing the probate duties. I have no doubt that in the real Parliament of the country upstairs, the honorable member was very loud in his denunciation of the proposal before us, but in the Chamber here he can merely be flippant. I hope that by the time the Attorney-General has introduced the Bill, which he himself has admitted should be infinitely more equitable than the present one in its incidence, honorable members opposite will have realized that double-banking is very dangerous in the public interests, and that we are likely to lose revenue by being too grasping. It is a tax which, I suppose, nobody particularly minds paying, especially if he has come into a windfall; but I dare say that the representatives of those estates which are going to be called upon to pay are even now worrying about the matter, and wondering whether it is fair that beneficiaries of blood should be so levied on in this section of the King's Dominions. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to clear myself of the charge made against me by the honorable member for Wentworth, who asserted that 1 opposed my party upstairs, and in the chamber propose to give a silent vote. That is not the case, because, if there is a form of taxation in which I believe, it is that proposed by the Bill. The inherited wealth of the world is, in my opinion, responsible for more economic injustice than any other form of wealth. The idleness generated by wealth is brought about more in this way than any other, because the man who accumulates wealth is generally a useful citizen who continues to be active and doing something of benefit while he lives. I am quite alive to the fact that the leisured classes have done much for the world, that if in the past wealth had not been accumulated and enabled some people to lead leisured lives the world would not have advanced as it has. But we are living in different times to-day; and opportunity is all that most people require, and inherited wealth tends to deny this. The accumulations of wealth, handed down from generation to generation, create an idle class, who are more pernicious in their influence on society than are the idle poor. Any form of idleness is bad, whether it be the idle poor, the idle rich, or idle land; but of the three, the idle rich is the most inimical to society. I am quite prepared to concede that this does not apply all round, but in the main it does apply. I have lived long enough to come to a definite conclusion in regard to this matter; and we are only doing our duty to posterity by taking this effective step against the transmission of accumulated wealth. It is a strong man who can survive a great legacy; and I say that advisedly. In other parts' of the world accumulated wealth may have had a beneficial effect, particularly, I think I am safe in saying, so far as the British aristocracy are concerned in the past. They have developed very highly cultured scions of leading families, who have been of some benefit to the world; but, all the same, the aristocracy of England can, I suppose, afford pathetic instances of that evil influence of easily-gotten wealth. For that reason, if for no other, I support the measure; but, at the same time, the exigencies in Australia to-day warrant us in looking for revenue wherever wealth is accumulated. I do not accept the dictum of the Leader of the Opposition as to inflated Estimates, and the probability of a surplus, because, from what I can see, I should say that we shall have to exploit our resources still further and impose still more exactions in order to meet the great strain that is being made on our civilization by the war. </para>

                            <para>- I do not regard such taxation as a blessing; but it all depends on the financial position of the individual. Probably the honorable member for Echuca is in a position to stand further exactions, while most of us are not, though I venture to say we are willing to play our part. We are quite justified, apart from the economic aspect of the question, in looking to accumulated wealth for assistance in this hour of trial. </para>

                        <para>.- Most honorable members will agree that legislation of this sort should not be introduced unless under extraordinary and very urgent conditions. It is an extraordinary procedure for the Commonwealth to enter upon an avenue of taxation which has already been exhaustively followed by the States. There ought not to be any desire to hamper or injure any section of the community, and, therefore, when introducing legislation of this kind, it is necessary to show, if we are anxious to act fairly and equitably, that it is both necessary and urgent. I regard this and the land tax proposals as panic legislation, which should be avoided if possible. I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition that if this were a time of great difficulty and stress, with the enemy at our gates, and we had exhausted all ordinary means, measures of this kind might be justifiable. This Bill will place an additional tax on people who are sufficiently taxed already, and the Government have never shown in any way that it is either necessary or urgent. In fact, I say deliberately that they have not sought to do so; and the Attorney-General clearly showed that he knows nothing about the effect of this taxation - that he does not even know the burden already borne in this regard by the people in the various States. Had we been in any real financial difficulty, would the Government, in the Budget, have proposed to spend out of the current revenue of the country £2,600,000 more than was spent last year? Would the Government have proposed to spend out of revenue £1,000,000 more than last year on public works? Even had we been in financial difficulty there would be no need to spend this money out of revenue. In addition to the falling off in trade, we have the distress that the drought is causing throughout the country; and it would have been very easy to raise the required money by means of a loan, thus avoiding, as far as possible, any additional taxation. There is no justification for this extra taxation. When speaking to the Land Tax Bill, I said all that I wished to say upon this matter, and, therefore, I merely refer to it now ; but I deliberately repeat that the Commonwealth could easily have financed this year without either of these drastic taxes, and assuredly without the one now before us. We have no right at the present time to impose the extra burdens proposed in this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw it : but the foolish interjections of the honorable member are abominable. We could easily have financed this year without the drastic impositions of the duties proposed by this Government. Under this legislation, the probate tax upon the citizens of Queensland will be 30 per cent. in the case of a large estate. There is no other name for the Bill ; it is a Bill to confiscate these properties and ruin the people who own them. Not long ago a man with an immense estate died, but there was the greatest difficulty in getting the money to pay the 10 per cent. probate duty. It was only done after much negotiation and trouble. To pay 30 per cent. on an estate will unfairly injure the beneficiaries. I wish to make my remarks as short as possible, but I again wish to repeat the statement, with any authority that I can give it, that it would have been very easy to have financed this year without either of these drastic impositions. Had the late Government remained in office, it would have been done. </para>

                        <para>. - I am aware that the Government are desirous of getting the Bill through, and I shall curtail my remarks. I would not have spoken but for the bitter, cruel language of the right honorable gentleman who is of the opinion that he possesses all the brains in this Parliament, and does not hesitate to call any one who differs from him an ignoramus. I am sufficiently well acquainted with his methods of taxation to realize that the time has arrived when things should be changed. The right honorable gentle man admits that we need more revenue, owing to the terrible war. According to his remarks, he would not have hesitated at taxing tea, and kerosene, and commodities used by the workers, but he complains when we attempt to tax the wealth amassed by the man who has gone to the golden streets, to which he has bought his way, and left to some one who has never worked and who has not produced any wealth, something to which he is not entitled. For the first time in the history of the country the party representing the poor, who have always paid in the past - the workers who have always produced the wealth for the other man - are in a position to put laws on the statute-book, and they are now taxing the people who, in the past, had the making of the laws, and evaded the payment of their just dues to the country, and who now refuse to pay those just dues towards governing the country that has treated them so well. If an enemy came to Australia, who would be the first to suffer? Those with title deeds in safe deposits, or in the offices of their lawyers - the men of wealth. <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> estimates that in 1911 there were in the Commonwealth 17,794 persons with incomes of over £1,000 a year, and having a total annual income of £78,115,646. Yet these are the people who refuse to give a little bit of their wealth to the country. I think it is time that the workers recognised these facts, and time that honorable members stopped their outcry about taxing the " poor " people who will be called upon to pay this tax. I advise honorable members opposite to read the work of Townsend Martin, a millionaire banker of America, entitled " The Passing of the Idle Rich," in which he says that America is in a deplorable state owing to the idle, rich young men having so much wealth. What occurred in my own presence recently? A young man rolled into a railway carriage, and a friend greeted him, " Halloa, Jack; I thought you were in Western Australia "; and the young man replied, " So I am when I am at home; but did you not hear that the old man had 'pegged out'? I am here to get a little of the boodle." A nice thing for the old man who had accumulated the money to leave to this young fellow ! We have other idle people in Australia, but they are idle because they cannot get work, and they cannot buy the necessaries of life for their wives and families. Yet when we need revenue, honorable members come forward with the cry about the poor " who will have to pav these taxes, and they say that we do not require the money. We need every shilling of it. I hope that every shilling provided on the Estimates will be spent, and that we shall not have sums of money voted, and Ministers afterwards applying the pruning knife and coming down to the House with a heap of unexpended balances, showing them as a surplus. We know that the late  Government  sent out an intimation to officers to curtail expenditure all along the line when that expenditure was absolutely necessary for the development of the country. There was one sum of £140,000 placed on the Estimates that should have- been spent, but was not spent. Owing to the war, I am unable to refer to it. </para>

I support the measure. I am glad that it is about to be placed on the statute-book." Ninety per cent, of the people, the wealth-producers of the Commonwealth, the workers, will realize that they have at last representing them in the National Parliament a party which will tax the gentlemen who have not hitherto paid taxes as they should have done. Not having been accustomed to pay taxes, they do not like to have to pay them now, but they must get used to paying them; and if the Labour party are long enough in office they will get so accustomed to it that in the future we shall not hear such an outcry as we have had from the Opposition benches to-day. </para>

The honorable member for Swan need only point to his record in Western Australia with regard to the levying of duties generally to show that his service to the country has been good and faithful, and that his taxation was based as far as possible on the principle of ability to pay. There are one or two matters upon which I should like to have information. Beyond a statement from the Treasurer when he was introducing - this taxation that it would bring in £1,000,000, we have not been told what the tax is to yield. </para>

I do not know whether the Treasurer has looked at the operation of the Bill from the point of view of persons administering the estates and having to raise these duties. This is a succession duty on all classes of property, real estate in Australia and personal estate wherever situated, whether in Australia or out of it. Even if a man's personal property is outside of Australia, it is added to his estate, and he has to pay duty on the whole. </para>

                            <para>- But in all probability the estate will be paying duty on the personal property in some other country. It will be found that in some instances the only property a man has left is a business which is a going concern, but which after this tax is imposed may be a "gone" concern. It may be property that is vested and bringing in rent; probably the estate consists of one piece of property like some of the city estates. The difficulty will be that immediately upon death these enormous duties will have to be raised, and some of the property of these estates, whatever they may be, will have to be converted at once into money in order to meet the obligations under this tax. I think that the Attorney-General will find that the drastic provisions of the measure will cause considerable hardship to legatees. One clause which is satisfactory is that allowing an extended time m which people may raise the requisite money to pay the duty. But I ask the Attorney-General to consider the advisability of even extending that time so as not to allow any hardship to arise from compelling any estate to raise money, probably at an inopportune time, to pay the tax. Suppose during the next twelve months a person dies, and any of the assets of the estate have to be realized ; to compel their realization in unfavorable markets will mean" a great hardship to those who inherit the succession. If the Attorney-General can extend the time allowed in the Bill for making payment of the tax he will be "doing a benefit to the people affected, and at the same time will be conserving all the revenue he hopes to raise by this means. Seeing that the tax is so exceedingly high, I ask the Attorney-General to look with a favorable eye on any suggestions that may be made in Committee. In the State of Queensland there is not only a succession duty, but a probate duty as well. In addition to the succession duties, 1 per cent, probate duty is payable on estates having a net value of £300. </para>

                            <para>- And 1 per cent, in probate duty as well. In Queensland an estate will have to pay 21 per cent, to the State, and 15 per cent, to the Commonwealth, which makes a total of 36 per cent. Suppose an estate of £100,000 is invested and is bringing in income; death takes place, and the executors suddenly find themselves in the position of having to raise cash to pay 36 per cent, on £100,000, which will be an exceedingly difficult problem for them to face, judging by cases that have been brought under my notice. That aspect of this taxation was brought to my attention by a person with considerable interests, who pointed out how harshly this legislation will operate if prompt payment to the Treasury is required. Another feature in this assessment which differs from that in the States is this: Suppose a man like the late" <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Francis</inline> Ormond or some other wealthy man dies and leaves large amounts to religion and charity- </para>

                        <para>.- Believing as I do that extra taxation is absolutely necessary at this period, I shall support the second reading of this Bill. We must remember that all the Governments of Australia, apparently with the approval of the people, have decided that they will not curtail public works during the present year, but will keep tilings going as well as they possibly can, in order to prevent the unemployment problem being intensified. In view of that' fact, it seems absolutely necessary that extra taxation shall be imposed. If I believed that further taxation was not required, I would oppose this, or any other, taxation scheme. But, believing the additional revenue to be required, I see no objection to the principle involved in this Bill. It applies to all kinds of property alike, and it begins with a very low exemption of £1,000. Undoubtedly, when added to t'ae State probate duties, it will be a very heavy tax, but we have to realize that these are exceptional times, and money has to be obtained somehow for public purposes. At all events, this form of taxation has the advantage that it will not be taking away from a person that which he possesses, but will be simply deducting something from an estate before  the legatee  receives his share. One thing I should like to impress on the </para>

                    <para class="block">Attorney-General is that I see no reason why we should depart from the principle laid down in all the State Acts, namely, the making of a reduction in the duty payable on estates left to widows and children. Property that passes from a man to his widow and children stands in a different position from that which passes from him to a stranger. That has been recognised in all probate taxation measures up to the present time, and this Parliament ought to recognise it also. In the original Victorian Act a reduction to the extent of one-half was made in favour of the widow and children, but in the Act of 1903, No. 1815, which was introduced, I think, by the honorable member for Flinders, the difference between the duty payable by the stranger and the widow and children was reduced. </para>

                            <para>- That was the case in Victoria up till the time when the amending Act I have spoken of was passed. If a reduction to one-half is considered too great, I think we should at least allow the widow arid children to escape with a payment of two-thirds of the tax collected from the stranger. We all recognise the duty a man owes to his widow and children, and we realize that they have a prior claim on his wealth to that which a stranger has. The honorable member for Darling Downs dealt with the question of forfeiture. I think this Bill seems to have been based On the Land Tax Act rather than on an ordinary probate machinery Act, and some of the penalties are too severe. There is one provision which, I think, will require to be altered. That is clause 24, which gives the Commissioner power to, within three years after the last payment on account of duty, make alterations in or additions to the assessment. I think he should be required to make his assessment as quickly as possible, because that provision will make the executor afraid to distribute. I admit that subclause 3 contains a provision that the administrator shall only be liable for an increased payment of duty to the extent of the property then under his control, unless, owing to fraud or negligence on his part, the proper amount of duty was not paid in the first instance. The administrator may fear that his action would be construed into negligence, and hang on to the estate until the three years had expired. I think that provision will require to be altered. However) taking this Act as a whole, and having regard to the necessities of the time, I think we can cordially support it. At the same time, I shall vote in Committee in favour of a proposal to allow estates passing" to widows and children to escape with the payment of a lower duty than that paid on estates passing to strangers. </para>

                        <para>. - I cordially indorse the last remarks uttered by the honorable member for Gippsland in regard to an indulgence to widows and children. In the legislation of all countries they have been regarded as standing in quite a different position from those to whom property  comes  more or less as a sort of windfall, and who have no claims of relationship or rational expectations which are defeated by a drastic tax of this nature. But I cannot follow the honorable member in indorsing- this tax as one called forth by the extraordinary exigencies of the present moment. This is not a war tax. In the first place, I do not suppose that any Government would be so bereft of reason as to impose a tax for the purpose of meeting the obligations of a sudden calamity that has fallen on the whole of the people, a large portion of the burden of which tax would fall on the estates of the few rich people who happened to die during that particular period. Such a thing as that would not recommend itself to any Government. The Government have themselves admitted that this is not a war tax. The Leader of the Opposition attempted, to define it as a war tax by limiting it to the duration of the war, but the Government opposed that proposal, and by so doing they deprived themselves of the argument which followed from the extraordinary circumstances in which we are now placed. The tax must be regarded, as the Government ask us to regard it, as one plank in the Labour party's general platform. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Attorney-General has left us in such a position that we cau only regard the tax as a fulfilment of the Labour party's general platform. Indeed, a Commissioner is appointed for a term of seven years. With a good deal of the argument in support of succession and estate duties I am, and always have been, in accord. I agree that even a fairly heavy burden upon estates passing at death is, perhaps, less keenly felt and less 'injurious in incidence than any other tax. As was mentioned by the honorable member for Gippsland, when I was faced with a great financial difficulty in Victoria some years ago, I was responsible for the introduction of what was one of the heaviest probate and succession duties in the British Empire. </para>

                            <para>- No. The tax still remains in force; but its extreme limit of 10 per cent, on estates of £100,000 is low compared with the proposal to place a duty of 15 per cent, on estates of £70,000. I am afraid that this estate duty, together with the land tax, is the outcome of a false doctrine, which honorable members opposite have been diligently inculcating into their political supporters, namely, that accumulations of capital are injurious to the working people, that capital is the enemy of the worker. Capital has been figured as a kind of vampire, which sucks from the working man the wealth that his labour' creates. We hear statements to that effect in the political speeches which honorable members make from the platform, and read them in the political prints of the Labour party.  </para>

                            <para>- I do not. say these things to irritate honorable members. I am not using' words of abuse. I am merely stating what we all know to be true. The theory which counts for a vast deal of the support which honorable members opposite get in the country is that the labouring man has' to fight against the capitalist. Instead of the relation between them being that of seller and buyer, of dealer and customer, as it really is, he is told that no accumulation of wealth of any considerable magnitude can come about without the robbery of the poor. </para>

                            <para>- We all admit that capital is acquired in some cases by methods which both law and morality condemn. Capital acquired by pure  speculation is acquired merely, by gambling, and capital acquired by methods not unknown to some of us is little different from the proceeds of a robbery. But what I assert, and what honorable members opposite deny, is that the accumulation of capital which takes place in the ordinary course of the growth and development of the country is necessary to enable the ordinary working man to obtain a fair return for his labour. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member objects to the capitalist. I respect a candid and .honest opinion, even though I may not agree with it. We all know that the honorable member for Dalley is a believer in the doctrine of Syndicalism. He has admitted that on more than one occasion. He thinks that the accumulation of capital in the hands of private persons is contrary to the theory which would work out the salvation of the world. I do not agree with him, and I do not think that most members of his party agree with him in that. These Bills give effect to the false doctrine that if you can pare down the wealth of the rich man, you have so much wherewith to increase the wellbeing of the poor. There never was a falser doctrine. How would this proposal work out? Everything is a question of degree. A maximum probate duty of 10 per cent, would be a very hurtful thing to a country if other countries had no such duty. When there is a high probate duty in one country, and a low duty in other countries, a flow of the life-blood of industry, that is, capital, is caused from the former to the latter, and the natural flow of capital from countries where it is plentiful to countries where it is scarce and badly needed receives a check. Sub-clause 3 of clause 13 endeavours to impose estate duty on all the personal property, wherever situated, of persons domiciled in Australia. The Government recognise, of course, that there is no way of attaching real estate in other countries; but personal property, including that over which there is a general power of appointment, is taxable wherever situated. I do not suppose that there is any absolute constitutional bar to this Parliament any more than the Parliament of Great Britain, Canada, or South Africa taking the extraordinary step of seizing the citizen who has property in other countries and squeezing from him taxation on that property. Such legislation, however, is not usually considered within the province of the Parliament. I should not like to pronounce an opinion on the constitutionality of the proposal before us; it may not be unconstitutional, but it is certainly contrary to the ordinary principles whereon friendly Governments base their taxing operations. </para>

                            <para>- The propriety of double income taxation has been discussed over and over again, but such taxation is altogether different from the taxation under consideration now. It would have been infinitely fairer to meet the extraordinary difficulties caused by the war by compelling us all to pay income tax. That would have been better than the taxing of a small section. This  enormously  heavy impost, when added to the burden of taxation imposed by the States, will provide the strongest lever that can be used to prevent Australia from having that share of the floating capital of the world which she needs for the development of her resources. Apart from the unfairness of the proposal under discussion, it is a most imprudent one from the point of view of the workers. We are likely to have very soon a larger army of unemployed than any of us would wish to see. We hope that this unemployment will not last long, and that 'it will <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> be great. But the imposition of a tax like this will make the difficulty greater. I know that nothing we on this side may say will produce any effect upon honorable members  opposite,  but it is our  duty  to enter our protest against what to me at least appears to be fraught with extreme peril to the country. It appears to me that honorable members opposite are using the extreme peril of the Empire as an excuse for forcing on the people of Australia some of the most drastic and radical planks in their political platform. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall say only a few words, because the case against the tax has been put very ably by the honorable member for Flinders. The imposition of a tax of this kind to meet the huge deficit staring us in the face is a proposal that every honorable member will agree to. Having said that, 1 feel that the responsibility rests with us to see that the tax is not continued beyond the necessities of the war. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">As soon as taxes are imposed upon capital, the capitalists immediately cast about for a means of avoiding them. An English Court has declared that no man is entitled to evade the law, but that a man is entitled to avoid the law, and the first thing that a capitalist sets about is to find a way in which to avoid the payment of taxation of this character. He is entitled to do that, and, in the process of doing it, is apt to injure, not the beneficiaries in his estate, but the men who are imposing the taxes, and who think that they are injuring him. The honorable member for Flinders has given a very clear illustration of what the effect of taxation of capital is upon the inflow of capital into a young country. This is a country in which we require considerable capital to develop our resources. We have vast natural resources in Australia, requiring huge amounts to be spent upon their development. Who is going to come here with a capital of, say, £70,000 - and that is a small amount to develop some of the big copper-mining propositions of Australia - to carry on such an enterprise with the knowledge that life is uncertain, and that, if he should die in the process of developing these works, the Commonwealth will come down with a 25 per cent. impost by way of death duties ? </para>

It is such men who build up the country, and the more we have of them the better for Australia. Take the case of a man with £70,000 - the minimum amount at which the maximum tax applies - and who has ten children. That amount, without any deduction in respect of taxation, will give them £7,000 each. That is not a huge sum for a man to possess. Many of the poor men on the Government benches, who claim to represent the working classes, own more than £7,000 worth of property. </para>

                            <para>-I could pick out a few honorable members opposite whose cheque for £7,000 would be readily cashed. This tax, superimposed upon the State tax, means that, out of an income of £7,000 derivable by a child from the estate of its parent, there would be deducted, by way of taxation, £1,750. That is a tremendous tax to place upon an estate, even although the child inheriting it has not made the money. </para>

                            <para>- It is an exorbitant tax, and will naturally cause men with money to seek to devise a means by which to avoid it. What means will they adopt? They will start at once to make settlements upon their children. I am referring now to those who cannot leave the country, and who have all their interests here. By dividing their estates, while they are living, among their children, they will avoid the payment of the tax, and it is probable that when the time comes for them to shuffle off, the State will get less from their estates than it would have got if we had imposed a moderate tax. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. A man who has money to invest, knowing the burdensome annual charge that is imposed here by way of income tax. and knowing also that something like one fourth of his estate is going to be taken by the Commonwealth at his death, will hesitate before he invests money in this country when he can get equally good security elsewhere. In America, where there are huge and vast accumulations of capital which provide safe investments, much Australian capital will be invested, and will thus evade this tax altogether. </para>

                            <para>- One thing certain is that, whether the honorable member has heard it before or not, he will see the effect of this tax on the revenue which he expects to be collected from this source, and he will see big organizations of capital depart from this country, instead of entering into enterprises that would provide employment for the working classes. There is one man certain of a good job under this Bill, and that is the Commissioner of Taxation, who is to be appointed for a term of seven years, so that his position is secure. That is the only provision in the Bill from which we can gather anything as to the intention of the Government. The Government have not said that this is a war tax. If they had, I might be prepared to say, " Well, if it is the best you can do, it might be justifiable in time of war." But when I find the Government providing the machinery for the collection of this tax long after the war may cease - I think that every one of us hopes that it will cease long before seven years have passed - then I recognise that they are not going to deal fairly with those who have accumulated money. </para>

The honorable member for Denison made a statement that was evidently intended to tickle the ears of the groundlings. He said, with a great flourish of trumpets, in the style of the honorable member for East Sydney, " What do you think of 17,000 people drawing between them £70,000,000 a year as income in Australia?" That seems an enormous sum, and the honorable member's interjection suggested that there were a certain number of vultures sucking the very life-blood out of Australia. But £70,000,000 divided by 17,000 is exactly the basis upon which the Labour party have created the position of Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The salary which that officer receives is the amount at which we arrive by dividing £70,000,000 by 17,000. It is equal to an income of about £4,000 a year, but, from the statement wrapped up in the inimitable style of the honorable member for Denison, one would think that these men were drawing an outrageously large income. Another peculiar statement made by the honorable member for Denison was that gentlemen who had never paid before would be made to pay now that the Labour party were in power. I do not know of a civilized country where a probate duty is not in operation. The honorable member for Flinders, who preceded me, pointed out that one of the heaviest probate duties in the British Empire was that imposed by him, when Premier of this State, during the drought and 'the depression that prevailed here some years ago. That was a permanent tax. Would the honorable member describe the honorable member for Flinders as a leading light of the Labour party? </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. The standard of living in Australia seems to be about as high as in Canada. I have had some personal experience of Canada, and whilst there did not see a man out of work. Although there was an enormous stream of immigration flowing into the country, every man who arrived there was being absorbed at wages averaging $5 a day. This would show that the prosperity of Canada was on a higher plane than that of Australia at that time. </para>

                            <para>- There never has been a Labour Government there. I am referred by the honorable member for Denison to a little official record entitled <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Statistics,</inline> and issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> but the figures put a totally different complexion on the position as represented by that honorable member. We are told in that table that the number of persons earning above £200 per annum is 114,000, and that they earn £62,000,000. It will be seen that that line includes the whole of the figures that follow in the table, because if a man earns £5,000 a year he is certainly earning more than £200 a year, and, therefore, he is amongst the 114,000 people. </para>

                            <para>- We are told in this record that the details as to those who earn under £200 per annum are not known, whereas the details concerning those above £200 are known from the declarations made to the Income Tax Commissioner. When we come to reduce the number of persons by increasing the income, we find that those earning over £300 a year number 57,000, and that they earn £52,000,000. Those earning above £400 a year number 25,000, and they earn £41,000,000. I am, of course, omitting the odd figures. Those who earn above £750 per annum number 15,000, and earn £35,000,000; and these figures come out at little less than half the amount mentioned by the honorable member for Denison. Clause 53 of the Assessment Bill contains, I think, the most drastic penalty that could possibly be imposed for evasion of an Act of Parliament. A trustee or executor might have a prejudice or a grudge against the beneficiaries under a will, and could deprive them of any benefit by seeking to evade the law, because the penalty is a fine of £500 and treble the amount of the duty due, or forfeiture of the estate. Surely such a clause is an outrage. It is not the person who leaves the money by whom the law is evaded, but by some one acting in a fiduciary capacity. </para>

                    <para>.- I have compared the provisions of this Bill with many of the provisions of State Acts, and I find that they are mostly verbal adoptions of the States Statutes. For instance, clause 3 is almost a copy of the South Australian section. I do not think that we should appoint a Commissioner for a fixed period of seven years as provided for in clause 5. </para>

                    <para>. - The Senate has requested, in line 14 of the schedule, we shall strike out " fifteen-thousandth," and insert in lieu "eighteen thousand seven hundred and fiftieth." The same amendment is consequentially requested at two other places in clause 2, and at three places in clause 3. These amendments have been proposed by the Government in another place in order that the rate of tax on estates of over £75,000 shall not exceed 9d. Formerly, under the formula which appeared in the Bill, the tax was very nearly11d. The amendment reduces it to 9d., and the net effect of that is that on an amount of £75,000 the rate of tax will be less than 5d. I move - </para>
