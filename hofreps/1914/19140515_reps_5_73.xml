            <para>- Speaking from memory, in November last I was informed in an official despatch by the LieutenantGovernor of Papua that certain charges had been laid regarding the irregular recruiting of natives, and were to be the subject of investigation. 1 went into the evidence that had been collected up to date, and communicated with the LieutenantGovernor on the subject. An inquiry commenced, I think on the 3rd December, and a number of witnesses were examined, but as the evidence on some points was incomplete, the inquiry was adjourned, the investigation being protracted and delayed because the party against whom the charges had been brought was absent from the Territory on leave, granted, I think, because of ill-health. In the end certain charges were found by the Executive Council to be established. The magistrate charged was in effect found guilty of misconduct and negligence in connexion with the recruiting of natives, and was removed from the service, though the necessary Order in Council was not drawn up and passed until this month. I assure the House and the public that every effort will be made; when the smallest suspicion of harsh treatment of the natives reaches the ears of the Administration, to investigate it, with a view to preventing any abuse. </para>

              <para>- When the question was asked I could not remember the actual number of natives that were connected with the charge of illegal recruiting. I asked that the papers might be lookedup, but owing to the fact that the natives cannot count beyond the number of their own fingers - that when dealing with any larger number they use such general words as &#34;plenty boy&#34; - the exact number is not shown. It may, however, be stated with some accuracy, I believe, that the total number of natives concerned is something like forty, though charges were laid in respect of about 100. The moment the suspicion arose that anything improper existed in connexion with the recruiting an order was given that the natives might go back if they chose, but I think that only three or four left. The total in relation to which the charge was sustained was about thirty. Inquiries are still being made as to whether it will be necessary to deal with the cancellation of tha agreement. </para>

        <para class="block">Every honorable member who was in the chamber at the time, will agree that that is a grossly exaggerated account of what took place; I might even characterize it as a lying statement. The journal in which it appears was convicted, on the unanimous resolution of a State House, of wilful and profligate lying. It has little or no influence in the district which I represent, and I believe that the more it abuses me the greater the number of votes that I shall get. Therefore, it is not considerations of personal interest that move me to make this statement. I made it to draw attention to the extreme lengths to which a journal with party bias will go to inflict injury on the members of this Parliament. This class of report does more to degrade the House than anything else I know of. There was a certain amount of amusement in regard to pillows, all, or nearly all that took place, being conducted with the utmost good humour. I have not taken part in any previous all-night sitting in which there was so much good humour as prevailed on Wednesday night. </para>

        <para>Mr.FENTON. - I am certain that the honorable members for Gippsland, Richmond, and Bourke, as well as others, will admit the accuracy of the statement that I am now making. If anything sensible or reasonable takes place in this chamber, the most limited report is given to it in the daily newspapers; but, should anything of a trivial nature occur, it is exalted and a mountain made of it. I enter my protest against this reporting of political party papers, and the attempts to damage, not so much the personal honour and standing of any particular member, as the reputation of the House. </para>

          <para>- Since my name has been openly mentioned, I think it well to state what took place, so that the facts may be put on record. The honorable member for Richmond did not violently remove a pillow from under the head of the honorable member for Dalley. I crossed the chamber in defence of the honorable member for Richmond, to prevent other honorable members from doing him an injury. I saw him forced back on to the bench, and a blow struck at him, without hitting him. I had no hold on the honorable member for Maribyrnong, and no desire to assault him. Both of us were bent on the same mission, that of preventing the disturbance which would probably have occurred otherwise. </para>

I have received a note from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> representative assuring me he was in the gallery when the episode occurred yesterday. That statement is supported by another representative of the press, who was also present. I do not wish to do this gentleman an injustice if he was attending to his work. I can only say that, when I glanced at the gallery, I saw only one man there. I am not prepared, however, to say that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> representative was not there; and, as he has assured me that he was in the gallery at the time, I accept that assurance. </para>

              <para>- There is nothing in our Standing Orders providing for the asking of questions without notice. The Standing Orders deal with notices of motion. Questions, without notice, are permitted as a matter of courtesy, and not of right by the House, but should at once cease when the Ministry have intimated that no further questions will be answered. Questions, without notice, should relate only to matters of urgent public importance, and it is entirely within the discretion of Ministers as to whether or not they shall be answered. When the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, has announced that it is not intended to answer questions without notice, no public purpose can be served by persisting in putting them. Such questions, when not answered, are not reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the putting of them, after it has been announced that they will not be answered, can only delay public business. </para>

              <para>- As the ruling you have just given, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> is a most important one, I desire, on a point of order, to ask you what standing order, authority, or practice lays it down that the Prime Minister can speak for all Ministers as he has just done ? I desire also to ask you whether your ruling will apply to all parties who have an appointed leader. If the leader of any party announces that no member of that party will answer questions, may no questions be put to the members of that party? The point I wish to make is that Ministers must individually decline to answer such questions. </para>

              <para>- I was about to say that it has been my very happy experience, so far, that the Leader of the Government in making an announcement to the House does so with the concurrence of his colleagues. I can only conclude that the Leader of the Opposition has had some less happy experience, and that this prompted him to make the statement that he did just now. In any event, I think that the matter does not come within the purview of the Standing Orders. It is one of the established practices of Parliament. It is older than any standing order, and, indeed, comes down to us from the night of time. I do not know why the right honorable gentleman should have raised such a question ; it is sufficient for me to say now that the Government will not answer any more questions without notice until those on the businesspaper have been answered. That, I think, is a fair position to take up. It is only a consideration for the value of the time of the country and the necessity for conducting public business that prompts me now to make this announcement. </para>

              <para>- With regard to the first point raised by the honorable member for Wide Bay, under the Standing Orders questions are not asked of private members except in certain specified circumstances. This question has already been settled under our own practice, and exception should have been taken to the  first decision given if there was any objection to it. Last session Ministers refused to answer questions without notice, and I then pointed out that it would be futile to continue to ask questions without notice when the Prime Minister had intimated, on behalf of his colleagues, that no such questions would be answered. An intimation of that kind, as I explained a few days ago, when I again ruled on the matter, was really an announcement that if honorable members desired any more information they must place their questions on the notice-paper. I would remind the House that, in the House of Commons, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has intervened in certain cases, and has disallowed questions on his own responsibility where he has thought that an unfair number was being put. He has even stopped the asking of questions on notice when he has thought that they were so long or so numerous as to be calculated to obstruct the course of business. I have extracts before me on the subject from the House of Commons&#39; debates, and Speakers&#39; decisions on the point, but one I think will serve as a sufficient illustration. In this case <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Redmond</inline> desired to ask a question. He said - </para>

          <para>These were not only questions without notice, but questions put on the noticepaper. Questions without notice are rarely asked in the House of Commons.

            <para>That is not a question of order at all.

              <para>- No one should know better than the honorable member for Kennedy what is the practice. The arrangement of the business-paper - except as I have already stated - is certainly in the hands of the Government, and that arrangement cannot be taken out of their hands by the  Speaker.  The House can do it. If the House does take the arrangement of the business out of the hands of the Government, we know what that means - it means a crisis. In the case of a motion to dissent from a ruling, it is customary to place it before the Government business of the day, with the concurrence of the Government ; but there is nothing in the Standings Orders requiring that to be done. That was done with the first such notice, but the House decided to proceed with another matter on an adjournment motion which occupied the time until Orders of the Day had to be called on under standing order 119. The House itself, however, on Wednesday last, directed that Government business should, until otherwise ordered, have precedence; and the notice-paper has, no doubt, now been arranged under the authority given by that order. Personally, I should much prefer that motions relating to my rulings were disposed of at once, and I intimated that desire; but, as I say, the matter does not rest in my hands. The House has directed that Government business shall take precedence, and, therefore, under any circumstance, the leave of the House would have to be obtained in order to alter that arrangement. Whether that is so or not, it is entirely for the Prime Minister or the Government to decide whether they are prepared to set aside the time necessary, before Government business is called on, to deal with any question of the kind. The Government, apparently, have not thought fit to do so, and the  Speaker  has no power himself to direct that it shall be done, especially in the face of the decision of the House already referred to. </para>

The Prime Minister has indicated that neither he nor his Ministers will answer any questions without notice; yet the honorable member for Kennedy, after the  Speaker  has intimated that such questions are disorderly, and not allowed - although the honorable member himself promised, at the beginning of this Parliament, that he would uphold the Speaker&#39;s authority - is, apparently,. . encouraging that authority to be set at nought in persevering with such questions after my decision.

If I find that a question is one that should not be asked or answered, I shall myself intervene. I further remind the Prime Minister that, whereas honorable members may by notice place on the business-paper questions addressed to members of the Ministry, such a practice is not followed in the case of questions to the  Speaker.  At the same time, I draw the attention of the House generally to the fact that it is grossly disorderly to attempt to heckle the  Speaker  by a series of questions. Unless the questions are of some moment - necessary, and of serious import - I shall certainly not allow them to continue. </para>

            <para>Is Parliament to understand from the following speeches by the Prime Minister that he does not intend to place on the statute-book the many proposed laws mentioned in the statement of Ministerial policy dated 12th August, viz.: - &#34; Why should the people always be crying out for legislation? Had there not been 83 Acts in the last three years placed on the statute-book? What more could the people want? Those who were continually asking for more legislation were really worse than Oliver Twist in his demands.&#34; (See Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> 8th August, 1913). &#34; Whether Parliament would do any business remained to be seen. It had been at work for some weeks without any result, but he was not sure whether the country did not want a rest from legislative enactments. There had been 83 enactments during the period in which the Labour party was in office, but he did not know whether the country was any the better for it. The present administration was certainly not going to be responsible for a record in that direction, and he for one would not be sorry for that fact.&#34; (See Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> 23rd September, 1913). </para>

            <para>- I am afraid that I must give to the honorable member the same answer that I have given tohonorable members before. It is not part of my function to answer questions relating to purely legal opinions. I may add, however, for the information of the honorable member, that even if it were the practice for the Attorney-General of the Federal Government to express opinions as to the validity or invalidity of Acts passed by a State, it would be a highly undesirable one, and we should strongly resent the Attorneys- General of the States offering similar opinions as to whether Federal Acts are invalid. Those affected by them can challenge their validity in the ordinary way. </para>

            <para>- I do not desire to hear anything more on this point, and have no wish that an irregular debate shall ensue. I remind the Prime Minister that it is not the function of the  Speaker  to specially expedite the business of one side of the House or of the other. It would be a usurpation of functions which do not belong to the Speaker&#39;s office. It is my duty to give effect to the Standing Orders. If these are inadequate to give the Government control of the business in certain circumstances, that fact may be a very good reason for amending the Standing Orders, but it would nob be a justification for the  Speaker  to override them. The rights of an Opposition as well as of the Government side have to be equally observed by the occupant of the Chair. The Government is in charge of the business of the House. The  Speaker  is concerned only with seeing that the Standing Orders are carried out, and the proceedings of the House conducted in conformity with them. Beyond seeing that the Standing Orders are observed, he has no right to attempt to facilitate proceedings in the special interests of any party. So far as I can facilitate the transaction of business by enforcing the Standing Orders I have endeavoured to do so. I had already called on the Orders of the Day when the Prime Minister rose to this point of order. </para>

The Prime Minister himself has contributed to the consumption of time by raisingpoints of order even after I had told the  Clerk  to read the Orders of the Day. If the Standing Orders are inconvenient to either the Government or any section of the House, then it is for the House to say whether they shall or shall not be amended, but I can deal only with the Standing Orders as they are. </para>

              <para>- It has been worn threadbare by both sides of the House. The question at issue is extremely simple, and must appeal to the common sense of not only honorable members, but the whole of the citizens of Australia. I therefore shall not occupy, on this occasion, more than a few minutes of the time of the House. The purpose of this Bill is to crush at its very inception the introduction of the spoils system into the clean political life of Australia. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that no Government shall use, behind the back of Parliament, the power of public employment as a means of giving preference to its own political supporters. It is to ensure that so far as the administration of the public funds and the public departments of the Government is concerned, all citizens of Australia, whether they bear or do not bear the union brand shall stand in the same rank. What is the position of honorable members on the other side? They find themselves compelled to uphold a principle which they cannot justifv either in this House or before the country, but which they dare not abandon. Like Sinbad they carry on their shoulders an Old Man of the Sea whose weight is continually increasing, and yet they cannot get rid of him. I have only the ordinary man&#39;s knowledge of whatgoes on at those meetings which govern the Labour members of this House - I refer not to their own meetings, but to the meetings of their masters outside, but I think I am right in saying that the principle of preference to unionists in Government employment was never made a plank of the Labour party&#39;s platform. I think I am right in saying that, before 1911, the year in which the principle was adopted by the Labour Government, no conference of the Labour party had ever gone to the extreme length of demanding this concession from their political agents. I shall go further, and tell honorable members opposite that from the whole of their conduct and actions in connexion with this matter it is plain that they would be only too delighted, if they could, to get rid of the whole thing. The loud laughter of honorable members opposite convinces me of  the truth of what I am saying. It is that kind of uneasy laugh that we hear from a man when he is told the truth about something concerning himself and does not like to hear it. They remind me of the story of the man who was convicted of stealing ducks, and who, after his sworn testimony that he was in complete ignorance of them, and after he had produced the evidence of a large number of his friends to support an <inline font-style="italic">alibi,</inline> had forced from him, when an unusually severe sentence had been passed upon him, the pious ejaculation, &#34; I wish to God I had never seen the blessed ducks.&#34; That is the position of the Opposition. They would give anything if the honorable member for Darwin, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley, had never issued the unfortunate proclamation in regard to preference. They would gladly give a great deal if that proclamation, once issued, had not received the somewhat reluctant consent of the Leader of their party. </para>

              <para>- It is quite natural that the honorable member and others should take up the position that this Bill affects the legitimate purposes and objects of unionists - that they should endeavour to cloud the whole issue in that way - because there is no other ground that they may take up. They dare not say, &#34; We claim to use the instruments of government as a means of rewarding our own supporters.&#34; </para>

              <para>- Do we not all know the form of contract into which he entered with those who wanted to obtain work in his Department? Do we not all know that he insisted that, even those who were not unionists, should go unless they became unionists in a very short time? Will the honorable member deny that? He will not. Then how can he possibly maintain that there is, in the principle of preference to unionists in Government employment, anything except an attempt to use the power of government in giving employment, and in making contracts, as a means of increasing the ranks of their own political supporters? The terms of the contract have often been made public, but the people have sometimes short memories, and I shall therefore read them again. In the form of contract made by a leading member of the late Government it was stated that approval to employment was given on the understanding that the applicant was &#34; a member of a recognised union,&#34; and that if he were not it would be necessary for him to join at once, or &#34; otherwise the agreement lapses.&#34; Is that in accordance with the idea of honorable members opposite of preference, &#34;other tilings being equal&#34;? Is it not a direct statement that they would enter into contracts only on condition that the men employed would join recognised unions whose political funds supported the Labour party in Parliament - whose funds were used to return the members of the party to Parliament? </para>

              <para>- I have often heard the statement denied, but evidence of its truth has been brought before the House. The honorable member for Darling is, perhaps, one of the greatest&#39;, and certainly the most authoritative, exponent in Australia of the principles of unionism, and he is a man for many actions and opinions of whom 1 have the greatest respect. He has always been a straightforward exponent and successful organizer of unionism in Australia ; and he has brought forward figures which show that, in the case of some of the more important unions, and, at all events, in the case of one, a very considerable portion of the funds is used for other than benefit purposes, presumably for furthering the political objects of the party. </para>

              <para>- I remember the statement by the ex-Prime Minister that preference would be given, &#34; other things being equal.&#34; But I am endeavouring to prove the absolute insincerity of that statement, not by words, protests, or promises of the late Government, but by their acts. I am showing what those acts were - that in carrying out this policy the exMinister of Home Affairs, who was by no means one of the least important members of the Government, directed that absolute preference should be given; and, further, directed, in a departmental circular, that in the event of any future dismissals, nonunionists were to go. Will that be denied? If it is not denied, will the honorable member for West Sydney now repudiate the responsibility of his Government for those acts? Let us face the matter fairly. &#34; Let honorable members opposite put aside the pretence with which they attempt to cloak their acts - let them have the courage of their opinions. Let them say plainly, unless they are afraid to do so, that they used their power for the purpose of rewarding those who gave them that power, and that they intend to use it again, if they get the opportunity. </para>

              <para>- More than once I have seen letters with regard to Government employment at Westernport, in my own constituency, intimating, on behalf of trade unions, that those men who had had the courage to remain outside, would have their conduct reported to the Government if they did not at once join. We see, therefore, not only that the Government issued circulars and directions imposing the condition that all men employed should join unions, but that active assistance was rendered by the unions themselves in carrying out the policy. The argument has been used that this Bill is intended, not to abolish preference to unionists, but to give preference to non-unionists. What tittle of evidence can be brought forward in support of that argument? If honorable members, as they say, know that that is the object of the Bill, then they know it as a matter of faith - on evidence of things not seen. If we judge the late Government by their acts, we of the present Government are entitled to be judged by our acts; and I ask. if any member of the Opposition can bring forward a tittle of evidence that, in abolishing preference, as we did by administrative act, we have ever given preference to non-unionists. The arguments of honorable members opposite kill one another. They have said more than once that the result of the abolition of preference by administrative act was not to cause one more non-unionist to be employed, or to in any way decrease the number of unionists. That is the argument used when the endeavour is to show that the Bill is unnecessary - a sham and a trifle. That argument kills the other argument, on which the honorable member for West Sydney relies, namely, that the object is to give preference to nonunionists. Have we dismissed any men because they are unionists? </para>

              <para>- Of course not; it is because honorable members do not know that the statement is so freely made. I say here, on behalf of the Government, that it is an absolute and scandalous libel to say that any man employed by this Government, since it came into power, has lost his billet through being a unionist. I repudiate such a statement as false, scandalous, and contemptible. </para>

              <para>- I am not at all surprised at the heat which my statements and arguments cause on the other side of the House. I am not even surprised by the fact - which I cannot refer to now in detail - that my introduction of this measure has brought a perfect torrent of abuse on my head. However, I do not mind that much; I do not even think that it is very unnatural, and I shall tell the House why. Honorable members opposite are fully conscious that they are approaching an appeal to the people, with a hateful and irremovable clog around their necks; and the loud and uneasy laughter on the Opposition benches is the best evidence of the fact. We know why honorable members opposite are using every parliamentary method they can to delay, even by a week or two, the jump into the water. I challenge them to take the plunge - to be prepared to take the plunge. Some of them can swim, even if others sink; and the more fortunate amongst them need not be afraid. I suppose that during last session and this session, and especially during the present session, there has been more ingenuity displayed, more searching of the Standing Orders, than ever before; and with what object? With the object of delaying, if only for a week of two, or a day or two, this horrible appeal to the people, which honorable members opposite will have to make with this creature, of which they cannot get rid, clinging around their necks. The nonparliamentary section of the Labour party, as already admitted by the silence of honorable members opposite when I challenged them, never went so far as to demand that this claim for preference should be made on their behalf, or that the Government should turn themselves into a recruiting agency for a political party. The non-parliamentary body had still some common-sense. There was still some common-sense and some regard for British fair play amongst those who sent the Labour members here. But, once done, it could not be undone; now that the leaders of the Labour Government have taken the matter into their own hands, and, behind the back of Parliament, have given this unfair advantage to their own supporters, they will never be allowed by their own party to withdraw; in fact, they dare not withdraw. </para>

              <para>- If the Bill before us is rejected the honorable member will have as early an opportunity of going before the country as we can possibly obtain. If honorable members wish to test the sincerity of the Government, let them see that these Bills go through this House and then let them be rejected in another place. The last time I spoke on this subject I ventured to refer to the meeting of the Opposition party, which was held just prior to this Bill being brought on, and which was prolonged into the night, and I said that I wished I had been present at that meeting, but that I had drawn my own inference. The conclusion I came to - I think it will not be denied - was that there was a very strenuous fight between those who wished to come out in the open, and accept our challenge and those who said, &#34;No, let us talk about the measure; let us walk round it; let us do anything but accept it;&#34; and it was the latter who won; for since the Bill has been brought on, honorable members opposite have been talking about it, walking round it, shuddering at it, and raising all sorts of objections to it. If they intend to do anything else, I now throw down the challenge, as I have done on many occasions, in the House and outside, that if honorable members wish to test the sincerity of the Government let them reject this Bill, or let them pass it through this House and have it rejected on the first occasion it goes to the Senate. They will then have the opportunity of testing the sincerity of the Government. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member will very soon see what will follow. The honorable member, who is a lawyer, has expressed strong opinions on the duty of the Governor-General in this regard; in fact he has worked himself up to an opinion that a double dissolution will be refused. Other honorable members have expressed the same opinion. Many honorable members have suddenly evolved a very profound knowledge of constitutional law. They have also evolved the habit, very unusual among profound lawyers, of giving their profound conclusions away for nothing. It is my duty to carry out the standard set up by the honorable member for West Sydney, when he was Attorney- General, from which standard he more than any other honorable member has departed widely - the standard of saying nothing to embarrass the King&#39;s Representative in the discharge of his duty. I have my duty towards the Government, and I decline to anticipate at this stage any debate whatever on what ought to be under the Constitution the duty of the GovernorGeneral. I leave that to honorable members opposite. There has never been any answer to the challenge I have thrown out. If the position of Ministers is insincere, if honorable members think that, having reached the conditions under which a double dissolution may be granted or refused, and it has been refused, Ministers would still continue to occupy these benches, let them put the matter to the test. They have their opportunity. But they are afraid to put the matter to the test. If the honorable member for Hunter seeks an answer to his question - not my answer, but the answer of the whole Government - there is no readier way of getting it than by giving up this futile clinging to every parliamentary buttress, this holding to the banisters of the stair, this having to be dragged out of their place, by giving up this wretched parliamentary chicanery and letting the Bill be dealt with in both Houses. In that way honorable members can put Ministers to the test. We have been told the Bill is a shadow of a sham, and can lead to nothing. Honorable members have spent a very long time, they have exhausted every kind of parliamentary method, in order to escape this shadow of a sham. They seem to evince a greater heart-felt terror of this shadow of a sham than of anything else that has happened in Parliament. I promised not to speak at any length, and I shall not do so; but I do say that the claim put forward, looking at the substance of it, by the other side is one that cannot be permitted in any civilized community, and that claim is that a section of the people, voluntarily associating themselves, have the right to demand that the State shall say that those who are members of these voluntary associations should have special privileges out of the State funds. Such a principle cannot be permitted in any civilized community. The Government of the country, representing the whole of the people, would not, under such circumstances, be governing the country. One shaft of light struck me in the whole of the vast, arid waste of talk, mainly consisting of personal abuse addressed to myself. The honorable member for Boothby struck the root of the whole question the people have to consider in this matter, and I may be pardoned for making some reference to it. He pointed out that the real solution of the difficulty was compulsory unionism. I observed at the time that there were no cheers from the other side, and in the whole of the subsequent debate the statement of the honorable member was supported only by the honorable member for Dalley, but that honorable member supported it on grounds as widely distinct from those advanced by the honorable member for Boothby as are the North and South Poles. No other honorable member supported the honorable member for Boothby, and I venture to say that there is no other honorable member opposite who will come forward and say that he is in favour of compulsory unionism. Apart from those two honorable members, there is no one opposite will say that he is in favour of unionism being made compulsory by law. </para>

              <para>- I am fully aware that it is against the Standing Orders for honorable members to answer me, but there are questions such as can be answered which are very frequently answered. However, instead of putting a question, I shall put forward a distinct challenge. When honorable members opposite are speaking afterwards, as they may do under the Standing Orders, they will have the opportunity of saying, as the honorable member for Dalley and the honorable member for Boothby have said, whether they are in favour of legal compulsory unionism, and then we shall see what they say. Every one knows why honorable members are not in favour of compulsory unionism. They know perfectly well that, before any civilized community would consent to give public legal recognition and compulsion to any union, it would insist onthe performance of certain conditions. It would insist, in the first place, that the doors of that union should be absolutely open, without any discretion whatever on the part of the managers of that union, to all persons belonging to that particular trade, who knew their business and were not of bad character. They know also that no compulsory unionism could be possibly brought about, as long as there was any discretion in the unions as to the amount of entrance fee to be paid by new members joining. </para>

              <para>- I don&#39;t think there is any use in taking notice of trivial interjections. The honorable members who make these interjections about lawyers either do so from absolute ignorance, or with a view to deceiving the people outside, because they cannot possibly deceive anybody inside. Another condition which honorable members know the law would require, if it not only recognised unions but made them compulsory, would be the imposition ofa definite law against striking at all, or except under certain definite conditions. There are other conditions which the law would impose before it would recognise compulsory unionism, and, therefore, honorable members opposite, with the exception of one or two, are opposed to compulsory unionism. A further condition would certainly be that the funds of the unions should be under the control of a public trustee, and that the expenditure of those funds should be subject to audit. Honorable members are not prepared to accept these conditions, but they say that the law should give preference to their unions whilst they retain the right to say what shall be done with the funds. They would compel a man to join a union, or be starved to death, whilst they retain the right to expend the money as secretly as they like, and for what purposes they like. Those are the reasons why honorable members opposite dare not advocate compulsory unionism, and why, though the unions would not comply with the conditions which a reasonable law would impose upon them, honorable members insist upon Parliament giving preference to unionists. In fact, honorable members insist that every man who does not bear the union brand shall be liable to be starved off the face of the earth. </para>

              <para>- I do. I cannot help it. I cannot touch this subject without feeling every sense of fair play that I have inherited from my ancestors stirring within me. Honorable members may laugh, but if there is one thing which we as British people have inherited from centuries of free government, it is that every citizen is entitled under the law to a free right to sell his services for the best price he can get for them. But honorable members on the other side say they will not allow a man to live his life unless he bears the union label. However, I am not going to allow myself to become overheated in this discussion, nor am I going to take up much longer time with it. I will conclude by a quotation which, no doubt, will be of interest to my honorable friends opposite. I do not know whether you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> in the intervals which you spare from studying the Standing Orders, devote any time to a perusal of the Bible, but, if you do, you will probably be quite familiar with the description of the beast of the Apocalypse. It is described as a beast &#34; coming out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.&#34; That is suggestive of the voice of the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- The Attorney-General, who spoke with so much heat when introducing the Bill, must admit that it goes only a short way in the direction in which he would go. Generally speaking, he leaves us in no doubt as to his views, and he has told us that if he had the power he would deny, not only preference to those seeking Government employment, but even its application by a Court in the. exercise of discretion conferred by Parliament. He would deprive every organization of preference, he says. Yet he belongs to an honorable profession which makes a larger claim for preference than has been granted by any Court. </para>

              <para>- Would the AttorneyGeneral practise with every man who has been approved by the Courts as possessing the qualifications necessary for a barrister ? He knows that he would not. He has compared himself with the ex AttorneyGeneral, saying that he did not propose to follow the lines taken by him in giving cheap legal advice. The exAttorneyGeneral is not only a member of the Labour party, but a friend, who, in the most honorable way, and notwithstanding almost insurmountable difficulties, has risen to one of the highest positions in the country. Yet the Attorney - General says, &#34; Here is a man who gave advice that was not paid for. I do not do that. My opinions are paid for, and always will be.&#34; The sneer was uncalled for, and unworthy of the AttorneyGeneral, although it will not hurt the honorable member for West Sydney. </para>

              <para>- That matter need lot be discussed further. The AttorneyGeneral, as a distinguished member of the Bar, has admittedthat persons qualifiedto practise law cannot do so unless they comply with certain conditions; that those who are in the organization will not appear with others who are not. I wish to deal with this matter calmly, because it is one for decision after argument. Either our position can be defended or it cannot; either we stand for political justice or we do not. I am in favour of preference to unionists, and do not hesitate to say so. Society needs organizing. Those who have to earn their own living, whether as artisans, in trade, or in the professions, should form themselves into organizations, and when disputes arise, asthey will from time to time,they should be arbitrated upon by persons who have no interests involved. The condition imposed upon parties seeking redress for grievances by an appeal bo the Arbitration Court is that they shall give up their right bo strike, their right to do injury to the whole community, and this is held to entitle them to preference. The preference for which we contend is much less than that required by the organization to whichthe Attorney-General belongs. A member of that organization in this State has gone so far astothrow up a briefto appear forthe Crown to defend a man arraigned on a capital charge, within a day or two of the case being called on, simply because the fees marked on the brief, although those ordinarily paid, were not sufficient. </para>

              <para>- I did not intend to convey any such inference. I was simply pointing out what can be done, and is done, by members of the privileged, exalted, noble profession, and of the association which the Attorney-General defends. Let me remind the honorable member for Indi that such privileges are not to be conceded, according to the AttorneyGeneral, to any association of working men. The advantages that are extended to the members of the exalted Bar Association are not to be enjoyed by workmen who organize, not to gain a competency, but simply to obtain wages and conditions that will enable them to live. </para>

              <para>- The AttorneyGeneral said that if preference to unionists were given, certain conditions should be imposed. But is it not a fact that he has also said that, under no circumstances or conditions, is he in favour of preference ? How does he reconcile the two statements? The explanation is that one is intended for the public. The one is designed to regale the electors when the question is being put from a partisan point of view. The honorable gentleman, on this question, cannot blow hot and cold. He is either in favour of one or the other of these propositions. I favour preference to unionists in respect of all organizations. I wish to state once more my attitude regarding the position of the Executive. Our justification for the action of the late Government in granting, in their Executive capacity, during the life of the last Parliament, preference to unionists lies in the fact that three elections had taken place since preference to unionists had been declared by enactment to be the policy of this Parliament. The relation of the Executive to the Parliament is that of a Board of Directors to the shareholders of a private company. When the shareholders of a private company have declared in favour of a certain preference, the management or the directors are in duty bound to give effect to that policy; and in the same way the action of the late Government in granting preference to unionists can be fully justified. The AttorneyGeneral declared that we were a party of hypocrites because we would not declare for absolute compulsory unionism. That charge is not only undeserved, but has no application. How were the unions of which the Attorney-General spoke brought into existence? Were they brought into existence as the pampered darlings of a class ? Is it not a fact that there are living to-day men who, when they first became unionists, had to hide the funds of their organizations, and to meet in secret? </para>

              <para>- They had even to conceal their records. That has happened during the lifetime of the AttorneyGeneral, and men would have been outlawed had it been discovered that they were members of a union possessing funds and holding meetings. If they merely possessed the courage of which the AttorneyGeneral spoke, the men would have professed their principles, but have sacrificed nothing for them. His policy is that of no preference whatever to unionists, but as the spokesman of the Government he brings in a Bill which will carry out only a small part of his professed policy. I am not here to question the firmness of his belief in the principles he professes, but my knowledge of him is that while he can speak mightily and determinedly as to the views that he. holds, he is seldom to be found remaining in the breach when a regard for his principle calls upon him to stand alone. He fights best when he is in a big battalion. </para>

              <para>- I do not object to the honorable member entertaining that hope. Even the criminal lying under sentence of death does not abandon hope until the last. I challenge the Attorney- General&#39;s statement that preference to unionists cannot be granted in any civilized country. I take the entirely opposite view. Preference to unionists is but a sign of civilization. It is in keeping with the whole trend of civilization, and does no injustice to any citizen. The Government that honestly declares for preference to unionists declares for a policy that more or less limits their action. The present Government declares for a policy, not of preference to unionists, but of free, open, unrestricted competition. Our experience is that, not merely in Australia, but all the world over, society influence and the prejudice of those in authority are entirely against unionism. For centuries unionists have had to suffer disabilities, and they have never suffered more than they have during the last fifty or sixty years. They have never obtained justice. The lingering prejudice still remains with the Attorney-General and his party. I am not going to say, however, that the Prime Minister has altered his opinions. I cannot believe that the honorable gentleman holds any other view than he held when, as a much younger man, he was associated with the unions. </para>

              <para>- No worse proposition could bebrought forward than that made by the Attorney-General that we should discriminate between preference to unionists in private and in Government employment. This Parliament has prescribed the conditions under which the private employer may carry on his industry, but, according to the Attorney-General, the Government should not be asked to comply with the same conditions when competing with that private employer. </para>

              <para>- One does not know. The Attorney- General, by implication; says that we should impose certain restrictions - if preference to unionists is a restriction - on private employers, but that the Government which, in certain industries, is competing directly with those private employers, should suffer no such restriction. Can he justify that contention ? It is perfectly illogical and unfair to outside employers. To be logical, the Attorney-General must get back to his old declaration that there should be no preference of any kind provided by either the Parliament or the Courts. In other words, he says, &#34; Let there be a scramble ! </para>

              <para>- Quite so ; there are, on the Government side of the House, honorable members who would have been in their element in Australia twenty-five years ago, when, after twenty years of borrowingand booming by Liberal Governments, the country was brought to its knees by financial disaster, the like of which had never occurred before in a country with our population. At that time, those who had to rely only on their hands to save their children from starvation had to scratch and scrape, and jostle with each other to get a mere pittance to keep body and soul together. Then there was no preference to unionists. Freedom of contract prevailed, and no one man was allowed to speak for two or three. Every man had to plead his own case. The AttorneyGeneral says to-day that we should revert to that position of affairs - that no two or three men should he allowed to organize and have one spokesman. On the other hand, employers may unite as much as they like, and one man may speak for the whole, and prescribe terms. Does the Attorney-General think it fair, even for a Government, to refuse to deal with men collectively? Is it fair for the Government, with their party behind them, to lay down certain conditions of employment, and declare that they will hear no one on behalf of an organization, but will deal with only individual men? What chance has the unit ? This may seem a smaller matter to some of my colleagues than it does to me, but if the Government carry out this principle, or what they call a principle, it will undoubtedly establish a precedent, because it cannot logically end with them. Governments, both Commonwealth and State, are not merely Governments in the old sense of the term - bodies merely to pass laws and keep the peace of the country - but they undertake enterprises and employ large numbers of people in productive and other occupations for the benefitof the community. It will be seen, therefore, that they stand in quite a different position from that of Governments of the past. It has been urged that preference, as established by the late Government, is not in accordance with British fair play, and the Attorney- General has sneered at the words &#34; other things being equal.&#34; Other words maybe used to express the idea, but the words used mean that the preference is not to the exclusion of everybody - they mean exactly what they say. The AttorneyGeneral is entitled to his sneer, but it does not appeal to me, and I do not think it will have any serious effect on others. The charge by the AttorneyGeneral that preference means &#34; Spoils to the victors &#34; is not true in fact. There are no &#34; spoils &#34; when the Labour party are in office; the &#34;spoils&#34; begin only when they leave office. That is a rejoinder which I think I am entitled to make to the charge by the AttorneyGeneral. </para>

              <para>- I am now replying to the taunt of the Attorney-General about &#34; Spoils to the victors.&#34; Who are the victors? They are men who are not getting money, or any consideration at all, beyond the consideration that allows them to work. They pray for work, for opportunity to use their physical and mental powers, so that they may support their families and other dependents. All the privilege they get is that of being employed under prescribed conditions that apply to every workman. All that is involved is the privilege to be employed; and this does not debar any one else. Unionists are not entitled to any privilege of employment to which non-unionists are not entitled. Unionists are not entitled to a penny, or to consideration of any kind.We support the principle of preference because we believe that organization is essential and necessary. While the Attorney-General was out of the chamber, I drew attention to the fact that if individuals are not allowed to associate in an organization, they are undoubtedly placed at a disadvantage. </para>

              <para>- What objection, then, can there be to treating as a body, and giving preference to as an organization, men who have made conditions prescribing hours of labour, and have fixed a standard of efficiency to which all must rise before they can join ? They are doing the work of the nation, and they are an organized society; and they ought not only to be given preference, but to be thanked. Every civilized nation should be thankful to the men and women who were the first to advocate and to carry out the great principle of unionism. Many of the privileges and conditions enjoyed to-day, from which so much of our happiness and comfort arise, are due to the sacrifice of those who have gone before us. </para>

              <para>- The whole proposal is in the interests of the wives and children; that is our idea; it is the beginning and the end of the contention. The only question is whether the way we advocate is better than that of absolutely leaving to Ministers the power to appoint whom they please. I wish to make it clear that preference, as granted by the previous Administration, did not in any way come into conflict with the Public Service Act. Those who have passed examinations, and thereby got into the permanent Service, have, at , the present time, security under the law; and, strange to say, the Attorney-General, with his Government and party, is prepared to accept and comply with an award prescribed by the Arbitration Court. Officers of the Commonwealth under the Public Service Act have the right to go to the Court, and, by means of evidence, present their grievances, and get an award. Do the Prime Minister and the Government intend, if this Bill become law, that that preference shall be dropped? </para>

              <para>- It seems a simple little question to ask, but nine-tenths of the supporters of the Government say that it does. I take it that the only persons who are, or can be, affected by this particular Bill are those who are directly appointed by an officer under the Minister. I am sure the Attorney-General is quite with me in trying to get the facts before the people. </para>

              <para>- Yes, preference to unionists, because they are members of organized bodies, but this Bill aims at giving preference to non-unionists. Members of an organized body will not work with non-unionists. The Prime Minister has said that no decent unionist will work with a non-unionist, and that his&#39; union, the Miners&#39; Union, knew what to do with non-unionists. Therefore, if the Government give employment bo non-unionists no unionists will be employed, and that means that it is preference to nonunionists that the Bill provides. Ministers know this very well. While pretending to make the matter universally fair, they are seeking to provide a legal condition which will prevent unionists being employed. It is strange that we find this Bill taking precedence over every other matter affecting the public welfare. One would think that the Government, in their present position, would endeavour to deal with matters of urgent and public interest, but instead, they have brought forward this measure, straightforwardly from their point of view, with the object of picking a quarrel with the Senate. The Prime Minister has said that the Senate does not represent the people, that the constitution of another place will need to be altered, and that Ministers cannot remain in their present positions unless this is done. The Attorney-General has said the same thing, and he continues to say it. The Bill has been brought down with the object of picking a quarrel with the Senate rather than to lay down a, principle. The Government have- chosen it for their own purpose, not to solve a dead-lock, but to create one. My justification for saying that is that every Minister making a public statement says that the condition of Parliament has a close connexion with this particular measure. So the Bill is brought forward, not bo solve a dead-lock between the two Houses, but to create one. </para>

              <para>- No one is better than the Prime Minister at making a statement which is not a fact. After the Government, during last session, had said about twenty times that they were going to have a dissolution, I said at Geelong that if they wished for a dissolution they could have one, but next day the Prime Minister rejoined, &#34; But what we want is a double dissolution.&#34; First of all, it was a dissolution, and then, when they were challenged as to . that they said, , &#34;No, you have made a mistake; it is a double dissolution that we want.&#34; My challenge to Ministers was that if they wished to get out of a difficulty, and found they could not carry on the government of the country, there was no obligation on any one taking office under the Crown to remain in office any longer than he could honorably serve his country. I would like to know to what limit Ministers would go before feeling their honour touched in any way. </para>

              <para>- I have explained that before. I am in favour of business being carried on against obstruction; but last session I was closured before uttering a word on the Loan Bill. The standing order was not framed for such a purpose. Since when has the doctrine been laid down that the Senate does not represent the people? Immediately Ministers have found a convenient medium of attacking another place. Senators were elected at the last election by a larger vote than was secured by Ministerialists. Apparently, &#34; win, tie, or wrangle &#34; is the policy of Ministers. </para>

              <para>- I have already said that the proposal of Ministers is not put forward to solve a deadlock or remove a difficulty between the two Houses, but is to create one, and is therefore subversive of the principles of government. Ministers seek to create a difficulty instead of using the provisions of the Bill to remove one after a difficulty has arisen. If we continually provoke a quarrel with a coordinate House elected on the same franchise as our own we shall never be able to carry on responsible government, and there will be no limit to wrangles and disturbances, and to theexpense to which the people will be put. If the Government had had the decency to stay their hand until a real crisis arose between the two Houses, they would have been entitled to some consideration. But they rush forward with an object which is obviously political, and not national. In all other Parliaments the practice has been, if the popular House finds it impossible, through conflict with the other House, to carry on, that it should first go to the country to ascertain the will of the people; and that course should be sufficient and ample to meet the present crisis. In dealing with that phase of the question, let me quote the prophetic words used by the Treasurer at the Federal Convention in relation to the &#34; deadlock &#34; provisions of the Constitution.

I can imagine that a Government which felt itself somewhat weak, or which thought that an occasion was on opportune one for an appeal to the country/ might encourage a conflict rather than try to avoid it, in order that in this way it might he able to recommend a dissolution of both Houses, in the hope that that would &#39; strengthen their follow*.^, or at any rate, give it more time. . . . </para>

            <para>. - I hope this debate will not be a very long one. I agree with the view put forward by the Attorney-General, in his telling and succinct speech, that the matter has been debated over and over again, and not much new mutter can be contributed to the discussion. I am inclined to take the view advanced in the leading columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning that if the Opposition regard this as an unimportant measure they will allow it to speedily pass, because, if a double dissolution is dependent on the passing of this Bill, it will certainly bring us face to face with the position that we shall have to proceed with the other planks in our platform or go before the people. Opposition members laugh, but I should like to know whether they have. any platform. If they have one it is their duty to, as soon as possible, send this House and the other House to the country, in order that they may appeal to their own supporters to secure the passing into law of the principles they advocate. In my opinion the Labour Government, during their three years of office, exhausted their practicable platform, and they are so bankrupt at the present time, so far, as a policy is concerned, that they are awaiting the passing of the referenda proposals before they can proceed with the platform of Socialistic legislation which they now find it impossible to carry out. </para>

              <para>- I hope weshall have an opportunity of amending the Tariff, but I think the members occupying the Opposition benches should be the last to charge the Government with not carrying out their policy of Tariff reform, when they so flagrantly neglected their opportunities in that regard during the three years they were in office. In speaking on this measure, it is the duty of every member to confine himself to the Bill itself, instead of indulging in a general discussion on the question of unionism. This measure does not involve the general question of unionism. The only question which it raises is as to whether a Government, who are the trustees of the public, and who, as such, have in their hands the revenues and funds of the people, shall be allowed to say that, in order to reward their own political supporters, they will give them exclusive employment in the Government service. </para>

          <para>It is the duty of the House, so far as industrial matters generally are concerned, to endeavour to bring to bear the genius of both sides in order to evolve some scheme that will insure industrial peace, and prevent the old barbarous method of resorting to a strike when differences arise between employers and employes. That cannot be done except by some scheme of organization on the part of employers on the one Hand and employes on the other. That question has already been dealt with by this House. We have not a perfect system at present, but it is the duty of the House to endeavour to make it more perfect. The Arbitration Act of 1904 was given to the people by a Liberal Government. It might be a better law than it is </para>

              <para>- It contained preference to unionists under certain circumstances, but I am not going to discuss now how far that principle should be embodied in any law administered by a properlyconstituted Court. That is not the question under discussion at the present moment. I am free to admit, however, that if we could induce the great body of industrial workers to give up the right to strike that obtained under the old barbarous system, it would be the duty of Parliament to provide some form of legislation which would be compensation and protection to the organizations and equivalent to the right they had forfeited. What form  that protection should take is for this House to decide, but it is not under discussion at present. When the question does come up for discussion, and the Arbitration Act is brought forward for amendment, it will be for the </para>

          <para class="block">House to do something to preserve to the organized workers of Australia their rights, and enable them to settle their disputes in the Arbitration Court, or before Wages Boards, or by some other form of a tribunal, instead of the barbarous method of the strike, which is so productive of suffering and loss, not only to the parties themselves, but to the whole of the community. </para>
          <para>However, what we have to deal with now is the question of preference to unionists in the Government service. For party purposes members of the Opposition have been endeavouring to make light of this important Bill. Some of them say that it is a sham, that it cannot effect anything, and so on. I am pleased to find that the Leader of the Opposition, who should speak with authority in behalf of his party, has declared this matter to be a very important one. I say it is an important one, because it is a question which strikes right down to the fundamental principles of administration. It is one which says that the administrators, who are intrusted with the public funds of the country, shall not use those funds for party purposes, but shall dispense those funds, administer the Departments, and handle the public money in a manner that will mete out equity and fairness to every section of the community. That is what the system of preference to unionists in government employment involves. </para>

As this personal matter has with such bad taste been introduced by the honorable member for Grey on several occasions, let me say that if the associations and industrial organizations were the same to-day as they were when my father was one of their leaders, I would be with them right to the last. My father was connected with industrial unionism before the unions became political organizations. They were industrial organizations only. The Prime Minister, too, was a champion of unionism when it was purely industrial, and not political in its organization. </para>

          <para>This question of administrative preference to unionists was first discovered while the honorable member for Darwin was at the head of the Home Affairs Department. In a debate in this House the honorable member was taxed with having given preference to unionists, and with having issued a minute in the Department ordering that preference to unionists should be given. The interpretation of that minute by the administrative head of the Department was that, if preference to unionists was to be enforced in the Home Affairs Department, it would be necessary to dismiss all non-unionists then employed. </para>

              <para>- That was the interpretation placed upon the instructions in a memorandum issued by the administrative head of the Department. The Minister&#39;s instructions declared that only unionists should be employed, and that the Department was to be furnished with a list of the non-unionists in the employ of the Department. No other interpretation could be placed on the Minister&#39;s instructions than that contained in the memorandum from the head of the Department. Honorable members on this side believe that if the instruction had not been discovered, and the discussion had not taken place in this House, the principle contained in that minute would have been the prevailing policy in the Home Affairs Department. It is now stated that this Bill is not necessary, because by administrative act the Government have repealed an administrative act of their predecessors. Honorable members opposite argue that the Bill is a redundancy, and that all it could have  achieved is already achieved by an administrative act of the present Government. It is fortunate that the people returned the present Government to power, if only for the fact that one of its important administrative acts has been to repeal that pernicious instruction in regard to preference to unionists in the Government service. Honorable members ask why we want this Bill. I am going to show that it is necessary that we should have an Act on the statute-book which will prevent the possibility of any such policy being repeated by a mere administrative act if the Labour party should be returned to power. </para>

              <para>- It has been stated in this debate that if preference to union. ists is given, it can only apply to a very small number of employes in the Public Service; but we have found out from our experience with the past Government that the principle did not apply only to casual employes in the Service, but could be enforced in connexion with all private contracts taken under the Government. This minute was attached to the specifications for certain works in the Northern Territory by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, some time after the order for preference to unionists in the Government service was given. The minute on the specification read : &#34;In the employment of labour and the carrying out of this contract, absolute preference is to be given to unionists.&#34; This instruction proved that, if preference can be given to unionists by Executive act, it may not be given merely to casual employes, but may be made a condition in all Government contracts. </para>

              <para>- We have no evidence that it would be. The public expenditure is increasing, and our commitments are very large. There are immense works to be undertaken in the Northern Territory; we have railways to construct; and, directly, or indirectly under contractors, must employ thousands and tens of thousands of workmen.

              <para>- It would mean that public funds would be used to force men into unions, and to reward political supporters. It would be a misuse of public money, a violation of public trusteeship, and a blot on Australian public life. The discussion of the Bill does not involve the discussion of preference to unionists generally. </para>

              <para>- The ordinary man who violates the law is put into gaol, and a Minister who did so would deserve the same treatment. If the discussion of this measure is unduly prolonged, the Government will be prevented from submitting measures to give effect to other planks of the platform for which we have the mandate of the people. We promised the people that we would remove the stain of preference, to unionists from the political&#39; escutcheon, so that the public money must be spent in the interests of the whole community, and not merely of a privileged class. When the Labour Government was in power, its measures were not inordinately discussed when it could be shown that they had been introduced in accordance with a mandate from the people. The Opposition held up the postal vote proposals for a night or two, because we claimed that the people had not given a mandate to the Labour party to exclude the sick and the old from the exercise of the franchise. </para>

              <para>- I have not said so; on the contrary, I distinctly told the honorable member for Wimmera that if he did not make the statement imputed to him, he could deny it. If, however, he did make the statement, it must be withdrawn at the direction of the Chair, even though it might not be offensive taken by itself. I have pointed out that if the honorable member to whom a remark has been applied regards it as offensive, it is the invariable practice to withdraw it without qualification, the honorable member who made it having an opportunity afterwards to make an explanation. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with the honorable member who has just spoken about the most unfair and undignified position in which the Government are placing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> by keeping over the discussion of these motions, and about the great disadvantage it will be to honorable members. The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> gave a decision, with which the House may agree when it has the opportunity of discussing it, regarding the inability of the honorable member for Bourke to move an amendment to the motion for leave to introduce the Government Preference Prohibition Bill. That amendment was ruled out of order, and we should have had a decision from the House as to whether honorable members supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but we shall not have an opportunity of arriving at that decision before the stage of the Bill at which such an amendment may be moved has completely gone. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister has had twelve months in which to introduce these measures.  The only information we got from Ministers to-day was with regard to the Tariff. We were told that the Inter-State Commission decline to make any report until they have taken evidence in all the States, and the Minister of Trade and Customs has told us that the officers in the Customs Department are preparing a list of anomalies. We shall await with great interest the appearance of that list. The commercial community of Australia are suffering from the absence of a- Bankruptcy Bill. That is a measure which would be treated as a non-party matter, and passed; and if it is framed on the lines of the Bill which has lately gone through the House of Commons, it will be of great advantage to the commercial community of Australia. The Prime Minister says, &#34; I will introduce this Bill when opportunity offers.&#34; Next Wednesday he can ask for leave to introduce the Bill, and he will be granted leave, and if he places the measure first on the business-paper it will be discussed, and no doubt passed very speedily. The same remarks will apply to insurance, so far as the Constitution will allow. The Prime Minister, nearly twelve months ago, met a deputation of unemployed, and he sympathized with them - I suppose that while he was speaking he felt that sympathy - but, so far, he has made no attempt to introduce legislation to insure people against sickness, or to pass a law to assist widows and orphans, or to pass a Bill to endeavour to insure people against unemployment. Where are these measures ? Where is the Bill for the appointment of commissioners to manage the Post Office, or that to appoint industrial boards to settle Inter-State disputes, or that to appoint a board to settle the maternity allowance - the Bill which the Knight of the -Crown of Italy is to introduce when opportunity offers. I do not know that we will pass the Bill very easily, but we have a right to know the nature of the measure. Then there is also the Bill for the redistribution of seats, which is to take that matter out of party political management, or manipulation, as the Prime Minister says. Where are all these&#39; national matters, that Ministers are not introducing them ? Why are the Government holding up the business of the country by introducing measures which are not nearly of the same importance as some I have mentioned? </para>

            <para>- I know that the AttorneyGeneral is. He believes in things as they are. He and his class have done very well with things as they are, and he does not wish to have any alteration in the laws. He thinks that any alteration will prevent him and those whom he represents doing so well. Of course, he is entirely mistaken in that Conservative and Tory view, but, nevertheless, he holds it. I would like the public of Australia to take particular notice of the Government and their method of doing business. I would like them to read the Ministerial statement of twelve months ago, and compare it with the Speech of the GovernorGeneral a month ago. They would realize that Ministers are merely marking time, and haveno intention of introducing these items of legislation, but intend to fool the general public so long as the poor general public are unacquainted with their real aims. </para>

          <para>. - I would like to bring under the notice of the Treasurer a matter which is rather urgent to the old people of Adelaide. The place where the old-age pensioners are paid is on a flat on the riverside, about three-quarters of a mile from the nearest spot to which these old people have to go. The road leading to it is very little used, and is very steep. It is a hardship for old people over seventy years of age to have to struggle down there, particularly in the summer time, when the heat in Adelaide is very severe. Ever since the ground has been levelled, the place has been used as a gun-carriage shed. It is simply constructed of wood and iron, and has a narrow bench inside on which the old-age pensioners are obliged to sit in summer, with their backs to the heat. There is no. shade outside, and they have to sit in that position for some time before they can get their wants attended to. In winter, the place is flat and dismal, and having been laid out as an evolution ground for cadets, it becomes simply a sheet of water after heavy rain. In addition, the soil is of a clayey character, and that makes walking somewhat dangerous to those who are not nimble on their feet. Honorable members will see that this is an awful place to send old people to in order to get their pensions. I hope that the Treasurer will try to secure an office more centrally situated in Adelaide. I would suggest the General Post Office, or Selborne Chambers, which are almost exclusively used for Commonwealth purposes. If the Treasurer looks at the matter from a sympathetic point of view, the obtaining of improved accommodation will not be a difficult matter. I hope that he will take the matter into consideration at an early date. </para>

            <para>- If I thought there would be any other opportunity of saying what I wish to say, I would not proceed with this matter, because I feel that the delay is probably inflicting an injustice on some members of. the Chamber. If the Prime Minister would exercise the same regard for the opinions of honorable members as he wishes us to show, I, for one, would be pleased to do as he asks. The point I wish to draw attention to is this : Last Friday I moved an amendment in this chamber; it was seconded, and was properly before the House. The AttorneyGeneral raised a point of order, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> expressed the opinion that the amendment was out of order. </para>
