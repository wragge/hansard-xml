            <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment upon the motion for the adoption of an Address-in-Reply to the Speech of  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral, and by it he accuses this Administration of having &#34; failed to safeguard the interests of the people of the Commonwealth;&#34; but he and his supporters in their attempts to justify the charge have proved, not that we have failed to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth, but that we have been alive to our responsibilities, and have done all we can to advance those interests. Especially has the charge which was levelled against the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs failed. Yesterday afternoon, the honorable member for Yarra, in supporting the amendment, declared that the Department of Trade and Customs, over which I preside, had unduly delayed certain matters of administration. If there is any honorable member who should not bring that charge, it is he. Ever since he entered this House he has posed as the archpriest of Protection, and has hardly made a speech without touching on the important fiscal question. I admit the importance of the question, but what did he do when in office to improve the Tariff? The Fisher Government, of which he was a Minister, was in office for three years. During that time it had a majority in both Houses, and could have given effect to any policy that it had the backbone to put forward. In their first session, the Labour Ministers dealt with certain so-called Tariff anomalies, and they dealt with a few more in the next session, but they did not introduce a large policy of Protection, their plea being that they could not do so until they could make sure that the worker would get his fair share of the benefits accruing from higher duties. Yesterday, the honorable member for Yarra boasted that, in dealing with Tariff anomalies, he made dredges dutiable, and increased the duties on pianos, and on several other things. As he could give the Protection necessary in connexion with two or three items, why did he not carry out the full policy of Protection that he has always advocated? He neglected entirely to propose any complete revision of the Tariff, and failed to propose whole-heartedly the policy that he has always strongly advocated. When he left office, there remained undealt with in the Department 117 confidential Tariff schedules; there were from 470 to 500 ap plications from persons who desired relief in connexion with Tariff matters, and, speaking from memory, there were the reports of some sixty or seventy deputations. I do not say that all the applicants were entitled to higher duties, but their representations merited consideration. The honorable gentleman did not even go so far as to appoint the InterState Commission. Had it been appointed seven or eight months earlier, it could have commenced its investigations sooner, and Tariff matters would then have been more advanced than they are to-day. What is the position of this Government in regard to the Tariff ? Immediately we assumed office, we took steps to fulfil one of our platform pledges by appointing the Inter-State Commission. It had been announced that the Liberal party would stand by the fiscal policy which had been affirmed by the people of Australia and embodied in our Tariff laws. We lost no time in appointing the Inter-State Commission. On the 8th September, 1913, I sent the following letter to the Chief Commissioner - </para>

          <para class="block">We organized the staff of the Commission, provided it with adequate accommodation, and it got to work as soon as possible. Ever since it has been giving consistent and persistent attention to the matters brought before it, and has now examined no fewer than 320 witnesses in respect of 149 different applications. It has received 463 individual applications, of which 200 are for increased Tariff assistance, and 219 for reductions of duty, abolitions of duty, or in opposition to increases. In some cases, decreases upon certain articles are asked for in order that the industry concerned may be better encouraged. The applications deal with 213 subjects and with 154 Tariff items, one item often including more than one subject. So far, no application has been based upon grounds of urgency. </para>

              <para>- The electors of Australia, having had previous experience of such an assertion, placed the honorable member and his party where they are today. As to the number of subjects covered byapplications to the Commission, and the States of origin, I find that the figures are as follow: - New South Wales, 113 subjects; Victoria, 127; Queensland, 19; South Australia, 17; Western Australia, 6; and Tasmania, 10. These figures clearly show that the people are appreciating our action in appointing a judicial and impartial Commission to investigate matters relating to the Tariff. I was rather amused by the effort which the honorable member for Yarra made yesterday to ridicule, as matters of small concern, several of the industries into which the Commission is inquiring. He did not go through the list and set out all the big industries which are the subject of the Commission&#39;s investigation, but treated the applications so far dealt with as being apparently of no concern. Is that his view in regard to the boot and shoe industry, which is one of the subjects of inquiry ? Is that a minor industry in Australia ? Other subjects on which applications have been made to the Commission are - Leather; paper, printing and manufactured stationery ; shale oil ; matches and vestas; brushware and brushmakers&#39; materials; brassware generally; glassware and glass bottles; folding-box boards, strawboards, &#38;c. ; the wattle-bark industry; timber; furniture; artificial manures; enamelled ware; marine engines and boilers; marine vessels; soap; apparel; cast-iron pipes and fittings; paints and colours; leather manufactures, travelling bags, &#38;c. ; pianos; nails; barb wire; and corks. All these are industries of considerable importance. The facts I have given show conclusively that this Government were not slow in taking action to safeguard the interests of the public. It appointed a. properly constituted tribunal to investigate Tariff matters, and the people of Australia, as shown by these applications, appreciate the action which we have taken to protect the interests of the manufacturer, the worker, and the consumer. </para>

Then, too, the honorable member says that we committed a mistake in remedying a defect; which, he must admit, was in the Labour Government&#39;s own Bill. The right honorable member for Wide Bay admitted in this House that it would have been better had the late Government inserted in that Bill a clause providing for the collection of the revenue. We collected every penny of the &#163;150,000 of revenue for which they had not provided. But this, after all, is but a minor point compared with the substance of the question at issue. The substance of the matter is that the honorable member for Yarra, without consulting the growers&#39; interests, as Minister of Trade and Customs, increased the wages of the workers engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland. </para>

              <para>- What they did was to complain that, whilst the honorable member, as Minister of Trade and Customs, was ready to assist the workers, he gave no consideration whatever to the sugargrowers - the primary producers - upon whom the whole industry rested. Justice was alleged to be done to the workers in the industry, but an additional burden was imposed on the sugar farmers, and the honorable member for Yarra gave them no relief. The Queensland Government pleaded with him for help for the sugar farmers, and we on this side of the House also did so ; but since only farmers were concerned, the matter was of no importance to the Labour party. They are a class party. Their class party had to be looked after, and they said, in effect, &#34; Let the other bloke look after himself.&#34; That is their policy. The Queensland Government asked that action should be taken to relieve the farmers; our party also pleaded for assistance for them, and finally the Labour Government agreed that as soon as certain measures were passed by the Queensland Parliament the proclamation should issue and relief should be given to the sugar farmers. The present Government came into power, and as soon as the conditions were fulfilled we took action, and gave to the primary producers the relief which the late Government had neglected to give, as they should have done. The honorable member for Capricornia represents a number of sugar producers, and the trouble, so far as he is concerned, is that he has not been able to show that, since he entered this Parliament, he has done anything of value for the farming community of Australia. The honorable member for Barrier has an unequalled record in the Postal Department. There were fewer milestones during his administration than in the case of any other Minister, and he got out of the Department as soon as he found that difficulties were arising, sheltering himself behind the excuse that he was taking control of a better Department - that of External Affairs.  His  record in that Department is well known. The real trouble with the honorable member for Capricornia is this: Last season showed the finest record for the sugar industry that Queensland has ever seen. Roughly speaking, 2,085,000 tons of cane were produced, and the relief we gave resulted in every grower being benefited to the extent of about 2s. 2d. per ton. In other words, we took action at the earliest possible date, in order that the growers might get the benefit of the legislation passed, and that benefit took the form of something like &#163;225,000 more than they had received in any previous season. During the first few weeks, while the conditions were being fulfilled by the State, we could not give the additional bounty, but, as soon as the conditions had been met we were able to legislate, and, before the 1st January of this year, to give those growers who had not benefited by the repeal an extra &#163;35,000 in cash, making in all, as I say, relief to the amount of &#163;225,000. If in this Parliament I can, by committing sucha mistake, help the growers and primary producers to that extent, I am prepared to accept the responsibility. The trouble is that honorable members opposite have never done anything for the farming population. They talk a great deal about being the farmers&#39; friends - about their all being workers mutually interested as against the middleman - but they offer no practical legislation for their relief; on the contrary, the farmers&#39; and producers&#39; burdens are increased, and they are allowed to stew until they&#39; get relief in the best way they can. I should now like to make some reference to the honorable member for Brisbane. The other day, when addressing the House, he prefaced his remarks by expressing the hope that we would regard what he said as purely political - that he had no desire to introduce personalities of any kind - and, therefore, I hope he will take what I am going to say now in the same spirit. If the honorable member wishes to worthily represent, politically, that great constituency of Brisbane - one of the finest cities in Australia - it would be wiser for him to ascertain, in the first place, whether there is even a shadow of foundation for statements he makes in public. It is very unsatisfactory that an honorable member should go on the public platform, as the honorable member did at Ballarat, and make allegations - I do not wish to mention names - about threats made by the Government, and that, when challenged, he should retort by saying that he did not make the statements as representing facts within his personal knowledge, but that he was asking whether rumours he had heard were true. What sort of personal relations would we have in life if, when we heard any scandalous rumours about our neighbours, we circulated those rumours without making any inquiry as to their truth; and if. when, we were brought to book, we pleaded that we &#39;did not utter the statements as true, but were merely asking whether they were true or not? The honorable member for Brisbane, when he was challenged, said that he had interviewed- a pressman, from whom he learned that there might have been other causes for the resignation of the Governor-General. </para>

Of course it must be understood that I am now speaking purely in a political sense. Then the other day the honorable member referred to the Government as being morally responsible for the lives of those unfortunate men who perished in the disaster off Cape Moreton. The charge, he said, had been made in Brisbane; and no doubt it had, with, perhaps, some little &#34;colouring. The honorable member said : - </para>

              <para>- I am not aware that a light has been erected there by the State Government, but I shall make inquiries. The honorable member for Yarra is quite correct when he says that the State Government should not do this kind of work, which now is purely a matter for the Commonwealth. If a light has been erected there, it is against the recommendations contained in the reports of Captain Brewis and Captain Hood. The captain of one of the largest vessels which go to Brisbane discussed the matter with me, and he, too, said that there is no necessity for such a light; and inquiries show that the loss of the vessel was due to an uncharted rock. The honorable member, before he charged others with being responsible for the loss of human lives - before he tried to attach a stigma to the Government - might have had the courtesy to inquire at the Department, when he could have ascertained the facts. </para>

              <para>- A man&#39;s safety in that way does not concern me so much as his political honour. The honorable member for Fremantle, speaking very temperately with respect to the Director of Lighthouses, said that while he did not question the capabilities of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsbotham</inline> as an engineer, he thought a man of nautical or navigation experience should be appointed. I would point out to the honorable member that, though in England Trinity House is controlled by the Trinity House Brethren, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Matthews, the Engineer-in-Chief, is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the lighthouses and for the maintenance of the lighthouse service, and acts generally as adviser to the Brethren. It is the same in Scotland, where the engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> A. Stevenson, attends all meetings of the board and advises as to the sites of lighthouses, but is entirely responsible for the construction and maintenance of them. In the same way <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> W. Scott, the Engineer, is responsible for the Irish lights. In Canada, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> P. Anderson, the Chief Engineer, is responsible for the maintenance of the lights, and in France, which has one of the finest lighthouse systems in the world, the administration is controlled by the Engineer-in-Chief, M. Ribiere. In Australia, three of the State officers are not men of the class the honorable member mentioned. I wish now to pass to the charge which the honorable member for Yarra, and other honorable members, echoing him very faintly, have levelled at me in regard to the transfer of lighthouses. </para>

              <para>- Let us see the exact position with respect to lighthouses. At a Premiers&#39; Conference held in Melbourne, in 1909, the State Premiers agreed that the Commonwealth should take over coastal lights, the control of lights in the ports being retained by the States, and the necessary Bill was drafted and passed through the Senate. It did not come to the House of Representatives because of the very urgent nature of the measures we were passing at the time. However, it was again introduced in 1911 by the honorable member for Yarra, at that time the Minister of Trade and Customs. The honorable member professes his great eagerness to secure Federal control of lighthouses, but, though he had a Bill. drafted for him, it took him two years to get it put on the statute-book, although he was not in any way hampered by lack of a proper parliamentary majority. After the Act was passed the honorable member appointed Commander Brewis to make reports on the location of lighthouses, but if he had been, as he said he was, eager to transfer the lighthouses to the Commonwealth, why could he not have appointed a Director of Lighthouses in 1912, while still allowing this officer to continue making his report ? It could have been done, but the honorable member did not do it. He did not appoint a Director of Lighthouses when he had the opportunity to do so early in 1912; he let the matter drift on, with the result that when the present Government came into office in July last I found that there was an advertisement appearing calling for applications for the position of Director of Lighthouses. </para>

              <para>- I am making no charge against my predecessor over that matter. I simply say that he could have appointed a Director in 1912 had he desired to do so. We appointed a Director, and he took up his duties on the 8th September, 1913. First of all, he had to prepare for the transfer of the whole of the State Departments, he had to inquire into the organization of those Departments, and into the question of light dues, and to lay down the whole basis of the carrying out of the works that were needed during the current year. The most important feature of the Federal control of lighthouses was not merely to take over the officers and continue the existing lights - the States had been doing that all along - but it was the addition of lights - the providing of better lighting on the Australian coast. With my sanction, and with full approval, the Director has given as much attention as possible to pressing forward the construction of all those lights that are necessary for the protection of navigation on our coasts, and the absence of the issue of the proclamation has not delayed in the slightest degree the progress of the lighthouse business. The Director has organized the staff. We have appointed district officers for two of the districts, and they have been to the different reefs and places where lights are to be inspected, and made reports and trial surveys on sites for lighthouses to be built. All the optical apparatus and the material required for construction have been arranged for. The ketches necessary to assist in the construction have been purchased, and the men who are to carry out the work have been engaged. In every way the progress of the erection of these lights has been advanced by the Director. The light at Wilson&#39;s Promontory has been properly equipped. This work was arranged for by my predecessor, who also dealt with the improvements made to Gabo Island. New lights have been installed at Cape Liptrap and Citadel Island. We are making provision to press forward with the new optical apparati for Emery Point and Fort Point, in the Northern Territory. Surveys have been made, and the material provided. Very soon the staffs will be engaged in the construction of the lights on the Inner Barrier Reef, along the coast of Queensland, at Coquette Island, Dhu Reef, Heath Reef, Tih Tih Reef, Chapman Island, Piper Island, and Gierke Island. Also, investigations have been made in connexion with a light at West Point, in Tasmania. We have pressed forward the work of construction in every way possible, and we have endeavoured to take over the administration of the lighthouses, which is not the easy matter that honorable members might think. First of all, we had to make provision for light dues, and since taking office we have investigated this matter. We wrote to the State Premiers in December of last year, pointing out that, as the Commonwealth were taking over the coastal lights, it was not right that the States should continue charging the whole of their light dues, which, in the form of tonnage dues, had been imposed on the shipping of Australia and that from overseas, and we suggested to them that they should make a reduction of light dues corresponding to the relief of expenditure which we were giving to the States, so that the shipping of Australia should not be taxed twice for the same service. Of course, if this tax is imposed, it is going to be passed on to the people whose goods are carried, the farmers and consumers, and we do not want that to happen. We do not want an amount in the neighbourhood of &#163;100,000 of unnecessary taxation imposed, and in order to prevent the imposition of those double dues we have asked the States to remit taxation to the extent that we shall be relieving their expenditure. </para>

Incidentally, I want to refer to the Navigation Act. The honorable member for Yarra found fault with the present Government because we had not brought the Act into operation. I say, deliberately, that there is no man in this House who knows more about the. practical difficulties in the way of bringing that Act into operation than does the ex-Minister, who passed the measure through this House. He knows as well as any other honorable member that there are 100 clauses providing for regulations; he knows that every one of those clauses involves more or less expert investigation ; he knows there are six different systems operating in Australia at the present time; and he knows that those different State systems have to be brought into harmony, that we have to devise regulations in harmony with the spirit of the law we have passed, and that those regulations will require to be considered by the expert Committee which is provided for in the Act itself. My honorable friend further knows that the Commonwealth will have to appoint its own staff, and it will have to establish relations with the different State officers, in order to find out how much is to be done. </para>

              <para>- The position is that the Act is law, but it is not in force. It was known to everybody, when the Act was passed, that months of careful investigation would be necessary before the measure could come into operation. It is easy in this House to pass clauses in a Bill declaring that something should be done, but it is more difficult, when dealing with the ramifications of the trade of Australia and the Departments of the States, to frame regulations that will bring the whole scheme into harmony and make proper and just working conditions for our shipping. So far asthe Government are concerned, that end is being striven for as fast as possible. Many regulations have been framed already, a mass of material has been collected as the basis for framing the regulations in their entirety, and we are in communication with the Imperial authorities in order to obtain information which will enable us to give effect to the recommendations of the recent conference for the regulation of the safety of ships at sea. </para>

              <para>- It was definite, but I am not responsible for that. The application of Captain Davis will be considered conjointly with all other applications which have been made for this position. I desire to make reference now to a matter which, as the speeches of honorable members have indicated, is of great importance to members on both sides of the House. I refer to the operations of trusts in Australia. First of all I desire to make some general remarks in regard to trusts. On both sides of the House strong expressions of opinion have been made that members do not desire to see trusts, which carry on their operations injuriously to the consuming public or to the industries of the community, carrying on those operations in the Commonwealth ; and, as far as the policy of the Government is concerned, we have never hesitated to declare our hostility to trusts of that description. I think that generally expresses the public opinion of Australia on this matter. But when you come to deal with the problem of trusts, and to decide as to the methods by which your legislation is to be carried out, you are confronted with a problem of a very, very serious character indeed, and one which, in the words of a very eminent American, &#34; taxes the capacity of the ablest statesmen that the United States can provide.&#34; Roughly speaking, the remedies of the trust evil have fallen into three classes. Firstly, there are those who contend that the proper remedy is to restore competitive conditions, so that trusts shall not monopolize any trade or industry, or carry on operations in undue restraint of trade. The second method is to regard the existence of a monopoly as the natural outcome of economic conditions, and to assume that the monopoly must grow until it gets complete control of particular branches of industry, when the State shall step in and provide laws regulating the industry by fixing prices. The third remedy which has been suggested is that which has been proposed inAustralia alone, by any responsible body, and that is the nationalization of monopolies. Those are the three remedies which have been suggested. As regards trusts generally, what you have to examine into is the nature of the evil and the trouble that exists in the country. You have to find out what is the cause of the trouble. Then when you have discovered the evil, and ascertained what the wrong is, you must introduce a law to provide a proper and adequate remedy for the disease. That is the proper method of investigating a problem of this kind. It is not to be solved by mere academic considerations. It involves something more than that; it means a very close investigation of the conditions obtaining. TheUnited States Government have appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> E. Davis Commissioner of Corporations in the United States, and have instructed him to investigate trust conditions in that country. In the course of a very able and interesting address which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davisdelivered</inline> recently on this Subject, he pointed out and enumerated the various remedies which have been suggested. </para>

            <para>There are wide variances of belief as to the treatment of this problem. Some maintain that the Sherman law, in its present condition, with a few amendments, is sufficient. Others there are who maintain that the Sherman law, even though amended, is negative in its effect, and not constructive in attacking the problem; that what is needed is not only a declaration of what cannot be done, but a definition of what can legally be done. Some offer in solution an Inter-State trade commission, to proceed upon the theory that monopoly should be frankly recognised and regulated, even to the extent of regulation and control of prices. Others advocate a similar commission, whose object and purpose, however, shall not be to regulate monopoly, but to regulate and control Inter-State business in supplementing the Sherman law by aiding the Courts in the restoration of competitive conditions, and in giving force to the decrees of the Court; charged with the additional power of defining what shall constitute fair and unfair competition, what shall constitute reasonable restraints of trade, and what agreements, now apparently in violation of the Sherman law are not, in fact, in restraint of trade, and should be permitted, together with other similar powers. Still another plan has been suggested which looks to keeping the control of this question more within the province of the individual States, by making it illegal for any corporation to do an inter-state business unless the requirements of its charter, granted by the States respectively, should contain certain inhibitions upon the activity of such corporation, looking to the prevention of the issue of watered stock, to the prevention of interlocking ownership and common directorates, and other similar conditions which are alleged to be the operating causes for the evils of the present condition. </para>

            <para>In the last analysis society is concerned with the question of which of the two types of industrial system is the more advantageous to the general welfare. The question resolves itself into whether the monopolistic system of large units or the competitive system confers the greatest advantage upon society. The advantages and disadvantages of each are questions of fact, and one of the paramount considerations therein is the question of cost of production. The efficiency of an industrial system will bo finally gauged by the people, in a large measure, by the difference in the cost of what they buy; and that system which produces most cheaply, and does not induce other and greater evils than those sought to be remedied, would be regarded as the final economic fact, in a large degree, by the consumer. One of the fundamental facts, then, to bo determined is the question of the efficiency of the trust - the question of whether increase of the size of capital and organization necessarily means a lowering in the cost of production and distribution, to the ultimate advantage of the people who buy. </para>

              <para>- No. As AttorneyGeneral, I was present at, and held, the consultations to settle the initial proceedings in the Coal Vend case. Honorable members opposite hold that the great organizations of wealth are leading up to u state of things which will make it easy to nationalize industries, and they advocate an amendment of the Constitution to enable them to give effect to their policy of nationalization. In the address of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davis,</inline> to which I have referred, the arguments brought against the value of huge industrial concerns are set out very fully; but the time will not permit me to quote them. It is contended that many of these great organizations are successful only so long as the original organizing brains remain at the head of them, or so long as the trust carries on its operations -within a restricted area, because otherwise there is, as with Government control, too much centralization, with consequent weakness in administration ; so that a system which at first created cheapness by its economy in organization, in the end increases the cost of production. It is argued that, for various reasons stated, it is inadvisable to allow huge aggregations of wealth to be controlled by a monopoly. Summing up, however, the Commissioner says - </para>

            <para>At the centre of this great system of trusts there is the question of fact to be determined, if possible. There is now no governmental or other agency engaged in attempting to get scientific information with reference to this fact. It is characteristic of the quality of mind of the  President  of the United States that he should desire facts upon which to base a judgment. It is the intent and purpose of the Bureau of Corporations, acting under tlie direction of the  President  of the United States, to make a survey of the industrial field, and an extensive investigation of this subject. We shall enter into this investigation with the sole intent of working out, in a scientific and fair-minded spirit, the facts absolutely as they are. So vital and so fundamental is this problem that to attack it in any other spirit would be criminal. What is needed is light - not heat. The problem bristles with difficulties; it seems a tremendous undertaking. It will demand an increased appropriation from Congress to enable us to have the men and means at our command. The results of this investigation may not coincide with all that we hope to procure. We can, however, obtain some facts that will at least contribute to a correct interpretation of industrial conditions as they exist. </para>

          <para>The  President  of the United States lays it down as a fundamental basis that, before there can be legislation on this subject, there must be an economic inquiry to ascertain the facts. Honorable members opposite have continually attacked the Sherman law, and have stated repeatedly that it is inoperative; that it is useless as a means of restraining trusts, affording no remedy against them. But in 1911 Congress appointed a Committee to report upon the operation of the existing laws affecting trusts, and the Committee reported, concerning the Sherman law, that it should stand as the fundamental law on the subject, and - </para>

            <para>The Committee will not at this time enter upon an extended argument respecting the policy of maintaining competition or competitive conditions in the business of the country. lt is well understood that there are many distinguished students and highly-trained thinkers who believe that the age of competition is past, and that for the struggle which competition involves there should be substituted combination and co-operation, under such regulation and supervision as will protect the people from the oppression of monopolistic power. And added to the students and thinkers who have reached this conclusion through mere observation and investigation, there are many engaged in commerce, and who, therefore, speak from a practical stand-point, who have also concluded that some form of regulated monopoly or concentration should be adopted. All these men, whether theorists or otherwise, admit that if we abandon the effort to maintain competition the Government must undertake, directly or indirectly, to fix prices for the combinations or monopolies. </para>
            <para>Then it adds this very important finding </para>
            <para>The Committee feels that the time has not yet come for so radical a departure from the long established policy of the country, and it hopes that the time may never come when it will be necessary for the Government to assume the  task of establishing prices for general commodities. It believes that the progress of the world depends in a large measure upon that fair, reasonable rivalry among men which has hitherto characterized the advances of civilization. It is frequently declared that the law cannot compel men employed in like business to compete with each other. There is a sense in which this is true, but it is only technically true. What is meant when we use the phrase &#34; maintaining competition&#34; is maintaining competitive conditions. We can both create and maintain competitive conditions, and, until human nature is revolutionized, when competitive conditions exist, there will be actual competition; but if for some extraordinary reason that should fail there will be, at least, a potential competition tending to prevent undue prices and unfair practices. Without going further into the issue between regulated competition and regulated monopoly, the Committee reiterates its finding that the anti-trust Statute should stand, and that every possible effort to create and preserve competitive conditions should be made. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Coming back to the three points: the restoration of competitive conditions, the control of monopolies, and the nationalization of monopolies, the &#34;United States Committee reported strongly in favour of the existing legislation, but urged that it should be amended in order to thoroughly restore competitive conditions in the country. In other words, the Committee advocated the continuance of the antitrust legislation of the United States of America. It would not consent to the regulation of prices, as advocated by honorable members opposite, and the question of nationalization is not even mentioned. When the Labour party are faced with an investigation into the question of nationalization of any particular industry, they will meet with only a reiteration of the findings of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Industry. </para>

            <para>Advocates of the public ownership of industry rightly dwell upon the avoidance of the wastes of competition. But, in the case of the refining industry in Australia, such wastes are negligible. Further, taking into consideration the various difficulties with which public ownership has to contend, and the high efficiency of the present refining business in Australia, we do not think that the public ownership of the refineries woud prove as financially successful as the present private ownership. </para>

            <para>The cost of nationalizing the refining industry would involve an initial capital outlay of some millions by the time allowance had been made for the costs of refineries, goodwill, floating capital, &#38;c.

            <para>Such profits&#39; as it does make on its refining are made under existing conditions - conditions which give to its plant a value in excess of earning capacity under the altered conditions which would be involved in nationalization. In the general result we cannot avoid the conclusion that the Commonwealth Treasury would be involved in a heavy financial loss, unless it were prepared to make higher demands on the consumers than is necessary under a system of &#39; private owned industry subject to appropriate regulation. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member&#39;s interjection reminds me that the honorable member for Yarra claimed that he had done a splendid thing in raising the wages of the employes in the sugar industry, and that the increase had been approved by the Royal Commission, as well as by the Queensland Court. The facts are that the Royal Commission, however, approved of an increase in wages concurrently with relief being granted to the grower, and that the Queensland Court only allowed the increased wages after the growers&#39; capacity to pay them had been increased as the result of Commonwealth legislation. I desire, in conclusion, to refer to the Beef Trust. The Government have not been oblivious of the importance of this question, although the honorable member for Yarra, when speaking at Ballarat recently, blamed us for not dealing with the trust.  His  own excuse for his inaction used to be that the Commonwealth Parliament had not power to deal with the trust- </para>

              <para>- I did not say that the honorable member personally criticised or revised the plans. I said they were revised by the Department. The Minister, however, knew what was going on. Early in August, 1912, he knew that the Beef Trust was going to commence operations in Australia. He was in office during the whole of that year, and had a complete majority in this House as well as in the Senate. He was familiar with the law, and its limitations. He knew that if the company submitted plans and specifications of its works to the Department, and acted as ordinary citizens, he had no power to refuse its request. He knew the law as it existed witu respect to monopolies, because the Attorney-General had been prosecuting a suit in connexion with it. Indeed, on certain aspects of that law he had consulted the Crown Law Department. In view of all these facts, how was it that during all this time, if the law was defective, he did not bring in a Bill to amend it so as to enable him to deal with this trust? Honorable members opposite found it much better to do nothing, and use the position as political capital. </para>

              <para>- What a splendid remedy! If every referenda proposal had been carried the position, would not have altered in the slightest degree, because an Act would have had to be framed under the powers conferred. As I say, honorable members opposite regarded this merely as a piece of political platform work, and never treated it as a serious problem. After the present Government took office special instructions were given to the officers of the Department to be particularly careful in watching the operations of the alleged trusts, and to report on all concerning them. Every important movement that was noticed was examined and investigated, and, as far as possible, the Department has been closely watching events. It is only fair to say that, so far, the Government do not find themselves in a position, under the existing law, to initiate any prosecution in connexion with the meat industry. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to go into the details, but another establishment has been acquired, and individual Americans have been exporting meat; but no fault can be found with those Americans so long as they comply with the law. The Government fully realize the evil, not only of a meat trust, but of any other trusts which may grow and assume control of the export trade; and, accordingly, two Bills have been drafted, and will be submitted to the House. It has been decided, on the determination of the present motion, to appoint a Royal Commission to make a searching investigation into operations of the alleged trust in connexion with the meat industry, with a view to ascertaining the facts and to assisting the Government in the administrative exercise of the powers which it is proposed to confer by the Bills referred to in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. This Commission, I may say, will be instructed to report promptly; but the Prime Minister, when the course is clear, will announce move fully the intentions of the Government in this connexion. Pending the report of the Royal Commission, the Bills I have referred to will be submitted. The Government are prepared to investigate, and, where necessary, take action to protect the primary producers or the consumers from the effects of any injurious trusts. The meat industry is a very important one to Australia. I should like to read the following minute, which was approved by my predecessor, the honorable member for Yarra&#39;: - </para>

              <para>- I was pointing out that the importance of- the meat industry to Australia cannot be overestimated. In 1909 we exported 635,199 cwt. of beef, and 1,954,630 cwt. in 1913, the increase in value being from &#163;733,210 to &#163;2,652,275. Of mutton and lamb, we exported 1,430,889 cwt: in 1909, and 1,829,748 cwt. in 1913, the value increasing in&#39; that time from &#163;1,231,035 to &#163;2,S9 6,532. In the same period, the export of canned meats rose proportionately from 20S,169 cwt. to 465,626 cwt., with an increase in value from &#163;4&#34;21,000 to &#163;1,084,000. Honorable members will realize how important these figures are to us in Australia. We are important providers for the markets in the United Kingdom. I have a table here analyzing and comparing the supplies of beef, mutton, and lamb from various sources imported and home grown, and available for consumption in the United Kingdom in 1913. Australia provided 8.25 per cent, of the total consumption; New Zealand, 6.69 per cent.; and South America, 10.12 per cent.; a total of 25.6 per cent., all being frozen. That is the percentage of frozen meat of the total consumed of imported and home-grown meats. Of chilled meats, South America supplied 262,400. tons; and the United States and Canada, 401 tons : a total of 262,801 tons, or 14.38 per cent, of the total supplied, 39.44 per cent. That is, of .the total consumption 39.44 per cent, represents frozen and chilled meat imported. The countries mentioned supplied 39.44 per cent, of the total of all meat, imported and home-grown, consumed in the United Kingdom. It will be seen that both England and Australia are vitally interested. We are driven to the conclusion, that, in dealing with international trade, so far as trusts are concerned, our efforts must wear an international aspect, and the several countries interested will have to enter into agreement so that due effect may be given to the legislation passed for the protection of producers and consumers all over the world. With that object in view, the legislation to be submitted to this House will enable Australia to cooperate with the Mother Country, and1 with the Dominions, and other nations, in order to obtain effective control. Even if we nationalized the meat industry here, and exported every pound of meat through Government agencies and from&#39; Government farms, we should find ourselves powerless when we came to deal with the import trade in Great Britain, if trust control prevail there. All we can do at present is to control our export trade; and if meat trusts in the United Kingdom or elsewhere got control of the British markets, we should, as I say, find ourselves practically helpless. This point is referred to in the excellent report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> on the supply and distribution of meat, but to that report I have time to make only this passing reference. The Government realize the importance of the problem, and they are prepared to appoint a Royal Commission to obtain information on which adequate steps may be taken. </para>

              <para>- The workmen and others have been engaged in erecting these works for some considerable time. As to the rise in the price of meat, many of us remember the time when the primary products of Australia were practically valueless, and when there was no real encouragement for farmers, pastoralists, or any other producers. Great wealth has come to Australia through the extension of our operations, by means of better steam-ship accommodation and other agencies, in the markets of the world, and through the increased price of wheat, wool, and meat. Our factories do not export, but merely supply local wants, and the millions of money which come into Australia, in return for our great primary products, have helped to increase the wages of the artisans in the cities. The hope of all Australians is that our products may continue to go abroad, and that the added wealth may result in higher standards of living for the whole nation. Incidentally, of course, we have to face certain consequences. If we export our wheat, and reap the advantage of higher prices in the markets of the world, the farmers must get the advantage; but the wealth that comes to Australia affords employment for the whole of the people. The cost of wheat and flour may rise here, and our clothing and meat may cost a little more. The higher the prices abroad, the more money will come here, and be made available for distribution amongst the working men, with a rise in the standard of living, and the removal of any anxiety for the future development of the nation. As to associations, we must penalize only those which act injuriously - which use the powers they possess to make the people pay more than they otherwise would pay in open market. However, these are matters of farreaching importance, which we shall, no doubt, have an opportunity to discuss later on. I have had prepared for me by the Customs officials in Western Australia and Queeusland a return showing last week&#39;s prices for beef and mutton in Perth and Brisbane. This return shows that, while the price of the sirloin was 5 1/2 d. in Brisbane, it was 7d. at the Government butchery in Perth, and 6d. at private butcheries. For ribs the prices were: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Brisbane, 4d.; Government butchery, Perth, 5d.; private butcheries, 6d. For top-side, the prices were 4d. in Brisbane, against 7d. at the Government butchery and private butcheries, Perth. _ Again, in regard to mutton, legs &#39; sold at 5 1/2 d. in Brisbane, against 7d. in Perth at the Government butchery and private butcheries, and loins were selling at 5&#163;d. in Brisbane, against 7d. at the  Government butchery, Perth, and 8d. in private butcheries, Perth. I could give further details, but they are not necessary. There may be local causes operating, but these are the latest figures I could get, and they indicate that, even in Perth, where there is no trust in existence, high prices can prevail as against Queeusland, which is supposed to be ridden by the trust. I only plead for fairness in the discussion of public questions, that honorable members will analyze things fairly, and get at the truth on the known facts. That is all I plead for. It is the way in which the Department is conducted, and I trust and believe that, from both sides of the House, the Department will receive co-operation in the endeavour to assist the producers and consumers of Australia in relation to her primary industries. </para>

              <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation in connexion with a matter raised by the honorable member concerning the application made by the Australian Meat Company, known by every one to be a branch of the American Beef Trust. They sent in an application to me in December, 1912. They need not have done so; they could have gone to the Brisbane office. I think the Minister will agree with me that applications in regard to premises do not usually come to the head office. </para>

            <para>. - I may intimate at once that I intend to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and I have reasons for so doing. I have asked myself why Parliament has been called together so early in the year. I object to this great National Parliament being used by any party in the House with the object of trying to destroy something which the electors created to exist for three years. In the Speech of the Governor-General we have an admission of incompetency on the part of the Government. They declare that they have been unable to carry on the government as they would like. They have put it in type that the last session was barren, and that they have called Parliament together because of that barrenness. Further, they have distinctly stated their intention to bring about chaos, and that they will not attempt to do those things which in 1913 they promised the electors they would do.

I see nothing urgent in them; in fact, they both reek with the odour of &#34;bluff.&#34; This plea of urgent business is nothing but a put-up job to delude and fool those who supported Ministers in 1913.

          <para class="block">It is quite clear to me that the only urgent public business before this Parliament to-day is the two Bills which the Government propose to introduce, and which were brought down to Parliament last session. But how can a Bill be Urgent that deals at the most with not more than 3,000 people in the Commonwealth ? Will the bulk of the electors consider the Government Preference Prohibition Bill urgent business, especially in view of the fact that this Parliament years ago indorsed the very action which was put into effect by the Fisher Administration - that is, granting preference to unionists in the Commonwealth service? And it only applies to casual labour. Many thousands in the Commonwealth service are working under the Public Service Act, which is administered by a Commissioner, and this preference to unionists applies to the casual labourers only; but if the Government do go to the country on this question, they will again fool the people by telling them that the matter applies to every civil servant in the employ of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I have never known the Fusionists to do anything else but mislead the public on every question that is before them. I for one would be quite willing, and so would my party, to go to the country if the true question were put&#39; to the people, namely, that this preference to unionists is confined to the 2,000 or 3,000 casual employes in the Commonwealth. We will help the Government to pass their Bill quickly. I can speak on behalf of my party when I say that if the Government will put to the people the only question that is occupying the attention of the House to-day, we will pass their Bill quickly. But we cannot trust the Government. They will bring forward every possible outside issue in order to mislead the public? That is their game, and it is our duty to tell the people what the intentions of the Government are. The Arbitration Act passed by this National Parliament gives the Court power to grant preference to unionists, and surely if this Parliament thought it right to give the Court power to make that concession to employes outside the Government, thus placing an obligation on private employers, it is also right for the Government to follow out tile principle contained in that enactment, and mete out the same justice to their own employes. That being the case, I fail to see why the Fisher Administration should have been slandered as they have been by their opponents. Then, in regard to the other Bill which the Government propose to introduce in order to bring about a dead-lock, namely, that for the restoration of the postal vote, if the Labour party thought that nothing wrong would be done by our opponents in connexion with the collection of postal votes, we would be prepared to pass that Bill also. Last session we were prepared to concede all that was necessary. The honorable member for Hunter moved to insert a clause which had for its object the giving of a vote to the sick and infirm, subject to that provision having a responsible person to operate it, so that no wrong should be done. Is it not a fact that, under the old system of postal voting, half the votes in the Commonwealth could have been so recorded ? I make bold to say that our opponents discovered what they had missed, and regretted that they had not made much more use than they did of the system, although they used it pretty freely, I admit. They know that if they could get the postal vote restored into the Electoral Act in the form in which it was operative four years ago, they would have a chance of continuing in office, because of The money power they possess to manipulate that vote. But knowing what wrong could be done under that system, the Labour party introduced into the Electoral Act a new system whereby this canvassing method was abolished, and the wrongful obtaining of thousands of votes before the proper election day was blocked. How many people were actually disfranchised by the abolition of the postal vote? Was not the poll at the elections of 1913 greater than that recorded at any previous election? In face of that fact, can the Government come forward, and say that the electors have been deprived of anything? They cannot; the increased vote in 1913 shows that no wrong had been done to any elector in Australia. I am quite willing to give the sick a vote, provided it is obtained in the proper way, and that can only be done by some Commonwealth officer being present, and witnessing the recording of that vote. More than that I shall never concede while I am a member of this House, because our opponents, who are the Conservatives of Australia, and who can find money to fight the labour party, would manipulate the vote on account of the position that has been created in party politics. Knowing what the Labour party is doing, and will do in five years, if the present Electoral Act continues in operation, the Liberal party feel that they have no possible chance of capturing the Senate or the House of Representatives at the next election. </para>

              <para>- We are glad. But we are not going to give away the principles which we have placed on the statute-book in order that the Prime Minister may bluff us by his threatened dissolution. Does the honorable member think he is going to bluff us out of our opinions? I do not think so. The Prime Minister has confessed to this country on more than one occasion that he is incompetent to carry on the business of the Commonwealth. What did he and his supporters, and nearly every &#34;Fusion candidate, do at the last election? Did they not promise the farmers, squatters, and orchardists throughout the Commonwealth that they would amend the Arbitration Act so that the rural workers would not come under its operation ? That was distinctly promised in my electorate. If the Government will bring in a Bill for that purpose it will be a direct challenge to the Arbitration Act as it exists on the statute-book to-day, and the Labour party will assist the Government to test public opinion on that matter. As a member of this Parliament, I do object, however, to being placed in a false position by the Government bringing down a proposal for prohibition of preference to unionists, which only applies to a handful of people, although they would make it appear to the country that the principle applies to every person in the Commonwealth service. During the &#39;last election, and also during last session, we were told by the Government what they would do, but they have never attempted to put into effect anything that they promised the electors. Personally, I would like to see the Prime Minister in office for the term of this Parliament, because I would know that when he did go to the country that would be the end of him and his party, simply because of the incompetence which he has already admitted to the people. </para>

              <para>- I say that the Cabinet, which is the Government, can only exist by authority of Parliament, and, that being so, surely the Fisher Administration had a perfect right when they were  in office to carry out something which they believed to be their policy. Suppose the Labour Government had not given preference to unionists among the casual employes&#39; in the Commonwealth Service, they would have been twitted with that fact, but because they did give effect to their policy they are blamed. The Labour Government boldly declared their intentions, and carried out that in which they believed by giving preference to unionists in the Commonwealth Service. I want to know what our opponents have been doing during the last fifty years in Australia ? They have been giving preference, but they have never openly declared it. They are doing the same thing now, but will not declare it, and I ask whom will the people of </para>

          <para>Australia believe - will they believe in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and his party or in the present Prime Minister and his supporters? One party gives preference openly as part of its policy, and the other party gives it secretly, and denies that it does so. We have seen preference given to nonunionists, preference to contractors, preference to friends. Would it not be better for the Government to drop these silly Bills and bring forward some of the -so-called policy which they put before the people in 1913 ? Did they support the Labour party&#39;s Federal land tax, or did they condemn it throughout the country? Yet the Prime Minister is existing to-day on that very land tax,- and collecting &#163;1,250,000 in revenue from it. </para>

              <para>- Of course, they would. Did they believe in the Commonwealth note issue when it was passed through this Parliament! Yet they are existing on that to-day. Did they believe in the Commonwealth Bank which we established? As a matter of fact, they condemned that also. The Treasurer now admits that the Government have not sufficient power over that bank. He affirms that the Governor of the Bank has too rauch power, and that he as Treasurer knows very little about its operations. Yet if the Fisher Ministry had attempted  to make that institution in any way a party bank their action would have been unsparingly denounced by honorable members opposite. The fact is that we created a bank which is above suspicion so far as party politics are concerned. </para>

              <para>- Then he is more plucky than the Prime Minister has been. The Government have been in existence for eighteen months without accomplishing anything. I am reminded by the honorable member for South Sydney that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank called for tenders for the contract to which reference has just been made by the Prime Minister. During the session of 1912 we heard a lot about a scheme of national insurance, in which honorable members opposite firmly believe. We heard a great deal about it during the last election campaign. The honorable member for Wilmot was great upon it. He pitted it against the maternity allowance and the invalid and old-age pensions. He declared that that scheme would cover all these contingencies, and that the whole of the people of Australia would have to contribute to it. This is the second session during which the Cook Administration have been in office, yet I do not hear anything about that matter. Are they afraid to interfere with the maternity allowance which they condemn? They dare not do it. Will they alter the Oldage Pensions Act? </para>

              <para>- It is well known that the Government opposed the principal clauses of the Navigation Act, which are humanitarian in their character. Have we heard anything about the repeal of that Act? Honorable members opposite were all smiles when the measure was passing through this Chamber. They were satisfied that it would never receive the Royal assent. We were told that it was so clumsily drawn, and that its provisions conflicted so much with Imperial legislation, that it would never obtain the Royal assent. But it did. It has had that assent for eight months, and yet it has not been proclaimed. The present Government is a Government of incompetents. </para>

              <para>- I am very kind. I speak only once or twice in a session, and I extend every consideration to the Government. I wish to point out that every day that steamers travel between Melbourne and Tasmania the safety of valuable lives is imperilled. We have a steamer which leaves Melbourne for Launceston three times a week, and which frequently carries from 300 to 500 passengers. That vessel is not fitted with wireless telegraphy, although wireless telegraphy is used now upon almost every passenger ship. The company owning this vessel holds a contract from the Government for the carriage of the Tas- manian mails for the next seven years. Yet, notwithstanding that on each trip it carries a large number of passengers, it has no wireless on board. Nor is it properly equipped in the matter of life-saving appliances. I will stake my existence that when there are 400 or 500 passengers on board there are not half enough boats to accommodate them in case of accident on the high seas. I want to know why this company should be granted an extension of its contract in view of its treatment of the people of Australia. </para>

              <para>- There is another matter that I wish to bring under the notice of the House. In Tasmania we are suf fering from what is known as a ring of saw-millers. A very strong combination of saw-mills exists, so that it is impossible for orchardists, especially in the north of Tasmania, to get fruit cases for the packing of their fruit unless they deal with a certain merchant. That merchant has an agreement with all the saw-millers that the latter are not to supply orchardists and others with timber unless it first passes through his hands. </para>

              <para>- They are paying between 6d. and-7d. per case for cases delivered. These saw-millers in one portion of Tasmania had the impudence to convene a meeting for the purpose of forming an association with the specific object of raising the price of timber to the consumers. In this connexion I propose to read a paragraph which was published in the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> on the 5th February of this year. It is as follows : - </para>

          <para>This afternoon a meeting was held to form a sawmillers&#39; association on the north-west coast. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> G. Blackwell presided, and representatives of the following firms were present :  - Grey Bros, and Lee &#38; Co., Smithton; the Burnie Brick and Timber Co., Wynyard Co., Austral Co., and Pilbeam and Coy., Burnie; and the Tasmania Co., Rocky Cape. After forming the association, it was decided to protest to the Inter-State Commission against the removal of the duty on Oregon timber. Another object the association has in view is to try to raise the price of hardwood. </para>

            <para>The Chief Secretary will be written to, asking for equal representation on the Timber Industry Wages Board, as the employ&#233;s at present have an extra representative thereon. It was agreed to co-operate with other associations already in the State, in order to secure mutual interests. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What effect will that have upon every orchardist and every person in Tasmania who requires scantling or hardwood timber for building purposes? Here is an open confession that these five or six sawmillers on the north-west coast of Tasmania have formed themselves into an association for the specific purpose of raising the price of timber, and that they are going to affiliate with other associations to secure their mutual interests and to give effect to their resolution. That being so, I desire to know whether there is any Act in existence under which these sawmillers can be treated as a combine. We have their open declaration that they have formed themselves into an association with the one object of raising the price of timber to the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly. For years past we have admitted that the members of trade unions join those organizations for the express purpose of bettering themselves, of bettering the conditions of their wives and children, and of securing that increased payment for their labour to which they are justly entitled. But although our opponents condemn the existence of these unions, they are now copying their example. They are doing exactly the same thing. </para>

The Prime Minister must admit that that is their intention. Surely that is not a worthy object. The Prime Minister&#39;s party were beaten fairly and squarely in the Senate elections for 1913, and he came into power in this House by a majority of one, represented by yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> He has said himself that you, sir, constituted his majority, and it is because of the position in which he finds himself that he is deliberately trying to bring about a result which was never contemplated when the Constitution was being framed. </para>

              <para>- Just so; but it is an unworthy action on the part of the Prime Minister, who has been intrusted by the electors with power through the possession of a small majority in this House, to call Parliament together with the object of actually creating an artificial dead-lock.  His  plain duty is to bring forward the policy that he announced on the platform. He never announced either of the two so-called test measures. He did not tell the people of the Commonwealth in the electoral campaign that he was going to bring in a Bill to prohibit the giving of preference to unionists in the Public Service only. But he did tell them something else. He told them about all the legislation that we had passed, and that was not beneficial to Australia. He told them of the extravaganceof the Fisher Administration; and, in the face of those statements, he has actually spent &#163;4,000,000 more in the year that he has been in office than the Fisher Administration did, and his Customs revenue is falling fast. It is nearly &#163;1,000,000 behind now, and he has to fall back on the surplus that was left by my leader in order to balance the ledger. He is going to take the money out of the Trust Funds that my leader left. </para>

              <para>- That is a nice, jocular way for the honorable gentleman to try to laugh himself out of the difficulty; but he knows that what I am saying is a fact. If he will act decently for once in his life to the people who supported him in Australia, he will come forward with Bills to repeal the Federal land tax, the Australian notes issue, the Commonwealth Bank, the maternity allowance, and invalid pensions. If he does that, he will have kept his word to the people; but, by introducing these two test Bills, such as they are, and calling this Parliament together in order to create an artificial crisis, with the ulterior object of securing a double dissolution, he is deliberately fooling the people. </para>

            <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition, when moving his censure amendment, accused the Prime Minister and the Government generally of having two entrance doors to the public offices - a front and a side door. He forgot to mention that there was also a back door. I often see the Prime Minister dodging in through that door myself. If there was one thing more than another that all the Government candidates throughout the length and breadth of Australia told the people during the last campaign it was that they stood for purity of administration. In what way have the Government brought it about? To denounce preference to unionists, which means that all who come in through the front door come in free, and come in equal, and to tell certain contractors that if they wanted anything on the quiet they must come round to the side, is a very peculiar way of bringing about purity of administration, yet that is the way the Government have adopted. If there is anything that calls for publicity it is the letting of contracts for public works, but that is not how the Government let the Teesdale Smith contract. The honorable member for Parkes, who from his party point of view was a very successful Minister of Public Works in New South Wales in days gone by, himself said in this House that the proper course was to call for public tenders. Had the Government done so in this case no one could have cavilled, but I must candidly confess that when I first read about this contract in the press it looked to me very like a job. When I read the leader published in March last in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - an organ which previously took the Prime Minister under its wing, and backed him up through thick and thin - I said, &#34; There is something more in this than I thought.&#34; 1 want to say now, however, that there is no job in this business at all. It is simply a woeful act of maladministration. 1 claim to have some knowledge of this business, as I was travelling ganger for a railway contractor for five and a half years, and helped to make up quantities for earthworks, bridges, ballasting, and relaying for many lines in Queensland. During the same period, the honorable member for Herbert was, as it were, in the opposite camp, being what I might call Government inspector. </para>

              <para>- He got it fairly in open competition so far as I know, and I can assure the House that he knows something about this subject. If the Prime Minister did not know anything about this contract, why did he not get expert advice? I am sure the right honorable memberfor Swan could not have been in Melbourne at the time. If he had been he would never have allowed such a contract to go through. As an old hand at the game himself he knew what contractors were to deal with. Let me tell the Prime Minister that he will not be done with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, even when he pays him up for his contract. There will be a few extras that will have to be paid for. No wonder the present Government like contractors. There are eight or nine lawyers in the Cabinet, and they know very well that handing out contracts <inline font-style="italic">ad libitum</inline> now will mean plenty of grain to come into the granary by-and-by, when the contractors make their claims for extras. The honorable member knows that, because I read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> many years ago how he denounced contractors for these very practices. The honorable member, however, is bound to do something for the contractors. He promised them that he would do away with day labour if he got into power; but let me tell him that there is no day labour on any of our Australian railway systems. It is all direct labour with the Government. The difference between that and contract labour is that, with direct labour, you get a better job, there is no scamping, and there are no deviations to be made, or, if any alterations have to be made in bridging, tunnelling, or laying the roads, it is done without any extra expense. In the contracting days, once we started deviating, even if it was only a yard of muck, we used to make the Government pay for it through the nose. Certain honorable members, particularly the honorable member for New England, have defended the price which the Government are paying for this contract. The honorable member for New England said that there were no extras in the contract, and that 10 per cent. had been stopped from the total amount to be paid. He did not mention that when the contract was completed to the satisfaction of the engineer that 10 per cent. would have to be paid. The &#163;1,000 that the contractor is putting up, and the penalty of &#163;5 per day for delay in completing the works, are mere fleabites. One important point is the payment for the banks, about which there has been so much controversy. My experience is that if we were paid for the muck work out of the side cuttings we did very well. In the whole of my experience - and I put in prices for contractors for hundreds of thousands of yards of muck on different railways in Queensland - I have never once known the contractor to be paid for the bank in addition to the side cutting. The contract price for the side cutting was 2s. 6d. a yard to bank, never 4s. 6d. a yard for taking out of the cutting, and an additional 2s. 6d. a yard for putting the muck to bank. Why, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith is making a little fortune out of this contract. He will make about half profit. The Government have put forward the excuse that they let the work in this hurried manner because &#34;Time was the essence of the contract.&#34; But what do we find? There is a gap of 12 miles between the head of the road and the portion completed by the contractor. According to a man who has been there, they have only just started to clear that section of 12 miles. Where is the hurry? That throws that plea to the wind at once. Why was it done? Had they called for tenders nobody could have offered an objection. Then just before Parliament met, the Minister came down and said that the reason why they were in a hurry to get <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith to take on the job was that he had a plant right on hand, and that if a contract was not let within so many days he would take his plant away, and have nothing to do with the work. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. We found out afterwards that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith had not as much plant there as a wheelbarrow. Here is where the lack of administration came in. If the Minister of Home Affairs could not devote the whole of his time to this business, and therefore, had to hand it over to the Honorary Minister, why did he not get the advice of experts who had been at the game? There was formerly in this Parliament an expert who is second to no man in Australia. Had the Prime Minister consulted this man I am satisfied in my own mind that no contract would have been let to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith. The way in which the contract was let was most peculiar. There were no plans, no specifications, no sections. Nothing was known about the work when the contract was let. Unless a man has been over the survey, bored some trial holes, and put in some paddocks to know the nature of the cuttings and the banks, how can he know whether he is offered a fair price for the work? Let me describe the procedure which was observed by the contractor for whom I worked before he went in for a contract. In Queensland, the contract for a railway job was not settled in a day. On the contrary, it occupied weeks. When the schedules went in, the contractor with the lowest tender was sent for ; the whole of the contractors and their engineering staffs met the engineer&#39;s staff and the Commissioner ofRailways and discussed the schedules. In this case, however, there was no schedule to discuss. The contractor was told in effect, &#34; Go ahead ; do as you can ; do as you will, and we will pay you 4s. 6d. a yard for the work done in the cutting, and for everything over a lead of a chain and a half we will give you another 2s. 6d. a yard.&#34; Mind you, sir, 7s. a yard is not too much when a man comes to have a long lead on, because he has to pay for the horses and the haulage, and the bank has to be made. A bank that has to be made by horses and drays is worse for the contractor, and better for the Government, than a bank made up by barrows from the side cutting. If you are going to measure up the bank after that is done, you will pay double for it, at any rate, a third more, because you cannot get a solid yard of muck into the space of a cubic yard. The Prime Minister knows that if a skip of coal is taken out it cannot be got back into the hole. When this matter comes to be analyzed by honorable members, they will see the terrible mistake which has been made. Had the Minister taken <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges</inline> into his confidence, and asked his opinion about the matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith would never have got this contract. It it a most peculiar thing that when this work was being contracted for, and the interviews were taking place, the principals were never there, but always a clerk, a friend, or a brother. Why have those gentlemen present; why not have the principals? In the first place I wish to ask the Prime Minister these questions - </para>

Had the Government called for tenders, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> been the lowest tenderer, the position would have been different. Our policy is one of direct work between the Government and the men, whereas their policy is the contract system. Had they called for public tenders, and done the thing as it should have been done, no one could have cavilled, because that is their policy. It is all very well for the Prime Minister, and other Ministers, to say that the bottom is knocked out of the opposition to this contract. If that is the case, why should they publish excuses and comparisons in every newspaper they can employ in Australia? </para>

If Smith has only got a small contract of 14 miles, why is this man being engaged for the three years? </para>

              <para>- I hope that the Government will call for public tenders before they let another yard of railway, seeing that they have called for tenders in the case of other work. Contract labour, I repeat, is the policy of the Government. They have to placate their friends. They told their friends that they were going to burst up the daylabour system, and that everything was going to be done by contract labour. They are only carrying out what they told the people they would do, but for goodness&#39; sake let them do the thing fairly and squarely. I can quite understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms</inline> was so quiet. </para>

          <para class="block">Government may let work on the daylabour system to a butty-gang, or any number of men who may agree to take a sub-contract. The point is that the relation of the men is direct with the Government. The saving under what we call the day-labour system is made not because the work is actually done more cheaply, but is due to the reduction in the cost of supervision. It is not necessary to have an army of inspectors and engineers to see that work under the day-labour system is carried out properly, but under the contract system there must be strict supervision of all work carried out by a contractor. If there is not strict supervision of contract work oh a railway, it will be found that the cost of maintenance will be considerable when the railway is taken over. I have not been over the ground, but I venture to say that it will cost more to maintain the section of the transcontinental railway carried out by contract than it will to maintain any section completed under the day-labour system </para>

The Prime Minister said last week that the present Government treat their workmen much better than did the Labour Government. I wish now just to show how the present Government are treating the men on the transcontinental railway.

              <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline>In reference to the transcontinental railway, it is about time that the public knew some of the facts. It is said that day labour is proving itself a failure, but the position is that the day labour system is being deliberately strangled by the Government. At the Port Augusta end of the line as far as conditions are concerned, absolute chaos exists. Private enterprise in the matter of stores has &#34; fallen down &#34; completely, and the workmen are living under the most deplorable conditions. One gang of over 40 men were left without bread or groceries for nearly ten days, and this out in a waterless wilderness, 83 miles from the nearest town. All along the line, in a greater or in a lesser degree, the same complaints are made. The men are suffering from hunger and privation, and large numbers are continually leaving for this cause. Repeated promises&#39; have been made that departmental stores would he improved, but conditions are, if anything, worse now than at any time since the line started. One storekeeper has a monopoly of the trade, and it is a matter of public gossip in Port Augusta that certain officials have a financial interest in the present arrangements. </para>

            <para>Whatever the cause may be, the results are enough to ruin any enterprise, whether contract or otherwise. During the past few weeks a large number of new employ&#233;s have been put on. With the usual blundering shortsightedness, that draws high salaries on this job, no tents or tent poles were available, and nearly 100 men are now living like dingoes under the shelter of the scanty saltbush, or coiled up in concrete pipes and other places to escape the elements. Some of these men have been sleeping on the ground and without tents for over three weeks, waiting for the Department to unwind its red tape. Just before the holidays the riding ganger at the head of the road sent for 60 men. When the men got on the works it was discovered that there were no shovels for them, and many of them had to tramp off the job. Some of the men were charged for riding back on the construction train to Port Augusta. For the convenience of the men and the protection of tradesmen and boardinghonse-keepers procuration orders were allowed right from the start of the job. Now, however, some four-guinea clerk has put his foot on the system, and large numbers of men without funds and without credit have been compelled to leave the works. </para>

          <para>I know the conditions on these railway works, and I can sympathize with these men. When I was working on railways in western Queensland, I know that many men, and particularly immigrants, were sent out to the works without a tent to cover them, or a shilling in their pockets. They were just dumped down at the rail head to do the best they could. I thought that those days were past in Australia. Surely the Minister can do something to alleviate the sufferings of the poor devils who go out to this line to do a hard day&#39;s toil. </para>

          <para>The late Government gave the employ&#233;s in Port Augusta free firewood, but now the order has gone forth that only &#34;the staff&#34; are to receive it. This represents a reduction in wages, but it applies only to the underpaid men at the bottom; the high-priced officials are still to get their wood free. These items, selected almost at random from a multitude of similar nature, are given as illustrations. A deliberate attempt is being made to goad the employ&#233;s into reprisals and to strangle the day-labour system. This, at any rate, is my conviction. - </para>

              <para>- I have nothing more to say about the Teesdale Smith contract, except to express &#39; the hope that in the future the Minister, when not satisfied that he is fully informed, will obtain expert evidence from outside the Department. Had he asked the opinion of a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> who is one of the most successful contractors in Australia, he would have been set on the right track. From what I know of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> I am certain that he would have been only too pleased to give the Minister the benefit of his advice. Passing away from that, I wish to refer to what the Government is doing for the producers. Honorable members opposite, especially the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, continually proclaim themselves to be the friends of the farmers, and declare that their mission is to make the lot of the farmers easier and better. I ask them what they have done for the small growers who are nOt members of the Dried Fruit Defence Association. If a retailer of sultanas, raisins, or currants buys dried fruits, except from the association, he loses at the end of the season a rebate of |d. per lb. which would otherwise be paid to him. This prevents the small growers from selling their fruit. The retailers have to swear a solemn declaration that their statements are absolutely true, and the cast-iron rules of the association thus prevent the small growers from doing business with them. One of the directors of the association told me that it is on good grounds. I said, &#34; It is a damnable arrangement that a man cannot sell the products of his labour without entering a combine. We shall have a shot at you under the Australian Industries Preservation Act.&#34;  His  reply was, &#34;It is not worth while to bother, because we have the opinion of the Attorney-General and the Minister of External Affairs that we are on good grounds, and that no harm can come to us.&#34; There can be no prosecution under the Act until the matter has come before the Attorney-General, and I wish to know what he intends to do. He cannot hand this case over to Paddy Glynn, as he did the Marconi litigation, because Paddy is &#34;in the bag,&#34; too. He cannot hand it over to the Minister of Trade and Customs, because it is already a matter for the Customs Department, and he cannot hand it over to little Willie, because little Willie has made such an unholy mess of the Teesdale Smith contract. The Prime Minister cannot do anything, because he already finds it necessary to get some one else to administer his Department. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to be unfair, but I understood the AttorneyGeneral to say that he would stop the export of meat, or would put a tax upon exported meat. There is not a man on either side of the House who would be game to propose an export duty on any primary product. Any honorable member who brought down, and succeeded in carrying, such a proposal would be an enemy to his country. I would so describe any one who attempted to stop our export trade. I have no doubt that the Beef Trust will eventually operate to the prejudice of both the consumer and the grower; but it will not do so for a time. It is only within the last three or four years that the grower of beef and mutton has obtained anything like value for his products. I can speak only in regard to the position of the industry in Queensland, and I know that at one time the representatives of two or three- companies used to go out west and take away stock at their own prices. But since new buyers have come in a change has come over the scene, and those who have fat sheep or cattle for sale are now obtaining fair prices for them. The cause of the increase in the price of beef and mutton throughout Australia is the scarcity of the supply. The trouble is not that too much is being exported, but that there are not enough cattle to be killed. </para>

              <para>- How is that to be prevented? When a nian buys a beast he may do what he pleases with it. But having regard to the price of beef in Australia to-day, men are foolish to export so much as they do. The honorable member for New England quoted 4&#163;d. per lb. as the price of a sirloin of beef in Brisbane. It cannot be obtained at that price even on a Queensland station. I am at a loss to account for some of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> statistics as to the prices of different commodities. I have tried, without success, to obtain different things at the price quoted by him in his statistics. He has, perhaps, been given the wholesale, and not the retail, prices. </para>

At the latter end of March last I saw ls. paid in Brisbane for a cabbage, whereas the price of cabbages was quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> at 4d. each. If he lived up there for a time, and had to buy these things for himself, he would be able to tell the people of Australia more accurately what are the ruling prices of various household commodities. The price of meat is still increasing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, and his Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnes,</inline> say that when the operations of the trust compel the consumer to pay increased prices they will deal with it. They can deal with the trust in Australia, but they cannot control its operations beyond the 3-mile limit. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, when in Australia recently, told the public through the press what Swift and Company, Armour and Company, and others in the Meat Combine were doing in London. They are cornering the London market, and it is there that the danger lies. What use would it be to have our cool stores full of meat if the exporters could not sell it abroad? Outside the 3- mile limit the trust cannot be dealt with by any of the States. There it has to compete in the world&#39;s markets, and if it has the control of the beef supply of the world, what can Australia do against it? </para>

              <para>- Put me on the Treasury bench and I will try to find a remedy. I have now to refer to another matter relating to honorable members opposite who describe themselves as the farmers&#39; friends. The Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon shed crocodile tears over the primary producers in the sugar industry, and quoted many figures relating to that enterprise. The industry is able now to take care of itself. We heard twenty years ago, just as we hear to-day, of its ruination, yet last year&#39;s crop was a record one. The production of sugar last year was the largest ever known in Australia. The Minister, however; said to-day that the growers were wealthier now than they had ever been. The honorable member for Wannon recently told us that the Agricultural Bureau was going to do much for the farmers; that it would make two blades of grass grow where only one had grown before. In Queensland, some time ago, a number of farmers were encouraged by the Tobacco Combine to cultivate tobacco, and they caused two tobacco plants to grow where only one had grown before. </para>

              <para>- Is that how the honorable member speaks of the farmers? The men to whom I refer are living practically from hand to mouth, and are dependent for their livelihood upon each year&#39;s crop. The only buyer available came along recently, however, and said to them, &#34; If you grow more than a certain quantity this year, I shall not be able to take the whole of your crop.&#34; I am pleased to say that there are some men in Australia, even yet. One came to me last week, and gave me the address of some persons who were prepared to take tobacco on sample; and, at my instance, communications have been opened up between the parties. Honorable members opposite are always talking about looking after the interests of the farmers. but why have they not done something in this direction? They could afford material benefit to the producers in halfanhour if they would increase the import duty on foreign unmanufactured leaf, and decrease the Excise on colonial leaf. I do not see how the farmers can be much advantaged immediately by the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, an institution which, if we believe honorable members opposite, would make a hen lay two eggs where now she lays only one. I do not intend to trouble the House with figures, because, as we know, figures can be made to prove anything, as was evidenced once in this House, when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, as Minister of Trade and Customs, on some figure&#39;s of his being questioned, said he would bring down another set on the following day. However, the present Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon quoted many figures, and I must admit that he had -me fairly &#34;bogged.&#34; The imports of unmanufactured leaf from 1901 to 1912 amounted to 15,035,532 lb. Surely to goodness, after encouraging the growth of Australian leaf, which entails severe and continuous work, the Government might have taken the trouble to insure that the growers would not be balked by a combine in the sale of their product ! I admit that Australian leaf is not the best cured in the world. The leaf itself is good, but it is in the curing that a mistake is made; and it would pay the Government and the country to send instructors to show the producers the proper methods. </para>

The Prime Minister has said a great deal about the &#34; cleansing &#34; of the rolls, but what does &#34; cleansing &#34; mean from the Fusion&#39;s point! of view? It means removing the names of as many Labour men aud women as possible, and putting on the names of as many Liberal supporters as can be procured, and keeping them there. </para>

              <para>- It is not rubbish. The State law of Queensland provides that a person must be two months in an electorate before he can even apply to be placed on the rolls. A man who lived in Fortitude Valley crossed from one side of the street to the other, and when the Liberal organizer ascertained this fact, he immediately lodged an objection, and the man&#39;s name was removed from the roll. This meant that the man had to live for two months in his new address before he could apply to have his name reinstated. </para>

              <para>- It is all the same; we have to meet honorable members opposite, and their supporters, on the public platform, whether the State or the Com monwealth is concerned. The Federal Liberal organizations act exactly as do the State Liberal organizations; and we all remember when, last session, the Government introduced a Bill by which it was proposed to brand every man and woman with a number, and compel them to sign their names. I took part in the 1891 strike, and I am not a bit sorry that I did so, because it proved the best day&#39;s work in my life. The Labour people were then asked why they did not send men to Parliament and alter the laws, instead of promoting strife and trouble in the industrial world; but ever since we acted on that advice there has been nothing but strife and trouble with the rolls. Labour sympathizers were scored off by the thousand in Queensland, and in one case the pastoralists had a cordon of bullies outside the Revision Court, to prevent the entrance of applicants for the franchise, with the result that names were struck off. </para>

              <para>- I should not be bullied under such circumstances. If any one wishes to be heard by the public, his best plan is to kick up a row ; and that is what I advised the men to do who were pre.vented from registering their names. Half-a-dozen of them were &#39; &#39; run in &#39; &#39; for making a disturbance at the Court House, and the Australian Workers Union took up the matter and appealed to a Judge of the Supreme Court, with the result that a quashing order was&#34; obtained, and the names recorded. Now, twenty-one years later, Labour representatives are not only in Parliament representing the brawn and muscle of Australia, but they have held the Treasury bench in the Federal Parliament, with a majority in both Houses, which is more than the present Government can say. I assert, without fear of contradiction, that if the appeal to the country comes quickly, we shall see some honorable gentlemen opposite in the cool shades of Opposition, where the Labour party are to-day. </para>

              <para>- It is worth risking; at any rate, if either one of the two gentlemen I have named will do as I have suggested, they will play the piano to-night, but they will be &#34;playing fingers&#34; tomorrow morning. When the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> suit the Ministry, those gentlemen are quoted. In Queensland, there has been a lot of talk about the faking of the ballot and so forth, particularly in the Oxley electorate, where one man is said to have voted nine times; though, when that rumour was run to earth, it was found to have &#34; no feathers.&#34; As to voting more than once, I may say that last week I voted five times for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> and other gentlemen as the selected candidates for the Liberal party. The selection ballotpapers could be bought for ls. each, and I bought 10s. worth, used five myself, and gave the balance to my friends. Amongst the candidates are two men whom I expressly desired to see selected, one being a reject of the Liberal party - ex-Senator St. Ledger - and the other, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer.</inline> We are told by the Liberals that they are willing to give a fair &#34; show &#34; to every man; but the honorable member for Ballarat read a letter the other night showing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> had offered to supply a whole contingent of strikebreakers. This <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> is one of the men who form a political organization which they call a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> trade union, the head of which is the present Prime Minister. What a sorry figure the honorable gentleman cuts! Once he. was a good trade unionist, and he abhorred everything that smelt of, I shall not say &#34; scabs,&#34; but use the words of my leader - and call them &#34; sneaks of society.&#34; </para>

Well, it is said that you never can tell what a man is until he dies&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer,</inline> ag, I have said, is one of the candidates for selection as a representative of the Liberal party in the Senate; but God help that party if that is the sort of &#34; bloke &#34; they put forward ! Send them along in dozens, and we shall wipe the floor with them, and send them home without boots or socks. The Liberal party have carried out a ballot which is supposed to be fair and square. I am pleased that, even at the eleventh hour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> whom I know well, when he saw what the Women&#39;s League were going to do to him, would not let them put a rope around his neck to hang him. They do not. like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> because he is a Democrat, and because he has not style enough for them. But! how will they treat poor old Packer? He will lose his deposit as sure as fate. The Liberals of Victoria are scattering their ballot-papers broadcast. If any honorable member wants a few that we can spare, I can bring them to him. I would like a pound for every one I could give the honorable member for Wannon. </para>

              <para>- At the last redistribution Queensland gained another member in this House, but, according to the Statistician and the Chief Electoral Officer of Queensland, Victoria has been defrauded of a member. The following paragraph recently appeared in the Melbourne press : - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Evidence having an important bearing on the loss by Victoria of its twenty-second member in the House of Representatives has been given before the Federal Electoral Commission. </para>
            <para>On the 1011 census it was shown that the population in Queensland had grown so much faster than that in Victoria, that the Northern State became entitled to a tenth member, the Victorian representation being, at the same time, reduced from twenty-two to twenty-one. </para>
            <para>Based on the enrolment on the State rolls for Queensland, it was contended that the Commonwealth rolls for the State named were inflated to the extent of 53,632. Statisticians agree that the adult electoral population forms about half of the total population. Therefore, if this contention that the Commonwealth rolls for Queensland were overloaded to the extent of 53,632 names were correct, it would mean that the population of Queensland was now over-stated to the extent of 107,264 persons. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>H. Allars, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in Queensland, pointed out to the Commission that either the State rolls were abnormally below their proper strength, or the State had lost population to such an extent that it was not now entitled to the tenth member it had got at the expense of -Victoria. </para>
            <para>Another serious aspect of the question is that the Commonwealth returns to each State 25s. a head of the population on account of Customs and Excise duties. If the Queensland population lias decreased, as is apparently shown by the State electoral officials, the Commonwealth is now paying Queensland &#163;134,000 a year more than she is entitled to. </para>
            <para>Victorian members of the Federal Parliament are anxiously waiting to see what the recommendation of the Federal Electoral Coinmission will bc on this aspect of the investigation. </para>

          <para class="block">Here we have the opinion of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in regard to inflated rolls. Let me give the Ministry a tip as to how to get clean rolls. Let them pay the 25s. per head for every adult enrolled. The States would then see that every adult was put- on the roll, and the Commonwealth would see that not more than the proper number were enrolled, so that there would be a double check. The idea is not mine. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> give it on the platform. </para>

          <para class="block">Let it be marked that all these dangers were pointed out before the referendum was taken. What are the test Bills, and particularly what is the Government Preference Prohibition Bill ? Ministers have already done, by act of administration, what they are asking the Parliament to do by Act  of  Parliament. Even if there is a double dissolution over this Bill, whoever secures the Treasury bench will not have a big majority - parties are too evenly divided in the States; neither party will get a big majority - and the&#62; Senate will continue to hold the key to the situation. When we come back after a double dissolution, what shall we meet, for? To do, by means of a Bill, what had been done two years previously by means of an act of administration. And&#39; then, if things do not pan out as they should, there will probably be another double dissolution. If the GovernorGeneral gives a double dissolution on this Bill, it means the downfall of the Senate for all time. There will be no Senate; there will be no need for one; and there will be no more Upper Houses in Australia, because the people will rise in their wrath against them and wipe them off the face of the earth, just as the kangaroo does the grass when he is on a good plain. If the Attorney-General had the power to-morrow, he would stop the representation of the small States; but he has no more hope of carrying that intoeffect as regards Queensland than he has of flying to Heaven without wings. </para>

            <para>.- When this vote of censure was moved by the Leader of the Opposition, I v&#60;as wondering very much whether the Government would treat it in the disgraceful manner in which they treated the motion of censure moved during the last session. We all remember that when the Leader of the Opposition submitted the latter motion the Government treated it on the first day as a motion of that description should be treated, by immediately adjourning the House. But after putting their heads together during the evening, they, on the following day, shifted the motion to private members&#39; day, and treated it as a private member&#39;s motion. Subsequently, the Government increased their majority by the ejection of an Opposition member. Those two actions, I think, must have been regretted ever since, even by the Government themselves, because the AttorneyGeneral, at a meeting in Melbourne, admitted the truth of what I am now stating, by telling his audience that he would not go through another session by treating  a vote of censure in the same way, or by ejecting honorable members in order to get a majority. </para>

              <para>- It appears to me that they have official organs in every capital of the States, that do nothing but &#34;boom&#34; or &#34;boost,&#34; as the Americans say, the Government cause, right or wrong. The party and the press seem to act in concert. When the Government refuse to do a thing that the papers require of them, the papers treat Ministers as the Chinese treat their gods - they whip them out of office, and adopt various other means of punishing them. Passing on, I desire to touch on a question that was dealt with by the Minister of Trade and Customs this afternoon. So far as concerns the securing to the producers reasonable &#34; prices for their goods, I agree with the Minister, but . when we get in Australia anything in the form of a combination, whether it is dealing with wheat, meat, or any other foodstuffs of the people, I am one who is prepared to take steps to protect those foodstuffs more readily than I would attack a combination dealing with any other commodity. While it is a good thing to see the exports increasing, and the trade of the country expanding, there may be a time - and so far as beef is concerned, that time has arrived in Australia - when, owing to the increase in exports, as directed and controlled by certain people, there is an undue inflation of the cost of the commodity to the local consumers. </para>

          <para class="block">The Minister for Trade and Customs produced figures in which he tried to prove that, although the Beef Trust is supposed to be operating in the State of Queensland, meat is cheaper in Brisbane than in Victoria and Western Australia. That comparison was very unfortunate and very unfair, and did not add any new information to the debate. Does not every member of the House know that Queensland produces more than half of the beef of Australia? And do not honorable members know that the southern portion of Western Australia produces, perhaps, a less number of cattle than any other part of Australia. The cost to the people of Perth of getting meat from the north-west is so enormous, that whether a trust is operating in Australia or not, prices must necessarily be higher in Perth than in Brisbane at all times. The honorable member would be doing better if he directed his attention to the fact that beef, whether in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane, has increased in price during the last few months out of all proportion to what it ought to be, considering the number of cattle raised in the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">Does it matter to me what the honorable member for Maranoa said about beef or the Beef Trust? Surely I am an individual who can think for himself, even if the honorable member for New England cannot. I do say that a trust is operating here, and honorable members on the Government side know it very well. Yet they sit there indifferent to what is happening. They have promised to do something ever since they have been on the Treasury bench. But why are they not politically honest enough, as we are, to tell the people that, until they give the extra power we asked for in the referenda, Parliament is powerless to take steps to check any combine that may operate here? Australia is different from any other Federation in the world, in that this is the one Parliament, called a Federal Parliament, that can be defied by any few financiers who may have enough capital to corner our foodstuffs. It is a bad condition of affairs in this young country, that, though we have gone in for nationalism, hauled up the flag of Federation, and pointed to the Australian Parliament as the all-powerful institution which is going to lay the foundation of the future nation of Australia, we yet find, after the experience of a few years, and some attempts to deal at law with trade and commerce, that any two or three individuals in the community can defy Parliament, snap their fingers at us, and say, in effect, &#34; With our money we will run any form of trade we please to the detriment of the people of this country, and Parliament is powerless to interfere with us.&#34; </para>

              <para>- They did, as the records will show. The only argument used against the attitude of the Government who took that action was that the solicitors did not lay the case before the Court as it should have been laid. It is always the quibble of the lawyers - &#34; If you had only done what I wanted you to do, the result might have been different.&#34; Every time a lawyer is beaten, he says, &#34; If the Judge had only listened to me instead of to the other person, I would have got a verdict.&#34; But the fact remains that not only that case, but other cases, have been tried, and each and every one has been thrown out by the High Court. In the case of the one appeal to the Privy Council, the decision of the High Court was upheld. </para>

              <para>- The Coal Vend at the time I refer to was a benefit to the people of Newcastle. I say nothing about the Shipping Combine, and those others who may have taken control of the coal industry afterwards. The Coal Vend became a different proposition in after years; but the honorable member would try to make out that what obtained at that time obtains to-day. I say that a combine, whether it be in connexion with beef or coal or timber, may run a legitimate business; but when it oversteps the mark, and clashes with the interests of the consumers, Parliament ought to be powerful enough to legislate for the nationalization of the monopoly. Let every one of these combines stand upon its own merits. I wish now to make a few remarks concerning the action of the Government in respect of the unfortunate outbreak in Sydney of that loathsome disease known as small-pox. We all recollect the attitude which they assumed during the initial stages of that epidemic; we all remember that, by proclamation, they prohibited any person who could not prove that he had been successfully vaccinated quitting that State. We also remember that, just prior to the last New South Wales elections, when they found that the feeling of the people of that State was exceedingly hostile to them, and when they feared that that feeling would jeopardize the prospects of the Liberal candidates there, they lifted the embargo and allowed persons from the infected area to wander all over the Commonwealth, irrespective of whether they were afflicted with this dreadful malady or not. I say now that the small-pox outbreak in Sydney has not been eradicated. I do not wish to dilate further upon this subject, but I would like a competent Commission to be appointed to inquire into the results which flowed from the use of the vaccine which was provided by the Commonwealth authorities for distribution throughout New South Wales. In the district from which I hail, as many as sixty employes in one business establishment were allowed time off to be vaccinated, and it is a fact that, in most cases, they had afterwards to be taken to hospitals for treatment. To-day there are numerous instances in which disfigurement has resulted, either from the vaccine used, or from the way in which the patients were treated. Their disfigurement is ten times as bad as that which would have been inflicted upon them by the dreaded small-pox itself. This matter is sufficiently important to warrant the appointment of a Commission of experts to inquire into it, with a view to seeing whether good or harm was done by the treatment to which patients were subjected. I am not speaking without knowledge of the complaints which have been levelled against the Government for their action in this connexion, and I know that the Prime Minister has been challenged by a man who was given up for dead, after he had been vaccinated - a man who holds a good position in this country - to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire whether he was not ten times worse after being subjected to the vaccine treatment than he would have been had he suffered from small-pox itself. I wish now to say a word or two in regard to the Teesdale Smith contract. I do not impute any ulterior motives to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, nor do I object to him interviewing persons who wish to consult him on public business. We ought not to judge Ministers from that stand-point. We ought, rather, to judge them by their administrative acts. In allowing the exConsulting Engineer-in-Chief to advise him, not only of .the prices which should be paid, and of the conditions which should surround this particular contract, but also of the policy which should be pursued by the Government, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs exhibited a lack of capacity that I have not seen paralleled during the time I have been in public life. The avowed policy of the Ministry was that this work should be done by contract, and that tenders should be called for it. Yet, on the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> that policy was departed from, and a contract was let without any tenders being called. The reason advanced by the late Consulting Engineer-in-Chief for the adoption of this course was one of urgency. It was pleaded that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith should be allowed to proceed with the construction of 14 miles of earthworks, as expedition was imperative. But the facts which have since come to light prove that there was no urgency whatever. Now that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith has almost finished his contract, the rails have not been laid within 11 miles of it. </para>

              <para>- Yes. It was urged by the late Consulting Engineer-in-Chief that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith had the requisite plant on the spot. As a matter of fact, he had not. He had to get it from a place 300 miles distant. He has been paid a fabulous price because the work was one of urgency, and because he was bound to complete it within three months. Some honorable members opposite are jubilant because he will have it completed within the stipulated period. But the fact that he will have done so clearly disproves the assertion which has been repeatedly made to palliate this blunder, viz., that the country in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith had to work was hard country. As a matter of fact, viewed as hilly country, it was of the very softest description. Not one of the cuttings required the use of a charge of explosives. Most of them could be ploughed out, and the earth scooped. It is true that explosives have been used upon it, but only for the purpose of bringing down larger quantities of material for removal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith is receiving 7s. per cubic yard under his contract, whereas similar work in worse country is being done in New South Wales to-day for less than 2s. per cubic yard. An attempt has been made to justify the letting of this contract on the ground that the work was worth more than is work in ordinary country. I admit that, owing .to the scarcity of water, something extra might have been allowed the contractor; but I venture to say that 2s. 6d. per cubic yard would have been a wonderfully good price to have paid him. Then we have to look at the ingenious way in which that price was increased by the conditions of the contract. We all know that, where a cutting is made, a hollow has to be filled up, and an embankment has to be built. If the contractor cannot get sufficient&#34; material out of the cuttings to form his embankment, he must get it somewhere. But the Department was so kind to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith that, in effect, it said to him, &#34; You need not bother about that. We will give you 2s. 6d. per cubic yard to remove the material which you take out of the cuttings to form the embankment in addition to 4s. 6d. per cubic yard for excavating the cuttings.&#34; </para>

Then, for what are the Government paying under this contract? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith submits that he had to purchase a considerable quantity of extra plant to carry out his undertaking.

              <para>- Under the contract, we have to pay the whole cost of the plant that the contractor had to purchase to carry out this work. Then I would ask if it is not a fact that, at the head of the railway clearing, the Government have a staff of surveyors who are wellequipped with camels, which are being kept in idleness ? These surveyors are waiting for the Government to let a tender to somebody else to carry out the surveying work which they themselves should undertake. They have the plant, the camels, and the men, and yet they are held up waiting orders until the Government are prepared to let a contract to private surveyors who will take their places. My friend the Treasurer used to be awfully anxious about the construction of the line. </para>

              <para>- The right honorable gentleman wishes to hasten the work, and yet he is a member of a Government which is causing delay after delay in getting this line constructed. Can he deny that the surveyors now at the head, of the line, who are well-equipped, and were getting on well with the workmen - men who are being paid handsomely by the Government - are now being kept idle in order that the Government may carry out this craze of theirs to have all the work from top to bottom let to some person or other by contract? </para>

              <para>- Where is the Minister? The right honorable gentleman is the only Minister at the table at the present moment. With regard to the contract work proposed by the Government, and day-labour work as carried out by the late Government, and by various State Governments, it is of no use to take the price of one little contract that may be let on this particular line, as has been done during this debate, and contrast it with a small section done by day labour at any particular place. Let honorable members opposite take the evidence of the Railway Commissioners of any State they like to name. These are independent gentlemen, whose policy in regard to the building of railways in the future is to have no contracting, because they find that day labour right through the piece has meant the saving of thousands of pounds in their Departments. It stands to reason that if a day-labour job is not completed for the estimated cost, or less, the cause must be bad supervision. Given the same supervision and the same conditions, it stands to reason and common-sense that jobs carried out directly by the Departments themselves by day labour are not only cheaper, but infinitely better done than under any other possible system. I now wish to deal with the effort of the Government to secure a double dissolution on the empty cry of abolition of preference to unionists in Government employment. This matter affects only 2,000 men throughout the Commonwealth, but honorable members opposite would put on the statute-book a law that would not only prevent, a Minister from granting them preference, but would also prevent any Judge or other independent tribunal, Federal or State, from giving them a meed of justice. To show what an empty shibboleth this measure is, Ministers know that they have abolished preference to unionists in Government employment by an administrative act, and therefore do not require a Bill to do it. Any succeeding Government can reverse that decision. The fact is that the Ministry are trying to gull the people. They intend, if they are able, to induce the GovernorGeneral when he arrives to grant them a double dissolution on a flimsy pretext, such as this measure is. Why should trade unionists not have preference in this regard ? You ask them on the one hand to give up their right to strike, and to go to the Arbitration Courts in order to secure the settlement of their difficulties. While they give up the only weapon they have ever possessed with which to fight for their rights, surely the Government will not deny them the right to employment after the dispute has been legally settled? The Government, and those who stand behind them, would, if they dared, and if they thought it was popular, do as their predecessors did before them in days gone by. They would go so far as to deny the men the right to form trade unions at all. They stand up to-day and say, &#34; We do not object to trade unionism so long as it keeps its place.&#34; Those words, interpreted in the sense in which they are really used, mean that so long as trade unionists are helpless, so long as they are content with their conditions, and not aggressive in asking for their rights, the Ministerial party believe  in unionism, but directly the unionists attempt to do something for themselves, they say, &#34; We are against you; you are too aggressive; you are usurping the rights of the employers.&#34; They make all manner of charges, and then try to justify their attitude by some flimsy pretext such as I have described. I am positive that every benefit that has been secured by non-unionists everywhere in the industrial world by way of increased wages, or increased accommodation, or better conditions generally, they have to thank trade unionists for, although they never did anything by cash contributions or by their own. exertions to help to bring these improvements about. Why, then, should they receive at the hands of this, or any other Government, the same consideration as themen who have borne the brunt of the battle, and paid their share to gain these benefits ? It has always been the unionists who have made the sacrifices in the past, and they have a right to preference, especially if they are asked to give up their right to strike by going to a Court to have their differences adjusted. Just imagine the first act of the honorablemember for Parramatta, as Prime Minister of Australia, being to strike a blow at the very men who put him into Parliament on the first occasion !  His  present attitude is a very striking commentary upon his political career. Sent into Parliament, as he was in the first instance, by the miners&#39; pennies and the miners&#39; work, his very first act as Prime Minister is to say, &#34;I am against preference to unionists.&#34; When he was the miners&#39; paid secretary, he dared not settle any strikes without every man having absolute preference and going back again into the mine. When he sat as delegate to the Australian Miners Federation under my presidency, and I went abroad adjusting and settling disputes, P* can imagine what he would have said to me if I had come back to the council and reported that I had adjusted even one dispute without getting absolute preference for every man who was out on strike at the time. That is the man who is now at the head and forefront of the antipreference movement. He wants to make us believe that he thinks differently today on the question from what he did fifteen or twenty years ago. He does not really think differently, but his position is different, and he has altered his views to suit his position. Whatever the outcome of the present situation in this House is, nobody will be more ready to welcome an appeal to the country than myself. I think that the appeal should have been made before this session began at all. I have always thought the House unworkable since the last election, and everybody knows that that is so. The Government are trying to hold on to office and to twist the situation in order to serve their own party ends. That is a degrading spectacle for any Government or party to offer. They are helpless so far as doing anything in this Parliament is concerned, and they know it. </para>

              <para>- If the Government had shown at the beginning an earnest intention to do any work at all, the position might have been altogether different, but they did last session just what their programme shows that they are going to do this session. They say, &#34; We are going to tear the Constitution to pieces. We are going to interpret it in such a way that the Governor-General will give us a double dissolution on questions affecting only 2,000 men on the one hand, and a mere detail of the electoral system on the other.&#34; I venture to say that the framers of the Constitution when they agreed upon the sections governing deadlocks between the two Houses never dreamt that any Government would be so insane as to ask for a double dissolution on a flimsy pretext of that kind They had in their minds a possible struggle between the two Houses on some measure embodying a vital principle. If the Government had introduced a measure governing the whole electoral machinery of the Commonwealth, it might have been called a test question in reality, but the postal vote is simply a detail of our electoral system, and it will be an extraordinary stretching of the Constitution for any GovernorGeneral to say that upon either of the measures which are to be pub before us by the Government, there is such a disagreement between the two Houses as to warrant a recourse to the deadlock provisions of the Constitution in the sense in which their framers intended them to be used. When these two measures come before us, I shall offer no unnecessary obstruction to them, but they will get from me the criticism which they so richly deserve, and the people of this country will be made aware of the true position which the Government occupy. </para>

            <para>- I also know of Acts passed in private members&#39; time in the State Parliaments; but I am speaking of our experience here. I distinctly remember many years ago putting through myself the first Truck Act that was passed in New South Wales, on a private members&#39; afternoon. That time has long since passed, and it is not the rule now even in the State Parliaments to put important proposals through, in private members&#39; time. I am certainly quite correct in saying that no Bill has ever reached the statute-book from this Parliament that was discussed in private members&#39; time. </para>

            <para>- Of course it is, and the Government are taking the responsibility. This appears to be a controversial subject. I thought it was generally desired by honorable members on both sides that we should substitute three sittings in each week for four, and I undertook to act as between all parties as a conciliation board. This motion is my award, given as the result of the best judgment I could bring to bear upon the settlement of the question. It represents a compromise in this way: In return for honorable members agreeing to surrender private members&#39; time, we agree to sit three days a week instead of four. </para>

            <para>- Partly so. I am suggesting to honorable members that it is better that they should surrender private members&#39; time for all the good it is likely to be to them during this session. I am not making this a general proposition, because I hope that in another session,when the House is in a normal condition, we may find time for private members&#39; business. In view of the special circumstances now existing, I am proposing that if we agree to reduce the number of sitting days to three per week, honorable members shall surrender their right to time for private members&#39; business, and shall agree to the sitting days and hours stated in the motion. I think that is a fair compromise, and it is in the spirit of compromise that I submit the motion. </para>

            <para>- The Government say we can have this proposal to sit for three days a week, and do away with private members&#39; time, or continue the old system. I say, quite frankly, that I prefer the old system. This is a Parliament for the expression of political opinions, and not merely for the registration of what the Government may desire to do. The Prime Minister has said that he has never known a Bill passed in this Parliament that originated in private members&#39; time, but some of the most useful legislation that has been passed in Australia was initiated in private members&#39; time. The then member for Northern Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, brought forward resolutions of the greatest importance to Australia, which were debated in private members&#39; time, and led to fundamental legislation for the benefit of the Commonwealth. Private members on both sides have, by the discussion of questions that have not matured as party questions, enlightened honorable members, and the public outside, as to the utility and advantage of the measures they proposed. The Prime Minister&#39;s proposal is to do away with the time which has hitherto been allowed to private members to deal with questions in which they are particularly interested, and which they are specially qualified to set forward with advantage to the House and the country. I regret the tone of the Prime Minister in saying that we must take this or nothing. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister says that he did not mean that. When I know what the Government mean, I shall be able to form an opinion upon their proposal. I now respectfully make the suggestion that the Government should agree to give up the time between 10.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Thursday to private members&#39; business. It is true that this may be an exceptional session; but, from my experience as a Minister, I say that once we . begin to deprive private members of time for their business in this way, it may lead to their being deprived of time for private members&#39; business in any session. The tendency in Parliament is for the dominant party having a policy to try to monopolize all the time to have that policy carried into effect, and to encroach upon the rights of private members to enable that to be done. If this practice is initiated during this brief session, it may form a precedent for similar action later on, and opportunity which has hitherto been provided for the discussion of private members&#39; business may disappear altogether. </para>

          <para>.- I am rather sorry that the Prime Minister has suggested doing away with private members&#39; time altogether. I think it would be a fair and reasonable compromise to allow private members two and a half hours each week, as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. I practically gave in my name as one who was prepared to support the Government if they brought in a proposal that, in future, we should sit for three days in each week instead of four; but when I did so, I had not the slightest idea that the Government purposed taking away the -whole of the time of private members. I would prefer to sit four days in each week to sitting three days if private members&#39; time is to be entirely taken away; and, if the motion comes to a vote, I shall be prepared to oppose it, in the circumstances. At the same time I confess that I would much rather that the House sat three days a week instead of four if a reasonable amount of time were allowed for private members&#39; business in each week. </para>

          <para>.- I have listened with some interest to the observations of the Prime Minister. The honorable gentleman tried to underestimate the value of the time hitherto devoted to private members&#39; business. I can call to mind, since I have been in this Parliament, many motions, originally moved  by private members, which have ultimately resulted in the passing of Acts of Parliament. A motion moved by a private member brought about the great inquiry into the administration of the Postal Service. The Commission which was appointed to make that investigation did more good than all the PostmastersGeneral we have had since Federation. If private members are no longer to have opportunities to give expression to their ideas, even when their views may not be in accord with the policy of the Government of the day, the motion must be regarded as a dangerous inroad upon the rights of members, and should not be tolerated. T do not agree with the proposal to sit only three days a week. We are paid to carry on the business of the country, and it is our duty to give to our work whatever time may be necessary. </para>

            <para>- The pages of Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Hansards</inline> show that more &#39; &#39; gas &#39; &#39; has emanated from the honorable member than from any other honorable member of this House. What the Government proposes now is a double-edged sword to wound those on this side. If passed, it will not benefit the representatives of New South Wales, though it will enable Victorian representatives to devote another day to their private affairs. They would like to make Parliament a place where they can present themselves for a short space each week, devoting the bulk of the time to their own business. That is the state of affairs that the other side would bring about if it had its way. Honorable members opposite would make Parliament the happy hunting-ground of those who are in politics for the sake of social distinction, or for the emoluments of a public position. However, I shall not discuss the matter further. I am prepared to sit for four days a week, and more, if necessary, to advance the business of the country. </para>

          <para>.- I am one of those who first suggested that we should sit only three days a week, but had I thought it would mean depriving honorable members of certain rights and privileges, I should not have done so. I am surprised at the alleged compromise that the Prime Minister has offered. He could arrange that private business should take precedence on Friday afternoons, or on Friday mornings, or on Thursday mornings. This would allow two and a-half hours a week for private members&#39; business. It is idle to say that important matters are not dealt with in private members&#39; time. Some of the most important legislation that the country is governed by was first mooted on private members&#39; days. Take the oldage pensions. </para>

            <para>- I apologize to the honorable member, to whom I have no wish to be offensive. Some of the most important legislation that has been passed by this Parliament, or by the Parliaments of the States, originated in private members&#39; time. Every one knows that that is so. The old-age pensions system originated years ago in the Parliaments of the States on motions introduced by private members. The paying of such pensions was considered impossible in those days, but they have since become established by law, and benefit many thousands. I could quote many other instances in support of my statement. The House may seem to take but little notice of a private member&#39;s motion when first moved; bat if the matter is of importance, the public come to realize it, and in the end Parliament, as a whole, recognises that what is proposed should be carried into effect for the benefit of the country. I have always been jealous of the privileges of members. In this matter I speak without party feeling, because what may be a victory for the Government party today may operate against it a little later. </para>

            <para>- This is not a party question. There are on both sides of the House honorable members who are opposed to the motion. The honorable member for Gwydir has just announced his opposition to it, and the honorable member for Grampians opposed it when it was first mooted, so that the parties are fairly divided upon the question. But that the honorable member who first brought forward the proposal should be the first to turn tail upon it on the simple issue as to time being allotted to private members&#39; business passes my comprehension. </para>

            <para>- Evidently. I supported the honorable member for Kennedy when he brought forward the proposal that we should sit only three days a week, believing that that would be sufficient to enable this Parliament to deal with its business. The State Parliaments get through their business by sitting three days a week, but they do not waste so much time as this Parliament does in beating the air. </para>

I have already called attention to the objectionable and growing habit of keeping up a running commentary while an honorable member is speaking, and it should not be necessary every time that an honorable member rises to speak for me to call for order several times.

            <para>- The Opposition do not like this criticism. The business for which we have met this session was clearly set forth in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. We have met thus early in the year for a specific purpose, and the Ministry are right in pushing on with Government business to accomplish what they have in view. If those members of the Opposition who originally favoured the proposal we are now discussing choose to run away from it, that is no reason why the Government should do so. The proceedings in this House last session during the time devoted to private members&#39; business must have surprised those not accustomed to the actions of this Parliament. I have seen at times only eight members present during the consideration of private members&#39; business. That shows what interest is displayed in private members&#39; business. The moment such business is called on the House empties itself, and if an honorable member by accident now and again carries a motion, it is because there is no one here to oppose it. Every honorable member knows the business with which the Government of the day, no matter what party is in power, proposes to push on, and it is his duty to be here to oppose or support it. But in most cases there is no interest displayed in private members&#39; business, and in nine cases out of ten the discussion of such business is an absolute waste of time. It is true, as the honorable member for Kennedy and others have said, that an honorable member may get a motion through the House. One or two were passed last year. But to what did they amount? They provided for the creation of Commissions, and I venture to say that if members of Commissions were not paid we should never be worried with motions for their appointment. </para>

            <para>- I know that the honorable member is. If the Government are going to give way on this question, and set apart time for private members&#39; business, I hope that they will decide that the House shall sit four days a week. But if they propose to go on with the business for which we were called together, thus early in the year, to deal, I trust that they will see that the whole of the time is devoted to Government business. Let me deal for a moment with the question of whether or not the carrying of the motion would be a precedent for the abolition of private members&#39; business. The number of private members is largely in excess of the number of members of the Government, and no Administration could insist upon monopolizing, indefinitely, the time of Parliament for the consideration of its own business, if a majority of honorable members favoured the setting apart of time for the consideration of private members&#39; business. There always would be, under normal conditions, a majority anxious that private members should have an opportunity to bring forward the grievances which they desired to ventilate from time to time. </para>

            <para>- Quite so; but the discussion which takes place on a private member&#39;s motion, if it leads to anything at all, results in the Government taking up the proposal, and, later on, submitting a Bill to give effect to it. A private member by getting a dozen members to support him can always move the adjournment of the House to bring forward any grievance he may desire, so that no privilege is taken away by the motion. I am quite satisfied that if there is any private business of importance there will always be sufficient honorable members, no matter what may be strength of the Government, to afford an opportunity. I, for one, although a supporter of the Government, would not tolerate the monopolization of the whole of the days in an ordinary session to prevent private members being allowed to discuss matters from time to time. But on this particular occasion the Government have a definite purpose in view, and I think that they ought to adhere to their determination. I hope there are honorable members who still believe that it is honorable to be connected with business outside. </para>

            <para>- I admit that such a member is at a disadvantage compared with a member who lives in Victoria. But what is the effect of the suggestion of the Government ? Tasmanian members at present cannot leave Melbourne during the session unless they pair, whereas, if this motion be carried, they will be enabled to leave for their homes on the Friday afternoon and return by Tuesday&#39;s boat in time for the meeting of the House on Wednesday; they will be able to get to their homes every week end as the New South Wales and South Australian members do now. Western Australian and Queensland members are in a different position, and nothing we can do can meet their case, because of the distance; but the motion will prove a distinct gain to honorable members from New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania, apart altogether from Victoria. That alone ought to be sufficient to carry some weight in this House. I trust that honorable members on both sides who believe that the business of Parliament can be done in three days of the week, and who believe that we ought to be afforded an opportunity to attend to our own business, will vote with the Government, irrespective of party. </para>

          <para>. - It is not necessary to debate the question at great length, seeing that the honorable member for Henty has used arguments sufficiently strong against the proposals of the Government. We are sent from all parts of Australia to do the business of the country; and in order to meet the convenience of a few honorable members, who live in four of the States, we are asked to make this change, regardless of the inconvenience that may be caused to those who come from the more distant places. </para>

            <para>- The best days I have in Victoria are those when I get into the train to travel north towards Brisbane. From the first mention of it, I have expressed my opposition to this proposal. Rightly or wrongly, I am sent here by the people of Brisbane to do the business of Parliament, and I think other measures could be adopted to get through that business in a shorter time. I do not, however, think that the plan now proposed will help us very much. From a personal point of view I shall be very glad to have an extra day, because I have any amount of correspondence and departmental work to attend to. I am prepared, however, to give the fullest possible time to the business of Parliament, so that we may get through it at the earliest possible date, and return to our homes and constituencies. I am utterly opposed to the proposal, particularly at this stage, because it means the elimination of the private members&#39; opportunity to put their views before the House. There is a feeling creeping over the mind of not only the people of Australia, but of the people of most civilized countries, that the party system is on its trial, if it is not, indeed, already sentenced to death. Party government has practically outlived its usefulness. The only opportunity that members now have, apart from their association with any particular party, is that presented by the time devoted to private business. If the motion be carried, private members will have no other standing in the House than that of members of a party, or a part of the machine, just as honorable members like to view it. We shall have no rights outside our party, by which the whole of our movements will be directed. It is quite futile for the honorable member for Henty to suggest that we can always move the adjournment of the House. I ask, for instance, whether to-morrow I could, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, submit the proposal that is down in my name. As to the importance or otherwise of private business, I am prepared to say that, although the motion I hope to have the honour of moving to-morrow may be considered of no importance, it is only a matter of a few short years when it will be accepted and adopted by the Governments in Australia. One can understand the desire of the Government to push forward their own particular business, but they must not forget that, however unimportant private business may appear to them, it is of prime importance to individual members. Every honorable member who puts a motion on the paper thinks it worthy of, at any rate, some consideration ; and the fact that other honorable members do not remain in their places to hear the speeches, is no argument against the quality of the business. Honorable members are quite well aware of the importance of some of the questions submitted, but they are, unfortunately, compelled to take advantage of the opportunity to attend to their correspondence and departmental matters. When, however, there is any private business of pressing urgency, a member can always secure a good hearing. I cannot understand the position of the honorable member for Henty. He says he is opposed to private members taking up the time of the House, and he ridicules the idea of any motion of importance being proposed by them. He also complains of the poor attendance of members during the discussion of private business as evidencing the poor quality of that, business; but he immediately goes on to say that next session he will be quite prepared to give private members time. If it is not necessary or wise to give private members time now, it should not be wise or necessary then; and if the Government require the time for themselves now, they will require it just as much when Parliament next meets. </para>

            <para>- No ; because of the danger of establishing a precedent, and it is because of that danger that I am now opposing the motion. I have sympathy for some honorable members opposite, who should be encouraged in persevering foi- the three days a week. I refer to the Ministers. It is a wonder that administration is carried on even as well as it is, because of the lack of opportunity Ministers have of attending to their Departments. But the advantage to Ministers will be more than counterbalanced if private members are to be deprived of their privileges, and thus degraded to the position of mere puppets in the political machine, while the system of party government that will grow out of such a condition of affairs will be to the great disadvantage of the parliamentary institution. </para>

          <para>.- I am prepared to sit whatever days are necessary to do the work to be done by Parliament. The question of how many days the House should sit is primarily one to be settled by Ministers, who know the time that will be required to do the business to be brought forward, and it is not for honorable members of the Opposition to object; though I suppose the less business the present Government do - if it is the same as they brought down in the past - the better we should like it. However, I cannot see any advantage that the proposal will give to those for whom the alteration is supposed to be brought forward. Honorable members now have Wednesday morning and Thursday morning on which to conduct their correspondence and transact business that can only be done outside the Chamber. As parties now stand, the almost continuous attendance of members in the Chamber is necessitated, and those who take copies of their correspondence cannot write their letters in the Chamber. The Labour party hold their weekly party meetings on Wednesday mornings, while I understand the Government party also hold weekly party meetings. As the Opposition must continue holding their party meetings on the Wednesday mornings, honorable members from New South Wales must still leave Sydney on the Monday evenings, as they do now, while those who live in Tasmania will be in the same position. As a matter of fact, those who clamour the loudest for fewer sitting days are those who live almost continuously in Melbourne. </para>

            <para>- I am not making any charge ; I am merely stating what I have noticed. If honorable members supporting the Government propose to give up their party meetings and allow Ministers to conduct the whole of the business of their party, and to have no say in the matter themselves, simply coming into the Chamber and recording their votes like machines, well and good; but Opposition members insist on taking part in party meetings, and on understanding what is to be the attitude and action of the party in the Chamber. The only difference the proposed change will make in regard to Sydney members is that, in order to attend the party meetings on Wednesday morning, they may cool their heels in Melbourne on Tuesday afternoon and evening. So I cannot see any advantage in this part of the Government&#39;s proposal. </para>

        <para class="block">I have no doubt that the Government would be very glad to have an opportunity of preventing discussion upon the proposal that is on the notice-paper after the name of the honorable member for Melbourne; but I do not propose to refer to it, because I see that the honorable member is anxious to speak, and I am sure that he will give a good account of himself. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports is also interested in private members&#39; day, and he, no doubt, will rise and let honorable members know the faith that is in him. I object to the proposed alteration, not so much because I  am against any lessening of the days of sitting - that being, as I have said before, a matter for the Government to decide; and if they say that the necessary work of Parliament can be done in less time, that is their concern - but because in the way in which it is submitted it will not give members the relief it was said would be given. The only members to benefit will be the gentlemen who occupy the front seat on the Government bench. They will be relieved of one day&#39;s sitting in the House, when their actions and policy could be subjected to criticism. Then, of course, there is the encroachment upon private members&#39; time. In view of all those circumstances, I propose to vote for the amendment moved by the honorable member for Kennedy, and if that is defeated I shall vote against the motion. </para>

          <para>.- Several references have been made during this discussion to various matters, and I, for one, am very anxious to see very drastic reforms made in the procedure of this Parliament. We should curtail, not only the days of sittings, but also the length of speeches. I am of opinion that the standing order referring to the length of speeches requires some considerable amendment in the direction of shortening the time for which members are allowed to speak. </para>

        <para class="block">I am anxious to see the Standing Orders further amended, so that speeches will be even shorter than they are at present. I enter my protest against the system of party government which is at present in force, and I have no hesitation in saying that it will not be long before that system will be completely abolished, and another substituted. The present system has outlived its usefulness, and some other form of government - what form I am not prepared to say - will be brought into existence. I am convinced that the people of Australia will not tolerate the present method of procedure, and the shameful waste of time that is taking place in this Chamber. In the course of a few years they will take control of this Parliament, if Parliament is not prepared to do the work which the people created it to do. I am prepared to support the Government in this matter, if their motion is accepted; but if there is to be any curtailment of Government business, I shall favour a continuance of the practice of sitting four days a week. I am convinced that the people of this country are dissatisfied with the actions of Parliament to-day, as they have reason to be dissatisfied, and in future they will amend the governmental system, if Parliament itself does not amend it for them. </para>

          <para>. - I think it only right that I should place my point of view before the House. No one has ever accused &#39;me of neglecting to look after my constituents. When I was approached and asked if I would waive my motion, I strongly objected. Then it was represented to me that I might be acting the part of the doginthemanger, and I said that if every other member was willing to waive his business I would not be a dog-in-the-manger, but would make a strong appeal to the Government to consider the question of an amendment of the divorce law. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has made a suggestion that, instead of private members being allowed four hours for their business, as at present, they should have two and a half hours on, say, Thursday morning. I think the honorable member for Kennedy made a mistake  in proposing Friday morning, and would readily alter it to Thursday. If the time for private members&#39; business is on Friday morning, that will make a ridiculous alteration of the status of members who have given notice of motions; and who should have the right to move them if the Government can see their way to grant time for private members&#39; business. Speaking from experience, I must say that private members&#39; business is always sacrificed by every Government who have the power, and the desire to do so. There is no member in the House but will say that when the Government are strong enough and desire to take private members&#39; business away, that business is sacrificed, no matter which party is in power. Some years ago I submitted a proposal in the State Parliament to the effect that one night in a session should be set apart as a divisionnight. Upon that night any honorable member would be at liberty to secure, without any debate, a division upon any motion which he might have upon the business-paper. Under such a system, I venture to say that, within two hours, at least from twelve to twenty divisions could be taken. If the House rejected any motion with contempt, the author of it would not be foolish enough to waste the time of honorable members by submitting it on a future occasion. The setting apart of a division night such as I have suggested would practically enable the business-paper to be cleared. Personally, I should be very loth to see private members&#39; business abandoned. I may mention three important Bills which were carried in the Victorian Parliament, and which were private measures, namely, the Prematernity Act, the Legitimization Act - these two introduced by myself - and the Divorce Act. The last-named was passed at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Shiels. I am sure that every representative of Tasmania in this Chamber will recognise that the motion which led to the financial grant to Tasmania was carried at the instance of a private member. I am satisfied that the honorable member for Henty did not intend to injure either honorable members upon the Ministerial side of the House or upon the Opposition side when he said that there would be fewer Commissions appointed if their members were not paid. He must know that the members of Royal </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Commissions do not receive any payment while those bodies are sitting in the State in which members happen to reside. As a matter of fact, they are paid only their travelling expenses when abroad. It is the duty of honorable members to do eight hours&#39; work upon each sitting day, but that work should be done in the daytime. That is the practice which is observed in the only country in the world in which the people have control of their Parliament. The Legislature there meets at 8 a.m. in the summer, and adjourns at 1 p.m. It resumes at 2 o&#39;clock, and sits till 5 o&#39;clock. Every member who is absent from a sitting is punished, and it is necessary that a majority of members must be present while any business is being transacted. If that rule were observed here, there would be no complaints from the honorable member for Henty that when private members&#39; business is being considered there are only about eight members in the Chamber. The Parliament of which I speak does its business every yearin two short sessions of three weeks each. </para>

            <para>- The Parliament of Switzerland. The one great question which this Government have to face is that of the referendum and initiative. If they would only bring forward a Bill to give effect to these reforms, I venture to say that it would be rapidly passed by this House. Of course, if the Ministry have decided to dispense with private members&#39; business, the question of divorce must go by the board. But there is no Court in the Commonwealth or in New Zealand which has not honoured me by sending me an expression of its opinion upon that motion. I have the testimony of 150 professional men in regard to it. That testimony I will be pleased to place at the disposal of the Prime Minister, or of any member of the Government, because I feel sure it will show them the widespread need which exists for making our women citizens the equal of our men citizens. I hope that the Government will see their way to grant one and a-half or two hours weekly to private members&#39; business. </para>

          <para class="block">I would not have risen but for the fact that motives have been attributed to the Government for having brought forward this motion. As a matter of fact, I urged on our party the necessity of submitting such a motion last session, and 1 renewed my efforts on the first day of the present session. The idea, therefore, that the Government have been actuated by any ulterior motive goes by the board. I was in a hopeless minority in my own party until I learned from some members of it, who are supposed to be on specially friendly terms with members of the Opposition, that a great number of the latter were also in favour of it. It was only then that my own party decided to indorse it. Personally, I do not think that the Prime Minister has gone far enough. My own idea is that we should sit three days a week, and that the Government should curtail questions without notice, and devote that time to the business of private members. If we cannot sit on three days a week only, we ought to sit the whole of the week. At the last elections, large number of honorable members were&#39; elected to this Parliament who have private interests to attend to, and the electors have never expressed the opinion that they should sit here day after day and absolutely neglect those interests. As the majority which either party will probably have in the future is likely to be a very narrow one, we shall be required to attend here upon every sitting day. That being so, if we meet four days a week honorable members will have no time in which to attend to their own business, and the result will be that we shall get a class of professional politicians whom the country does not want. Those of us who have interests outside of this Parliament require a certain amount of time to look after them, and the electors who sent us here are willing that we shall have it. If the proposal to sit three days a week is not acceptable to the House, I am prepared to meet upon four days a week. </para>

          <para>. - It is a strange thing that time should be occupied in a great Parliament like this in discussing a question of this character. Many years ago we could have had our salaries fixed at &#163;1,000 a year, but honorable members were scared of their shadows in those days. I remember when the thing was all right, and the very men who voted against the increase of salary all went out of public life. The great people of this country do not want men to work themselves to death. I believe in taking everything that comes, and if it comes too swiftly then I dodge it. When I look round it seems to me that it would be easier to sweep back the waves of the ocean than to silence the political martyrs who are too much afraid of their own shadows to do anything. What are they frightened of? No other Parliament in the world works more than three days a week. Most of us are now travelling toward our immortal home, and are we going to work ourselves to death for a few years? What, after all, is private members&#39; business? I never got a motion through this House yet, and it will be thirteen years on the 9th of this month since I gave notice here of a motion dealing with old-age pensions. It was thirteen years since I gave notice of a motion to allot, an area of 1,000 square miles for the Federal Territory, but I never got the motion through. There are honorable members here who always do their best to throw out motions of that kind, and it is a farce to talk about this matter. We can adjourn the House and have a battle over the thing if it is not working right. In fact, it seems to me that patient listeners stimulate eloquence. No matter how this matter goes, I intend to vote for three days sittings a week. </para>

          <para>. - I am rather surprised at the proposal coming from the Prime Minister, for I have a vivid recollection of him assailing the late Prime Minister for having the temerity to move that private members&#39; business be done away with towards the middle of the session. We have practically not more than started the session, but the Prime Minister now wants to wipe all private members&#39; business out. I also recollect the honorable member for Lang objecting to private members&#39; business being done away with. On all occasions when an attempt has been made to reduce the privileges of private members there has been a concerted howl from a number of honorable members who tonight have spoken in support of the proposal. I cannot understand why they should have turned such a complete somersault. I do not like to charge honorable members directly with trying to evade a vote on certain questions, because that perhaps would not be fair, but I have a strong desire to put before the House the only notice of motion which I have standing in my name. Private members&#39; business should not be wiped out so early in the session. If the Government meant business the position would be different, but we know they do not. I wish to give notice of an amendment on the amendment to delete the word Friday, with a view to insert Thursday, because I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne that if Friday was fixed for private business instead of Thursday, there would be a rush all over again to get the best positions, and I do not want to lose for my motion the favorable position which it now occupies on the notice-paper. Honorable members will think seriously before curtailing the privileges that we have had in the past. I objected to the proposal to reduce the sitting days from four to three, and thought that the suggestion to sit on Thursday morning was rather a good one if the other day could be done away with, but I never dreamt that the Prime Minister would propose to do away with all the time previously given to private members. I understood from those honorable members who were &#34; whipping &#34; the matter that Thursday morning was to be allowed for private members&#39; business. It is a pity that that has not been arranged. The Government are establishing a precedent that no other Parliament has adopted so early in the session. The State Parliaments sit for three days weekly, but they allow time for private members&#39; business. If the numbers are up it is useless to protest, but I think there are honorable members who will vote for the motion who will regret later on that they have curtailed their own privileges. </para>

He did not actually move his amendment, but I understand that he is under the impression that he did. If it is the desire of the House, I would like to give the honorable member an opportunity to move the amendment before going to a division. </para>

          <para class="block">I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether the insertion of such an advertisement is not illegal. If it is not, it is, in my opinion, the business of this House to make it illegal. In my opinion, all men in business, or otherwise engaged, who endeavour to discourage compulsory military training under the present system should be punished in some way or another. During a debate in this House when the question of compulsory training was under consideration, I pointed out on more than one occasion that something of this kind would occur, and that employers of labour who would shout from the house-tops about their patriotism and assert that they are in favour of compulsory training would, the moment it touched them, endeavour to evade their duty as members of the community. If that sort of thing continues, no youth who has compulsory service to do will be able to obtain employment when those who are exempt can be got. I know two men, one in the hairdressing business, and the other in the bakery business, who will not take youths who have military training to do. If preference is given to those who have not to perform drill, young men will resort to unfair methods to secure exemption. It behoves the Min- istry, the House, and all well-thinking people to see if something cannot be done to prevent this kind of thing. </para>

              <para>- Regarding the matter brought under notice by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, I know of no law that has been violated by the advertisement; but the person advertising has put himself into a position which I should not like to occupy were I a business man asking for the services of a youth. </para>

              <para>- In that case something will have to be done.I hope that the number of those who are thus encouraging youths to evade their service to the country is not large, and that public opinion will discountenance this sort of thing. Advertisements like that which has been read cannot be too strongly reprobated. The action of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports in bringing the matter forward has the sympathy of the Government. It is reprehensible for citizens to encourage our lads to evade their public duties by putting a premium on exemption. </para>
