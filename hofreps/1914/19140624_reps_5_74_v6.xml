                            <para>- They have purchased the leases; there is no freehold. It is really the unexpired term of certain leases that has been acquired by the English company, and, speaking from memory, I think they now have about 14,000 square miles, and, perhaps, about 2,000 square miles of permit country; but the permits are determinable &#34;on short notice. </para>

                        <para>- I have some further particulars furnished by the architect, 80 that I can amplify what I said in reply to the honorable member last week. It is the desire that timber, marble, and other products of the various Australian States shall be represented in the building as much as possible. The architects examined the various timbers available, and we caused an inquiry to be made as to the amount of seasoned timber of the class required to be obtained in the various States. I think there was trouble about getting a sufficient quantity of sea- . soned timber, but we ultimately got over that by making an arrangement with the Government seasoning works at Newport to do the seasoning. This was after careful examination and testing both here and in the Old Country. The result is that, approximately, 530,000 lineal feet of flooring timber and 117,000 superficial feet of joinery timber will be sent. It is proposed to use on the ground-floor New South Wales tallow-wood timber; on the first, fifth, and sixth floors the yellow stringybark of Victoria; on the second floor, hooppine from Queensland; on the ground floor, jarrah from Western Australia; and for the entresol, third and fourth floors, the stringybark of Tasmania. I have also particulars of the various quantities that have already been shipped; but I pass on to mention that we are availing ourselves of what excellent marble we have here for the purposes of Australia House. The varieties and quantities of marble asked for were as follows: - Buchan marble, Victoria, 8,000 cubic feet; Kapunda marble, South Australia, 2,440 cubic feet; dark Caleula marble, New South Wales, 671 cubic feet; and white Angaston, South Australia, 2,181 cubic feet. An additional small quantity has been, or is being, sent Home, but it is not necessary to mention the particulars. It will be seen that at Australia House there will be a good representation of what Australia can produce in these directions. </para>

                        <para>- This morning I received a telegram from Papua to the following effect: - Some time ago a Samoan teacher of the London Mission at Aird Hill, in the Kikori district, was threatened and attacked by natives, and subsequently two men named Williams, when proceeding past the Aird Hill village in a boat, were threatened, and had spears thrown at them. A patrol officer named Herbert, accompanied by sixteen native police, was sent up at night to Aird Hill to effect an arrest. The party having landed and surrounded the dubu, or big native house, the patrol officer and four of the native police entered, and the natives of the village stampeded to the end of the dubu. The police, on approaching the natives, were opposed by five or six natives with heavy spears, and by a native with a club, who rushed and attacked Herbert. A spear was thrown, and passed through Herbert&#39;s clothing, while a police constable was also struck. On the spears being thrown, Herbert ordered his police to fire, and he himself fired two shots with his revolver over the heads of the natives. The constable also fired. I am quoting the words in the telegram from memory. I understand that the police who were left outside then commenced firing in the dark contrary to orders, and it is deplorable to relate that ten natives were killed. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member must not, as, indeed, he would not, judge too rashly. An inquiry into the circumstances has been begun. The Commissioner of Native Affairs has gone up for the purpose, and I have wired to Papua asking that the inquiry should be most exhaustive, and drawing attention to certain points which struck me on reading the telegram. I may mention that four natives were arrested, and stated that a quantity of arms had been collected, as they intended an attack for the purpose of securing blood for the christening of three boats. The native ceremony of christening boats with human blood has led to a great deal of the deplorable bloodshed that in recent years, at all events, has occurred in parts of Papua. </para>

                <para>Almost every day we are listening to charges of manipulating the rolls, and gerrymandering the elections. There is not a tittle of truth in any of the statements they are making. </para>
                <para>I propose to give some facts. I will give the Prime Minister the names and addresses of individuals who have been objected to within the last week or two, and I will leave it to him to say whether fair play has been meted out to those electors. In the Ballan subdivision of Ballarat, on the last Federal roll, printed in October, 1913, there were 1,946 names. Of these, 259 have already been struck off, and, in addition, 165 names have been handed to the Electoral Registrar for removal. Included in this list of 165 are the names of many Labour supporters who are still residing in the subdivision. This represents 22 per cent. of the total enrolment. </para>

                <para class="block">When the State rolls were being compiled and objections lodged, the police officer, Constable Weppner, lodged an objection against Carberry&#39;s name being placed on the roll. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Molloy,</inline> the Chief Electoral Officer for the State directed that the name should be retained upon the State roll, and to withdraw the objection, because Carberry was living in the subdivision. It must not be forgotten that in this respect the Commonwealth and State laws are somewhat similar, yet notwithstanding that instruction by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Molloy,</inline> Constable Weppner has sent to the Divisional Returning Officer for the Federal electorate the name of this man as one to which objection should be taken. He holds that he should not be on the roll for the subdivision of Ballan. </para>

He was born in the district, and has never lived out of it.

                        <para>- And in not 500 of those cases could the objection be sustained. If that man had been required to lodge 5s. with each objection sent in by him he would have been more careful. I ask the Attorney-General whether it is not a serious matter that agents for political parties should be sending in to the Electoral Registrars long lists of names to be objected to, and asking that those names should be removed? The Government have sent out the police to make a canvass; but they have really been sent out to strike names off the roll and not to put them on. The police send in to the Electoral Officer the names to which they think objection should be taken, and the Electoral Officer has not the means at his command to make a proper investigation. Ballan, for instance, is 20 miles from Ballarat, and the Registrar at the last-named city must take the word of the police in these matters. In this case he would be taking the word of a very biased man. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what is being done there. I am dealing with what is happening in my own electorate. If the Liberal party can capture the Ballarat seat by fair means then &#34; good luck to them.&#34; I do not desire to represent a minority; but I do wish to see retained on the rolls every name that should remain there. Volunteers in the Labour movement who are prepared to make sacrifices for the cause have gone from house to house within a radius of 10 miles in the Ballan subdivision with the object of securing the re-enrolment of those whose names have been improperly removed from the rolls and objected to. </para>

But I have read to the House the names of people who are living about his own door-way, so to speak - people whom he is meeting every day. It seems to mc, therefore, that only a bitter partisan could act as he has done. There can be no doubt as to that. He would not be permitted to act as he is doing if the Electoral Act were carried out in its integrity. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to prove it. The Prime Minister says I am damning men, without their having an opportunity of being heard. I have to go before the electors in the course of a few months, and I will be quite prepared to abide by their judgment. The people in that locality know that I am telling the truth, and that there is no right to object to these names. I charge the Government with having, through the Attorney-General, opened the door for the disfranchisement of electors. The Attorney-General, immediately after he came into office, let it be known, first of all through the Liberal Leagues, that they could, through their agents, furnish information to the electoral officers, and that the fee of 5s., which is supposed to accompany an objection, need not be paid. In thousands these names have been furnished, with the result that thousands of names of electors have been struck off the roll, although they are entitled to remain on the roll. I know that the answer of the Attorney-General will be that the particulars supplied by the agents to the electoral officers are not objections, but merely information. That is very true, but the Government have not given the electoral officers sufficient help to enable them to investigate these objections. I would not impose a monetary penalty upon any one who lodges an objection against a person who has a right to remain on the roll. I would put that man in gaol for six months. It ought to be a criminal offence to remove from the roll the names of people who are residents in a district, and many of whom have never removed from the one locality. We could give tomorrow morning the names of 200 people in the Ballarat electorate who have never left their houses during the last ten years, and yet objections have been sent out in regard to them. That is most unfair. If the Government think they are going to secure a victory by these means at the forthcoming elections, they are making a huge blunder. The people are awakening to the fact that something unfair is being attempted in connexion with the rolls. In my district the people themselves are organizing, because they recognise that no one&#39;s vote is secure when so many objections are being sent out, simply because the Government have decided to accept the information sent in by various political agents, without requiring the payment of the fee of 5s., which should accompany every objection. </para>

The Liberal party charged us with having at the last elections gone to the cemeteries and raised the dead to vote for us. In my own electorate, if we can combat the unfair methods of the Liberal organizers, we can win without the assistance of the dead, and I shall come back to this Chamber with a majority of, not 358, but 2,000 or 3,000. I know that 259 names have been struck off Ballan subdivision. In addition to that, there have been 165 names objected to, although in scores of cases the people have never left the district. I guarantee that during the last three months many of those people have not been out of the subdivision for one day, yet objections have been sent to them. In many cases the wife receives the objection, places it on the mantel-piece, and forgets all about it. Then when the election comes round, the husband finds that he has no vote, </para>

                        <para>- The Government ha.ve done their best to disfranchise, in a wholesale manner, thousands of electors. I quite believe the circular which the Prime Minister read the other day as having been issued from some Labour office in New South Wales, and m which an appeal was addressed to the electors to get on the rolls on account of the latest dodge of the Cook Government. The circular was badly needed, and we shall want something like that in the Ballarat district, when we have 22 per cent, of the voters in one subdivision objected to. </para>

                        <para>- The names have been sent in by the local constable, acting on instructions from the Government. The Government made no preparation whatever to put people on the roll. There were no instructions issued that the police should carry enrolment cards; so far as I can gather, the only instruction to them was to ascertain the names of the people who have gone away from the district for which they were enrolled. When the constable went to a house and found the elector temporarily away, he marked a cross against that name, and the Divisional Officer had no alternative but to send out an objection. In many cases the working people, particularly in the farming districts, are continually moving away from their homes. They are not permanently employed in one place, although their homes are permanent. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General cannot deny that, shortly after his assumption of office, he issued, through the press, instructions to all political parties that they could lodge an information without paying the fee of 5s., which the Electoral Act requires to be paid. Indeed, the Government made provision to that effect in their Bill of 1913. They should have waited until their Bill became an Act of Parliament, but they have anticipated matters somewhat. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brazenor</inline> had to lodge 5s. with every objection, he would be very careful before making any objection, and would satisfy himself that the persons objected to had really left the district. I do not think that he would have objected to 4,200 names had he been forced to lodge 5s. with each objection. But we are not alarmed about these objections now. We know that not more than 500 of the names objected to have been removed from the roll. There has been a foolish idea abroad that we in Ballarat won the last election by the means of the absentee votes cast at Broken Hill ; but those votes numbered only thirty-three. I suppose that I got them all, because those who live at Broken Hill are intelligent persons. It was my duty to draw attention to what is going on in connexion with the compilation of the rolls. I have exposed what I believe to be a most unfair action on the part of the Government. </para>

The honorable member said that he was glad that that leaflet had been issued, and that it was time that something of the kind was issued in the constituency which he represents. That is a fair indication of the sort of contest upon which honorable members opposite, or some of them, propose to enter. </para>

I have disregarded that and the host of other personal accusations which have been showered on my head by honorable members opposite and their supporters outside, because I have been particularly anxious that the immediate business before the House should be disposed of, and had I attempted to meet all the calumnies circulated concerning me, that would not have been possible. </para>

The statement to which I am now referring is being reiterated, with the sanction of the Leader of the Opposition, on the eve of a general election, and must, therefore, be met. The accusation is made that I, having been intrusted by my colleagues with the duty of looking into the electoral law, authorized the issue of a regulation, or an instruction, permitting a provision of the Electoral Act requiring the lodging of 5s. with objections to names on the roll to be dispensed with. My reply is, first, that no regulation or instruction of the kind has been issued. </para>

                        <para>- This intimation by a member of the Government to all who are busying themselves, on both sides of politics, in trying to cleanse the rolls, that it is a desirable, patriotic, and proper thing to furnish information, has been construed into a statement that persons may do something without paying 5s. for which the Act requires 5s. to be paid. This construction can be put upon my words only with the deliberate desire to mislead the public, or because of complete ignorance of the provisions of the electoral law. I am prepared to give some of my honorable friends opposite the benefit of the doubt, and to assume that what they have said has proceeded from complete ignorance of the law about which they have been speaking. </para>

                        <para>-I intend, once and for all, to dispose of this shameful attempt on the part of some honorable members to distort the truth and to mislead the public. There is in the Electoral Act a provision requiring the payment of 5s. in connexion with the lodging of a formal objection to a name on the roll. Section 67 gives the right to any one to call upon, through the Returning Officers, any person whose name is enrolled to show cause why his name should not be struck off the roll, but for the exercise of that privilege 5s. must be paid. When that is done, it becomes the duty of the Returning Officer to give notice forthwith to the person to whose name objection has been taken. Section 70 says - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The notice may be in the prescribed form, and be served by posting it to the last-known place of abode of the person objected to ; or, if that is not known, then to the place cf living appearing on the roll. </para>
                    <para>Where the Returning Officer is satisfied that the ground of objection stated in any objection is not a good ground of objection, he may dismiss the objection, in which case no notice of the objection need he given to the person objected to. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Section 71 says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The person objected to may, orally or in writing, in the prescribed manner, answer the objection. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Section 72 adds: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>On receipt of the answer of the person objected to, or after the expiration of twenty days from the posting of the notice, the Returning Officer shall determine the objection, and if it appears that the person objected to is not qualified or entitled to be enrolled on the roll, shall strike out his name. </para>
                    <para>If any objection is held by the Returning Officer to be frivolous, the person objected to shall he entitled to a reasonable allowance, not exceeding &#163;5. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>This is a perfectly familiar form of summons to show cause. The person who wishes to place himself in the position of an objector, and who claims the right to insist on the Returning Officer investigating any particular case, and, on summoning an elector to show cause, must start the process by paying 5s., and incurs the liability, if not successful, of having to pay costs to a sum not exceeding &#163;5. That is an ordinary case of giving to a man the right, under certain conditions, to become what is known in law as an actor in judicial proceedings. </para>
                <para class="block">Every man who desires to purchase the right to insist that the Returning Officer shall pursue his objection and have it tested, must still lodge 5s. with his objection. That provision does not conflict with, nor in the least degree affect, the duty lying on every Registrar, on the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, and on the electoral officer for each State, and all other electoral officers, to receive information from any source from which they can get it. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary, I tell you, and the Chief Electoral Officer will tell you the same thing, that the electoral officers have always deemed it to be their duty to act on information of the kind to which I refer. How could it be otherwise? Honorable members must bring a little common sense to bear on these matters. If they do, they will see that no Electoral Office could be administered properly unless those in charge of the cleansing of the rolls were prepared to receive, from any source that they thought reliable, information that would enable them to act. The honorable member for Ballarat has given us to-day a very fair example of the kind of statements that have been brought before this House, over and over again, and have been repeated from platforms as if conclusive evidence of the truth. He has given us a list of statements made regarding certain individuals. We have had such statements inquired into over and over again, and these statements will be inquired into. Every other similar statement has been investigated by the Electoral officials, under the direction of the Government. Probably, there will be very little more substance in the statements which the honorable member has brought under notice than there has been found in most other similar statements. But there shall be investigation - I can tell the honorable member that. Before any investigation is made, however, a constable, who is carrying out his public duties, is charged by the honorable member for Ballarat with being partial - a biased partisan. </para>

Without any inquiry or information beyond that supplied, perhaps, in a partial hearsay statement of some friends of his own, he publicly charges a public officer, who is carrying out his duties under the Act, with being a partisan, simply because, in trying to cleanse the rolls, he has brought a considerable number of names under the notice of the Returning Officer. </para>

                        <para>- Next, we had the public statement of the Attorney-General, in which he invited persons to make representations in order that the rolls might be &#34; purged &#34; and &#34; purified &#34; ; in other words, in order that names might be removed. It is as obvious as anything could be, that the Government hope to win the forthcoming election by stripping the rolls of many of the names now on them. The Government appear to believe, though I can scarcely think it is an honest belief, that the rolls were so unduly inflated at the last election that many persons voted who had no right to do so, and that others voted twice. </para>

There is hardly a member on this side of the House but who has mentioned scores of persons in his electorate whose names have been challenged, and, in many cases, improperly removed. </para>

In one case I asked an officer why he had caused a name to be challenged, and his explanation was that the police, when they called at the address, had not been supplied with the name. Yet the objection to that name takes the form that the person does not live, and has not lived for a month, in the division. Neither the person who made the objection nor the person who had to consider it had any evidence - but the negative evidence referred to - that the person had so ceased to reside for one month or one minute. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member asks for a definite case, and I shall give him one to show how the section is being overridden and the law disregarded. The name of a person who had resided in the same place for twenty years was challenged, and a notice was sent that unless, within twenty days, cause was shown, the name would be removed from the roll. The matter was brought under my notice, and I wrote for an explanation of the fact that, under the circumstances, the person, who in this case was a lady, would be put to the trouble of defending her case or having her name struck off the roll. The explanation that was forwarded to me was that when the police called for the names of those resident in the house this particular name was not supplied. As I have already pointed out, the form of the notice of objection by the Registrar is that the person does not reside, and has not resided for a month, in any part of the division of Batman; and the person who made the objection could not have had the slightest knowledge of whether this lady did reside or had ceased to reside in the subdivision, much less in the division, which means the entire electorate. It was enough for him that the name was not there and then supplied at the particular place and time. The section in the Act shows how strict were the conditions laid down relating to objections; and how jealously the members of the Labour party, when a Government, guarded the interests of persons entitled to exercise the franchise. It is provided in the Act that any outsider who lodges an objection shall make a deposit of 5s., and render himself liable for costs; but I say deliberately that, as the result of the public utterances of the Attorney-General, who invites the public to raise objections, and as a result of the action of the Prime Minister in repeatedly declaring in this House and outside that the rolls must be &#34; purged,&#34; and, further, as a result of the cynical observation of the Honorary Minister in regard to the provision for the deposit having &#34; all gone by the board &#34;- </para>

                        <para>- What I say is that, as a result of the attitude of Ministers, whose object plainly is to strip the rolls of names and not to have names added, any person, however inconsequential, and on grounds however slender, may lodge objections, and render persons liable to have their names removed. Day after day hundreds of names are being taken off the rolls, and I cannot see how, under the circumstances, we can have the &#34; square, standup fight&#34; mentioned by the Prime Minister. Of course, I do not accuse the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General of deliberately causing names to be removed, but emphatically say that their declarations invite private individuals to disregard the law, and invite Returning Officers to challenge names on quite insufficient grounds. I submit that the charge made by the honorable member for Ballarat is absolutely sustained by the facts. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Batman charges the Government with having departed from the practice of our predecessors. He declared that the provision in regard to the deposit of 5s. is no longer carried out, and endeavoured to make us believe that it was always exacted when the Labour Government were in power. Is that the case? A dead silence ! The honorable member said, in effect, that every objection lodged when the Labour Government were in power carried with it a deposit of 5s. </para>

                        <para>- Yet honorable members opposite talk about desiring clean rolls. If honorable members wish to get a true indication of what sincerity there is behind the present protestations of honorable members opposite, they should weigh a statement that fell from the lips of the honorable member for Batman. Speaking of a gentleman who had only recently been secretary of a union, to which he is the legal adviser - speaking of the very gentleman who got him that remunerative job in connexion with that union - he described him as a perjurer. Thus he spoke of a man to whom he has owed so much in the last few years. </para>

                <para>What is the actual position with regard to this 5s. fee? We have heard so much - it can only he described in a word of three letters - of this bogus charge throughout Australia recently that we might as well know exactly what is done in the matter of objecting to names on the rolls. When any person has reason to believe that a man or woman whose name appears on a roll is no longer resident in the subdivision, it is his or her duty, as the case may be, as an ordinary patriotic citizen, to acquaint the authorities with the fact, and allow the authorities to inquire into the accuracy of it. People come forward and acquaint the Electoral Office, and the office inquires into the facts. That is all that happens. The honorable member for Ballarat says that it is not fair to put the duty on the office to inquire into the facts, because, as he says, after an objection is lodged, and a notice is sent to the elector whose name is objected to, the wives of Ballarat have so little regard for the interests of their husbands that they do not bother about bringing the notices under the attention of their husbands, and so the latter become disfranchised. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. &#34;It is only for the old man ; we need not bother about it ! &#34; That is their attitude, according to the honorable member for Ballarat. But the statement of the honorable member shows conclusively that whenever any organizers come along, Liberal or Labour, and say that So-and-so has left the district, the office does not take the word of these organizers, but sends along the notice of objection to the address of the elector objected to. Then, of course, if he takes no notice of it, and does not go to the office, or let it know that it is a mistake, the office naturally assumes that the man is not living at the address given. </para>

If there is no truth in this gross slander on the housewives of Ballarat, and if a person receiving an objection acts reasonably on receiving it, and takes proper caution to protect his own interests, no person who is entitled to be there can be removed from the Commonwealth roll. But what do we find has arisen in New South Wales to-day ? The Labour leagues are making doubly sure that there is to be an inflated roll by telling people that their names are being removed when that is not the case.

He made a charge that the name of a lady had been removed from the roll, and I understand that when he came forward in order to substantiate it all he could produce was a notice from a Political Labour League, to tell her that her name had been removed from the roll, though all the time it had not been removed. However, the League said it was not there, and an innocent person in another place accepted the statement of the League and thought it was good enough to fire off at the Government. That is one case. I believe this sort of thing is going on all over Australia. I believe the motion put up this afternoon is only another chapter in a veritable conspiracy of mendacity with the object of- </para>

                    <para>.- The speakers on the other side have used a- lot of heat in the matter. I am a new member, and it is the first time I have heard honorable members using such violent language. They have not, however, touched on the point raised by the honorable member for Ballarat. At the beginning of the session there was a lot of bandying of words about slandering the general public, and a lot of talk about how loose a measure the Electoral Act was in allowing of duplication and inflation of rolls, and heaven knows what. The only safeguard in the Act appears to be the deposit of 5s. I happened to be in the Electoral Office in Adelaide on the day the lady referred to by the Honorary Minister lodged an objection against some one else who was masquerading as her husband&#39;s wife, to which she objected. The abrogation of the provision in the Act means the further opening of the door to a lot of mendacity on the part of members of Liberal unions. We do not come to the House and make statements without backing them up. The honorable member for Ballarat has given names, and is prepared to back up his accusations. I wish to show the effect the abrogation of this fee has had on the Liberal Union in South Australia. This union is at the head of the Fusion in that State, and the present Commonwealth Government is a Fusion Government, and we can judge them by the company they keep. I have a copy of the official circular of the Liberal Union in South Australia appearing under the names of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> J. McLachlan,  president,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> G. Freeman, general secretary, and dated the 17th June, 1914. I shall not quote the whole of the circular, because it proceeds to advertise the candidates whom tl&#39;0 union supports, but there is one name on that list to which I must draw attention. When men sneak out of the Labour party, they seem to find a haven of rest o i the other side. I see the name of P. N. Daley, described as &#34;a further supporter of country interests.&#34; He ran on two occasions as an outright Labour man, but could not secure election, and so now he is taken into the fold of the Liberal Union. There is one paragraph in this circular which is headed &#34; Cleanse the rolls.&#34; That is the cry with which the Liberals are going round. </para>

Their efforts are not calculated to bring about the desired result of clean rolls. We do not fear clean rolls. I hope that the roll in South Australia will be absolutely clean, so that there may be no chance of fuddling  the electors. Last time we gave the Liberals a hot time, and this time we will give them beans. We are going to capture nearly, if not wholly, two more seats in South Australia. That is something that honorable members can take home and sleep on. Let us see what the Liberals are doing in South Australia.

                <para class="block">There is the slander. There is the lie issued by the secretary of the Liberal Union in South Australia, and subscribed to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> J. McLachlan, just as the &#34; breeding-cows &#34; libel was subscribed to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon</inline> and printed in his office. Though they sacked one man afterwards as a scape-goat, it did not relieve them of the responsibility of uttering that scandal, just as now they are issuing this slander against this side, who can beat them one hand and kneeling in a fair fight. This circular illustrates the power that has been given by the construction the Attorney-General placed on the section of the Act which demands the 5s. deposit; and the Government know that if they had not given their acquiescence to the reading of the provision in that way, the people of Australia would observe the provision, and any one with a legitimate objection would put down the deposit of 5s. as a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> of his desire to have a clean roll. But the slander does not stop at electors who have the right to exercise the franchise. It goes much further. It is well known that the majority of the electoral officers have Liberal rather than Labour leanings; yet even they are hit at. The Liberal party tell us that they are going to have a cleansing of the rolls. From their point of view, everything is going to be put right, but I am confident that on the Monday following the general elections we shall have them saying that everything is all wrong. People nowadays are not to be gulled by such trash. It has been said that we did nothing to cleanse the rolls, and that we told those who merely thought they were not on the rolls to send in fresh applications. </para>
                <para class="block">The actual facts are that at every meeting that we hold a copy of the rolls is on view. If any elector finds that his name is not on the roll, he is advised to send in a fresh application card. Here is another statement in this circular from the general secretary of the Liberal Union of South Australia - </para>

                    <para>Electoral Officers. - I shall be pleased if you will report to me early any cases where the local electoral officers who have charge of the conduct of the polling, &#38;c, are not men of sober habits and good character, impartial in their judgment, and capable of carrying out duties imposed upon them in a trustworthy and intelligent manner, satisfactory to the general public; or the  same  in respect of any temporary men employed.

                <para class="block">Apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Freeman</inline> has power to see that things are put right. This is an intimation that the policy to be adopted by the Liberal party is that of &#34; Spoils to the victors. The Liberal party are on top ! They will do what you want!&#34; Whom do they propose shall judge these electoral officials? When the Labour party were in power, the Minister of Home Affairs found that in certain cases the position was unsatisfactory, and he openly directed that certain individuals should not be employed as electoral officials. When this became known, a great hubbub was raised. Here, however, we have the general secretary of the Liberal Union of South Australia taking this action. There can be no doubt that those declared to be lacking in sobriety, in intelligence, or wanting in honour, would be officials with Labour leanings. I left this House for Adelaide on Friday last with the words of the Prime Minister ringing in my ears, &#34; Sheet home one case.&#34; What has he to say to this complaint? Does the right honorable gentleman wish us to prove our charges in each case by bringing before him the Liberal organizer and the man whose enrolment has been objected to by him, in order to prove that the elector is not dead, and has not removed from the subdivision in question ? In this circular <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Freeman</inline> asks the organizers of the Liberal party to let him know the names of Labour supporters who have lost their qualification for enrolment. </para>

                <para class="block">All these, according to the Liberal organizers, have lost their qualifications. When I asked the Honorary Minister last week a question regarding the removal of these and other names from the rolls, I was told that I should have made inquiries before bringing the matter before the House. I was not permitted to explain that inquiries had been made, and that no satisfaction could be obtained, the name of the individual who had sent in these objections not having been given. The list does not stop there. In the case of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Biscoby,</inline> he was told by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> G. Brennan that his name had been reported by a Liberal Union organizer. I have it on official authority that the list from which that name was taken was a large one sent in by a Liberal organizer. I believe that, following the usual practice, notices of objection were sent out, but why should any one be allowed to object to the enrolment of a man who has been resident in one place for twenty years? We do not mind a fair objection, but we take exception to tactics of this kind. We have been accused of passing an Electoral Act which opens the door to fraud. After the last general elections the Liberal party and their newspapers made allegations of dual voting, and said that even the dead had been resurrected to vote. The Electoral Commission has obtained no evidence to support any of these charges, and we now find that the Department is lending itself to a practice which is likely to make the rolls even worse than they were. We were asked to sheet home one case. We have sheeted home more than one, and when the honorable member for Ballarat this afternoon sheeted home several cases, the Prime Minister&#39;s reply was that the honorable member was taking an unfair advantage of the police officer concerned. If he had not mentioned his name the right honorable gentleman would have said, &#34; Tell me who is doing this, and I will have the matter looked into.&#34; The Government have an opportunity now to do something. Let them ascertain from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Freeman</inline> how many objections have been sent in as the result of his circular, and also how many objections have been lodged by representatives of the Labour party of South Australia. I am prepared to say that we have not lodged any. When I was secretary of the Labour party there it was not my desire to cause any names to be removed, but I did my best to see that every qualified person was enrolled. We worked in the open. Any person was free to call at our office. Our doors were always open, and more than once we had inquiries from persons who, it was palpable, came there only to &#34; quiz.&#34; One woman even asked me to mark off in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the names of the Liberal and Labour members. I did not know whether she was a suffragette or not, but I did what she asked. I repeat that we work with open doors, and that, in order to win an election, we have never descended to tactics which will not bear the full light of day. </para>

I am afraid that his services as a prophet have not been fully recognised, but, by way of consolation, I would remind him that on great authority a prophet is not without honour save in his own country. The honorable member seems to have been greatly perturbed by the issue of a circular by the Liberal Union of South Australia, the very substance of which is an instruction to organizers to advise the general secretary of the names of any Labour supporters who are on the roll, although they are not qualified to be on the roll. </para>

                        <para>- Then, why all this indignation on the part of the Opposition ? Is there not a just reason for the action taken ? It is notorious that the rolls are inflated and unreliable. As to the charge that so many thousands have really been struck off the rolls, I have some official figures of interest. The number of names on the rolls at the date of the last Federal elections, and the approximate number on the rolls at the present time, are shown in the following statement prepared under the authority of the Chief Electoral Officer :  - </para>

Only one thing would justify the attacks which have been made, and that is if honorable members opposite were able to indicate or bring a scintilla of evidence to show that there had been any corrupt or improper practice on the pa.rt of the Government in connexion with the making up of the rolls. There has never been the slightest proof or evidence of any kind. All these slanderous statements are made on various platforms, and charges are hurled against the Government although honorable gentlemen opposite well know there is no foundation whatever for them.

At first, the honorable member said that it was a regulation; that was watered down to an instruction, and, ultimately, to an intimation by the Government that the law should be disobeyed. There was nothing in the statement of the Attorney-General which allowed of any possibility of such a construction being honestly placed upon it. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the Government are responsible for the position created in connexion with the rolls, by reason of the statement made by the Attorney-General when introducing his Electoral Amendment Bill of 1913. On that occasion he publicly invited members of political organizations to lodge objections to names on the roll. My complaint is not against the Electoral Registrars, because these political organizations have lodged so many objections that the Divisional Returning Officer for the district has not the time at his disposal to make the necessary inquiries. </para>

                    <para>.- I will continue the remarks I had commenced on the motion for the adjournment, and I will repeat my statement that the Attorney-General, by the statement which he made on the floor of the House when introducing his Electoral Amendment Bill of 1913, was responsible for the position which has arisen in connexion with the rolls. The honorable member for Illawarra, when speaking the other day, drew the attention of the Committee to the fact that 1484 names had been objected to in the Riverina electorate by a gentleman of the name of Archdale Parkhill, who was not an elector of that particular constituency. That seemed a rather remarkable statement, but the representative of that district, when speaking on the same afternoon, admitted the correctness of the figures submitted by the honorable member for Illawarra, and made the further remarkable admission that for the first time in the history of the Libera&#93; movement the whole of that electorate had been canvassed, and as a result those 1484 names had been sent in to the Returning Officer by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill.</inline></para>

That is the form of canvass which the honorable member for Riverina has admitted to have been carried on in his electorate. What has been done in Riverina has been done in almost every electorate throughout Australia. Paid canvassers have been sent through the electorates, not to assist persons entitled to enrolment to have their names placed on the rolls, but to lodge objections. If the objections had been confined to the names of persons not entitled to enrolment, neither I nor any other member would have any fault to find with them. We have no objection to the erasure of any name wrongly on the roll ; but what has been done has been to object to thousands of names which are rightly on the roll, those lodging the objections knowing the names to be rightly enrolled. </para>

                        <para>- He did not lodge one penny. Prior to the 1913 election, the Labour party assisted, as far as lay in its power, to obtain the enrolment of persons entitled to vote, and it is doing so on this occasion. Notwithstanding tie great organization with which our opponents credit us, not one objection has been sent by us to any Registrar in Victoria. But the Liberal party has taken full advantage of the advice of the Attorney-General to assist the Government in purging the rolls, and has objected to thousands of names which are rightly enrolled. In the case to which I have just drawn attention, there was no possibility of a mistake. The objections were lodged by a paid organizer of the Liberal party in New South Wales, the name of the father, who is a Liberal, not being objected to, and. the names of the mother and other members of the family being objected to. What was done in that case has been done in thousands of other cases. I believe that the Registrars are doing all in their power to cope with the situation; but an immense amount of work is being forced on them by the lodging of objections by irresponsible persons at the invitation of the Government. The protest of honorable members against what is happening is justified, and so is the criticism that has been levelled against the Attorney-General for inviting irresponsible persons to take on themselves the business of cleansing the rolls, which has led to thousands of names being wrongly objected to. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Prime Minister will take notice of what has been said by members of the Opposition this afternoon. We would not bring these matters under the notice of the House were it not that hundreds of electors in each division are complaining of being harassed. This morning I received information that about 500 names in the Coburg subdivision of Maribyrnong had been objected to; but, on inquiry, I found that the officials were satisfied that more than 200 of these names should not have been objected to. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and the names were properly on the roll. Yet those who are thus properly enrolled are harassed by receiving notice that their enrolment is objected to. The greater number of the names whose enrolment is objected to are those of Labour supporters. Every person in the community, of twenty-one years of age or over, is qualified for enrolment, whatever his or her political opinions, and it should be the concern of every member of Parliament to see that every person qualified for enrolment is given an opportunity to vote. The Prime Minister says that the coming election is to be a real, good, stand-up political fight, and I hope that neither side will have any unfair advantage. It is a serious thing that in one subdivision 200 names have been wrongly objected to. </para>

I have had complaints from other subdivisions besides Coburg. Each person whose name is objected to, and is found to be rightly enrolled, should be informed that his name will remain on the roll ; but no intimation of the kind is being sent out. We should not harass citizens who have complied with all the requirements of the Electoral Act. Were a Labour Government in power, the honorable member would be the first to complain if, in a thickly populated subdivision, he found that 200 names had been wrongly objected to. </para>

                        <para>- The Electoral Bill introduced last session provided for the abolition of the 5s. fee which must accompany objections, but the only way in which we can safeguard electors, whatever their political opinions, is to prevent unscrupulous persons from objecting to their enrolment. I intend to act the part of the detective, and to investigate fully the cases to which I have referred, and others. Members on this side are receiving sheaves of letters stating that injustice of all kinds is being done. The honorable member for Kooyong spoke of the total number of electors on the roll, but no member knows what the enrolment for his constituency will be. In Maribyrnong, the supplemental roll will contain something like 7,000 names, and an enormous amount of confusion will be created by the wholesale objections to names. Whenever an elector comes to me within a short time of the election, and there is any doubt about his enrolment, I shall recommend him to fill up a claim card, and to send it in. Neither I nor the elector will have time to make inquiries, and I think it best to make assurance doubly sure. </para>

I am thankful that the curtain has been lifted, and 1 shall not be surprised if, all over Australia, indignation meetings are held, denouncing the Government for trying to cheat the electors out of their franchise rights. </para>

                        <para>- Of course; but I do not see why residents, who may have been in the one place for as long as twenty years, should have notices of this kind served on them, apparently without any previous investigation. All these cases show that there is something very defective in the administration. For instance, in Coburg a total of 500 names were objected to, but, fortunately, some inquiry was made, and it was found that over 200 were properly qualified to remain on the roll. The responsibility for this is largely due to the announcement of the Attorney-General last year. In the Bill that was introduced by the Honorary Minister - and introduced in a fashion that, I am sure, was not relished by his own side - there was a clause, which, had it been carried, would have abolished the- deposit of 5s. in the case of the lodging of an objection; and what the Government could not do by Act of Parliament, and what they are not doing even by regulation or on direct instruction, they are doing in another way by inviting wholesale objections. We are on the eve of an election; and I hope that the people will have a mind to those who are endeavouring to deprive them of the franchise. </para>

                    <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline> Having read in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> where you asked the Acting Minister of Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> to inquire into the case of a cadet who was sentenced at the Essendon Police Court to imprisonment for having failed to return to drill when he had been sent home to get his uniform. The cadet in this case is my son, Charles Alfred Spong, and 1 would like you to know the particulars of the case. </para>
                    <para>My son applied for leave of absence from parade on the 14th March, 1914, which yon will see by the form enclosed was granted. By missing that parade made him two hours short in his time. Tuesday, the 9th inst., being a voluntary drill, he went to make his time good. Owing to it being late, and having over 2 miles to walk, ho went to parade in his private clothes. The officer in charge sent him home to put on his uniform, and return. When he arrived he informed me the reason of being sent home. He also told me he was suffering pain from rheumatics. It was then about 9 p.m. Being a voluntary drill, under the circumstances I told him to go to bed, not knowing that it would be considered an offence. The drill instructor has allowed him to stand out from the ranks on three occasions on account of his suffering, and as late as Saturday, the 13th inst., he had to allow him to stand out. I may also state, on the day he appeared at Court, he was one hour in advance in his drill. Inclosed you will find letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Flanagan,</inline> who has attended my son. </para>
                    <para>The reason my son had to go to Essendon to drill was, he was attending St. Thomas&#39; Grammar School. He had to make that time good before he could get his clearance to Ascot Vale Company. </para>

                    <para>The father of this boy I know personally as a man who would not permit his son to shirk any duty, but would always insist on his doing the correct thing. Such officers as the one referred to are doing more than any one else to break up our system of defence; and they would be all the better for a little seasoning of common sense. This lad was brought up at a Police Court at Essendon, and not even fined, but sentenced to a term of detention for disobeying orders. The same sort of thing is occurring elsewhere, though, of course, there are some officers who carry out their duties efficiently and with discretion. There are boys who respect their instructors, and love the work; but, on the other hand, some of the instructors by their conduct simply give rise to a rebellious spirit. I know very well that, if I were a boy and saw a comrade badly treated, as some of these lads are, I should feel considerable resentment, and, doubtless, would take his part. I hope that when these facts are known, the authorities will make some investigation with a view to putting these officers in their proper place. If this particular officer acted deliberately, with full knowledge, he is certainly not fitted for his present position. </para>

                    <para>. - Last Friday, the honorable member for Newcastle brought under my notice some facts into which I promised to inquire, and to make some reply concerning them to-day. The honorable member said that, at the time of the outbreak of small-pox in New South Wales action was taken by the State authority, and by the Federal authority, to establish vaccination depots at various places. In that, the honorable member was speaking under a misapprehension, because the Commonwealth never established any vaccination depots. </para>

                        <para>- Any depots that were established were established solely by the States. The honorable member also referred to the system of isolation, and I have to point out that, during the particular outbreak referred to, the Commonwealth did not interfere in regard to any management within the States. The question nf how the disease should be stamped out in New South Wales itself was left entirely to the State authority. Isolation is a matter over which the Commonwealth has no control ; we could insist only on Inter-State travellers from within a radius of 15 miles from Sydney being vaccinated. I have now to refer to the statement of the gentleman who complained about the results of his vaccination. This gentleman called upon the Director of Quarantine, and I have from that officer a statement, in which he says - </para>

                    <para>The statement made by myself to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.--- was</inline> not as stated, &#34; That no injurious results followed.&#34; What was said was that, though come cases were reported in which, after vaccination, undesirable manifestations had occurred, yet, as many thousands had been vaccinated with the same lymph without any unsatisfactory results, it was clear that some factor other than the lymph was involved </para>
                    <para>The effect of vaccination depends upon several factors. The condition of the patient at the time of vaccination. The method of performing the operation. The circumstances under which the operation is performed. The treatment of the arm after vaccination had been done; as well as the quality of the lymph. At times of panic vaccination, such as obtained in Sydney and Melbourne last year, persons- are vaccinated when in a condition of lowered vitality, who would at other times defer being vaccinated until a more suitable occasion, and many of the severe reactions were due to this cause. </para>
                    <para>The method of preparation of the lymph did not differ during last year from that employed before and since, and this same lymph has been used for years in connexion with the quarantining of ships, without any undesirable result. </para>

                <para class="block">The honorable member will remember the circumstances. The Commonwealth establishment in Victoria was for the purpose of meeting the necessities in regard to cases coming from overseas. But with a view to meeting the necessities that arose within the States, every effort was made to give a full and complete supply of lymph for the whole of Australia, and the establishment worked at high pressure, extra nurses and assistants being appointed, in order to expedite the production. The gentleman to whom the honorable member has referred also made a complaint to the State authorities in New South Wales before the Commonwealth was approached on the matter. It is all set out on the files, and, among other things, for instance, this gentleman said that, as a result of vaccination, he had a headache within two hours of the operation. As this gentleman admits, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Paton</inline> dismissed the fact of a violent headache two hours subsequent to vaccination as being in any way associated with vaccination. In his opinion, five days would have to elapse before the lymph would have any effect. The State authorities referred the whole of the complaints to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dick,</inline> the Medical Officer for Health, Hunter River combined districts, who reported on the 13th September last - </para>

                    <para>It appears to be impossible to accurately trace the lymph with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- was</inline> vaccinated. The date of vaccination, 17th July, renders it probable that the lymph was prepared and issued immediately prior to that date. If so, it was used on several thousand people without any ill effect. Mr. - made some statements indicating that the lymph had been re-bottled after leaving here; but, on being questioned, and shown samples of the bottles used, he was not quite sure. The only positive fact is that the lymph prepared at the same time was used widely without ill effects. </para>
                    <para>In my opinion, the probable explanation of the severe reaction from which Mr. - suffered is that his general constitutional resistance was, for some reason, lower than the normal, and the reaction correspondingly severe. </para>

                <para>Over 500,000 people were vaccinated, and probably about 1,000,000 in Australia as a whole. When the Department is working under high pressure it is quite possible that in isolated cases there may be some suffering, but, so far as we can ascertain, there has been nothing in any way due to the nature of the lymph supplied. The utmost care was taken in its preparation so far as the Central Department was concerned. I would like to make this statement as regards the effect of vaccination - </para>

                    <para>The value of recent vaccination in protecting against small-pox was again thoroughly demonstrated, as it will continue to be demonstrated whenever small-pox is encountered. Among 261 persons employed at the quarantine station and in daily contact with persons, none contracted the disease, and although it is estimated that more than 500,000 people were vaccinated in Sydney between July and September, 1913, not one of these contracted smallpox, and, finally, of those who did contract small-pox,89.5 per cent. had never been successfully vaccinated, 5.4 per cent. were successfully vaccinated within the incubation period, and 5.1 per cent. had been successfully vaccinated prior to infection. But in no individual instance had the successful vaccination been performed less than thirteen years previously. </para>

                    <para>.- Notwithstanding the statements made by the Minister, the fact remains that there is considerable doubt in Newcastle, as well as in Sydney, as to the efficacy of vaccination, and as to whether it does not produce worse effects than small-pox itself. Does not the Minister think it advisable to have the whole thing inquired into, in order to see whether vaccination should be continued, and whether the quality of the lymph is good - whether it is prepared properly, and so forth? Such an inquiry should he held if only to re-establish the confidence of the people with regard to vaccination generally. If vaccination is right, the people should be vaccinated; but, while doubt remains, they will not be vaccinated. Small-pox, though not so bad as it was, still reigns in Sydney. If there was one individual in Australia that one would say was not below normal when he was vaccinated, it was the individual to whom I referred. There was no man more robust and healthy looking. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Why not have an inquiry into vaccination, an independent inquiry, and not a departmental inquiry? Have an inquiry into the case of these sixty employes in one firm having to take to their beds. Surely they were not below the normal point in regard to health. I have lists of people who were disfigured. We know that in Sydney all sorts of ailments occurred. Some people died, some became blind, and others were disfigured in other directions, yet we cannot get an inquiry into whether it is better to suffer small-pox than to be vaccinated. Something should be done, if only to restore confidence in regard to vaccination, and people obeying the will of the Department in this regard. If the Minister will say that he will have a departmental inquiry into each case that I can hand to him, I shall, first of all, proceed on those lines. I can give the Minister a number of cases where worse results have been shown by vaccination than would have happened had the people suffered from small-pox. </para>

                    <para>.- I was pleased to learn last week that the Minister of External Affairs had prepared a memorandum setting forth the policy of the Government with regard to the Northern Territory. In enunciating the policy of the Liberal party at the last general election the right honorable member for Parramatta advocated the vigorous development of the Territory; but although his party have been in office for twelve months we have had from them very little in that direction. I suppose we should be pleased that we have at last obtained something, even if it is only a memorandum as to what the Government hope to do. The Government cannot complain that in their efforts to develop the Territory they have been obstructed by the Opposition. It is not necessary for them to pass a Bill dealing with any particular enterprise there. The Minister, by Ordinance, may do what he desires and whilst it is true that every Ordinance must be submitted to Parliament, and may be disallowed by either House, the fact remains that during their term of office the Government have not brought down one for our consideration. The right honorable member for Parramatta, who in the last Parliament vigorously denounced my action as Minister of External Affairs in dealing with the lands of the Northern Territory by Ordinance, instead of introducing a comprehensive Land Bill, has been in office for twelve months, but has not yet introduced such a measure. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite another question. The point that I wish to emphasize is that the Government have not even given us an opportunity to deal with such a measure. I promised that if we were returned to office last year a Northern Territory Land Bill would be one of the first measures to be introduced by us. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Government were denounced for their failure to introduce a Northern Territory Land Bill, although we had less time to devote to the preparation of such a measure than the present Government have had. We recognised that some criticism might fairly be applied to any delay in dealing with the lands of the Northern Territory by Ant of Parliament rather than by Ordinance, and we wish to know now why the present Administration have done nothing in that direction. I approve nf the statement contained in the Ministerial memorandum, that it is necessary to develop mining in the Territory, but at present mining operations there are being carried on under an obsolete Act passed by the South Australian Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable gentleman will admit that we ought to have had his memorandum before now. In that memorandum, I understand the Government have pledged themselves to a policy of railway construction in the Northern Territory involving an expenditure of about &#163;10,000,000. I agree with those who say that the Territory can be developed only by means of a vigorous railway construction policy; but I should like to know whether the Minister feels that he has yet obtained the most complete information as to the routes that should be followed. I regret that the Committee of experts which was appointed by me to investigate the question of railway routes in the Northern Territory should have been disbanded by the present Government before it had completed its inquiries. Its report, I understand, was laid on the table of the House this afternoon, but I have not yet had an opportunity to read it. Even the Attorney-General will not accuse me of having fol-  lowed the policy of spoils to the victors in appointing that Committee. I do not think that any member of it was a very strong Labour supporter. I have heard that one member &#34; jumped for joy &#34; when he learned of our defeat; but no one will say that the Committee was not well qualified to do the work required of it. If the Government are satisfied that they have all the information necessary to guide them in entering upon a railway construction policy involving an expenditure of &#163;10,000,000, well and good; but I venture to think that, before such aD expenditure is authorized, Parliament. will desire more information than has, so far, been forthcoming. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the proposal of the Government is that where an added value is given to lands held under lease by the passing of a railway through them an increased rental shall be charged. To that I have no objection, but I think the Government should go further. Land in any centre of population, the value* of which is enhanced by the construction of a railway, should be taxed, just as much as is a leasehold through which the line actually passes. We are told that the Government propose to build these railway lines by contract. I regret that decision. If the present Government purpose handing over the construction of any of these railways to the contractor, that is the strongest possible condemnation of themselves. I have said in this House, and I say again, that I do not believe that contract is anathema, nor do I make a fetish of day labour. </para>

                        <para>- If any large portions of the railway are handed over to the contractor, that must be a condemnation of the Government who do that. The respective advantages of day labour and contract are merely a question of management. If a Labour party were in office, and the Minister of External Affairs and his party were in Opposition, I could understand that the honorable member would object to doing anything by day labour, because he might be prepared to say that Labour Ministers are not good administrators, that we are not qualified to appoint foremen, that we would allow the men to use the government stroke, and that we would be too lenient with them. But surely the honorable members who are now in the Government would not say that of themselves ? They, as heaven born administrators, would be able to carry out the construction of a railway equally as well as a contractor. They have in their own hands the appointment of officials, because I understand that in the&#39; Northern Territory no officials have been brought under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. </para>

                        <para>- Therefore, there is no difficulty in dismissing any officials. The honorable gentleman can appoint whom he chooses and dismiss whom he chooses. I admit that under the Commonwealth Public Service Act there are difficulties in dealing with officers, particularly in dispensing with the services of an officer, even if he is not competent, but that does not apply to the Northern Territory or to any railways which the Government are called upon to build. Therefore, seeing that the present Government are in charge of the construction of those railways, it seems to me that they can only hand them over to the contractor for one of two reasons. The first would be that they are in favour of the contractor. The contractor is generally a Liberal, and he might be prepared to give something to the funds of the Liberal organization. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear the honorable member say so. I was pointing out that there could be only two reasons for handing work over to the contractor. In the first place, the Government would do it, because they were agreeable to do something for the contractor. The second reason would be that the Government were of opinion that the contractor could do the work more cheaply and expeditiously, and better for the community. If that could be demonstrated to be a fact, I think that both sides of the House should be prepared, in those circumstances, to hand the work over to the contractor. But if we were to do it for that reason, it seems to me that such an admission would be a reflection upon the Government, because it would suggest that they were not able to appoint competent foremen. In my experience of Departments, I have found that the officials, as a rule, are rather anxious to give work to the contractor. I believe that one reason is that there is less bother for the Department if the work is handed over to the contractor instead of being done departmentally, because the contractor has a lot of the worry which the Department, or the Minister, would otherwise get. I take it, however, that it is the business of neither the Minister nor the Department to shirk responsibility in that way. I am sorry that the Government have said in their memorandum that they are prepared to hand the freezing works over to private enterprise. </para>

                        <para>- Why does the Minister quibble over my question ? There are two alternative policies: One is for the Government to erect &#39;the works and control them after the buildings are completed, and the other is for private enterprise to erect the buildings and control the works afterwards. Apparently the latter course is what the Government propose to adopt. If that is so, are those capitalists undertaking this enterprise out of a spirit of philanthropy, or in furtherance of their own interests? I take it that they are willing to build and control these works because they believe they can make a profit out of the enterprise. Then, why should not the Government put up the freezing works, and run them, just as they run a post-office, or a navy, or an army? </para>

                        <para>- They are, in comparison with private enterprize. Take, for instance, the Post Office. Let the honorable member have some dealings with private companies, and he will find that he has more bother with them than with the Government Post Office. If that were not so, why does not the honorable member propose to hand over the post-offices to private enterprise? We read only recently that in America, the great home of private enterprise, the Postmaster-General has been advocating that the telephones and telegraphs, which are in the hands of private enterprise, should be purchased and controlled by the Government. Why does he advocate that policy if these services can be run better by private enterprise? In England, the telegraphs for many years were in the hands of private companies, whilst those in other parts of Europe were under Government control. Why was it that (lie business people waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> and asked that the Government should take over the control of the telegraphs, at a time when there was no Labour party to advocate State control of such services? </para>

                        <para>- Then we must assume that the capitalists are undertaking this enterprise in a spirit of philanthropy. The memorandum shows that the Government are prepared to erect a dairy factory. Why ? Because there is no profit in this dairy factory; there are only a few people in the district, and it would not pay for private enterprise to run the factory, or even for the people to run it co-operatively. I am glad that the Government are stepping in, and I will be willing to support them in establishing a dairy factory there. But what is the difference between establishing and running a dairy factory and establishing and running freezing works? One is to cost &#163;10,000, and the other &#163;80,000, I understand. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the action of the Government. They are prepared to put up a dairy factory at the expense of the Commonwealth, and run it as a Socialistic concern. I agree with their action, and I am supporting them. My regret is that they have not the courage to erect the freezing works. A &#163;10,000 concern seems to be about the capacity of the present Government. </para>

                        <para>- If the principle is good in one thing, I cannot see why it should not be good in another. I notice in the memorandum that the Government&#39;s policy is to grant freeholds. That, I take it, cannot be done until an Act of Parliament has been passed, because the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill provided for the leasehold principle. I am rather surprised that the Prime Minister, the Minister of External Affairs, and the Attorney-General should all be in a Government who are prepared to adopt &#39; a policy of freeholds, in view of their advocacy of a different system in times past. This freehold is to have restrictions placed upon it. No man is to be allowed to hold more than 2,500 acres. But surely if the freehold system is a good one, it should be unrestricted. I hope to have another opportunity of dealing with this matter more fully. It is a pity that the Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs have altered their views regarding the leasehold system. </para>

                    <para>The roll has been printed in an imperfect condition, and the roll which is now being printed will not give a true indication of the persons whose names were entitled to be enrolled at the date it was printed. There is a considerable amount of information in the hands of the Electoral Department upon which they are acting, but which will not be reflected in the roll now being printed. Consequently when this roll is issued, during the next couple of weeks, tens of thousands of people will be misled into the belief that their names are on the roll, but in the official rolls in the Department and in the official rolls used in the booths, those names will be struck off, and the people will not become aware of the fact until they actually go into the polling booth on polling day, when it will be too late for them to do anything. The rolls have been sent to the printer in the middle of preparation. There has been no occasion in the history of the Federal Parliament, except in this case, where a roll has been printed and issued from which there have not been omitted the names of all those against whom information has been obtained as to their lack of qualification, and in which the roll has not been brought right up to date. </para>

The statement of the Treasurer does not affect the point. Information may come to hand after the roll is printed, but in this case the rolls are being printed, and there are tens of thousands of names which the Department, at the time of printing, intend to strike off, but which are not struck off. People will be under the impression that as their names are on the roll they will be able to vote. The names appear on the roll, but the people will not be able to vote upon that roll; consequently the roll that is being printed now will mislead tens of .thousands throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Yet it was stated in the press only a few weeks ago that the Prime Minister and the Honorary Minister were engaged in a conference with the Premier of New South Wales quibbling over a few shillings for the cost of sending the police around to see that the rolls were in order. This quibble compelled the work to be hung up for months and months, although the Government knew that an election was coming on, and that the dissolution was right on top of us. The Government then gave way, and there was no time to get the work done. That is an example of what I say. If we could get the officers of the Department to open their mouths, it would be found that they have not a large enough staff to do the work. Take the comparison of the claim cards, for instance, in all the electoral offices of the Commonwealth. It will be found that the permanent staff handling the matter is absolutely inadequate to do the work. This accounts for duplications on the roll. When second cards come in, duplicating the claims for enrolment, it is found that there is not staff enough to compare them with the first, and now that an election is pending the officers have to put on a number of temporary clerks, who have no permanent interest in the Department. Consequently the work cannot be done in the same way as if there was a trained permanent responsible staff handling it. </para>

                    <para>In that way they are being misled into the belief that they are being put on the Commonwealth rolls, whereas they are only being placed on the State rolls. The Prime Minister to-day handed an official statement to the honorable member for kooyong to read out. This showed that in New South Wales on 31st May, 1913, there were 1,036,187 names on the electoral roll, whereas on 31st May, 1914, the number was 995,128. Although there has been an increase in the population during those twelve months, there are actually over 41,000 fewer names on the rolls in New South Wales than there were twelve months ago. Such a state of things is absolutely scandalous. </para>

                            <para>- What have we to do ? We have to go into our electorates and call upon hundreds of people, tramping the streets from door to door, to see that names are put on the roll - work which should be done by the Government - so as to nullify, if we possibly can, the kind of administration by which the Government expect to come back to power in this House. For the whole Commonwealth from 31st May, 1913, to 31st May, 1914, although the honorable member for Kooyong admitted that there has been an increase in the adult population of about 250,000, there are only 9,417 more names on the roll. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. That is exactly what he did. The police, acting under regulations issued by the Government, were sent round the electorates to find reasons for taking people off the rolls, but no matter how many people they have put off the rolls they will do nothing to facilitate their enrolment. I do not blame the police for this. They are only doing what they are directed to do. It is not theirs to reason what the intentions of the Government are. </para>

                        <para>He was informed, however, that names of persons who had left the district permanently for a long time past were still on, and many who should be on were not enrolled. In this connexion a curious thing had come under his own notice. He was shown on an official form a long list of names of persons in his own subdivision who were supposed to have removed elsewhere. A casual glance showed him that several of his friends and supporters were among them, not one of whom had removed from the place of residence for which he was enrolled. And, to his further astonishment, he discovered the names of himself and family were included. In his own case, being member for the district, even had he not been residing therein, he was entitled, under the Electoral Act, to be enrolled for the subdivision, instead of elsewhere. He thought it a pity that the State and Federal Electoral Acts were not more in unison in connexion with the matter of enrolment. People got greatly confused, believing that the police collection of the State roll insured their being entered on the Federal rolls. </para>

                        <para>The Federal Electoral Department has furnished a great achievement. It suddenly discovered that a big section of the adult population on the railway side of Bullanaming-street, Redfern, have been resident in the locality less than a month, whereas the fact of the matter is that some of the persons concerned have been living in the same houses for periods up to twenty-five years. . . . As a means of finding out to what extent notices of objection had been circulated by the Department, a representative of this paper made five casual calls at houses in Bullanaming-street yesterday afternoon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. White,</inline> of No. 34, said :  - &#34;Both myself and husband were served with notices. Our names are on the roll, and we have been living in this house for twenty-five years.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Dorey,</inline> of No. 52, said :  - &#34; Six members of the family are on the roll. We were also presented with notices. I have been living in this house for twenty-five years.&#34; Notices, it was stated, were also served at Nos. 36 and 44, although the occupants had been living there five and seven years respectively. The other persons spoken to had only been in the locality a few weeks. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are administering the Electoral Branch, and insisting on the observation of regulations which have this effect. The work in connexion with the printing of the rolls, on which it is proposed to make an appeal to the people almost immediately, is in a state of muddle and chaos that would be a reflection on a child. Of course, if all this is deliberately done, it in another matter; we can hardly believe that men of experience would issue regulations of the kind innocently. The idea is so preposterous as almost to compel one to come to another conclusion. </para>

                        <para>Many western towns arc agog with indignant electors, who have received notices that &#34; Unless you reply within twenty-one days of the post hereof,&#34; their names will be struck off the roll of electors (Commonwealth). The discontent is so common that it looks as though on organized attempt of depriving people of their votes was being made. One could understand it if the notices were being posted to people who shift their place of residence; but to be a bird of passage does not seem the requisite for attentions of the kind reported, Well-known Labour supporters, who are not noted for their carefulness in attending to correspondence, are being picked out as target: for the fun (or malice?) of objectors. As under the Cook Government the fine for frivolous objecting is not enforced, the onus lie! with that discredited band of patriots to prove they have no connexion with this annoying campaign. Straws show which way the wind bloweth, and this &#34; objection &#34; dodge reveals the desperate position of the Joe Cook banc of political boodlers. </para>

                        <para>. - We have reached a stage in connexion with Supply which ought, I think, to make any one somewhat diffident in dealing with any question other than that which is immediately before the representatives of the people. Personally, I am somewhat surprised at the situation in this Parliament. The Government desire Supply for three months, during which time they may consult the electors and get their affirmation of the stand taken by Ministers, or otherwise. If my vote might be cast in any direction, it would be in a direction to thwart the Government in their endeavour, because I still think that their course of action is not one which is conducive to the interests of the majority of the people of Australia. I am well aware that the Government represent a section of the community who are desirous, by hook or by crook, to defeat the efforts of those who I may say, pardonably I think, prefer more democratic methods of transacting the affairs of the country. While I have to admit that, perhaps, they are justified according to their lights in taking the stand they have taken, I am one of those who believe that we have not exhausted the means by which we might have been able to conduct the business of the Commonwealth in the interests of the greater proportion of the people. Therefore, I am one of those who would endeavour to prevent the Government from consummating their desire to appeal to the people until they had divulged to the House, or the country, that information which is desirable and necessary in the interests of good administration. I, as an individual, rightly or wrongly, cannot believe that the political situation is one in which a double dissolution is desirable or constitutional. I may not have the ability to present the constitutional aspect of the question in such a manner as to prove my contention. I recognise that we have arrived at a stage where a legal mind is necessary to prove that the situation is such as ought not to exist, and, if I might be permitted to refer to another place, of which we are not supposed to have any cognisance, I would say that there is an institution associated with this House which I individually thought had a certain standing under the Constitution. Seeing that the other place is elected on the same franchise as we are, to a degree, at any rate, I have always felt that it had powers almost parallel with our own. That such is not the case has come as a revelation to me. Although I nave always maintained that the powers which I thought the other place possessed were undemocratic, still I have recognised that it was there under the Constitution. As an individual who never expects to get his own way, or as an individual who belongs to a party who, while they desire to assert themselves strongly with the view of getting their wishes carried out, still recognise that there are constitutional methods which have to be resorted to to attain their end, and that .if the Constitution is read in a certain direction they cannot succeed, I have to admit that the Constitution has been interpreted by the Governor-General and the Ministry in such a direction as to make this House paramount to the other place. I am rather fearful that it may not be accepted as a precedent, and that, in the future, an opposite decision may be given by the Governor-General of the day. When I present a case to the House through you, sir, or when I present a case to a judge, or, may I say, with all due respect, to the Governor-General, and I am told on the first occasion, &#34; You see you have to conform to the letter of the law, or of the Constitution,&#34; and, recognising as a well-intending citizen that the Constitution is an instrument from which we ought not to depart, I accept that decision, that the letter of the law, or of the </para>

                    <para class="block">Constitution, must be followed, come what may; and, when on another occasion I find that the letter of the law, or of the Constitution, is in my favour, and I present to the powers that be a case for a ruling that would suit me, and they say bo me, &#34; Do you not see that the spirit of the law, or of the Constitution, has to be obeyed, and carried into effect,&#34; it appears to me it would be an unfair method of dealing with any man or any set of men. If it were possible to combine the letter and the spirit of the Constitution, I should accept the present position, but when they are separated, and the effect of separating them is to thwart my desire, I am brought into conflict with those in authority, who are responsible for the separation, and I am prepared to fight against that kind of thing as effectively as I can. I trust that I am not infringing the rules of this House in saying what 1 have to say on this subject. We are informed that in deciding to grant a double dissolution because another place would not agree with the decision of this House, the Governor-General abided by the Constitution. Yet, when a further request is made to him to do what is desired by another place, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, he says, &#34; In this case, neither the letter nor the spirit of the Constitution has anything to do with the matter. My advisers say that I should not follow either the spirit or the letter of the Constitution in this case, and that is enough for me.&#34; If that is to be the &#34;be-all&#34; and &#34;end-all&#34; of requests from this Parliament, it seems to me, as a layman, that the situation is a most remarkable one. I frankly confess that I do not understand it, and I believe the great body of the people will understand it as little as I do. As a law-abiding community, no doubt, our people will try to make the best of the situation, rather than resort to unconstitutional methods to deal with it. I have, in common with the rest of the people, to accept the decision of the powers that be, with all the weight of authority behind them, but I enter my protest against it. I have no legal knowledge or training, and claim only the ordinary common sense of a layman. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that it is possible to get a great deal of law and very little justice, and that the application of common sense to legal questions would give us more justice than does the application of law to those questions. A few years ago I listened with great interest to a lawyer presenting, a case to Court and jury in one of the Melbourne Courts. He tried to assure the jury that it did not matter what the law upon a certain point was, the justice of it was so-and-so. He was immediately pulled up by the learned Judge occupying the Bench, who castigated him for attempting to suggest that in that Court anything but the legal aspect of a question should be considered by either Court or jury I felt that the lawyer in that case, though he may have been a bad lawyer, was endeavouring to secure justice for those he represented. He was beaten, and on these particular questions I am beaten, and I must abide by the decision. So far as the crisis is concerned, I intend to let the matter drop with these remarks. I am positive that in presenting their case for a double dissolution to the Governor-General, the Government of the day presented something which was not in accordance with the fact, so far as the situation in this House is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it is so. I am fortified in that view by the fact that the Government will not, by hook or by crook, allow the members of this House and the people of Australia to know what they really told the Governor-General in applying to him for a double dissolution. When a man is &#34; oyster &#34; upon any question in which he, you, and the country are interested, it is natural that you should become suspicious, and conclude, either that he is very foolish, or that he desires to keep back the real state of the case. I know the constitution of the other side. They are a party of men strong in their own opinions. The members of the Government have great political knowledge. I am satisfied that there is no kind of political engineering with which they are not conversant. I never belittle my opponents. I recognise when they beat me or my party that there must be strong men amongst them. I know that there are strong men in the Government, and I say that, if they presented a case to the Governor-General to support their request for a double dissolution which would bear the light of day, they would not refuse to give this </para>

                    <para class="block">House and the country the reasons they put forward. Honorable members in another place, in a constitutional way, by a prayer, and not a demand, asked the Governor-General, in language to which no one could object, to let them have the full text of the memorandum presented to him by Ministers in support of their request for a double dissolution, and a full statement of what Ministers said in their conversations with him on the subject. In a courteous manner,  His Excellency  has replied, &#34; My advisers tell me that it is not advisable to give the reasons.&#34; In the circumstances, I and others believe that something was told the Governor-General which the people should know. A man may get upon the house-top and shout his opinions, and may be laughed at. He may secure the appreciation of others who, in the opinion of those who disagree with him, are as foolish as himself, but we know that where there is nothing to conceal everything should be made public. It is in the interests of the people of Australia that all that transpired in connexion with this matter should be made public. Honorable senators in another place asked for the reasons which were submitted by the Government in support of their request for a double dissolution, and they asked also that the proposed Bills for the amendment of the Constitution should be submitted by referendum to the people, in view of the fact that the constitutional provisions governing such a matter had been complied with. If, from a constitutional stand-point, it was correct to give a double dissolution, it should have been just as correct to present the referenda to the people at the coming election, because, in that respect, the provisions of the Constitution have been fulfilled just as equally as in the other case. I cannot deal more fully with that aspect of the question in the short time at my disposal. I wish to deal with other matters, and, firstly, with the question of defence, which I approach from no party stand-point. The question of defence has been, and should be, removed from party politics. It was removed from party politics when the Labour Government submitted their Bill, which is now th&#187; Defence Act of the Commonwealth. At that time there were many among the Labour supporters, and many who sat in Opposition, who did not agree with much contained in the Bill, and on several occasions when dealing with cardinal questions, the Government of the day might have been exercised to maintain their position. This declining Government that is now in power might have done much iu regard to Defence that would have been beneficial to Australia. We are spending too much money on our defence, particularly on our military forces. 1 would not care so much if it gave a fair return to the people, but I have evidence to show that money that might be spent with greater benefit is being wasted. If we had followed line by line and step by step the methods adopted in Great Britain, there would not have been such a great expenditure, although our defence might have been strengthened instead of weakened, and I admit that our huge expenditure is caused by our having adopted so much that is of an experimental character. I do not blame the political head, whether he is a member of this or any other Government, but I maintain that money is wasted by our practical, or theoretical, officials. We are spending hundreds of thousands on war material that could very well be manufactured in Australia. The Inspector of Ordnance has on more than one occasion signed a minute to the effect that certain articles could be manufactured in Australia, many of them quite as cheaply as they could be imported, and most of them at a cost very little in excess of the imported article. Let us get away altogether from the question of Protection or Free Trade, or the question of foreign interests as against local interests. If we wish to be a self-contained people, as far as defence is concerned, we shall not attain that end until the whole of our ordnance and armaments are turned out by Australian workmen in industrial establishments in Australia. It is essential that a country, to be self-contained, should manufacture everything that is required in the matter of war material, because a home supply is always better than having to purchase from overseas. I have no idea of embarrassing the present head of the Defence Department, but I must deal with this matter now that we are going to the country, and the Lord knows what may take place. Just as the Labour Government were leaving office, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers presented a case to them, as it was also presented to the present Government last year, and again* this year, and though they showed conclusively that certain war materiel could be manufactured in Australia, there has been no reply from Ministers. In fairness to the present Government, I cannot blame the Minister of Defence, because I know that exactly the same position obtained during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Labour Government, but I do blame the officials in the Defence Department, because they have not shown any desire to make Australia self-contained in regard to the manufacture of these articles. They did attempt to manufacture certain gun mountings at Cockatoo Island, under the management of the late manager of the dock, but the present manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter, has already said that he was brought to Australia to build ships and not armaments, that the whole of his life had been spent in the Motherland on the construction of ships, and that Cockatoo Island was not suitable for the construction of armaments, as shown by the fact that what had already been turned out was not up to sample, and had been thrown on the scrap heap. If it is not possible to manufacture these large accessories to ordnance at Cockatoo Island, there is no reason why we should not establish an arsenal in Australia at some other place. It would cost very little, comparing it with the cost of some of the huge establishments in the Old World, and should be able to produce a fair quantity of the accessories that are required. Though the gun mountings made at Cockatoo Island were a failure, I am sure there are many manufacturing establishments in the Commonwealth that could manufacture them, but even if that be not so, any Government desirous that Australia should be self-contained in this respect, and that the Australian Navy should be built and equipped by the Australian people, should bring about some establishment for this purpose. However, nothing has been attempted, though it is so desirable a thing to be done. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> spoke on this matter two years ago while another Government was in power, and I shall continue to speak upon it in the future whatever Government is in power. Such an establishment would give work to hundreds of men. If the men are not here now, we could increase our population by bringing them out from Great Britain, and having the work done here instead of having it turned out in the Old Country and brought out by ships. This matter that I mention is one that will have to be seriously considered by whatever Government is in power, and I hope that the present Ministry will, at a very early date, give earnest consideration to the request that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers have put forward. </para>

The big guns in use in days gone by were little more than iron, drain-pipes, and there was not much, mechanism associated with them. And so with the old &#34; Brown Bess.&#34; The rifle in use to-day, however, is. an intricate piece of mechanism, and its manufacture involves the skilled work of the trained artisan. Such rifles are now being produced at Lithgow. The big guns of to-day are far more extraordinary pieces of mechanism, the machinery used to elevate or to depress them working with clock-like precision, and a great deal of that mechanism could, and should, be manufactured in Australia. We import motor cars and sewing machines, but many of the parts are manufactured locally, and even if we cannot at present make these big guns, we ought to be able to produce in Australia many of the parts associated with them. I am satisfied that we have here men who are capable of producing them. There are to be found in the Defence Department memoranda proving that these parts&#39; can be manufactured here in many cases for less than it costs to import them, and </para>

                            <para>- I may be told that the ex-Minister of Defence, whose Government I supported, passed the regulations of which I complain. But I care not by whom the regulations in. question were framed. It is somewhat singular that no matter what &#39;Government- is in power the Minister of the day is induced to bring in regulations which are. not in the interests of the people, but are. really the creation of officials. That is the position in this case. Regulations have been framed which make it almost impossible for an Australian to obtain a position on the Instructional Staffs unless he has been to the Old Country, and has served in the Imperial Army or Navy. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to belittle the stock from which I spring, but in every walk of life the Australian has shown capabilities just as great as those men from the Old Country. We have young men in Australia to-day who have been trained by the best instructors imported from abroad. They are men who are strong physically and mentally, but who, although they have obtained all the instruction that is necessary, are prevented from getting positions as instructors in the Forces by a silly Act, and more silly regulations. The Government could very well have attended to this matter instead of creating the ridiculous position that exists to-day in regard to the double dissolution. I hope this matter will be given consideration to by the present Government, if they have the good luck to come back to the Ministerial bench - bad. luck to them, if they do - so that the young Australians may have a chance of obtaining these positions. There is another matter I should like to deal with. We have endeavoured, to bring our Naval and Military establishments up to date, and there is in my electorate, associated with the Navy, a Department, the sole interest of which is the maintenance and upkeep of wireless telegraphy. In the Old Country, and I believe also in Germany and France, the wireless telegraphy in connexion with the Navy is associated with the Torpedo Department, where the artificers are employed. The Australian Naval Board, perhaps with a commendable, idea of bringing the system more up-to-date,, have established a separate Department for wireless telegraphy. For some years the construction of a wireless station at the naval yard at. Williamstown has been in progress. The plant has cost an enormous amount of &#39;money; I do not know whether we can get the actual amount, but I know that a part of the plant has been taken down and reconstructed, and that certain material which was manufactured for it had to be &#39;sent back to the manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- I know that. If this wireless system were as good as the wireless system connected with the Postal Department I would be satisfied. It is because it is not so good that I take exception to it. This plant has been constructed evidently by men who know nothing about wireless telegraphy, and to-day is manned by officers who, by no stretch of imagination, can be said to have had any experience or knowledge of either construction or of the transmission and receipt of messages. </para>

So far as I can ascertain, there are four officials associated with this wireless establishment. The officer in command receives about &#163;450 per annum - I do not know where he got his wireless knowledge, but he is there - there is another officer who receives &#163;280 ; a third who is paid &#163;150 ; and a fourth receiving about &#163;145. So far as I can make out, the only man who knows anything about wireless telegraphy is the man receiving &#163;150 per year. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Henty has struck the nail on  the head. The officers who control this establishment may be the best intentioned men on earth, and they may be very desirable as officers, but they know nothing about wireless telegraphy. I may be answered that those men were appointed during the reign of the Labour Government, but that does not matter a hit. I am told that the only man who knows anything about wireless telegraphy is the man receiving &#163;150, and his Department will not give him an opportunity of getting a better position, nor is he allowed to leave the Department. I believe the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department would like to get hold of that man, but they cannot get him, because the men who receive the good salaries, knowing nothing about their work, will not part with the services of the man on the lower salary, who does know something about it. The Defence Department is full of those anomalies, and the Minister in charge ought to see that they are not perpetuated. I charge the officers of that wireless telegraphy Department with knowing nothing about their work, and with loafing on the brains of the man who does know something about it. </para>

                            <para>- I have never met him, but he spent fourteen years in the British Navy; he was brought out here, and he now desires to get into the Postal Department, but is not allowed to leave the service he is now in. In half-a-dozen cases in the Defence Department, men who possess special knowledge receive very small salaries, while men who know little receive large salaries. It is for the Government to prevent this, or to take the blame for perpetuating it. Ministers, by the memorandum which they presented to the Governor-General, which induced him to grant a double dissolution, have fashioned an engine which should recoil upon the Conservative party with the force of a blow from a steam-hammer, and should prevent for ever the rule of Conservatism in Australia. Although the Governor-General gave- his decision on this occasion on the advice of his Ministers, we have no assurance that his action will be taken as a precedent and followed by succeeding Governors-General. If it was to form a precedent, we should have nothing to cry out about ; it is the fact that on this occasion, when it suits Conservatism, such advice has been followed, that we lament. I am sure that the members of this Government and the Governor-General will be sorry in the future for the position which they have created. </para>

                        <para>.- This afternoon I expressed surprise that the Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs have agreed to recognise the principle of freehold in connexion with the land in the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister stated in New South Wales that alienation of the land has been the greatest curse of civilization, and that a generation yet unborn would arise to curse us if we continued to alienate the land. He said that he personally would not agree to the alienation of land, either within or without a municipality. The Minister of External Affairs has written a large number of pamphlets against alienation in freehold and in favour of leasing, and, when a member of the Federal Convention, tried to embody in the Constitution a provision preventing the selling of Federal territory. The objection made to his proposal at the time was that the Constitution could not be amended without the consent of the Commonwealth Parliament and of the people, following upon a referendum, and that the land laws of the Commonwealth Treasury should be framed by the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- At the time the idea that the Northern Territory would be taken over by the Commonwealth had not occurred to any one; the Convention was dealing only with the Federal Capital Territory, the land of which the Minister of External Affairs wished to prevent the alienation of by constitutional enactment. It is a fair thing to ask why these Ministers have abandoned the leasehold principle. One would almost think that they had been outvoted by a majority in the Caucus of the Liberal party. That may not be so, although of late there have been several Caucuses of the Liberal party in this building. Certainly it is a matter for surprise that these Ministers are now advocating alienation in freehold. It was said of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Peel that he betrayed a party to save a nation ; the Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs seem to me to have betrayed a nation to serve the exigencies of a party.

                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline>
                        made it on the authority of the statement made by the honorable member for Barrier in the House, that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline>
                        had been sent there until he was sixty-five years of age.&#34; The statement made by the Prime Minister, and repeated by Liberals at some of their meetings, was that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline>
                        had been sent there, and could not be dismissed because he had been appointed for seven years. As a matter of fact, he was sent there in the same way as all other officers on the permanent list under what might be termed the &#34; Northern Territory of South Australia Ordinance for the regulation of the Public Service.&#34; There are two classes of officials in the Territory - permanent and casual. The permanents were sent there under that Ordinance, which, although it was passed at an Executive meeting on the 15th May, 1913, when we were in office, has, I understand, not yet been proclaimed, because the officers in the Territory have not yet been classified. There are probably not more than 300 officers there on the permanent list, and apparently work is going on in the Territory fairly leisurely. In the Ordinance that we passed we provided, &#34; The permanent head shall furnish the Administrator, in the month of April in each year, with a return of officers in his Department who have attained the age of sixty years or over, together with a report in each case as to whether the officer is able and willing to continue to perform his duties.&#34; Again, &#34; Every officer having attained the age of sixty years shall be entitled to retire from the Public Service if he desire&#39;s to do so, but, subject to this section, he may continue in the Public Service until he attains the age of sixty-five years. If an officer continues in the Public Service after he has attained the age of sixty years, he may, at any time before he attains the age of sixty-five years, be called upon by the Administrator to retire from the Public Service, and every officer so called upon to retire shall retire accordingly.&#34; We also provided that &#34; If an officer appears to the Administrator, after full investigation of all the circumstances, to be unfit to discharge, or incapable of discharging the duties of his office efficiently, the Administrator may deal with such officer by retiring him from the Public Service or transferring him to some other position of equal or lower status and salary, provided that where an officer is so retired the Minister may, upon sufficient reason being shown, reinstate the&#34; officer in the Public Service upon such terms and conditions as he thinks fit.&#34; Any officer we sent up could be called upon to retire if the Administrator thought him unfit or incapable at any time, the only person who could put him back being the Minister. In that enactment, there is a provision which is far more elastic, so far as concerns the removing of permanent officers, than there is in the Commonwealth Public Service Act, because any one who has had any dealings with the latter Act knows how difficult it is to remove an officer, even if the permanent head deems him incapable. He has to be sent to a board, and that board - not the permanent head, or the Minister - decides. The Prime Minister has accused us of not telling the truth on all occasions, but he should be about the last person in this country to find fault with anybody who does not tell the truth. On the 28th April last, according to the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline>
                        the honorable member said at St. Kilda, &#34; There were four highly paid officers in the Northern Territory, and the Government found it could do without them. They were all &#39;brothers &#39; (laughter).&#34; If that means anything, it means that we appointed those officers because they were in the same political camp as we were. One of them was
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland,</inline>
                        who, I admit, was a member of the Labour party before he went to the Territory. The fact that a man belongs to a political party ought not necessarily to be a bar. I do not think the present Government have appointed anybody to a position unless he happened to be a member of their political side. The Minister of Trade and Customs shakes his head, but
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline>
                        who was appointed to the InterState Commission, was a &#34; brother,&#34; not of the Labour, but of the Liberal party. I do not say he was incompetent, or ought not to have been appointed &#39;because he belonged to the Liberal party, but the fact remains that he was a &#34;brother.&#34;
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline>
                        certainly was never a Labour man. I do not suppose he ever voted for a Labour candidate in his life. He was associated with the Free Trade Liberal party in New South Wales for years - one of their capable men.

                                has made it an honorary one, which, if I may be permitted to say so, was, I think, a little foolish on his part. I am pleased that the appointment was offered to him, and I am more than pleased that he has accepted it. But all these -gentlemen are friends of the Liberal party. We know of no appointment which has been offered to a Labour sympathizer. The birthday honours, too, are all on one side.

                            <para>- It was not.  Whether or not it was necessary to appoint him is another matter. But the only inference to be drawn from the Prime Minister&#39;s statement at St. Kilda is that he was appointed because he was a member of our party. When the right honorable .gentleman said that we were all brothers there was loud laughter. In filling the position to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rossiter</inline> was appointed, we first called for applications. Between thirty and forty of these were received. I referred the applications to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tate, Mr. Board,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams,</inline> the Directors of Education, who reduced the list to ten, and I then asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tate</inline> to deal with those ten. He, in turn, reduced them totwo, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rossiter</inline> being placed second. I offered the appointment to the person whom he placed first. This gentleman accepted the position, but, on account of ill-health, he was unable to fill it, and subsequently it was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rossiter.</inline> It cannot, therefore, be urged that I appointed that gentleman because of his political opinions. After he had been appointed, I noticed that the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> published one-half or three-quarters of a column regarding this gentleman, in which it regretted his departure from South Australia, because he was a most able and promising officer. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rossiter&#39;s</inline> political opinions are. The third gentleman appointed to the Territory was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke,</inline> who was in the Department of Home Affairs. I did not know what were his political opinions. We called for applications for a certain position, and undoubtedly he was the best of those who applied for it. As a matter of fact, there were only three or four applicants. The fourth appointment to the Territory was that of an officer who had been in the Department for a great many years. He was appointed to look after the aborigines, and he was sixty-five years of age at the time of his appointment. We appointed him for twelve months at the strong request of the Administrator and Professor Spencer, who had been sent to the Territory specially to deal with the difficult question of the aborigines. Pro- fessor Spencer drew up his report, and we practically accepted his recommendation. He and the Administrator asked that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stretton,</inline> who had been  a  Customs officer in the Territory for a good many years, and who had reached the retiring age, should be appointed to the position of Director of Aborigines, on account of his intimate knowledge of the aborigines, and because he possessed the confidence of the white people there. Under these circumstances, I consented to his appointment for twelve months. Again, I had not the slightest idea of the nature of his political convictions. As he had been a resident of the Territory so long, I suppose that, as a matter of fact, he had not exercised the franchise for quite a number of years. I do not know what the present Government intend to do in reference to the aborigines. It is a very difficult problem which they have to face. I do not know whether they have appointed anybody to take the place of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stretton,</inline> seeing that the term for which he was appointed has now expired. As a Parliament, we owe a great deal to the aborigines of the Territory, and we ought to be as careful of their interests as we are of the interests of people in any other part of Australia. I have taken this opportunity of replying to the statement of the Prime Minister that these officers were appointed merely because they happened to he brothers. I venture to say that the right honorable gentleman who made that statement should be the very last person in this country to complain of anybody not speaking the truth. </para>

                        <para>. -  I feel myself a little handicapped in addressing myself to you, sir, in Committee. But a situation has arisen which calls for my consideration, and I trust the consideration of this Chamber. We have heard a good deal to-day in connexion with electoral reform. We have heard honorable members opposite declare in most emphatic terms that in the electoral situation that has arisen there is nothing lacking. Everything is supposed to be perfect. According to the present Administration, there is no question that demands any consideration. They say that they are perfectly satisfied that the coming election can be conducted on pure and effective lines. I query that statement very much. In my. own electorate I am doing what I can to obtain a purification of the rolls. For some two or three months past I have had my people out, with a view to ascertaining what may eventuate in that connexion, and I have found that in one branch of my electorate - I say &#34; branch &#34; because my division embraces many State electorates - that of Balmain, in an investigation covering 3,000 names, no fewer than 900 names of Labour voters are absolutely off the roll. Now, the question arises, &#34; How can their names be placed upon the roll?&#34; The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have told us that they are doing all they can to secure a clean roll. A fortnight ago I asked the Electoral Officer of New South Wales if he would favour me with 1,500 forms in order to enable me to place my people on the roll, and he told me he could not give me one. He promised, however, that in the course of the day he would send the number I had mentioned, but I have since received a wire from the secretary of the Political Labour League saying that the forms are not forthcoming. Are the Administration fooling, or are they tampering with this matter and seeking in their own way to turn the game against us ? In the most respectful terms I ask, what is the meaning of this? Does it mean inefficiency on the part of the Administration when we are face to face with a great issue. No matter where I turn, I am faced with the fact that the rolls are not as they should be, and that there is impurity somewhere. I do not desire to charge the Government with impurity, but I do charge them with inefficiency. They have &#34; left undone those things which they ought to have done,&#34; and have &#34; done those things which they ought not to have done.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- They are, and they are not prepared to meet us in a fair way, but ready to utilize all the forces that lie in the hands of any Administration to defeat their opponents by devious and objectionable methods. We require some answer from the Prime Minister as to what he is prepared to do in connexion with the cleansing and purification of the rolls; and until we have some assurance that the Government are prepared to meet us fairly and squarely, I trust that honorable members on this side, and my fellows in another place, will &#34; tie &#34; them up. The Government are very much afraid of the situation. They taunt us with having a fear, and with not being prepared to enter into a political battle; but in that they make the great mistake of their lives. We are prepared to meet the other side at any time, in any battle, for we feel that the future lies with us, and not with them. We represent a movement which is going to sweep the Government and their supporters into political oblivion. I have been told that a recent utterance of mine has stirred the dove-cot of the Prime Minister and those who think with him, and that all the working men are now behind me in the view I take of the maladministration of the Naval Dockyard in Sydney. The working men have had enough of the present Government, and will surely cast out the Prime Minister and his supporters.I have in my hand a letter which tells me that this is the best thing that could happen for the administration of the dockyard. However, I shall not now say more on that subject, because I may have an opportunity later on. The Government are meeting the country to-day with the declaration that public affairs were maladministered by the Labour Government; and we are prepared to fight on that issue. There is no doubt that the vote in New South Wales will show how far short the Government have fallen in their efforts during the past twelve months. As a matter of fact, the Government have during their term of office made no attempt to do anything, and I shall meet my constituents with the assurance that the Liberals, and those ultra-Conservatives, will never get back to power. As the situation develops, it will be seen that the record of the Government does not stand to their credit, and there is no doubt that the Labour party will be returned to the Treasury bench, from which they will administer the business of the country to the well-being of the people as a whole. At the present time, the Government stand condemned, not only by the House, but by the country. They go with bad grace to the death - who does not? They are afraid of the situation ; we are not. They are going to their death ; we are going to our victory. </para>

He would rather sit where he is, and I am sure that I will miss his smiling presence. I am very glad to see him here sometimes; but still I think he is one of those who are going to death ; I regret it very much, but still, if he has to go, he must.

                        which I have described before as a journal that is very much appreciated by the society classes in Victoria - and suggest a prayer of this kind, seems to me a little extraordinary.

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Is it not very hard on the Liberal party that, just at the present time, when the honorable members for Swan, Flinders, and Parramatta, and others occupy the Treasury bench, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Wilson Dobbs should say it is necessary to pray for- </para>

                    <para>And is it not a great refection on the Prime Minister- that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Wilson Dobbs should say we ought to pray for - Men who have honour - men who will not lie. </para>
                    <para>That is a very undeserved reflection on the Prime Minister, but, fortunately, his reputation as &#34;&#34; Truthful Joe &#34; will not suffer by such a &#34;sly dig&#34; as that. The last portion of the prayer contains an abominable heresy. It says - ....... Lo! Freedom weeps, </para>

                    <para class="block">When the Prime Minister and his party went to the country, their principal planks were &#34; Freedom, Justice, and Liberty,&#34; and if, after twelve months of their rule Wrong rules the land, and Justice in a state of profound repose, and Freedom is having a weep, surely it is time that the Australian National Labour party were put back on the Treasury bench. </para>
                    <para>Leaving this prayer to be said or sung by the people who think that it ought to be said or sung, let me say that I am very greatly disappointed at the turn of events in another place, where a message has been received that  His Excellency  the Governor-General, acting on the advice of his Ministers, has declined to submit the six Constitution Alteration Bills to the people. These Bills proposing amendments of the Constitution should, in the opinion of a majority in another place, be again submitted to the people. Any one who reads the evidence which is being taken at the present time in Victoria about the operations of the Meat Trust must see how necessary it is that the people of this Commonwealth, through their Parliament, should have some control over trusts and combines. We are absolutely powerless at the present time to deal with them effectively. The Americans are now getting a footing in Australia. This may be satisfactory to a number of small cattle-growers and sheep farmers. The cattle men in , Queensland are to-day getting about double the price for their cattle that they received five years ago. They are now receiving from &#163;9 to &#163;10 per head, and that is an excellent thing for them. But if the same thing happens in Australia as has happened in other parts of the world, the time will come when the American Meat Trust, and capitalists in Great Britain and elsewhere, will join together and be in a position to offer the cattle-growers of Australia just what they care to give them. </para>
                    <para>It is often contended that, since in Australia the State has possession of the railways, the Meat Trust will not have the same power here as they have in America, where the railways are in the hands of private companies. But we have to remember that, at the present time, a few individuals control all the refrigerating space available for sending our meat, fruit, butter, and such products to the markets of the world. All that it will be necessary for the American capitalists to do will be, later on, to secure control of the oversea shipping, and it will then be impossible for any one to compete with them. If we were permitted to send the Bills proposing amendments of the Constitution to the people, I have no doubt that they would give the Commonwealth Parliament power to enter into competition in the business of the trusts, to control them, and to build ships and provide the necessary space for our exports. </para>
                    <para>I should not like to say that we have not the power at present to build ships. I am inclined to think that the Commonwealth has a good deal more power to spend its money in its own way than some anti-Federalists generally give it credit for. But we should have these Bills placed again before the people. </para>
                    <para>I do not know that the Labour party should feel extremely angry with  His Excellency   the Governor-General for accepting the advice of his Ministers in this matter, because the whole tendency of civilization is to control the power of the individual. The whole science of government is in the process of evolution just as humanity itself is evolving. There was a time when we had the absolute monarch, the king with supreme power. In those days, of course, the king used to lead his armies to battle and engage himself in personal combat with the enemy. Sometimes the people got a good king, as in the case, we will say, of Alfred the Great. Sometimes they got a bad king, as in the case of that monarch - I will not say of honoured memory - because, as a matter of fact, Henry VIII. had rather a bad reputation. </para>

                            <para>- I have a great respect for the marriage-tie myself, and when I read that Henry VIII. had eight wives, I do not think he was up to much. I do not think, as a matter of fact, that he was any good. It was possible for the people to get a good king or a very bad one, and we know that absolute power has a tendency to make a man a tyrant. As First Consul in France, Napoleon was an excellent man, but when he became Emperor he commenced to be tyrannous, and sought his own aggrandisement and the aggrandisement of his family. The tendency of modern times is to curtail the power of the individual. We have in the Old Country a limited monarchy. Our limited monarch, the King, is supposed to act according to the advice of his Ministers. I presume that His  Excellency  the Governor-General has taken up that stand at the present time. Personally, I believe that  His Excellency  might have used his discretion in putting, into force section 128 of the Constitution, having reference to constitutional amendments, without regard to the views of his Ministers. The Senate passed thrills for the amendment of the Constitution twice, and this House failed to pass- them, and the Governor-General had it in. his power in the circumstances to refer those Bills to the people. I believe that if he had exercised that power the people would not have complained. He has chosen to accept the advice of his Ministers, and we can only hope, therefore, that his Ministers will meet with proper punishment when they go before the electors: on the 5th September next. We cannot, as a Democracy, blame the Governor-General, because, as I say, the tendency of the times is to take absolute power out of the hands of the individual. We do not want dictators in Australia. We desire that the men who rule over us shall be subject to the will of the electors, and be compelled, as are members of this Parliament, to go before the people every three or six years. In the circumstances,. I prefer to ask the people of Australia to deal with the Right Honorable the Prime Minister and his colleagues for their action in advising the Governor-General not. to send the Bills for amendments of the Constitution before the people. I think it was perfectly monstrous advice for Ministers to give the Governor-General. In view of the fact that our party has 66- members in this Parliament out of a total of 111, and that the 66 wish these Billssent before the people, the minority of 45 have displayed an absolute lack of the spirit of fair play in advising the Governor-General not to remit those proposals to the people. </para>

                        <para>I wish to know what the Governmentpropose to do with regard to the Tariff. They have told us that they are prepared to maintain the Protectionist policy decided at the 1906 elections. What is that policy? They call it a Protectionist:  policy, but when the Tariff was brought up for consideration the Prime Minister never failed to vote against protective duties. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir GeorgeReid</inline> was beaten badly at the polls, when he raised the &#34; Socialist tiger &#34; cry, a majority of Protectionists was returned, and a Tariff Bill was introduced; but the Prime Minister, and many other Free Traders, voted consistently against any proposal to introduce a protective duty. I take the view that honorable members of the Liberal party are divided in their opinions. </para>

The honorable member for Dampier has wired to the farmers in Western Australia that he proposes to support a revenue Tariff. That is not a protective Tariff.

It is said that the honorable member for Dampier has been unable to get the selection of the Country party. The farmers know too much to vote for a Free Trade or revenue Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- If so, they are poorly educated. If farmers favour Free Trade hey do not understand what is in their Interests. Of what use is it for the farmers to produce agricultural products to be sent abroad, and be subject to the competition of other parts of the world ? Our farmers sell about 80 per cent. of their products in Australia, and to have 300,000 or 400,000 more artisans in the manufacturing centres would provide a far better market for the farmers than having to send their products away. I understand that it is the desire to reach another stage in Supply, and so I conclude, but not with a very good peroration, as it is on a rather prosaic subject. I wish to know if the Postmaster-General will establish an aerogen gas plant in the post-office at Gladstone. </para>

                            <para>- Is it not amazing how all these gentlemen shy in their castors, and come into the ring, and talk about twenty millions? They held the reins of government for many years, but owing to their incompetency and destitution in the matter of financial ability they left the country almost on the verge of bankruptcy. Coming back to the statement made by the honorable member for Gippsland, I must say that it has no foundation in fact. It is as destitute of truth as a frog is of feathers. </para>

                            <para>- I have no ill-feeling towards the present Government. I am merely sorry for them. When they took over from us the reins of government the finances were in a flourishing condition; but, after squandering nearly every penny on which they could lay their hands, we find them, after thirteen months of office; face to face with a deficit of ?3,100,000. That will be the deficit at the end of the year, if we allow for their several commitments. </para>

When we left office business was flourishing, but to-day merchants all over the country tell us that business is bad, and that it is hard to collect money. All this is due to the fact that one of the most incompetent Governments that we have ever had in Australia has had possession of the Treasury bench for thirteen months. An awful fate awaits them.

                            <para>- The honorable member is not yet out of the wood. Coming to another matter, I understand that in the Senate to-day the Honorary Minister could not give a definite answer to a question as to whether or not a supplementary roll would be issued. We should have a definite pronouncement on the subject. According to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> the population of New South Wales last year increased to the extent of nearly 100,000, and yet 116,000 names have been removed from the rolls. The honorable member for Adelaide this afternoon read a circular issued by the Secretary of the Fusion party in South Australia, in which he invited the organizers of the party to send him in &#34;the names of Labour supporters.&#34; Here we have a general conspiracy. The Attorney-General has broken the law by allowing these people to send in objections to names on the rolls without lodging a deposit of 5s. in each case. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Although I am said to be a partisan, not once did I interfere with the working of the Electoral Act whilst I was in office. It is true that I refused to allow squatters, who were sacking men because they voted against their candidates, to act as presiding officers. When complaints were brought to me on the subject, I quickly stopped them from so acting; but I never once asked the officers to remove any name from the rolls. All that wo want is a. square deal and a fair fight. If we get that, we shall be satisfied. </para>

Now they are paying 4 per cent. and only get &#163;97, which means that they are losing &#163;30,000 in &#163;1,000,000, and on that &#163;30,000 they have to pay 4 per cent. In other words, . they are really discounting at 3&#163; per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour party recognised all along that in the expansion of the Commonwealth Bank its operations would extend in due time into the country, so that we would have a grand system of rural credit, and enable the farmers of this country to study scientific chemical methods of farming. Compare the Australian farmer&#39;s annual production per acre with the productions in Germany, France, or the State of Wisconsin, and we find that the Australian farmer does not produce half the percentage of crop that is produced in Germany and France. Why? Simply because there is a rude system of cultivation in Australia. With very few exceptions, the Australian farmer has not studied scientific chemical methods of progressive farming. There is great talk when they have to pay a little extra to their working men. What difference do good wages make when farmers are getting big crops? In the State of Kansas we used to raise 80 or 90 bushels of corn to the acre; in Australia the farmers think they are doing well if they are getting 70 bushels. </para>

                            <para>- I am talking about the average for a whole State. Some of the men in Kansas reaped 150 bushels to the acre; but 1 mentioned 90 as the average for that great prairie State, where the prairie dog rules supreme. Instead of wasting our time on a tin-pot preference to unionists prohibition Bill, the present Government might have ascertained by investigation the causes of the wonderful progress of the agriculture of the German and French farmers, as compared with that of the Australian farmers. The facts are plain and undeniable. Agricultural production is not increasing annually in Australia in proportion to the productive capacity of the people. I will admit at once that the fault does not lie wholly with the Australian producers. Both owners and tenants will compare favorably with the average Australian in intelligence, integrity, industry, and thrift, hut they have always had to struggle against the stupendous organization known as the private banking corporation, which has been backed up by the various State Governments, and which has always discriminated against the farmer and in favour of the financial speculator in stocks, shares, debentures, bonds, and mortgages. </para>

                            <para>- I would urge my honorable friends who interject to remember that one can catch more flies with molasses than with vinegar. Why should not the Commonwealth Bank lend money if the security is good ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> Miller, the Governor of the Bank, is a very careful man ; in fact, he is too cautious. That is the reason why I desire the establishment of a board. I think the responsibility is too much for any one man. When there is a board, the members seat themselves around a table, and one man looks at the question one way, and another man another way, but the general consensus of opinion is nearly always right. That is why I am anxious that the States should be represented on a board of directors, so that we may have one great national system of finance. Coming back to my original proposition, I desire to say that the land and the workers of a nation are its real sources of wealth. Stocks, bonds, shares, debentures, and all manner of transferable and exchangeable securities are merely titles to the ownership of the profits from land and labour. We want to take the farmer out of the hands of the usurer. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, not always. But the wealth of the world has been produced by the labour of workers. We are not producers, we are acquirers and accumulators. They produce, and we gather together. We need a system of rural credit in Australia, so that two or three farmers can get together, and one farmer can back another&#39;s promissory note, and can have it rediscounted through the Common wealth Bank at a low rate of interest. Why is it that the speculator in industrial, commercial, financial, and other securities can borrow all the money he requires on call loans at from 2&#189; to 4 per cent., while the farmer, who produces the food that we live on, has to pay from 6 to 12 per cent. per annum on his overdraft? </para>

                            <para>- If it is advancing money to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, you can rest assured that it has the security. I am prepared to advance money if you will give me proper security. When the great iron industry is full-grown, it will employ thousands of men, and thus make a market for the farmers. What we are trying to do is to get, by means of Protection, a home market for our people. We believe in Protection. After the next election, when a Labour Government are back on the Treasury bench, you will have Protection up to the hilt in the very first session. You will have such a system of Protection that you will know where we start out. We shall not let our friends get the big commitments which  they have had since we left office. We will give the initiative and the referendum. No young country can prosper without Protection, which diversifies industries and increases the intelligence of the community, transferring the raw material into the finished product, and putting twenty or thirty values on it in the process. I say to honorable members opposite: Take warning; the handwriting is on the wall; Belshazzar&#39;s castle is coming down; Nebuchadnezzar is going out to eat grass for twenty years. The wicked shall not prosper. Never was anything truer than the old sacred Word. God said, &#34;The wicked shall not prosper,&#34; and they have not. For thirteen months they have sat on the Treasury bench, and have swallowed up Fisher&#39;s surplus, so that now there is nothing left. Let them have a good time, it is nearly over. In the Sabbath schools of Canada I was taught that when sitting at the bedside of the dying, one should never call attention to the crimes which he had committed. </para>

                        <para>.- A more pitiful exhibition of physical and mental depression I have never seen in any Parliament than that now given by honorable members opposite. The Labour party was full of dash and daring when an appeal to the country was first spoken about, but it is a depressed and melancholy body now that that appeal is about to be made. Judging by the utterances of its members this evening, it was never in a worse mental state than that in which it finds itself now. The honorable member for Darwin says that his party favours the initiative and referendum. I do not know if he is aware what that would mean in a great country like Australia. The initiative might bc possible in a municipality, and even in a very small State, although, as Woodrow Wilson has pointed out, no one would dream of proposing it where there is decent representation in a State. To propose the initiative is to admit that Parliament has outlived its usefulness; that its members are corrupt, or so ignorant as to be unable to exercise legislative functions, or so unacquainted with public opinion as to be unable to propose the laws needed by the people. In my opinion, those admissions cannot be made regarding the Parliament of Australia. According to the right honorable member for Wide Bay, Parliament has outlived&#39;, its usefulness, and, therefore, he may favour the initiative ; but it would require something like 300,000 votes to get a. matter brought forward by means of the initiative, and would the right honorable member suggest that any Parliament would be so wanting in intelligence, and so devoid of information, that it would not know, and give expression to, the opinions of 300,000 electors 1 In the circumstances, for a Parliament even to talk about the initiative and referendum is an admission that its members do not understand the duties they are called upon to perform. </para>

                            <para>- I always understood! that members of Parliament were sent in because the people trusted them to make laws for them. When the people ceased to trust them, I could understand them, perhaps, abolishing Parliament altogether, or taking in hand something of the style which the honorable member suggests, but not till then. It is an admission by the honorable member that he believes Parliament to be such a degraded, ignorant body that it is unable to legislate on behalf of the people. Some of the Labour party may hold that belief, but I entirely disagree with it. </para>

                            <para>- There can be no other reason for bringing forward such a proposal. A measure applicable to a small town or city is surely not applicable to a great combine like this. Who are to bo the people to take these petitions round to be signed? Are they to be bodies of men outside Parliament, and are they to <inline font-style="italic">know move</inline> about the opinion of the people than men in Parliament? That is what the advocates of this proposal have to admit, and, therefore, to talk about the initiative and referendum as likely to produce any change in the welfare of the people is utterly to misunderstand its nature. After all, the scale of intelligence in Parliament may not be very high, as some people assert, but, in the main, it is a very correct reflex of the general standard of intelligence of the {&#62;eople, and, consequently, the class of legislation that the people desire is, in the main, carried out by their Parliaments for them. It is unfortunate that political economy is not more greatly studied than it is, and that every man is not altogether fitted to take his place in Parliament, but, after all, it is a very good thing that there should be representatives of every shade of opinion. Whether that opinion is well or ill formed, it is highly desirable that the matter should be brought into the Court of common complaints, for that is what our Parliament is, and discussed pro and con. Again, if you were to draw up your Bill, it might have one name and bring about a totally different result from that intended. I suppose Acts have been passed times out of number to accomplish one thing, and have brought about something totally different. In Great Britain alone during the last hundred years some 20,000 Acts have been repealed only after having been found mischievous and unworkable. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply pointing out what the Labour party did. I, for one, never questioned that the Labour party meant in one way to have a shot at some of the various sugar companies throughout Queensland and New South Wales. The result of their action was that in one company alone the shares have risen since the passing of the Act to the extent of &#163;1,500,000. I know honorable members opposite did not intend this, but if a vote had been taken, and the matter had been submitted to the people at the time, it would have been passed, because the Labour party were in favour of it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows that that is a deliberate untruth. If anything was tried to be done, it was this: The Labour party had been able to squeeze the Tobacco Trust and got contributions from them, but they were not able to squeeze the men belonging to the Sugar Company, and they would not pay anything to their funds, so the Labour party brought up a Bill which they thought would apply to them. They appointed a Commission which they thought would kill them, but this Commission remained not to curse, but to bless. </para>

We are supposed to take no notice of them when they come from honorable members opposite. But the same individuals become extremely sensitive when a similar method of attack is made upon them. A Bill can be so framed as to accomplish an entirely different purpose from that which its authors intended it to accomplish. I may mention, for instance, one or two Anti-Trust Bills which were framed. One of these measures, instead of being an Anti-Trust Bill, was a Bill which, in my opinion, led to the creation of trusts. Then, again, in connexion with certain parts of the Tariff, some honorable members intended that a benefit should be conferred on the workmen who are employed in particular lines of industry. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The reason is that, when industrial factories are built up in certain lines, those engaged in them are unable to seek service in any other avenue of employment, and thus  become absolutely bound to accept the limited wage that is offered to them. The honorable member for Darwin asserted to-night that the Labour party are in favour of providing cheap money to men on the land. Let me tell him that the whole of the taxation that has been imposed by this Parliament falls upon the men on the land. Although honorable members did not intend to do so, they diverted capital from land into industrial pursuits in the city. In addition to causing the withdrawal of capital from its proper lines of development, they built on the idea that the scarcer capital was made the better it would be for the poor man. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely showing what the Labour party did. Of course, they did not intend to do it. But, by their action, they caused the withdrawal from the private banks of &#163;10,000,000, which was earning, in the main, 10 per cent. In addition to that &#163;10,000,000 which was withdrawn from the private banks, the State Labour Governments went on borrowing until they had exhausted the local market, and thus absorbed practically another &#163;20,000,000. That made a total of &#163;30,000,000. As a consequence of that money being invested in works which are not paying interest at the present time, and which, perhaps, for four or five years, will not do so, we have something like &#163;30,000,000 which is returning only 3 per cent., or &#163;900,000 annually instead of &#163;3,000,000, which it would have been returning had it remained in private hands. Thus they have raised the rate of interest to every borrower in the community. The very men who talk so much against the capitalist have really benefited him tremendously. Is it any wonder that the sensible section of the workers have realized this, and have determined that there must be an end to this kind of thing? What the genuine worker wants is capital. It is the want of capital which keeps him down. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite run about the country exclaiming that capital keeps them down, although in the next breath they admit that it is the want of capital. Can there be  a  greater state of mental confusion than that exhibited by honorable members opposite, who are unable to understand that it is the want of capital which keeps a community back? The Labour party, by their action, have undoubtedly raised the rate of interest. They have also attempted, by -means of a heavy land tax,, to divert capital from land. They have not .allowed anything to the unfortunate man who has to borrow money on his land; and, if we are not careful, they will prevent any small man raising a loan upon his land from a private company. What will be the result? The result will be the aggregation of still larger estates than exist at the present time. In New South Wales the Labour Government have introduced a super-tax, which they describe as something new; but, asa matter of fact, a similar tax was introduced as far back as 367 b.c. This fact shows that the Labour party are the Tory party, who always live in the past, and cannot learn to live in the present and the future. All their legislation is of the musty, fusty, rusty past. In 367 b.c., under the super-tax, a man was not allowed to own more than 300 acres or 100 head of cattle; and the Labour party follows on the same lines now, although the inevitable result is the greater aggregation of estates. In Gaul in the fourth century, land taxes caused men to leave the land in such numbers that whole districts were deserted, until too late it was discovered that taxation had killed the &#34; goose that laid the golden egg.&#34; When honorable members opposite launch out against the big man they hit the small man infinitely harder than they do the object of their legislation. In Syria and Egypt, where land taxation was carried to extremes, whole districts were desolated; and only 120 years ago in France, as Arthur Young relates, whole provinces, in some cases, were thrown out of cultivation owing to it being impossible to secure advances on land. The same thing is operating in Western Australia to-day, where financial companies will not make advances because of the utterances of a Labour Minister about the conversion of titles and freeholds. </para>

                            <para>- Because it is proposed to confiscate the titles of land. The Labour party do not understand the injury they may do to the country, and they will find out the truth too late. A few  months ago I quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Rig Vedas,</inline> showing that in India they had learned the lesson, and that one of the old kings there was advised to take care not to oppress the tillers of the soil by heavy taxation, so as to drive them away, because they could not be regained. I mention these things because honorable members opposite seem to be absolutely blind to the teachings of history; and, if they had their way, they would land this country in ruin. </para>

                        <para>.- As we are on the eve of an appeal to the country, it is important that there should be placed on record the ineptitude, inefficiency, and bungling of this Government in every Department under their control. There are seven Departments administered by the various captains of this Government, namely : </para>

                    <para class="block">The Treasury : </para>

                    <para>The Treasury is administered by the right honorable member for Swan. When the Labour Government took office in 1910, there was a deficit of &#163;450,000 left by the Fusion Government. When the Labour Government left office, after three years&#39; control of the finances, a cash surplus of &#163;2,643,305 was left in the Treasury. The Cook-Irvine Government took office in June, 1913, and they now admit that they will have a surplus of only &#163;824,305 at the end of the current month. </para>
                    <para>These statements are undisputed, but I want to place on record some criticisms of the bungling of the Government in every Department from their own supporters. The case has been so undeniable, the facts have been crying so loudly, that even the great Liberal newspapers have been called upon to testify to the chaos that exists in the whole of the Departments : </para>
                    <para>Referring to the question of finance, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which is not a Labour newspaper by any means, in a leading article on the 12th inst., said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It will be remembered that in his Budget Speech last October the Treasurer estimated the revenue of the current financial year at &#163;21,462,000, and the gross expenditure at &#163;27,246,747, leaving a deficit of &#163;5,784,747, to be provided for partly out of new loan funds and partly from the accumulated surplus, of &#163;2,643,305, inherited from the Fisher Administration. </para>

                        <para>It is clear, at any rate, that in regard to defence, the Government has not kept its pledges to the people. We were promised a sensible alleviation in our overwhelming burden of military defence, and it seems we are to be fobbed off with a paltry sop of &#163;160,000 on our naval and military establishments combined. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest plumes himself on having effected &#34; considerable savings &#34; in other departments, but he refrained from indicating their nature or extent in more specific terms.  His  revised estimates for the year are as follow :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="074331191406242_57_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The above estimate of expenditure refers, of course, exclusively to expenditure out of revenue; and it will be seen that the Treasurer treats the accumulated surplus left by the Fisher Government as an ordinary item of revenue. It should be needless to remark that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest has not a tittle of justification for this procedure. The accumulated Fisher surplus of &#163;2,643,305 was, no doubt, earned out of the superabundant revenue of past years, but, once having been earned and ear-marked as surplus, it became capital money belonging to the people. </para>
                    <para class="block">So the stinging testimony to the financial incompetency of the Government proceeds. It is shown further in this article that the Government have been juggling with the finances, and it is pointed out that the position in this Department is most precarious. Yet the Government have done nothing, and are doing nothing, to remedy the position. </para>

From 1908-9 to 1913-14, a period of five years, there has been a tremendous increase in the cost of the administration of pur office in London. It has mounted from &#163;3,650, in the former year, to an estimated expenditure of &#163;21,461 for the present year. </para>

                        <para>Lord Kitchener estimated that when in full working order, in 1920, our military forces would cost us &#163;1,888,000. This year we are spending &#163;3,315,435 on land forces alone, and conservative estimates place the cost in 1920 at &#163;5,000,000, assuming that rigid economy is exercised. No country in the world, crushed as many of them are beneath the burden of armaments, pays as much as 25s. per head for land forces only. Australia will quickly have to decide whether she is able to afford this huge annual sum for her citizen army. </para>

                    <para>There is huge expenditure going on at the top of the tree in the Defence Department. Inspector-General Kirkpatrick was employed at a salary of &#163;1,500 per year. His place is being taken by Inspector-General Bridges at a salary of &#163;1,500 a year. But it must be remembered that Inspector-General Kirkpatrick left his home in England to take up duty on a practically foreign station. He was to all intents and purposes working away from his home, and provision had to be made to pay him accordingly. </para>
