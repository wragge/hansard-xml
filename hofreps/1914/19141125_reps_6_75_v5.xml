                        <para>- The matter is being considered. It is hoped that a competent authority will be appointed to carry out in Australia experiments similar to those conducted in other countries, which will cover a much wider field than the &#39;mere testing of explosives, having to do with the resilience and structure of metals and other matters. We hope that a determination will be come to&#34; very soon. </para>

I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether that message was censored. If it was, will the censor be reprimanded; and if it was not, will the <inline font-style="italic">Evening News</inline> be called to account for the publication of such a statement, which caused a great sensation iu Sydney ? </para>

                            <para>- The question, I think, is a very proper one. I do not know whether the message in question was seen by the censor; but if it was, and was passed by him in the form mentioned, then I should view his conduct as does the honorable member for Parkes. With all due respect to the proprietors of the newspaper in question, I consider that their action in publishing such a statement, which I do not think is true, was reprehensible. I shall make inquiries into the matter. </para>

                </speech>
                    <para>Sydney, Tuesday</para>
                    <para class="block">In the Legislative Assembly to-day the Premier said he would ask the House to pass an urgency Bill, giving effect to the proposals, through all stages on the following day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> further announced that, from information collected by the Minister of Agriculture, it appeared that the forthcoming wheat harvest would be insufficient by an amount roughly estimated at 1,000,000 bags for consumption in the Commonwealth. Exact information on that point would be available later by the Minister. While there would be a surplus within the area of New South Wales, there would be a shortage in other parts of the Commonwealth. It would therefore become necessary to import a quantity of wheat, presumably from Canada, in order to make up that shortage, and apparently the ruling price throughout the Commonwealth would be determined, not as in former years by the surplus they had for export and by the price then ruling in the London market, but by the price of the 1,000,000 bags which they brought in to supply local markets, and as that would be a high price, probably 6s. or 6s. 3d. per bushel, there was a probability of a heavy increase in the price of flour and bread unless Adequate steps were taken to protect the interests of the people of the State. </para>
                    <para>What the Government proposed to do, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> said, was to protect the situation of the Commonwealth as far as it was able to do. Clearly, any step they might take would leave the situation in other States in the Commonwealth unaffected where there was actual shortage, and where wheat at 6s. 3d. or 6s. 6d. per bushel had to be imported. </para>
                    <para class="block">Mark the Premier&#39;s use of the word &#34; urgency.&#34; The Minister of Trade and. Customs long ago relieved this country from any doubt as to there being sufficient protection of the foodstuffs of Australia, by his declaration which has the effect of preventing the export of flour, wheat, and other commodities of the kind ; and, therefore, it is to be hoped that the responsibility of providing the people of New South Wales with a cheap loaf will not be covered up under the cloak of protecting the people of Australia. This Parliament is clothed with ample authority, and the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs has my complete approval. I am not now speaking of an ex-Minister of External Affairs, who reminds me of my &#34; two blades of grass&#34;; his popularity has vanished, and his persistent remarks make me feel that the effort of his life has been rather to make &#34; one blade of grass&#34; grow where two grew before. The &#34; urgency &#34; referred to by the Premier of New South Wales is based, we are led to understand, on negotiations between Commonwealth Ministers and himself, and I shall, at a later stage, ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to lay on the table the whole of the correspondence that has taken place regarding the wheat question. In both the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of to-day we are told - </para>

                        <para>The Premier of New South Wales(Mr. Holman) made a suggestion to the Minister of Customs yesterday that collective action should be taken by the Federal and State authorities on the wheat question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> was not prepared to adopt the suggestion offered, and it was decided to submit it for the consideration of the Premiers&#39; Conference, which meets in Melbourne on Monday next. </para>

                    <para>Observe the timorous &#34; urgency &#34; of this Premier, who is not prepared to take the responsibility himself for his action, and also observe the sagacity of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who - and I commend him for it - will not touch the question with a 40-foot pole. </para>

                            <para>- That is just the point to which I am coming. The question assumes two aspects, with both of which I am vitally concerned. The first is the constitutional aspect, and the next is the effect of the action taken on one of the great industries of Australia. I shall not dwell long on the constitutional aspect, because there are others in the House better qualified to speak in that regard than I am myself. I feel it my duty, however, to point out that this Parliament derives its authority in connexion with trade and commerce from section 51 of the Constitution, and that section 92 seems to show the position very clearly, so far as a layman is concerned. Section 92 reads - </para>

                            <para>On the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among -the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely -free. &#34;We have from the Premier of New South &#34;Wales an absolute declaration that the -estimated wheat supply in that State will be more than adequate for  the  requirements of the people there. We are. aware that there are certain policing powers, as we may call them, which may be put into operation for the preservation of life, and for the protection and the well-being and health, and so forth, of the citizens, under which a State may operate. With total disregard of the Constitution, Western Australia acted in the restriction of the importation of produce from one State to another. Western Australia, by an over-exercise of these policing powers, attempted to restrain trade in this way. Now we have the first attempt made in the Commonwealth to assert, at any rate the first declaration by any State, that the foodstuffs in that State shall be the property of the State and disposed of by the Government as they may think proper. It matters little to me that the New South Wales Bill may provide that, if there be surplus wheat after New South Wales requirements are met, that surplus will be at the disposal of the other States. If the Federal Parliament has the right to act as the guardian of freedom of trade between the States, in order to insure free and unfettered commercial intercourse, it little matters, I say, that a Government, while temporarily holding up that trade, may promise to ultimately make available the surplus for distribution amongst the other </para>

                        <para class="block">States. The action of New South Wales seems to be the converse of the action of Western Australia, when that State, by an overcautious system of inspection, prevented Victorian potatoes from finding their natural market under a condition of Inter-State Free Trade. Here we have an avowed declaration by the Premier of New South Wales that it is his intention to prevent the wheat crop of that State, and the surplus of the previous years - and that must be borne in mind, because a surplus did exist - finding its natural market in the other States. Western Australia by its inspection system attempted to prevent foodstuffs getting into the State, and now we have the converse action of an attempt to prevent foodstuffs leaving a State. I can well understand the attempt of the Premier of New South Wales to secure uniform action on the part of the various States. There is a very old and impressive story told of the fox that had its tail cut off, and that story seems apposite to the present circumstances. I believe that from a constitutional standpoint, and also having regard to the effect which his action will have on the agricultural interests of New South Wales, the Premier of that State has blundered badly. Whatever the constitutional aspect of this matter may be, the question arises as to who is to decide regarding the legality of the action which has been taken. Is New South Wales itself to determine the justice or injustice of an action which we believe to be wrong? Or is the Federal Parliament to be the arbiter? If so, I hope that this House will to-day show itself a jealous custodian of the rights of the whole of the States. </para>

                                <para>- The referendum is the honorable member&#39;s pet nostrum for everything. If the action of the New South Wales Government in acquiring the entire wheat crop of that State and preventing freedom of trade between the States is correct, how does Australia stand iu respect of its many great natural industries ? Suppose the Queensland Government were to similarly acquire and control the sugar crop, what would become of the true Federal spirit under which the States federated? Apparently we are to have the doctrine laid down that in times of plenty the Federal spirit is to be observed, but in lean years the opponents of the true Federal spirit are going to take the recoil action of asserting State rights in order, as they think, to produce a cheaper loaf for the people within their own particular State. If this action be right in respect of wheat, would it not be permissible in respect of New South Wales coal, Queensland sugar, and Western Australian timber? Let us glance at the position of the Riverina territory. Geographically and otherwise, Melbourne is the market for Riverina, but by the action of the New South Wales Government Riverina will be deprived of its natural market, and its produce will be forced to take a more costly and circuitous route. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. The estimate for this year is that the wheat harvest for the entire Commonwealth will be only 30,000,000 bushels. That estimate is not made by the Federal Statistician, but it is based on the best information I was able to get in the time at my disposal. I have also the estimate of the New .South Wales Statistician for his own State, and I shall put that on record. The 1913-14 harvest in that State yielded 38,028,000 bushels, and the estimated yield for this year is 15,000,000 bushels. </para>

                                <para>- I am satisfied that the figure I have given will be the limit. This further fact has to be borne in mind : that the officials who have collected this information, though they have taken into consideration all the area under wheat, and the possible yield, have not fully appreciated the fact that this year there will be an enormous additional area cut for hay. The farmers will be influenced to this step by the fact that a greater area will be required this year to produce the amount of fodder that must be consumed, and also by the action of the Government of New South Wales in declaring that they propose to acquire the whole of the harvest, which action I can characterize as nothing but a piratical invasion of the rural industry of New South Wales by the State Government. </para>

According to the press report of a deputation of Victorian farmers which waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs, it is estimated that this season there will be a shortage in Victoria of 1,500,000 bushels. </para>

                                <para>- I dare say that they have underestimated the shortage. In the matter of yields, there is an inclination to overestimate rather than to underestimate. My point is that Australia will undoubtedly be short by several million bushels. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> anticipated that the shortage would be 3,000,000 bushels, and that .it would be necessary to go to other countries in order to make it up. The average wheat yield in Australia is from 11 to 12 bushels per acre; last year the average in New South Wales was 11.86 ; we may call it 12 bushels. That return, at the price of 3s. 4d. per bushel prevailing when the harvest was declared, would have yielded a gross return of &#163;2 per acre. Now, cost of production must always bear a certain relationship to the fixation of prices&#39; doctrines; and I have estimates of the cost of production in various States which show that the cost of producing a wheat crop runs from 30s. to &#163;2 per acre. In some parts of Victoria it is fully &#163;2. In the more settled districts, where the land is heavier, and where the methods are better than in other districts, the cost is higher than it is in the Mallee, where there is light, free soil, and where the methods employed are not so good as in the other districts. According to the estimate of the New South Wales Statistician, the average yield of the State this season will be 4 or 4$ bushels per acre, which, at the fixed price of 5s. per bushel, will mean a return of fi 2s. 6d. per acre, or 7s. 6d. per acre less than the cost of production on the lowest basis I allow for the cost of growing an acre of wheat. Thus, assuming that the wheat yield of New South Wales is 15,000,000 bushels, the State Government propose to levy upon the drought-stricken farmers of the State, on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman&#39;s</inline> figures, a direct tax of &#163;1,125,000; and if he is successful in bringing about uniformity of action, and a fixed price of 5s. per bushel throughout the various States, affecting a total Commonwealth yield of 30,000,000 bushels, there will be a levy of &#163;2,250,000 on the drought-stricken farmers of the Commonwealth in order to provide a cheap loaf for the people of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> and for every legislator whose affairs are not affected by the action of fixing the price of wheat. </para>

                                <para>- The price is fixed by the N&#34;ew South Wales BilL However, as I have only a few more minutes, I shall not answer any further questions from honorable members. Apparently, the position is, that the Federal Government are financing another Labour Government which has for its avowed object the purchase of the wheat crop of its State at a cost of &#163;3,750,000. The State Government has, by its appeal to the Federal Government, proved its utter inability to conduct its own financial arrangements, and place at the disposal of the people the ordinary facilities of government, enabling public works to be proceeded with. Yet here is a monstrous proposal on the part of the Federal Government to lend money to a State Government in order that it may exact an enforced levy of &#163;1,125,000 from its drought-stricken farmers. I am very much mistaken if the country will stand such an action. Public conscience must be stirred up. Industry would not be safe under such conditions. We have the Premier of the State appealing to the farmers to spread out their areas and fallow more land, and telling them that if they do so they will get 4s. per bushel for their wheat. Is it the proper thing for the trustees of the money of the people of New South Wales to buy in advance the whole of next year&#39;s wheat crop for 4s. a bushel? Let there be no more talk in this House against the speculator when the Premier of New South Wales is permitted to do a thing like that. The proposition of the New South Wales </para>

                            <para>.- I support the motion. The matter which it has been moved to discuss may be considered from two stand-points, from that of the consumer, or bread-eater, and from that of the producer or farmer. The Government must have regard to the interests of both classes, and in the discussion of this subject there should be no intrusion of ironical interjections, or of party feeling. On both sides there are honorable members who represent farming constituencies. New South Wales is the only State which this year will have a surplus of wheat; the other States will harvest enough grain to provide seed only for next season, certainly not enough to provide their people with bread. Therefore, it is the duty of this -Government to see that no action is taken by the Government of New South Wales which will injure the rest of the Commonwealth. If it were an individual, or a company, or a syndicate, that proposed to corner the New South Wales wheat crop, the howls of indignation would prevent us from hearing one another speak. Many of those who interjected during the speech of the honorable member for Wannon would be the loudest in their complaint. </para>

                                <para>- I think so. A price has been arbitrarily fixed, and, though a Bill has not yet been passed through the State Parliament, no dealer in wheat dare offer any other price, and no farmer dare expect more than 5s. a bushel at the nearest railway station. </para>

                                <para>- I am sorry that the honorable member has not practical experience of wheat growing. If he had, he would be less hypercritical. Even in New South Wales there are many places where, during the last three or four years, farmers have been growing wheat at a loss. Remembering these losses, it it not too much for them to expect to be recouped by higher prices this season. Even 5s. a bushel is not a paying price. As a practical wheat-grower, I say that, if every item is taken into consideration, from 5s. 6d. to 6s. a bushel would be only a paying price, even in the most favoured districts. For what other than speculative purposes has the New South Wales Government arbitrarily fixed the price of wheat? What is it going to do with the surplus ? Is it going to act as a philanthropist, and say to the people of the other States, &#39; &#39; You can have wheat at the price that we gave for it &#34; ? That is the last thing that should be expected of that Government. Yet it speaks of encouraging wheat-growing by the fixing of a minimum price for next year ! The action of the New South Wales Government, if this Government does not intervene, will be to retard production. Inasmuch as the other States have not sufficient wheat to meet their requirements, this Government should declare that the action of the Government  of  New South Wales in cornering the wheat crop of that State is prejudicial to the interests of the Commonwealth as  a  whole. The consideration of this matter by the State Parliament has been postponed. </para>

                                <para>- I believe that it is to be brought before the Conference  of  Premiers which is to meet .next week. I was in the Legislative Assembly chamber in Sydney yesterday afternoon, when in reply to a question by the Leader  of  the Opposition it was stated that action  was to be deferred pending some arrange&#34; ment. Before that statement was made it was thought that the Standing Orders would be suspended to enable a Bill authorizing the Government&#39;s action to be passed through in one sitting. I hope that before anything definite is done the Minister of Trade and Customs will strongly protest against the proposed cornering of wheat by the Government of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable member for Wannon has done a distinct public service in bringing this matter forward for discussion at the present time. Nothing more serious can occupy the attention of the Legislature than the prices of  primary  commodities which are the source of life to us all. Like many other honorable members, I represent consumers, and my chief and primary interest is to see that the staple of life is made as cheap as possible consistently with the interests of the producers. No one desires a dear loaf in Australia, nor a condition of things which would make bread dear to those who toil. Therefore, we are not wasting the time of Parliament in discussing these matters affecting our daily bread. I do not quite see what function the Commonwealth Government has in the regulation of these things. It may, of course, interpose to preserve that freedom of intercourse which is a fundamental principle of the Constitution, and one of the chief purposes of Federation, but whether the time has arrived when it can intervene I do not pretend to say. I understand that a Conference with the Premiers is to be held next Monday, at which this matter, among others, will be dealt with. Members of the Government have spoken of these Conferences as an excrescence on the Constitution, but the present Ministers have multiplied their number. I am glad that they show such good sense, and I am pleased that this most serious question is to be considered by a Conference. </para>

                        <para>What are the facts? This year New South Wales, alone of all the States, has a small surplus of wheat. But let it not be thought that therefore the farmers of the State are doing well. Nothing could be further from the truth. The official statistics are eloquent  testimony  to their hardships. Last year, 3,205,000 acres were under wheat in New South Wales, and this year nearly 3,500,000 acres will be put under wheat. The estimated yield is 15,000,000 bushels - a high estimate - or about 4 bushels an acre. </para>

                                <para>- That, I think, must be so ; otherwise, the cost would be very shocking. But take the case of wheat alone. It is that which I wish to impress on honorable members. I read in a country newspaper a few days ago a detailed estimate, supplied by a farmer in New South Wales, of what it cost to put in his crop and to take it out. His estimate amounted to about 32s. per acre. </para>

There are other honorable members who started to grow wheat, but came out of the industry because they could not make a success of it. The honorable member for Werriwa, however, continues to grow wheat. The Leader of the Opposition commenced wheat cultivation, but gave it up because he could not grow any wheat. </para>

                                <para>- Let me put this matter in another way. At page 27 of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Statistical Bulletin,</inline> it is stated that, in 1904, in New South Wales, the total production of crops amounted to &#163;12,372,000. These figures include hay, sugar-cane, vines, and wine-making, potatoes, and all other highly profitable crops, and that represents what was gained from 4,568,000 acres. We have, therefore, an average return of about &#163;2 14s. per acre. The farmers clearly have not been having a good time for many years past- </para>

                                <para>- A gentleman who buys and sells wheat on commission - who does a large business, but does not speculate, and never has done so - tells me that since the Government began to fix the price of wheat speculators have been doing a roaring business. They have been going into the country and &#34; scooping the pools,&#34; with the result that those who sell on commission - selling honestly and doing what they can for the farmers - find themselves without an occupation. These speculators are reaping rich harvests, and making fortunes out of the fixing of prices. </para>

                                <para>- It is alleged that some of them get inside information and make use of it to their own advantage. All that I suggest to the Government is that they should discuss this matter very seriously with the Government of New South Wales. If they can bring any moderating influence to bear I hope it will be in the direction of preventing interference except where wrong is being done. There is no justification for the Government interfering with these matters except where a wrong is being perpetrated upon the people of this country. </para>

                        <para> To put the matter in its best aspect, what is happening in New South Wales is that, in order to prevent the man who has a bountiful crop getting a little more, the Government are running the risk of jeopardizing the very income of the man who has only a small crop, and whom the drought has hit very heavily. I do not say that the Government have no right to interfere in time of war; but it is not the war - it is the drought that is causing the present trouble. The war has nothing to do .Avith this time of pinching poverty through which some people are passing; the drought alone is responsible, and honorable members opposite should be very chary how they step in to prevent the primary industries taking advantage of a little higher prices in order to recoup them for a tremendously lower production. I do not know what lie Commonwealth Government can do, but they should consider whether they ought not to do something. </para>

                                <para>- I am not clear as to that. I suggest that the Commonwealth Government should act if they find the States going beyond the mark in this respect. We read, for instance, today that the South Australian Government are prohibiting their own people from sanding to Tasmania corn which has been purchased there. That, surely, is an interference with Inter-State Free Trade. I am not quite clear as to whether this action on the part of the New South Wales Government is not a direct interference with the principle of InterState Free Trade. What is their action in commandeering all the produce of their own State and declining to allow it to be sent into any other State, except upon certain terms and conditions, but the placing of a restriction - the placing of a bar sinister - upon trade between the States? I hope the Commonwealth Government will step in, if need be, to prevent injustice being done to the consumer, on the one hand, and the producer on the other. </para>

                            <para>.- Whilst I hold that the honorable member who has submitted this motion and those who support his action are wholly mistaken, and that their energy and talent are being misdirected, I feel that the fact that they express concern for the poor farmer who is being robbed to-day give3 us some little reason to hope that eventually they may turn their attention to the point at which the great robbery is being perpetrated, and which lies at the beginning of the work of production itself. I have followed wheat-growing for twenty-five years. I started in a very small way, and, like every one else, I follow my personal interests very keenly. In New South Wales, the bulk of the wheat produced in the big wheat-growing districts is raised by very poor men under the share-farming system. We have, it is true, a large number of very small holders cultivating their own land, but, except for the middle-class holder, in very few instances are men of considerable means operating under a wages system. It has become a common practice, especially among share-farmers and very small holders - the poor and the needy - to make advance sales of their wheat; but I have not heard on the part of the Opposition any expression of solicitation for the welfare of these men. I have not heard the Opposition express any desire that they should be relieved of the absurd contracts - absurd because of the war which subsequently broke out - entered into by them to sell their new season&#39;s wheat at 3s. and 3s. 3d. a bushel. </para>

                                <para>- I would relieve the wheat-growers by some such means as I sketched the other night, when I said that if the State would guarantee a price, not only in time of war, but at all times, it would result in making the industry permanent, instead of a sort of gamble in which one or two bad years may beggar a man. We find no relief foreshadowed for those people who have made contracts, and are really suffering. But the question arises whether we, as a farming class in New South Wales, should raise a dust over what has been described as the &#34; robbery &#34; of the producer, and make accusations against the powers that be, when they are called upon to pass extraordinary legislation, not only throughout the Commonwealth, but throughout the Empire. I have been twenty-five years a wheat-grower, and I never yet received 5s. a bushel ; and are we to permit the statement to go forth to the world that, when the Empire is in danger, and there is dearth of employment in every direction, those in the wheat industry are determined to take advantage of their more needy fellow-creatures? Are the wheatgrowers going to allow it to be known that they insist on their &#39; &#39; pound of flesh &#34; - that they insist on a price they have never been able to exact before? The bulk of us who are engaged in the wheat industry have, in the past, sold our produce for a trifle, and, though we were staggering under debt, no one came forward specially to assist us. As one who is more solicitous for the development of the wheat industry than of any other, it seems to me that the opportunity is being taken to nip in the bud what might turn out to be a very dangerous thing to those large numbers of people who are able to live as expensive idlers under our present system of production. It will no doubt, in the opinion of some, furnish a most dangerous precedent if we allow any Government to calmly fix the distribution price in the hour of trial, because this fixing is, in its results, satisfactory to the community as a whole; then, when the socialistic agitators come forward with a proposal to regulate the monstrous robbery in the form of rents and shares that are being exacted from the blood and toil of those actively engaged in the industry, there may be a danger of the conclusion that, as the system has worked so well in the case of distribution, it may work quite as well in the case of production. I have some wheat, though not a great deal, to sell this year, and I am pleased to say that I could, as a member of this House, face every farming centre in my constituency without, I think, losing a single vote, except, perhaps, in the case of a few interested commission agents and others, who may be afraid of finding their occupation gone. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly I do; and if the New South Wales Government will follow up their present step with others they have already a dumb rated in connexion with a supertax and the fixing of rentals, there will be given to the wheat-growing industry an impetus that could not be attained by any other means. I have heard it. said that the price of 5s. a bushel at the railway siding will so affront wheat farmers that they will put in less wheat; indeed, it lias been said that some of them are cutting for hay some crop that might be turned to grain. </para>

                                <para>- All I can say is that, if there are such farmers, they do not live in the huge wheat-growing area that I represent. Practical men must recognise that, in view of the drought, the hay this year is, at best, of inferior quality. We know that, as a rule, a drought such as we experienced in 1902 and are experiencing now is very apt to break up in November or December, and that, with what may be found in the stubble paddocks, the quantity of hay used on the farms this year may be reduced to, perhaps, one-half; at any rate, the chances are that growth will take place, and a small quantity of hay will 3ee us through. The class of hay which we harvest in such a bad year is of inferior quality, and, of course, it brings inferior prices. The cost of bagging and handling hay is so high, unless the land is close to a railway station, that the majority of farmers would prefer to fill their bags with anything else, and very few cut more hay than they require for their own consumption. </para>

                                <para>- Are there not hay districts and wheat districts ? <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. LYNCH.-</inline> Exactly; but mostly hay-growing districts are oat-growing ones, and I am speaking of what I know. Farmers have lived through past years without getting the price now offered; and, in 1902, they saw a worse drought than the present, as the figures show. A few good years, however, relieved most of us, on our own holdings, from debt; and why should we ask for special exemption from a system of fixing prices that is now universal all over the world ? We have heard no howl from the wool-growers, although it has been stated in the newspapers that it is the intention&#39; of the British Government to buy up the Argentine and other foreign wools to prevent the enemy getting supplies, thus leaving Australian wool locked up. I should be sorry to think that the patriotism of the pastoralists is of a higher quality than that  of the farmers; indeed, I am sure that that is not so. As I said before, when State interference will guarantee us 3s. 4d. or 3s. 6d. a bushel, the industry will become permanent, and it may become desirable to regulate, not only the terms of distribution, but also the terms under which men engage in production. Nothing is so productive of a number of worthless idlers than the attaining of a permanent title to large areas of fertile land; and it is those idlers that the farming community is called upon to support to-day. I know what it is to start from nothing on the land; and what little headway I have made has been by means of wheat farming. It has been said by some honorable gentleman that it costs from 32s. to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> an acre to put in a crop and take it out again; but in the Riverina district any number of men could be found to plough new ground at 6s. an acre, while old ground can be profitably dealt with for 4s. Any man knows that it is cheaper to harvest a poor crop than a good one. </para>

                                <para>- Most ploughmen get from 25s. to 30s. a week and keep. If it is old ground, and the ploughing is consecutive, it can be done profitably from 4s. to 4s. 6d., and the land can be ploughed once and harrowed twice for 10s. an acre by good capable men with an up-to-date plant. I have harvested with an harvester, on an average, 10 acres per day of about ten hours, over a term of six weeks. Of course, if one is harvesting a 10-bag crop he naturally cannot do more than, perhaps, two-thirds of what he would if it were a poor crop; and to-day many producers are not hiring men at all. Only to-day I have received a letter from men engaged in the industry who tell me that they are not employing any hands, because the harvest is so small that they can do the work themselves; and in the farming industry, as in other industries, we do not pay men when they are not wanted. </para>

                                <para>- I have yet to learn that the honorable member for Illawarra is a practical man at anything. I, of course, accept the figures given by the honorable member for Werriwa as to the part of the country in which he is particularly interested, but I can imagine no greater fallacy than to lay down a rule that shall apply to land generally. Everything depends on the nature of the land; some lands cost twice as much as others to crop, and some produce twice as much as others. Owing to the excitement of the war, the conditions at present prevailing in Australia have not received that consideration they would have secured under ordinary- circumstances. I solemnly believe that the four southern States, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, are in a worse condition to-day than in any previous year since they have been settled and cultivated. I know that in the State of Tasmania there have never been conditions equal in severity to those which prevail to-day. Tasmania is, as a rule, immune from droughts; but to-day that State is drought stricken from one end to the other, with the exception of a small portion on the north-west coast. Who can say what price will pay a farmer who is getting practically no yield at all I do say that the attempt which is being made by the New South Wales Government to commandeer, or buccaneer, the whole wheat surplus of that State is a direct infringement of the Constitution. If there is one section of the Constitution which is clearer than another, it is section 92- </para>

Is it in accordance with the Constitution that the Government of New South Wales may say, &#34;Although we have a surplus in our State, the other States may starve for bread &#34; ? </para>

                                <para>- That is exactly what they are doing to-day ; and it is time that the Federal Government considered whether the action of the New South Wales Government is not a direct and open violation of the Constitution. Is it not a prevention of free trade, interchange, and intercourse between the States when a Government deliberately lock up the surplus of any product, and say to other States, which are in need of that surplus, &#34; You shall not have it &#34; ? When Western Australia, by means of prohibitive inspection fees, placed a high protective duty on imports from Tasmania and Victoria, I held that it was the duty of the Federal Government to intervene, and they did intervene. In the United States, from the Constitution of which section 92 is taken, the Federal Government adhere to that section so strongly that when a strike has occurred which has interfered with Inter-State trade they have intervened, and said, &#34;You may fight these squabbles out among yourselves in your States; but the moment you infringe the Constitution by preventing free intercourse between the States, we, as the custodian of the rights and privileges of the people, must intervene.&#34; In New South Wales, however, an open violation of the Constitution has taken place, and the State Government glory in throwing the gauntlet in the face of the Federal Government, and saying, &#34; No matter what your Constitution provides, we admit that we have more wheat than we require, but the other States may starve.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- I think they have. I cannot speak with absolute certainty, but I know that the Tasmanian Government applied to other States, and they were unable to get supplies. As I have said, the four southern States are more drought stricken this year than they have been at any time since they have been settled. The coming year is going to be the worst time that the farmer and the farm labourer have ever experienced. The farmer may get credit for his fertilizers, and the Government may supply him with seed wheat, but wages have to be paid in cash, and I know that there are scores and scores of farmers all over the southern States who are not able to pay cash to their labourers. Therefore, the hardship will rest particularly on the small farmer in those States, and on the farm labourers, whom I regard as one of the most deserving classes in Australia, and I believe that in the coming season hundreds of these men will be thrown out of employment through no fault of either themselves or their employers. The thanks of the House are due to the honorable member for Wannon for having brought this matter under our attention. I know that honorable members from New South Wales do not realize the extent of the drought prevailing in the other States. In Victoria one may travel for miles and miles without seeing any wheat: </para>

I know of others who, instead of having &#163;700 or &#163;800 worth of chaff, will not have more than enough to feed their own horses through the year. So far as Tasmania is concerned, the harvest is practically nil. </para>

                                <para>- I have pointed out that, whilst in ordinary years the yield in Tasmania may be very much larger than that in other States, the cost of ploughing, sowing, and garnering is infinitely greater, because the farmers there never use the harvester at all. I believe that the fixing of the price of wheat this year is going to have the effect of enormously reducing the area planted next year. </para>

                                <para>- Whether the price is fixed by a Government or by a Board, the result is the same. I agree with the honorable member for Werriwa that there is a considerable element of gambling in wheat growing. Unless the farmer knows that at certain times he is going to get a very considerable price for his wheat he will cease wheat growing altogether. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. Unless we can regulate the elements we cannot regulate the prices to be paid to the farmer for his wheat. Are we going to say to the farmer, as the Governments of nearly all the States are saying, &#34; Put in all the wheat you can for the sake of the Empire &#34; - at the same time we will not allow one bushel of wheat to be sent away to help the Empire - &#34; and if you get a bountiful harvest you must face the competition of the world, and take what you can get for your grain, but if the country is drought-stricken, and your yield is so small that no price will repay you, we will fix a price which cannot possibly repay you.&#34; </para>

I feel confident that if the persons who are engaged in wheat-growing in Australia could be guaranteed anything like 5s. per bushel for the next couple of seasons the number of acres under wheat would probably be doubled or trebled.

                            <para>- I take it that honorable members are objecting to the action of the Boards who have fixed the prices of wheat, but I would point out that in at least two States those Boards were appointed by anti-Labour Governments. What is the true position in regard to the wheat supply to-day, and what has been the experience in past years? The average price of wheat in Australia during the last fifteen or twenty years has been less than 3s. 8d. per bushel. </para>

                                <para>- The Government of New South Wales will have to answer to the people of the State for their action in taking the wheat. While estimates have been given as to the probable harvest this season very few people can say how much has been held over from last season by speculators. Speaking from memory, I believe that one gentleman informed the Commission in Melbourne, when an inquiry was being held, that he held 900,000 bushels of wheat. </para>

The Government, by their action, practically said, &#34; We shall get the information, but allow those who have the produce to do what they like with it.&#34; I suppose that the 1914-15 crop can be fairly accurately estimated ; at any rate, we are all unanimous on the point that it will be a very small crop, but apparently some honorable members think that in these circumstances it is their duty to get the highest possible price for the producer and let the consumer &#34; go hang.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- Independently of any action taken by a State Government, the consumers will have to pay fairly highly. I understand that the proposal of the New South Wales Government is to buy the wheat crop of New South Wales at a fixed price, and, if there is any surplus over the State&#39;s requirements, to sell that surplus to the other States at that fixed price. Honorable members have contended that if the action taken had been taken by a syndicate, or by speculators, or a ring, it would be denounced by honorable members on the Government side. That would be the case if the Government of New South Wales proposed to do what a ring or speculators would do; but what would any ring or speculator who cornered the wheat supply, or the supply of any other foodstuff, do? Put up the price of the article to the highest possible point, and compel the consumers to pay it. As I understand it, the proposal of the New South Wales Government is to purchase the whole of the wheat at the fixed price of 5s., and, in the event of any other State being so short as to necessitate its purchasing outside the State, if not outside Australia, they are willing to sell to that State at cost price. </para>

                                <para>- In the event of New South Wales having a surplus, it is the intention of the Government of that State to hand over that surplus to the other States at the price paid by the State of New South Wales for the wheat - I cannot see that any other State has any room for complaint on that score - and I believe that they intend to go further. The suggestion, I gather from the press, is that, in the event of a shortage of wheat, they are willing to co-operate with the other Governments, and do exactly as the New Zealand Government have done, namely, import from overseas, thereby saving commission and the expenses of the middlemen, which ordinarily have to be paid by the consumer and the producer. I think that is the attitude the State Government have taken up on this question. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member had asked the cost of landing wheat here and paying all the charges, plus the duty, I would, of course, have added lid., which is roughly the duty. The Tariff is ls. 6d. per cental, which is about lid. or 11-Jd. per bushel. Of course, in the case of importation, that duty would need to be considered. The honorable member f6r Wannon spoke of a deputation which waited on me. I gave the paragraph to the press. The deputation asked that the duty be waived, and that they should be informed of it, so that they might be prepared to import ; but I told them that any alteration to the duty must first be announced in Parliament, so that every one would be on the same footing, and so that no one could get inside information, which some honorable members, apparently, consider they have in regard to this matter. </para>

                        <para>It appears that approval was given by the Administrator for the services of certain German officials of the late German administration to be retained in an advisory capacity for a period not exceeding three months. The Administrator has been informed that the services of such officials should not be extended unless it is impossible to replace them, and then that the extension should only be for such a period as will enable their replacement. The Administrator has been requested to telegraph a report in the matter, and such report is now awaited. </para>

                            <para>- In reference to the statements that have been made in connexion with the naval and military assistance rendered by Australia . in the present war, in comparison with that given by other Dominions, it has first to be remembered that Australia has provided a Fleet Unit, which has already played an effective part in the protection of British commerce and shipping in these seas, thereby relieving the Admiralty of the necessity of detaching ships from the North Sea for this purpose, and in assisting in the combined naval and military operations at Samoa and New Guinea. On the military side, 39,416 troops have been raised for service in Europe; 1,764 Naval Reservists and Infantry have taken part in operations in the Pacific; totalling 41,180. In addition to this, 56,298 of the Citizen Forces are armed and equipped, and the bulk of these have, in turn, been mobilized under active-service conditions for the defence of various parts of the Commonwealth. There are, in addition, 51,153 members of rifle clubs, and 16,000 recruits who have passed from the Senior Cadets; making a total of 67,153 reservists available for war; the grand total being 164,631 under arms. Of the above, the present Government have offered to the British Empire, and have raised, the following units - </para>

They are these: - A dispute certified to by the Registrar; all industrial disputes submitted to the Court by an organization by plaint; all industrial disputes which any State industrial authority refers to the Court; and all industrial disputes in regard to which the  President  has held a compulsory conference. Clause 3 amends section 19 by inserting . after the word &#34; organization &#34; the words &#34;or by an association registered for the time being as an organization.&#34; According to the definition section of the Act, an organization means any organization registered pursuant to the Act.

                        <para>- Under the civil law all sorts of safeguards are provided to prevent interference with the hearing of a case by a properly constituted tribunal. No person dare tamper with a witness nor with a jury. The general rule is that, while a case is pending, there shall be no interference with the tribunal which is to deal with it. It is highly dangerous for Parliament to interfere with the rights of parties in cases being heard by the Judiciary. I wish to know, therefore, whether the provisions to which I have referred will, if passed into law, interfere with any litigation now pending. It would be exceedingly dangerous for the Legislature to interfere in such a way. I do not suggest that anything personally improper is intended, but what is a right principle may be infringed. I suggest the insertion of a provision to this effect - </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to discuss in any way the merits of any case; but we know from the public press that a . case is pending, and I want the House to definitely assert the principle that legislation shall not apply to any pending litigation. Had the Bill been intended to apply to pending litigation, I presume that the Attorney-General would have told us so. My knowledge of him leads me to think that he would not wilfully have kept us in ignorance of the fact. The Bill as it stands may be open to the interpretation that it excludes from the consideration of the Court in the determination of a case now pending the question of the cancellation of the registration of an organization, because it declares that an association which is registered shall be deemed to have been duly registered. As regards the second issue I desire to raise, clause 10 strikes at the foundation of industrial organization. The object of our arbitration law is to provide for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. An industrial dispute is a dispute between employers and employes in an industry or industries with respect to remuneration and conditions of employment. Clause 10 permits the enrolment in an organization of persons who are neither employers nor employes in the industry with which that organization is connected. </para>

To permit such enrolment is contrary to the principle of our law. It would enable disputes to be created in an industry by persons in no way connected with that industry. All these matters that I have mentioned affect vital principles, and honorable members should have an opportunity to discuss them in detail in Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I make no apology for occupying time in the discussion of the motion to recommit the Bill for the reconsideration of certain cl.au ses in it. When I spoke on the motion for the second reading I was not fully aware of the immense reach and extraordinary effect of these clauses in regard to, not merely pending litigation, but also the whole operation of the arbitration law. We were told by the Attorney-General that the particular urgency on account of which the Bill was pressed forward last week had nothing to do with a case then pending, and now partly heard, in which the Australian Workers Union is concerned; that the urgency arose out of some conferences which were being held, or were about to be held, the members of which desired to know where they stood. </para>

                        <para>- I an. obliged by parliamentary  etiquette  to accept it, but I am not obliged to refrain from  commenting  on an extraordinary coincidence, and I shall do so. This is a matter concerning which it does not do for any of us to be mealy-mouthed. We must conform to the usages of Parliament, but we are not bound to cove. up facts which seem to me, at all events, to be very shocking. One of these facts is that, whilst a certain case is pending in the Courts, we have introduced into this House a Bill, the effect of certain clauses of which is to deal directly with the merits and the decision of that dispute. As the honorable member for Darling Downs has put it, this is the adoption of a principle which not only this Parliament, but, I believe, every British Parliament, has entirely refrained from following - the principle of interference, by amending legislation, with actions brought by citizens to test their rights before the Court? of the country. </para>

                        <para>- I am nob. concerned with the honorable member..  His  interjections are as unimportant as; he himself is. On the motion to recommit, these particular clauses, I am going to show what we are asked to do. There is a powerful association or combine - I venture to say that it is .the most active and powerful combine at present existing in Australia - which is known as the Australian Workers Union.  That combine is powerful, not only in the immense number of its members, but in the enormous political influence that it wields both inside and outside this Parliament. I do not exaggerate the facts one iota when I say that the political lives of  quite  a number of honorable members opposite lie. so to speak, in the hollow of the hands of this union. That being so, let us look at what is happening. This association - the Australian Workers Union - about the constitution of which I am going to speak in a moment, has registered itself under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I need hardly do more than remind honorable members of the principles under which that Act permits the registration of associations. Those principles were fought out before the High Court many years ago in what is known as the Jumbunna case. I hope the reference does not awaken any painful recollections in the mind of the honorable member for Henty. </para>

                        <para>- The whole question was then threshed out. It waa disputed by those opposed to the Jumbunna branch of the association that there was any constitutional power in the. Parliament to enable the organizations to be created and registered under the Act. That argument was not accepted. The Court unanimously came to the conclusion that associations consisting exclusively of employes on the one side, or of employers on the other, could be registered. It held that, although there is no power directly given under the Constitution to create or register a corporation of that  kind, yet the power given to the Parliament to legislate for the settlement of industrial disputes necessarily implied the power to enable associations of employers on the one hand, and of employes on the other, to meet together, to come to collective agreements, or to appear jointly instead of separately before the Courts which had to settle their disputes. That power was declared by the united decision of the Court to be confined to the creation or registration of associations limited strictly to the employes of an industry on the one side, and to the employers of an industry on the other. But what has taken place ? As is well known , the Australian Workers Union has, for a long time, purported to be a very wide one. No one will question that, if it chooses to embrace a very large number of correlated industries, it has a right to do so, provided that it brings in the employes only for the legitimate purpose of arbitration. But what has it done ? Either by persuasion or force - by that kind of persuasion which is exercised, as we all know, by these powerful associations - it has compelled hundreds of persons, who not only are not employes in the particular industries with which it is connected, but who are not employes in any industry, to join its ranks. Instead, of being a legitimate association for the purpose of obtaining industrial peace, or to enter into industrial agreements, it has become a huge political, octopus-like organization. </para>

                        <para>- The trouble is that such an association should claim registration under the Act. That is the particular claim, which in the Courts of this country, and under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, is being challenged by people who have a right to challenge it. I am going to point out what sort of an association this is which claims to be registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as representative of employe&#39;s. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Worker</inline> of 19th September, 1904, there appeared, on the inside of the red page, an advertisement containing a list of local agents. They are all members - under the rules of the association, they must be members - of the Australian Workers Union. </para>

                        <para>-  One of the clauses which it is proposed to recommit is clause 13, which says that every association which at the commencement of this Act is registered as an association shall be deemed to have been duly registered. I have referred to the Australian Workers Union by way of illustration, and I contend that this Bill is exactly the same, for the purpose of testing the measure of debate in this House, as if it had said &#34; the Australian Workers Union,&#34; which is included in the words &#34;every organization,&#34; &#34;shall be deemed to have been duly registered.&#34; Is there any rule of practice which prevents us from bringing forward arguments why that provision should not pass? </para>

I moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill with the object of ventilating one of these important questions which the honorable member for Darling Downs has introduced. </para>

                        <para>- However, I wish to avoid discussing the merits of the Bill, and to confine myself closely to the point of order. How is it possible for us to discuss clause 13 without inquiring what associations are to be affected, whether or not they have cases before the Court? I am not particularly interested in blocking the operations of the Arbitration Court. It is true that I do not believe in the Court as it at present works; but, while the Court exists, we should recognise it as an Australian institution, and let it perform its functions as well as possible. In my opinion, the time will come when the Court will disappear. </para>

                        <para>- Then the Attorney-General is not serious in pressing the urgency of the Bill? He has not given us the assurance which would render its passage comparatively easy, namely, that it will not affect the case before the Court. With great respect, I submit that the Attorney-General has made a mistake in raising the point of order. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has resumed the chair, and I should like permission to lay the point before him, in order that he may understand what has gone before. The honorable member for Flinders was criticising the Bill in relation to an amendment moved by the honorable member for Darling Downs to recommit certain clauses. When the honorable member for Flinders proceeded to analyze the constitution of the Australian Workers Union as one of the organizations to be dealt with under clause 13 - an association the registration of which will be validated if the Bill pass - the Attorney-General objected that&#39; it is an organization with a case before the Court, and that, therefore, it is neither decent nor proper to discuss it. </para>

                        <para>- One of the clauses which it is proposed to recommit is clause 13, which, in effect, provides that every association which has been registered under the Act - no matter how faulty or how illegal that registration may have been, or how far the rules of the association may be contrary to every canon of the Arbitration Act, and no matter what wrongs it may have committed - will have its registration validated at once. I wish to deal with one of these associations - the Australian Workers Union - which I believe to be the most important. My desire was to point out that this clause will validate, not only the rules, but the whole registration of the association. </para>

If the Attorney-General thinks that it is necessary to pass this clause at this moment, while the case is pending, he invites the House to discuss it. The Attorney-General cannot bring in a Bill the effect of which - never mind about a motive - is to direct the Court what to do in a particular case, and say to the House, &#34; You are gagged from discussing the very effect of the Bill &#34; - from discussing, not the decision in the case, but the position of this and other associations. </para>

                        <para>- If this case had not been before the Court, it would not affect the question. I suppose there are thirty or more associations involved, and, no matter what defect or irregularity there may have been in their registration, they are by this clause deemed to have been duly registered ; and I say that this particular association, the Australian Workers Union, is one which, in its registration, does not comply with the principles of the Act. </para>

Clause 13 says - &#34; Every association which, at the commencement of this Act, is registered as an organization, shall be deemed to have been duly registered.&#34; Looking at the Arbitration Act, we find that one of the conditions of registration, and part, of the registration, is the submission of the rules of the organization to the Registrar, who has to be satisfied that those rules comply with the Act. Now, when the honorable member subsequently comes down with a Bill, and says, &#34; No matter what those rules. may have complied with, or may not have complied with, whether they are legal or lawless, whether they are right or wrong, the registration shall be deemed to be valid,&#34; he not only validates the formal act of registration, but he completely sets up rules which had no foundation in right. </para>

                        <para>- Suppose you have an organization that contains within its rules not only a moral right for persons who are not employes at all to join, but also an. invitation to carriers, hotelkeepers, hairdressers, and all sorts of people, to join, and, therefore, is doing wrong; suppose that organization has been registered, and wrongly registered, then my contention is that this clause not merely validates the formal act of registration by the Registrar, but validates those wrong and unlawful rules. I do not think the Attorney-General will dispute that. </para>

                        <para>- In my humble opinion, it does validate them. I refer the Attorney-General to the sections in the Arbitration Act which require, as part of the registration, that the rules shall be submitted to the Registrar and approved by him. Section 55 is the most important part of the Act ; it is, in fact, the very essence of the Act. It provides that any association of employers in or in connexion with any industry, who have, in the aggregate, employed on an average not less than 100 employes in that industry, or, any association of not less than 100 employes in or in connexion with any industry, may be registered. Those are the persons entitled to be registered, but the rules must be submitted to the Registrar, and Schedule B, which has been altered from time to time, contains conditions intended to secure that. These are homogeneous unions of employers and employes respectively, and if they had not been unions of that kind, the High Court would never have held that they were entitled to registration at all. It is not because they are industrial or political associations, but because they are associations of employes for the purpose of meeting the employers before the Court that they are permitted to be registered. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Attorney-General ought to consult the Prime Minister again as to the law on the question. It seems to me that when you pass an Act of Parliament saying that every association which has been registered shall be deemed to have been validly registered every Court must obey that; even in pending cases as well as in future cases every decision of the Court must comply with that Act. </para>

I desire to make it clear that in passing this clause we are saying to the Court, &#34; So far as any particular association which may have been registered under this Act is concerned, and so far as its rules, which were registered, are concerned, no matter how wrong they are, no matter how oppressive, tyrannous, and unjust they may be, no matter how they may restrict the rights of other persons to enter the organization, no matter how they may go against every rule of the Act and every principle of justice, your hands are tied; that registration and those rules are validated.&#34; That is what the Bill is doing. </para>

                        <para>- With all respect to the Attorney-General,&#39; I cannot accept him as an authority. I cannot say that it is conclusive evidence until the power of the Court to cancel a registration has been exercised, and that clause 13 will not affect the power of the Court to cancel upon any ground whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has ruled that I am not permitted to enter into the discussion of the Australian Workers Union and its history. I simply conclude what I rose to say by putting this: First of all, by bringing in a clause which directs the Court as to what course it must take in regard to a disputed issue in a pending case, the Government are pursuing a course which, so far as I know, has never been followed by this Parliament or by any British Parliament. We are not allowed to discuss the effect of this provision on that particular case; but, in any event, the Government are validating all kinds of defective rules, and adopting a new principle which, in the future, if followed, will be mischievous in the highest degree to the proceedings of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - I thought that the Attorney-General would have said something upon the point raised. I have no desire to add anything to what has been so well put by those who have spoken from this side of the Chamber; but I wish to ask the Attorney-General to endeavour to explain the effect of clause 13. When I was perusing the Bill I did not make a note of this clause; but if I was absolutely convinced that the provision has a retrospective effect upon pending litigation, I would not say that it should find its way into any Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There &#34;is sufficient doubt on the point to justify this claus* being sent back to Committee. One of the chief reasons why this step should be taken is hinted at by the  Attorney-General.  He is relying on section 57 of the Act as indicating that this does not retrospectively and finally validate the registration of an organization, but that what is done is still subject to the power of the Court, which, in future, will be discretionary rather than compulsory. I confess that, on first looking at the provisions, I thought that this might be the effect, but the balance of my judgment now leans the other way. If the Attorney-General means something that may not be accomplished by the Bill, it&#39; is incumbent on the Government to send this clause back to Committee. If the impression of the Attorney-General as to the effect of this legislation is correct, that is, that it gives the Court the discretion, which is now obligatory upon it, to order that a registration may be cancelled for the causes mentioned in section 60 of the Act, if the Attorney-General thinks that the purport of the Bill is that the Court will still have the power, notwithstanding clause 13, to cancel the registration of a union that is already registered - seeing that this view has been assailed from this side of the House, we ought to have the clause sent back -to Committee, so that we may see whether the Government have attained their object. There is very grave doubt as to what the Bill does. Section 60, sub-section <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> says that, on an application for a cancellation of a registration, the Court  shall cancel the registration if it finds that the organization has been registered erroneously, or by mistake. The Bill, by clause 12, renders this power discretionary for the future. But in respect of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 60 - erroneous registration - clause 33 may take the power away. If we arc passing clause 13 in order to say that all organizations registered so far are to be deemed to be duly registered, the Court will want to know what is meant by this provision, and may say that it is intended to validate erroneous registration under section 60, sub-section <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> When we put a new provision into an Act, the Court must find some definite meaning for it which was not expressed by the original provisions of the measure. The Attorney-General says that by this clause we are not doing more than is done by section 57. </para>

                        <para>- That section declares that when a certificate is given by the Registrar that registration has been effected, it shall be deemed evidence of registration of the organization, and of the fact that the association has complied with the prescribed conditions entitling it to be registered - in other words, that it has filed rules in accordance with schedule b which have to be registered. It seems to me we cannot go beyond that. The proper rules have been submitted, and the Registrar has accepted them as in accordance with those required to be submitted under schedule b; all conditions have been complied with, but, nevertheless, that is not the final step. An application may still be made under section 60 on the ground that there has been erroneous registration. Now clause 13 says, in effect, that, on an application for the cancellation of registration on the ground that there has been an erroneous registration, the Court is compelled to hold that the registration has been duly done. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Flinders says that it cannot be done, so here we have two opinions upon the point, and, as discussion is limited at present, let us get into Committee and thresh the whole matter out. If the At- torney -General is mistaken, he is doing something that is open to the greatest condemnation on the grounds of policy, seeing that he is giving complete validity to a registration which affects a case pending in the Court. Does he wish to go to that length ? </para>

                        <para>- It is open to doubt At first, the clause did not strike me as having the complete retrospective aspect that some lawyers outside the House think it has. The Attorney-General may be wrong. He may be going much further in  retrospective  legislation than he intends, according to his own contention. Can we risk the Court holding that the view put forward by the honorable member for Flinders is right, and that we have passed legislation which, from the point of view of policy, both sides of the House would condemn? We should get into Committee to consider what we are doing. It is a. serious matter. When Courts are giving a meaning to a new provision of an Act the intent of which mav seem to be covered by a previous and still existent, section of the measure, such as section 57 in this case, they must hold that it. is intended to do something more than the previous section has done. Therefore, they will hold that the new provision practically validates any erroneous registration there may have been under section 60. </para>

The clause proposes to amend the principal Act by inserting in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 19 the words &#34; or by an association registered for the time being as an organization.&#34; What on earth is the meaning of that addition? Does it deal with an association that has no right to exist as such, but is temporarily registered for the purpose of taking the place of an organization ? </para>

                        <para>- I shall try to explain what the amendment really means. We have, first of all, to remember that the Act rests upon the principle, now generally accepted wherever civilized industry has manifested itself, that there are combinations of employes and combinations of employers. It is disputes between these combinations with which the Act deals. </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">It recognises those combinations of employes usually called unions. In order that a union may come within the purview of this Act, it is necessary that it should comply with its requirements. The first of these is that it must register. The requirements of the Act relating to registration are set out principally in Schedule b, with which I shall deal more particularly when I come to the consideration of clause 13 of the Bill. The position, shortly put, is that no organization can have any benefit, nor can the Act operate in respect of any organization of persons, except they are registered as an organization, or are proclaimed as such. Under section 19, the Court&#39;s jurisdiction is limited, so far as industrial disputes are concerned, to the classes that are set out in that section, and all that the amendment does is to say that disputes under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> which are submitted by plaint, shall not be outside the jurisdiction of the Court merely because some flaw or invalidity is subsequently found in the registration. This amendment is to give the Court cognisance of a dispute, notwithstanding that the registration of the organization concerned may subsequently bc found to be invalid, <inline font-style="italic">c.r/.,</inline> has been made by mistake, as under paragraph 6 of section 60. It does no more than that. It does not in any way, so far as I can see, affect any pending case. The necessity for the amendment has arisen from the fact that plaints have been filed by organizations whose registrations have been subsequently cancelled, with the result that their plaints have had to be withdrawn from the file, although the deregistration has not been the outcome of any fault on their part. In such a case an organization loses its place on the list. It has to file a new plaint, and takes its place at the bottom of the list of cases to be heard. This amendment is to enable the organization in such cases to retain its place - to give the Court cognisance of the dispute in so far as the invalidity or the informality of the act of registration would withdraw it from the cognisance of the Court. </para>

                <para>I come now to clauses 10 and 13. I shall deal, first of all, with clause 13, because the honorable and learned member for Flinders has, in particular, attacked it. I shall endeavour to explain what I conceive to be its meaning and its effect, both on pending cases and generally. Clause 13 cannot be looked at by itself. We must have regard to the whole Act, and in particular to sections 55, 57, and 60. Schedule b must also be looked at. Clause 13 of the Bill provides that - livery association which at the commencement of this Act is registered as an association shall be deemed to have been duly registered. </para>
                <para>There is no ambiguity about the words, but I am asked to apply my mind to their meaning. It is asserted that this amendment of the principal Act is improperly introduced at this stage if it applies to a pending case. That is one criticism. The other is an objection to its application to any case. I shall deal with both. It is said, first of all, that this provision ought not to be introduced now, because it applies to a pending case. It is urged that, if in any case before the Court, an organization has not been duly registered, and application is made to the Court in respect of that defect, the parties seeking redress will be treated unjustly by this amendment. I have been invited to insert in this Bill a proviso that this clause shall not apply to pending cases. Obviously, then, the gravamen of the criticism is directed against what is thought to be the retroactive effect of clause 13 on pending cases. It is alleged that such retrospective effect would be improper, unjust, and most unusual. Let us see, first of all, what effect clause 13 will have. As I have already said, the Court will not hear individuals; it will hear only associations or organizations. It will hear an association when it applies to be registered ; it will hear an organization where it files a plaint or applies for some relief that the Court can give. Section 57 lays down the conditions with which an organization applying for registration must comply. It says that - </para>
                <para>The Registrar shall issue to each organization registered under this Act a certificate of registration in the prescribed form, which certificate shall, until proof of cancellation, be conclusive evidence of the registration of the organization therein mentioned, and that it has complied with the prescribed conditions to entitle it to be registered. </para>
                <para class="block">The certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence upon two points - (1) that the registration itself has been effected, and (2) that the prescribed conditions have been complied with. The &#34; prescribed conditions &#34; are &#34;those set out in Schedule b to the Act. I invite honorable members to look at that schedule. A perusal of it will dispel a number of illusions or delusions - I shall use whichever is the less offensive term - which have arisen in connexion with this matter. One of the conditions of Schedule b is that every organization, before it is registered, must make rules satisfactory to the Registrar, and setting out, amongst other things, the powers and duties of the Committee and officers, removal of members and officers, control of Committee by members either of the whole or in district meetings, the mode in which industrial agreements shall be made, and so forth. Those conditions must be complied with before the Registrar will issue his certificate. His certificate is now conclusive evidence so far as compliance with these requirements is concerned, and of the fact of registration itself. </para>
                <para>I wish honorable members now to look at section 60. That section compels the Court to cancel the registration of any organization if it be shown to the Court that the organization has done, or failed to do, anything set forth in that section. The cancellation of registration has the effect of taking from an organization all the benefit of any award granted by the Court in respect of the industry with which it is connected. That is to say, if an award has given an organization improved conditions, and its registration is cancelled, then <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto</inline> the benefits under the award cease. Cancellation is the extreme penalty provided by this Act against an organization; it is, so to speak, the capital punishment of the industrial code. A Court, under section 60, as at present framed, has no discretion, but must cancel registration if it appears that for any of the reasons set out in the section it ought to be cancelled. If honorable members look at section 60, they will see that it sets out a number of reasons which compel the Court to order cancellation. Some of these reasons are good and weighty, while others are trivial, relating to forms and technicalities rather than to substance. Some of these disclose no real offence on the part of the organization; some, indeed, suggest, as is borne out by an examination of the cases, that the reason for cancellation may arise from the neglect, error, or act of the Registrar, or of the Court itself. For instance, if, under sub-section <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> an organization has been registered erroneously the Court must order the registration to be cancelled - there is no option. As I before pointed out when addressing the House at an earlier stage, the Court in the Actors case was compelled to do what it called a stupid act of injustice in cancelling the registration. </para>

                        <para>- No ! What I have stated is the present position. Under section 57, the certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence of two things - one that the organization has been registered, and the other that there has been compliance with the provisions of sub-section b ; but if, on an application by any party under section 60, the Court is satisfied that any one of the counts in that section has been made out, the registration is cancelled accordingly - there is no option. If clause 13 of the Bill would amount to an estoppel, then section 57 of the Act would act similarly. But it does not do so. The effect of clause 13 has now to be considered. In my opinion, it is very simple. This clause, first of all, does not impair or lessen in any way the powers of the Court under section 60; every one of the causes for which registration can now be cancelled will apply under the clause. </para>

                        <para>- Let me first elaborate my argument. The effect of clause 13 is not, in any way, to impair the powers of the Court under section 60; all it does is to amplify the position under section 57. Whereas, under section 57, the certificate of registration only amounts to conclusive evidence that the conditions in sub-section <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> have been complied with, under clause 13 other things necessary to effectively register the organization also will be deemed to have been done. Under section  57  the certificate of the Registrar is conclusive evidence of two things - of the fact of registration and of compliance with sub-section <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> Clause 13 is not conclusive evidence, but is <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence, which may be rebutted in a proper case. In any event, the clause only goes to the point of saying that the act itself of registration has been effectual, and the clause aims at that and nothing else. Now I come to the effect of clause 13 on section 60 of the Act, and, in particular, on sub-section 6. It is contended oy the honorable member for Angas, and admitted by me, that if the clause affects any part of clause 60, it affects subsection 6, clearly the weakest of the clause. Upon a fair review of section 60, and in fair interpretation of its meaning, the contention that the effect of clause 13  is  to limit the power of the Court in this respect is not upheld. Clause 13 merely says that the act of registration is effectual. Although an organization has been registered, it may have been registered erroneously; and it is the mere act and fact of registration that clause 13 validates, and not the consequences of erroneous registration. </para>

                <para>I now come to clause 10, which deals with the amendment of section  55  of the principal Act. This clause enables persons not employed in the industry to become members of an association. It has been said that this clause violates the basic principle of arbitration; and in support of this the Jumbunna case was quoted. It is true that in the Jumbunna case it was laid down as the opinion of the Court that a dispute within the meaning of the Act and Constitution could only arise between employer and employe, the dispute being one in respect to contractual relations between employer and employed. That, I admit, was the decision of the Court, but it is wrong to infer that there is any constitutional sanction for such a limitation of the powers of this Parliament. When we desire to know the meaning of the words &#34; arbitration and conciliation &#34; we have to consider what that meaning was in 1900, when the Constitution received the sanction of the British Parliament, What was the practice of trade unions in England at that time? I am absolutely amazed at the contention raised here, apparently in good faith, that this provision is a violation of the basic principle of arbitration, and that persons not actively engaged in an industry should not be admitted as members of an organization. Do honorable members not know that the fight of trade unions in Great Britain, from the time that those unions toddled from their cradles up to the present, has been to escape the consequences of the influence and power exerted by the employers to crush the efforts of working men to combine ? Every one knows that the steps of infant organizations are followed persistently and relentlessly by many employers, and every man who takes office in such an organization is either dismissed or suffers in pocket or status. No fact is better established than that trade unions  have for very many years had for officials men who were not actively engaged in the industry. As an instance, let me take the case of Thomas </para>
                <para class="block">Burt, who was a representative of the Northumbrian coal miners, and a member of the British Parliament long before 1900. Perhaps, however, I can settle this question in a far simpler way by leaving it to the honorable member for Parramatta to say whether it was not the practice in his time for the secretaries of organizations - perhaps of his own organization, but certainly generally - to be men who had to be withdrawn from active employment in the industry. In no other way can a great organization be carried on. There are two reasons, both of them sufficient, why this should be so. A man working in a mine for eight hours is in no condition when he comes to the surface again to address himself to the labour of his secretarial office. The working man following his usual avocation has neither sufficient time nor energy to manage the business of an organization with, perhaps, 5,000, or even 10,000 members. The right honorable member for Parramatta has been secretary of an organization, just as I have. </para>

                        <para>- Neither did I. I never received a penny in my life from any organization of which I have been secretary ; but that has nothing to do with the argument. I say deliberately, and the honorable member knows it perfectly well, that there are two reasons, both of them sufficient, why this practice must necessarily be the woof and warp of the industrial fabric. Both those reasons arise out of the circumstances of the case. One is that a great organization demands the whole time and energy of an officer; the second is that, if we did not adopt the principle of having as secretary one who was not an employe in the industry, the  organization  would be in great danger of being beheaded every time an official act was committed. Mark you, the purpose of an organization&#39;s existence is to demand something from the employers which they would not otherwise readily grant. It is the interests of the employers to penalize the officers of the workers&#39; organization, and they do it by marking them down and watching their opportunity of dismissing or disrating them. When the Constitution came into force, the principle had been well established, for half a century in Great Britain, that the officers of the organizations were not persons then actively engaged in the industry. I say, therefore, that if the Court of Arbitration stands by the letter of the bond, and says that no organization can be registered which includes any person not actively engaged in the industry, there is not one organization from Dan to Beersheba, .not one throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, that can register under the Act. To say, therefore, that the Court will, by its interpretation of the Constitution and this Act, deliberately frustrate the purpose for which the Court was established is monstrous. Such a contention is against the well-settled doctrines that underlie the interpretation of Statutes. The Court will not do it, because I say, deliberately, there can be no arbitration, and no room for the exercise of the Court&#39;s powers, if it be held that no one shall become a member of -an organization unless he is actively engaged in the industry. If that be the law, then let us say good-bye to arbitration. The one essential thing for arbitration and the conduct of modern industrial organizations of workers is that they shall be free to engage as officers such persons as they please, men who will be absolutely free from the influence of the employers. So that, instead of clause 10 being opposed to the well-settled principles of arbitration, it is entirely compatible with them, and neither the Constitution nor the Act can in any way conflict with those principles. </para>

That is sound nrac.tice, and it is one which the English Courts have almost  invariably  followed. But the whole thing turns on the application of that principle, and particularly its application to what is known as procedure as opposed to substantive law.

Although to make a law for punishing that which, at the time when it was done, was not punishable, is contrary to sound principle: a law which merely alters the procedure may, with perfect propriety, be made applicable to past as well as future transactions; <inline font-style="italic">and no</inline> secondary meaning is to be sought for an enactment of_such a kind. No person has a vested right in any course of procedure. He has only the right of prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time being, by or for the Court in which he sues; and if an Act of Parliament alters that mode of procedure, he has no other right than to proceed according to the altered mode. The remedy does not alter the contract or the tort; it takes away no vested right, for the defaulter can have no vested right in a state of the law which left the injured party without, or with only a defective, remedy. If the time for pleading were shortened, or new powers of amending were given, it would not be open to the parties to gainsay such a change; the only right thus interfered with being that of delaying or defeating justice; a right little worthy of respect. </para>

There is no authority to suggest that view; but be this as it may, the matter is not worth discussing, for the point under section 10 of the Building Societies Act of 1894 is conclusive. I read that section as enacting that after the 25th of August, 1894, no matter what any Court may have said about dissolution or winding-up - from and after that day, when any society is being dissolved or wound up, no advanced member shall be called upon to pay his debt otherwise than according to his contract.

                <para class="block">It was held that the legislation applied, and the prisoner was tried under the amended law, and was convicted. Then, in <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> Vol. 14, 1912, in the King and the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth against the Associated Northern Collieries, it was held that evidence then before the Court, but not available under the law as it stood when the proceedings were instituted, would apply to that case, and it was so applied. That, briefly, is my answer to the criticism directed against the measure. The alterations of the law proposed are alterations in procedure : they do not take away any rights, they do not prevent the Court from doing justice: they do not limit the penalties of any party in any case now proceeding. </para>
                <para>I see no reason why the Bill should be recommitted. An attempt has been made to show that these amendments have been introduced for the purpose of interfering with the course of justice, and that they have application to pending cases. All I have to say is that no attempt has been made to show, or if an attempt has been made it has failed, that these amendments are not in themselves desirable. No one has ventured to say for a moment that it is right that the discretion of the Court shall be taken away, so that the Court shall be compelled to do a stupid act of injustice, or that registration shall not be cancelled on good cause. No one has attempted to deal with the position that will be created if the point be sustained that no organization ought to contain any person who is nob actually employed in the industry. That position would be frankly a state of industrial chaos. We have heard, times out of number, reasons why any attempt to increase the ambit of the Arbitration Court should be opposed. We have heard that the Act should not extend to the rural industry, and that the Court should not have power to make a common rule ; but no man has yet dared to rise in this chamber and say that the Act should not apply to shearers. We have had every destructive argument that can be brought against the Bill bolstered up by the excuse that what was intended by the Convention was to apply arbitration to shearers and maritime organizations; yet now they propose to prevent these organizations coming under the Act! As for the maritime &#39; organizations, I may speak with freedom, and I say that an application lodged against them must succeed if section 55 bc not amended, because my own organization contains not twenty, or thirty, but literally thousands of persons who do not follow the occupation of the majority of the members of the organization; they are nomads; they are wharf labourers in the summer; they are elsewhere in the winter. Yet, if the contention of honorable and learned members can be sustained, all these men are improperly members of the organization. The honorable and learned member for Darling Downs maintains that there is objection to lawyers becoming members of unions. I know of no objection to a lawyer becoming a member of a  union,  any more than to a wharf labourer being admitted as a member of the Bar. What we have to consider is the welfare of the public, and the maintenance of industrial peace ; and I invite honorable members to say how either is impaired or threatened by any of the amendments in the Bill. On the other hand, I ask them to tell me how either is to be maintained if the law be not amended. We have heard very much about rumour; let us hear a little about great principles, so far as they affect the community. Let us hear how the Court is to carry on, and how organizations are to register when they are denied the very means by which they live, and without which they could not exist for twenty-four hours. The Bill is necessary ; it impairs no right; it inflicts injustice upon no man. It is introduced for the purpose of amending obvious inconsistencies and insufficiencies of the law. </para>

                        <para>- But we must look at the matter broadly. There are members of organizations who are not engaged in the industries connected with those organizations. The Australian Workers Union has about 60,000 members, and perhaps 1 per cent, of those members are not following the industry; while I suppose that the Wharf Labourers Union has about 10 per cent., the wharf labourer&#39;s work being irregular. The officers of an organization are as necessary as are staff officers to an army : the business could not be run without them. If it can be shown that any of these persons can use their powers to the detriment of the public, a position will be established that must be considered. That they happen to be not engaged in the industry is nothing, for the basie principle of industrial organization depends upon these officers being free from the influence of employers. I see no reason why the Bill should be recommitted. </para>

                    <para>. - As I know nothing of any pending law-suit, I am quite unable, even if I were permitted, or had the desire, to discuss the merits of any such action. The desire from this side of the House has been to discuss the principle involved in certain clauses of the Bill, a principle which is of a grave and serious character. That retrospective legislation is intended by the Bill is admitted, and whether that legislation is to seriously affect any suits, or whether its effect in that respect will be of a more or less trifling character, is of little moment at the  pre-sent  time. The object of honorable mem- <inline font-style="italic">hers</inline> is not to assess the value of the legislation in that regard; their object is to discuss the serious principle involved, because, although possibly the effect may for the moment be only of a trifling character,  once  the principle of retrospective legislation is admitted, it may be of grave and serious moment in another case. I approach the matter from that stand-point. Clause 13 is, on the face of it, retrospective, and I strongly urge that the Attorney-General does not answer our contentions when he suggests that it will only bring about a trifling advantage to existing organizations which are irregularly registered. The words &#34; shall be deemed to have been duly registered &#34; have a clear and conclusive meaning. The Court must take for granted that everything required by the law in connexion with the registration has been actually done, therefore making the registration valid. The Attorney-General unwittingly misled the House when he said that all that the clause means is that a union has been <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> registered. If the Attorney-General would insert words saying that an organization shall be held by the Court to have been <inline font-style="italic">,, ......:- / facie</inline> registered&#34; he would get rid of a large amount of the criticism that has been launched against clause 13, because it does not say that the Court shall simply regard an organization as having been &#34; <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> registered &#34; ; on the contrary, it means that the association has absolutely and completely been validly registered. When retrospective legislation is attempted, it is usual and proper to expressly exempt litigation which has been honestly started under the existing law. When a man starts proceedings upon advice given under the existing law, he may go to large expense in preparing his case and presenting it to the Court. All that expense is involved under the existing law by a man who is engaged in endeavouring to enforce his rights as they exist under the law.  His  lawyers advise him, not as to prospective legislation, but as to the existing law. He goes to large expense in order to enforce his rights under the existing law, and if it should be held to be proper and usual for Parliament to introduce legislation altering those rights under the existing law, a very grave injustice would be done to him. Let me deal with the matter from a strictly parliamentary point of view. If it is possible for a Government to take advantage of its majority to pass retrospective legislation of this kind, the most serious abuses may occur. I do not suggest that anything of that nature is occurring now; but if, for example, a Liberal Administration were to attempt to validate the registration of an employers&#39; organization which was obviously defective, it would be guilty of a gross misuse of power, and I can fancy what my honorable friends opposite would have to say about the matter. Any Government so short-sighted as to take a course of that kind would make a grave mistake. A seat in Parliament might be more or less shaky because of some irregularity, but if the principle now contended for by the Government were recognised, it would be possible for the Administration of the day to introduce a Bill to validate the position of a supporter, thus doing an injustice to the opposing candidate and his party. These considerations are not to be ignored. The Attorney-General quoted from Maxwell <inline font-style="italic">On the Interpretation of Statutes,</inline> a recognised authority, but he could not find in that work any passage justifying interference with existing litigation. Parliament has the right to alter procedure at any time; but it must not inflict grave injustice by interfering with the vested interests of those who have honestly entered into litigation for the protection of their rights under the existing law. Maxwell does not suggest that there can be any justification for interference with pending law suits, or with vested rights created by them. On the contrary, he says that a law must be made specifically applicable to such rights if it is intended to affect them. This passage is to be found on page 360 - </para>

                <para class="block">The Bill shows a clear intention &#34; to vary such rights.&#34; It is admitted that its effect will be to validate the registration of an organization which is now invalid. The Attorney-General, in referring to section 57 of the principal Act, omitted to emphasize its vital feature. The section provides that the Registrar shall issue to each organization registered under the </para>
                <para class="block">Act a certificate of registration in the prescribed form, which certificate shall, until proof of cancellation, be conclusive evidence of the registration of the organization and of its compliance with the prescribed conditions entitling it to be registered. It is specifically provided that the certificate is to be evidence of registration only until proof of cancellation. Section 60, which provides for cancellation, is being deliberately amended. Under that section, as it stands, if it appears to the Court, on the application of any organization, or person interested, or of the Registrar, that, for any reasons, the registration of an organization ought to be cancelled, or that an organization has been registered erroneously, or by mistake, the registration may be cancelled. Clause 13 would be a complete answer to proceedings for cancellation under section 60(6) contemplated under section 57. The Bill, therefore, amends that provision. I believe there are cases in which organizations have been erroneously registered. An organization may be composed of persons who have no right to belong to it, and may be registered erroneously. Although at present such registration could be cancelled, yet from the moment of passing this Bill, cancellation is to be impossible. This will affect existing registrations. To suggest that the amendment is only supplemental to section 57 is to put a wrong construction upon it, because the registration under the principal Act is valid only until proof of cancellation, and the Bill prevents cancellation by providing that an organization which has been registered, although improperly registered, shall be deemed to be properly registered. An organization which attempts to assert rights given to it by the existing law should not be interfered with in its litigation ; its rights should not be affected by legislation of a retrospective character introduced in the midst of legal proceedings. </para>

If we are careful in that regard no such injustice as I have referred to can accrue from the alteration of the law, because all who are not litigants will be on the same footing. I am arguing, not against any proposal to simplify or to facilitate registration, but against retrospective legislation affecting persons engaged in litigation for the protection of their rights under the existing law. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know; that may be so. Nevertheless, we should not affect existing litigation. If we do not recognise the rights of litigants, we shall do a grave injustice, and our action may have serious effects in the future. The Attorney-General tells us that what is meant by the Bill is that the registration is to be regarded only as <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of due registration. I say, without hesitation, that it does not mean that. If honorable members read the Bill, they will see that it means that the registration shall be absolutely valid and incapable of being attacked under section 60 (6). The Bill, being capable of a far graver and more serious construction, the Attorney-General should pay heed to the representations that are being made regarding it, and remove any possible ambiguity. With regard to clause 10, section 55 of the principal Act is amended by it to permit the enrolment in organizations of persons who are not employers or employes in the industries with which those organizations are connected. It has been contended from this side of the House that that amendment completely violates the fundamental principles of our arbitration law. Under section 55 any of the following associations or persons may, on compliance with the prescribed conditions, be registered - </para>

                        <para>- The law is one for the settlement of industrial disputes, and contemplates organizations of employers and employes in our various industries. If publicans, hairdressers, and others not connected with an industry are allowed to be members of an organization, they may come to dominate that organization, and a gross injustice may thus be done to <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> members of that industry. The Act is for the settlement of industrial disputes in an industry, and was not passed to affect persons outside the industries concerned. Therefore, clause 10 violates the fundamental principle of the Act and its spirit and intention. Good and substantial reasons have been given for the recommittal of the Bill for the reconsideration of all these clauses. </para>

                    <para>This is a small measure, the necessity for which has arisen out of the war, and I do not think that it will call for much discussion. Those who were members of the first Parliament will recollect that the original Customs Bill was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> C. Kingston, then Minister of Trade and Customs, and was generally regarded as a model of what Customs legislation should be. Under section 112 of that Act it was provided that certain articles, namely, all arms, explosives, military and naval stores, the export of which was prohibited by proclamation, should be prohibited exports. In 1910, when I was dealing with the question of prohibited exports, I found it necessary to add to that section by providing that the Governor-General should have power by proclamation to prohibit the exportation of any goods - </para>

This Bill consists really of one clause, and is designed to widen the powers conferred by section 112 of the principal Act. It provides that - </para>

                            <para>- I should have thought that in war time the Minister could do practically anything he pleased in this direction. I do not wish to limit him with respect to any power that he thinks necessary for the defence and wellbeing of the Empire; but I think it is a sound and salutary rule that when an Executive asks for further powers it should justify the granting of those powers. Surely the powers of the Minister are large enough under the Act as it stands. I thought that the Act made him a sort of administrative Czar, if I may use that word without being misunderstood. </para>

I do not object to give the Minister any power that is necessary for the proper discharge of his functions, but he ought to show some justification for such plenary and sweeping authority. I often think it is good for Australia that we have honest Ministers, because we are aggregating and centralizing their powers more and more every day: and I can conceive of nothing that so paves the way for a future bureaucracy than the Bills we are passing time after time. At the rate we are going on, there would scarcely be any powers left for independent exercise by this Parliament. </para>

However, the Law officers have persuaded the Minister that the Bill is necessary; and I suppose there is nothing left but to pass it.

                        <para>. - I think the Minister ought to consider the wording of this clause. It is provided that, in time of war, the Governor-General may issue a proclamation, but it is not set forth that the proclamation shall cease to operate at the termination of the war. However, it is merely a matter of drafting. </para>

Those latter proclamations set forth that, in the opinion of the Governor-General, the exportation of certain commodities mentioned would be harmful to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt these proclamations could operate longer than the war; but the intention is that they shall cease as soon as the  necessity  is removed. There is certainly no desire to hamper trade by continuing them longer than is absolutely imperative. The prohibitions of exportation contemplated by the Bill are necessary, and it is considered by the Law authorities that there is not sufficient power to enforce them under the law as it stands. Honorable members may rest assured that, as soon as the war is over, the prohibitions will be removed. At present the exportation of wheat is prohibited, and every one will agree that that is absolutely necessary, even, perhaps, independently of the war. Then, for similar reasons, the export of flour is stopped, because it would be absurd to prohibit one without the other. The exportation of meat is absolutely prohibited to certain places, and to all places without the consent of the Minister. The exportation of sugar is prohibited altogether, except with the consent of the Minister, and only some very small shipments, in some cases under a hundredweight, are being allowed, some of them to the islands. The exportation of mares is stopped, because, otherwise, it might be difficult to obtain remounts for the troops. The exportation of coal to certain places is prohibited, because it is considered that it might fall into undesirable hands. Then again, we have stopped &#39;the exportation of sheepskins, hides, graphite, and rubber. </para>

The fact that so little friction has been caused shows that the powers, which, as has been said, place the Minister in a position of almost a bureaucrat, have not by any means been used harshly. </para>

                        <para>. - It is very desirable that some such powers should be exercised by the Government in cases of emergency, considering that Parliament may not be sitting at the time when immediate action is necessary. During war time the Executive have the whole responsibility, and must, therefore, have ample powers. I do not know, however, that the Minister quite appreciates the objection raised by the honorable member for Angas, who suggests that the Bill should show on its face that a proclamation shall be operative only during the continuance of the war. The provision is that a proclamation may be issued during war time, but there is nothing to prevent it continuing after the war is over. This is a matter which the Minister might take into consideration. </para>

                    <para class="block">The grounds for this amendment are the same as those urged for the power to prohibit the exportation of certain goods during the time of war. In the early stages of the European conflict, particularly, we were faced in Australia with serious interruption to our industries, and consequent unemployment. For instance, the honorable member for Darling Downs, when Minister of Customs, had to deal with the question of the importation of cement, a very serious shortage of which was threatened. The main supplies had been previously obtained from Germany and Belgium ; but those supplies were suddenly stopped owing to the war, and unemployment was threatened in every direction because building operations had been brought to a stand-still. Cement supplies could be obtained from New Zealand; but, although the ex-Minister, and the present Minister of Trade and Customs, were requested to allow New Zealand cement to be imported on the same basis as British cement, both had to confess inability to do so, owing to the stiff conditions of the Customs Act. The Australian cement factories were quite unable to meet the demands made upon them, and all that was asked was that, temporarily, the duties on New Zealand cement should be suspended so as to allow employment to continue. The fact that the Minister had no power to act in connexion with this one item, threw hundreds of men out of employment; and to-day, building operations, if not entirely suspended, are largely curtailed and interrupted. The power I seek to give in this amendment is not unusual. In the early stages of the war, the Imperial Government decided to suspend certain duties, and other European countries, and the United State of America did likewise. In the Customs Act. the Minister is given a considerable amount of discretionary power to admit machine tools, machinery that cannot be produced in the Commonwealth, tools of trade for the use of artisans, models of invention, scientific instruments, theatrical costumes, trophies, &#38;c. Australia is now faced with the possibility of a shortage of wheat for home consumption during the coming season, and I say that the Minister or the Government ought to have, and a courageous Government would take, power to suspend or remit duties where the necessities of life are concerned. In normal times the necessity to operate that power would not arise, but in these abnormal times we are faced with shortages in several articles that are urgently required to maintain our industries, as well as in certain foodstuffs of the people. Yet, no Minister has power to suspend or remit duties in order to allow our industries to be carried on, or the food supplies of the people to be maintained. </para>

                            <para>- In time of war, there should be no limit to the power possessed by the Minister and the Government, especially with respect of those things which are necessary for the employment and food supply of the people. But, while the Minister may have unlimited power, his discretion is expected to operate. There is a world of difference between the possession of a power and the operation of it. Our experience during the last few months should be sufficient to convince honorable members of the necessity of some law which would allow the Minister or the Government to admit, under an arrangement of the Customs duties, either by suspension or remission, articles necessary to continue employment and secure the food supplies of the people. I notice that it is estimated that the wheat harvest will be 2,000,000 bushels short of Australia&#39;s requirements for her own people. </para>

                        <para>. - No honorable member will doubt the sincerity of the honorable member for Brisbane in moving this amendment, but provisions like this lead to transgressions of every kind, and such a temptation ought not to be put in the way of any Minister, no matter whom. The amendment refers to the doing of certain things in time of war. What war - a little war or a big war? Wars are always taking place,- and they may be large or small. A small war in one place might only affect us in a minor degree, but the opportunity would be presented for interested parties to say that certain protected articles were affected, and that the Minister ought to take a certain course of action. The place to determine alterations of the Tariff is on the floor of the House, where everybody can be heard, and the evidence for and against determined.  There will be anomalies  under every  law we pass, and this is not  the way to amend them. I suggest to  the  honorable member that he should withdraw his amendment. In all probability, he will have an early opportunity of dealing with the matter when the Tariff is  before  the House. </para>

                        <para>. - I should think that the moving appeal of the Prime Minister ought to have some effect upon the honorable member for Brisbane; but if I were in his place, I should certainly resent the condescension of the right honorable gentle- man, who has practically told the mover of the amendment that he does not know what he is about, although he is sincere. In fact, the Prime Minister says that, in regard to fiscal matters, the honorable member is a simpleton. I can see a great many difficulties raised by the honorable member&#39;s amendment. One that is outstanding is the meaning of the words &#34; raw material.&#34; The raw material of one industry is the finished product of another industry. For instance, it has been suggested that bananas should be free in order to assist pastrycooks and restaurants. </para>

Timber is the raw material for the building of houses. We know that the building trade all over Australia is terribly depressed. Are we to allow timber to come in free for the purpose of stimulating house building and giving employment in the building trade, where unemployment is very keen at the present time ?

I wish he would tell  us, because I am anxious to free the raw material of any industry, as far as it can possibly be freed, but the advice that the Prime Minister gave to the honorable member a little while ago, that he had better leave the matter until we can deal with the Tariff, was wise. We cannot take off or put on duties in regard to raw material without affecting many items in the Tariff. We can never tell when a product, the application of brains and the ingenuity of man, is the raw material or the finished product. As iron leaves <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins&#39;</inline> works, it is a finished product, but when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker</inline> buys it to build his engines at Maryborough, it is his&#39; raw material. And so the whole thing goes on right through the ramifications of the industrial world. The plough is the raw material of the farmer. Would the honorable member free all ploughs? I cannot vote for an amendment such as this. I must know what it means. </para>

                        <para>.- Because this is one of the most dangerous amendments that I have ever had the pleasure of reading since I have been in this Parliament, and because of the freedom it allows to the Minister of Trade and Customs, I propose to help the honorable member for Brisbane in having it accepted. It would be one of the best provisions ever invented or circumvented and put in a Bill, because it would open the back door to some of the best trickery possible under any Customs Act. </para>

The honorable member poses as a real red-hot Protectionist, and yet he brings in the very best Free Trade provision that could be put into any Tariff Bill or any Bill relating to Customs. We, as members of this Parliament, must guard more than anything else against allowing any one man to play tricks with the Excise or Customs Tariff. At present the Minister has no power to remit or increase duties. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta has shown numerous commodities that would be brought under the amendment, particularly sugar. No industry in Australia needs protecting more than the sugar industry. The effect of a provision must not be taken from what an honorable member means, but from what the provision says as interpreted by the High Court. According to our Justices of the High Court, Acts do not mean what we meant them to mean when we passed them; after they have been reviewed by the High Court they bear quite a different complexion. The honorable member would not like the idea of the duty being removed from sugar. </para>

                <para class="block">As honorable members are aware, a considerable number of private telephone lines have been resumed by the Department, but many of them have not yet been paid for. The Act which was passed in 1911 to permit of their resumption provided that when an arrangement could not be come to between the Department and the owners of a line, the amount of compensation was to be settled by arbitration under the laws of the State in which the line was situated. That system has been found so unsatisfactory that we wish to alter it. A case was submitted to arbitration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand,</inline> K.C., acting as arbitrator, and a barrister appearing for each party. The arbitrator awarded the sum of &#163;60, but he gave no reasons for his decision, so that there was no basis on which to build future settlements, and the costs which the Department had to pay amounted to about &#163;300, or five times the amount of the award. Arbitration has therefore not proved a cheap method, and, as there is about &#163;15,000 worth of property to be resumed, the Department feel justified in asking Parliament to sanction a more efficient method. The proposal is that when an agreement cannot be arrived at a Justice of the High Court shall decide the matter. By this method we shall obtain, in the reasons supporting a decision, a basis on which to found other settlements, and thus, perhaps, avoid litigation. At any rate, we shall have some statement of principle to guide us. </para>

                        <para>. - The method of settlement provided in the Bill resembles the application of a steam hammer to crack a nut. The legislation of 1911, which it is now proposed to amend, was brought in by the party now in power, which provided for the settlement of disputes by arbitration, in accordance with the laws of the State in which each particular line happened to be situated. The method has not proved successful, it having cost &#163;300, the Minister tells us, to obtain a settlement of a case in which only &#163;60 was awarded. The Minister complains that no statement of principles was obtained from the arbitrator which would serve for guidance in other cases; but that was to be expected, because the laws of the States differ, and the arbitration provided for was to be in accordance with six different laws. Many persons are disposed to pass by Courts of justice which are presided over by men who are trained for the work of deciding questions at issue, and to employ arbitrators who are not so trained, and who often try to satisfy both parties by splitting the difference between the amount claimed and the amount offered, thus pleasing no one. By using the Courts we save arbitrators fees and obtain the services of skilled adjudicators - of men trained to seek and apply settled and definite principles. But why should the disputes which may arise in connexion with the purchase of private telephone lines be referred to the Justices of the High Court, whose time is already so fully occupied ? The Lands Acquisition Act lays down certain definite principles of valuation. No doubt it would be more difficult to do that in regard to the resumption of personalty all over Australia. Many of the private lines that are being purchased may be merely bush telephones. Certainly great latitude must be allowed. In many cases the disputes could be settled locally by a police magistrate or a County Court Judge. </para>

                            <para>- If the question of compensation is to he decided by a Justice of the High Court, it seems to me that claimants will have to ask themselves whether it is worth while fighting the Department. A claimant at Geraldton would have to take his witnesses to Perth, which is visited only twice a year by a Justice of the High Court, and would incur great expense in securing the settlement of his case, which might be readily dealt with by a County Court Judge or resident magistrate sitting in the district concerned. J do not think that the Minister will get any satisfaction from this measure. Where the amount involved is comparatively small there should be power to have the question settled by reference to a police magistrate or County Court Judge. That would be a more expeditious and satisfactory means of settlement for both parties than will be possible under the Bill as it stands. We have no guarantee that in any one case any clear lines can be laid down by the High Court which will be applicable to every other case. </para>

                            <para>- I have every admiration and respect for the commission of the peace, but I should prefer to have any case with which I was connected definitely decided by a trained mind, accustomed to sift evidence. At the same time I recognise that we are deeply indebted to the justices of the peace throughout Australia for the vast amount of honorary work they do, and I believe that the administration of justice could not be carried on satisfactorily without them. The Land Tax Assessment Act originally provided for a reference to Justices of the High Court, but it was found necessary to amend it so as to provide for certain cases being dealt with by County Court Judges. I think that the Postmaster-General will find it advisable to adopt a similar course in this instance. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot conceive of a clumsier piece of machinery being set up for a purpose of this kind than that for which this Bill provides. I am amazed to find the Postmaster-General unable to look at this matter from the point of view of the man outside. If I had a telephone I would give it up without any compensation rather than submit myself to the possibilities under this Bill. Costs and compensations are at the discretion of the Justices, and a Justice may, if he thinks fit, submit a case in writing for the opinion of the High Court. Where these proceedings are to end I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- If a matter be of sufficient importance to warrant its going to the Full Court, it is of sufficient importance to send on to the Privy Council. This Bill, therefore, involves such a possibility as the honorable member suggests. I hope that the Postmaster-General, in view of all his experience in the settlement of disputes, will make some other proposal. Whatever may be said of arbitration, the matter dealt with by this Bill is in its very essence one for compromise and mutual arrangement. I marvel at my honorable friend&#39;s readiness to rush into litigation with such facility as this Bill suggests. If he desires these questions to be settled, he had better keep away from the High Court, and confine himself to some simpler tribunal, which there ought to be no difficulty in setting up, to deal with these cases. I should prefer to see lawyers excluded from all matters of this kind. A simple arbitration, without the assistance of any one requiring fees, should be all that is necessary. If the Postmaster-Generalwill not agree to that, then I hope he will adopt the suggestion that a police magistrate be allowed to settle any question of compensation. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the Postmaster-General will give further consideration to this measure. To my mind it should be entitled &#34;A Bill to enable the Department to take over telephones at the Department&#39;s own valuation.&#34; Any person whose telephone service the Department may desire to take over will have to accept the valuation of the departmental officers, unless he is prepared to go to the expense of an appeal to the High Court. Claimants might reside hundreds of miles from the places at which the Court sits, and their going there would involve very great cost. It should be an easy matter for the Minister to submit a fairer and more reasonable proposal than is this Bill for the determination of these questions of compensation. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable members, in their criticism of this Bill, have overlooked a number of facts. It is not anticipated that every claimant will be required to take his case into Court. As the law stands at present, however, if people find that they can obtain from an arbitrator, without incurring any cost, considerably more than their service is worth, then they all desire to go to arbitration. What we wish is to obtain a test case, the decision of which will serve as a guide. </para>

                        <para>.- This Bill will have to be entirely recast before it can be permitted to go through. It is a Bill, setting up the costliest and most dilatory procedure, for the purpose of dealing with small local matters. It will by no means get the Government out of their trouble, but will, on the other hand, provoke more litigation than it will prevent. It is absurd to drag such cases to the High Court, and to suggest that a Judge should himself state a case for that Court. </para>

                            <para>- If the telephones are of no value, why all this elaborate machinery? The whole proposal is absurd. The Postmaster-General &#34;lets the cat out of the bag&#34; when he says that the other side have been doing too well, and that he will force them to the other process before the High Court unless they take what is offered. That is not arbitration, but pure unadulterated coercion, because he knows they will not go to the High Court, on account of the cost. This is the condition of affairs that arises when a &#34;boss&#34; with &#34;boss&#34; instincts has control of the Department; and no doubt the High Court would be followed by the Full Court, and, possibly by the Privy Council. I am surprised to see a Bill like this before the Chamber, and, at any rate, this is not the time of night to commence the work of amending it. </para>

                        <para>. - The speech of the Leader of the Opposition should not, I think, go without reply. There is no intention on the part of the Minister or the Government to embarrass or interfere with the rights of those who have telephones to be acquired by the Government; but there is abundant experience of the difficulty of settling what is an equitable compensation, and arbitration has been discovered to be the most expensive of all means. The Government always have to pay, and there is no evidence that an appeal to the High Court would be expensive to either party. In any case, there need be no appeal to a Judge unless there is a dispute. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope, the Government have all the information that can be gathered regarding this matter. Two or three years ago important questions arose in England in connexion with the purchase of telephones, and there was one arbitration which lasted about two years, and which resulted in an award of about &#163;21,000 on a claim for &#163;23,000, while the costs were very severe. There, I think, an Act of Parliament distinctly laid down grounds which have to guide arbitrators in the exercise of their discretion; but, in the present instance, it is proposed to ask a Judge to frame the law, and lay down a policy of compensation. I grant it is a great advantage to have rules to guide an arbitrator; but still a High Court Judge may express a wish that Parliament had given some idea as to what its intentions were. This was done in the case of the Lands Acquisition Act, which prescribed three categories. These, by the way, are not adequate, and great hardship is done, because people do not know whether they can claim compensation under the terms of the Act, and dare not go to Court in case they are crushed by the costs and loss of time, possibly of interest. I do not accuse the Department of any wrong: but, without guidance as to the basis of claim, a man going to Court may be mulct in heavy costs. I suggest that we find out what principles have been adopted in much bigger cases in the United Kingdom, and, having laid down in the Bill a  basis of valuation,  we  might, in cases involving &#163;500 or under, de bute the task of finding out what is fair compensation to  a  County Court,  a  District Court, of, it might be, a magistrates&#39; Court. </para>

                        <para>.- It seems to me that it would be a very simple matter to appoint two arbitrators, who, in turn, could appoint an umpire, and to provide that the decision of that umpire shall be final. With such  a  plan, we would be more likely to get a business judgment. </para>
