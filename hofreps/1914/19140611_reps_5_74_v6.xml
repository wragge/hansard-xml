                    <para>.- To display the rolls for a month after their completion would mean that the honorable member would have to do with about three weeks' less pay, and he is keen about getting his money, I know. My trouble is that I cannot suit him both ways. I understand that under our present arrangement, and with the present outlook, the completed rolls will be displayed for about sixteen days, and all names not appearing on them will have to be enrolled on the supplementary rolls, which are bound to be large. We cannot help that. The circumstances are abnormal, and we have to administer the Act as we find it.

                    <para>- In the absence of the Postmaster-General, I wish to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to a matter which I think has serious import in connexion with the coming elections, and, with your permission, sir, I should like to preface my question with a few words. I have recently received from a postmaster a notice that in future all letters addressed to my last place of residence will be forwarded to the dead letter office. The Prime Minister must see that a regulation of that kind will have a most important bearing on men who get a twenty days' notice to show reasons why their names should not be struck off the roll. I am told that in Adelaide a new regulation has been issued which instructs postmasters that, in the case of persons who have removed to a new locality, all letters addressed to the former residence must be sent to the dead letter office. Will the Prime Minister make inquiries into this matter?</para>

                        <para>- I do not quite realize all the bearings of the question which the honorable member has asked. I advise him to put the question on the notice-paper, and I shall have the matter fully inquired into during the day. I am coming more and more to the conclusion that one of the best ways of getting a proper roll, of stopping duplication, is to put the penal clauses of the Act into operation. ' </para>

Official inquiries do not disclose that any organized system of improper voting was resorted to; if any cases of improper voting did occur, they were apparently isolated cases, and had no effect on the result of any return - on what grounds does the Prime Minister now allege, with the view of influencing the electors of the country, that the present Electoral Act is most unsuitable, and that we should have a new one? </para>

                        <para>- May I again direct the attention of the right honorable member to the many suggestions for improvement which have emanated from that officer himself? May I direct his attention to the last conference of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> with his State officers on this very matter, and the strong representations there made to get a different set of regulations altogether to deal with the absent voting. I invite the right honorable member to get to the mind of the Chief Electoral Officer, and, if he does, both he and his confreres will agree to some very substantial alterations being made, even before the next vote is taken. All that I want to say is that when these statements are made they are not the officers' statements, but the right honorable member's. That is the trouble with the latter. He never quotes a correct statement, and sticks to it. He quotes a statement, and then says something quite different as a deduction. </para>

                        <para>- Order ! I am sorry that I have daily to make appeals to honorable members, which should be quite unnecessary, to allow the business of the House to be conducted in accordance with the Standing Orders, and with decency and decorum. I must ask honorable members to cease this practice which has been growing up of indulging in a chorus of cross-firing across the chamber, and unnecessary interjections. Honorable members should support the Chair in preserving order, and allow every honorable member to ask a question, and the Minister to answer it, without attempts on. the part of other honorable members to get in other questions at the same time on the one side, or to endeavour simultaneously to answer the same question on the other. Questions may not be asked by any member while seated, and this applies also to answers, </para>

                    <para>T. - I desire to make a personal explanation in view of the reflection made upon me by the Prime Minister, with regard to my appearance at the new electoral office in my constituency. When I found out that a person had been appointed to occupy the position of Divisional Returning Officer, I naturally sought to find him and see who he was. I thought it was my duty to do so. I found that he had taken an office in a portion of the city, totally removed from the great body of the electors of East Sydney, and I endeavoured to interview him to see if he could have his office moved to the nearest possible spot to suit the electors. I likewise found that he had no conveniences to conduct the business of the office. He told me that he had borrowed a table and a chair, and I said that that state of things ought not to continue. I also found that he had no telephone communication. I thought it my business to make this statement here, so that these officers might be given proper facilities to carry out their duties. I also found that this officer hardly knew a street in the electorate, and I likewise told him that I would give him the names of persons who would be of great assistance to him in his present position. </para>

I said the clerk should, of course, attend the summons and answer any questions put to him, and that so far as the production of papers was concerned he ought to inform the Committee that the Minister in charge of the Department was responsible for the safe custody of papers, and, therefore, ought to be approached for any papers that the Committee wanted. So far no request has been made to me for the production of any papers whatever.</para>

I am at a loss to know why the Government should balk when they are asked to supply the House with definite information as to the grounds on which they asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution. The public have a right to know on what basis they preferred their request. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has always been characterized by a desire to adopt an ideal way of doing things, and to go straight when he can. I ask him, therefore, not to fall back upon musty precedents, but to build up a new and noble edifice. We are asking for something which the Government apparently are not inclined to give, but which it is incumbent should be supplied, having regard to the crisis which now confronts us. It is a crisis which, in its form, is entirely new to Constitutionalism, and the Government, in the interests of those who will have to follow them, should supply to the House and the country a detailed statement of the arguments which were submitted to the Governor-General in support of their request for a double dissolution. To do anything less would be to 'play with the people. I have been greatly surprised at the action of the Attorney-General, who, I know, cannot communicate direct with the Governor-General. The Prime Minister may do so, and we have a right to ask honorable members, irrespective of what the Attorney-General may say, what arguments he submitted to the Governor-General as the basis of his request for a double dissolution. If the Government have nothing to hide in this matter why this obstinacy on their part? If the arguments submitted to the Governor-General are sound, and such as the Government have no need to be ashamed of, on what ground do they object to submit them to the country ? The people have a right to know something more than was contained in the brief statement made by the Prime Minister yesterday. </para>

Do the Government intend to give honorable members the information which is in their possession? It is of no use for the Prime Minister to say that he has told us all that there is to be told, because we know that the Attorney y- General was told off to formulate a memorandum. What was the purpose of that memorandum ? It was not to enable the Prime Minister to hold a conversational interview with the Governor-General. </para>

                    <para>R.- I am told that three lawyers in the Government were concerned in the preparation of the memorandum, which is the essential document in this matter. What has been said by the Prime Minister does not touch the kernel of the question, and therefore we have a right to know what is contained in that memorandum. If there is nothing in it of which the Government have a right to be ashamed, why do they not pro duce it ? They may be afraid that if the public knew what it contained they would learn the grounds on which, in the opinion of the Government, the dead-lock was built up, and would be able to judge the true position. The people, who will be called upon to pay the £80,000 involved in carrying out a fresh election, have a right to know what is in the memorandum. </para>

                    <para>R.- I need not answer that, because I have often heard the Treasurer say that two wrongs do not make a right. No position that previously existed is analogous to that which we are facing to-day. The question is one which affects the stability, not only of this House, but of both Houses of this Parliament and the whole political position in this country. The course followed: represents 'a new departure for which there is no precedent, and may involve the unmaking of all the laws passed by this Parliament, and a retreat on the path of political progress. In all the circumstances, the Government can have no justification for refusing to submit to the House and the country the reasons they offered in support of their request for a double dissolution. It is highly amusing to listen to the honorable member for Werriwa. Whenever he rises to speak, he tries to place himself on a pedestal that no other man in the world could ever climb. It has amused me many a time to hear the honorable member, with all his legal training, all his subtlety of mind, and all his cross-grained views with regard to every matter, speak of members on this side of the House as though they were not born of the same kind as himself. According to the honorable member, no one on this side could possibly be possessed of any brains whatever. The honorable member never once misses an opportunity of raising himself to an altitude so that everybody may see, a3 he believes, a wise man, but actually a man hoist by his own folly, and he is always endeavouring, by diminishing the importance of members on this side, to establish his own superiority. </para>

Sometimes I have had the idea when listening to the honorable member that he should not be in a House of Parliament, but in a bigger house containing more rooms, and if he really wants to be at home, he will look to some other institution than Parliament where he may get an audience who will understand him. It is impossible for anybody in this Chamber to understand him. </para>

But when I listen to the honorable member for Werriwa I cannot help remembering that, with all his high legal training, his attainments in the Law Courts which make the mighty turn green, with envy, with all his forensic capacity, his startling knowledge, and paralyzing arguments, he has never left one record in the Law Courts, for which he studied, that can be found by any searcher through the reports. In listening to an argument, we have to judge its worth by the source from, which it comes, and when we, in listening to the honorable member for Werriwa speaking on great constitutional questions, realize that the source from which that argument comes is irresponsible, and that the argument itself comes without any control and merely rushes out like water down a hill, I may be excused when I pass by the honorable member for Werriwa and say, " Get you hence, for this place has no use for you." The Attorney-General condescended last night to give the House a few words of explanation of his interpretation of the Constitution, and, in doing so, he also attempted to humiliate the gentleman who was his predecessor in office. All I can say is that, for subtlety of mind, for resources that are rarely resorted to by ordinary nien, and for that twisting and contortion which is ever the qualification of a legal man, I know of no equal of the Attorney-General in Australia. If the Attorney-General, instead of resorting to those practices, were to apply his mind to the unravelling of the mysteries of the </para>

The honorable member talks about honour, application to duty, and the obligations of Ministers and members, and yet he is the man who shirks the highest responsibility which is placed upon the Attorney-General, the obligation of giving the best that is in him to defend the Commonwealth in the Law Courts from any attack upon the assets of the Crown. </para>

                    <para>R.- Let the honorable member get away to his two blades of grass. All that the honorable member has done since he has been in the House has been to make a kind of ejaculation, or to propound some idea, with which he hoped the Government would help him through, whereby he would make this land flourish with grasses such as never grew before. He comes into this chamber only to interject. If that is how he realizes his obligations as a Parliamentarian, I hope the electors will appreciate his worth to them. What are we to think when we find the Attorney-General in such a position as I have described ; when we find a gentleman holding such an office running away from his obligations to Parliament, and relegating his duty to another? Yet he is the man who has been mapping out the destinies of the Commonwealth during the last four or five weeks. <inline font-style="italic">Aor</inline> then I hear the honorable member for Flinders talking about spoils to the victors. He said, " We recommended the Governor-General to do what he has done, because we were determined, and we had promised the people that we would abolish this outrageous system of spoils to the victors." What a mockery ! What a piece of hypocrisy for the honorable gentleman to come here and declare that he and his colleagues desired to remove from the Commonwealth the stigma attaching to such a doctrine! Did he come here and remove that stigma ? No. Why? Because it had already been removed. Within a month or six weeks from the present Government assuming office they had removed every vestige of preference to unionists in Government employment. By regulation they had wiped it out of existence. Yet the Attorney-General has the audacity to stand up and say that this was the great question upon which the Government had advised the Governor-General to cast this country into the throes of a double dissolution. I say without any hesitation that he occupies much the same position as does the man who works the confidence trick upon the public in regard to some great stable secret which is not worth anything. He has held this Parliament up to ridicule before the world. The day will come when the students of Constitutionalism will look back on this page of our history with the same feelings as we now look back on that page in Victorian history when the Honorable W. H. Irvine put a blight upon this State for several years. In the course of a year or two he inflicted more injury upon the people of Victoria than has ever been inflicted upon any country by any one man since the days of the Inquisition. This is the individual upon whom the electors of Australia have to rely as to what is best for them. He is the man who deprived the railway employes of this State of their franchise, and, in that action, showed what he would do if he were only clothed with the necessary power. </para>

                    <para>R.- I am coming to the Treasurer. There are a lot of persons in this House, and outside of it, who have given more credit to the Machiavellian politician to whom I have been referring than is due to him. It has been stated again and again that certain matters were evolved in the subtle mind of the Attorney-General. But it is not so. The source of the Attorney-General's inspiration to hamstring this Parliament was evidently the Treasurer. He was an illustrious member of that great Convention which met for the purpose of framing a Constitution for the Commonwealth. Looking into the future, the delegates to that famous gathering imagined that in the Senate there would be no room for any Labour man. They fondly believed that as senators would be returned by each State as one electorate, no Labour representative would ever gain admission to the other Chamber. But the present Treasurer, doubtless looking forward to the period when he would be Prime Minister of the Commonwealth - and I confess that I would not be sorry if he realized his ambition when I compare him with some occupants of that distinguished office - foresaw that some day the rights of the Senate might be threatened upon some nominal measure, and that, in such circumstances, there was a danger that it would be subordinated to the decree of an unscrupulous Government, which might utilize the existing machinery for the destruction of Parliament in a way that was never intended. </para>

                <para>How prophetic; how far-seeing! I do not know where the inspiration came from, but it was marvellous in il3 accuracy. It was probable that the Attorney-General got his inspiration from the prophetic words of the honorable member for Swan. The marvellous mind of the Attorney-General did not evolve this double dissolution move. It had already been indicated by the Treasurer fifteen or sixteen years ago. Will the Treasurer tell me that the provision of the Constitution is not being used now for a different purpose? In spite of the written record, will he dare to tell us that it is not being used for an unworthy purpose, and for a purpose to which no man with the appreciation of responsibilities of a politician, or a statesman, would descend? Yet such are party politics that the mighty seer of the past is dragged down to the morass of the Conservatives, and has to keep company with a man who has evidently pirated his ideas, hoping to foist himself on the community as a genius inventing them. Then proceeds the seer from Swan - </para>

                    <para>I can imagine that a Government which felt itself somewhat weak, or which thought that the occasion was an opportune one for an appeal to the country, might encourage a conflict, rather than try to avoid it, in order that in this way it might be able to recommend a dissolution of both Houses in the hope that that would strengthen their following, or, at any rate, give it more time. "A Government which felt itself somewhat weak ! " What Government has ever felt itself so weak as the present Government? These words are an indictment of the honorable member's comrades that carries the brand of truth on the face of it. "Might encourage a conflict, rather than try to avoid it ! " What have Ministers done? Have they tried to avoid a conflict? No. They have manufactured a conflict. Did they bring down to the House non-contentious legislation, or give the Opposition the opportunity to help them pass measures that would be in the general interests of the people? No. They did what the honorable member for Swan said they would do if this provision was inserted in the Constitution - encourage a conflict, rather than try to avoid it. The credit of all this does not belong to the Attorney-General, but to the honorable member for Swan, probably looking through his own glasses at the possible effect of the provision in the future. Ministers thought of "getting more time," but as the other place cut it short, Ministers have not attained, in this regard, exactly the full measure of the prophecy of the honorable member for Swan. The honorable member went on to say - </para>

                <para class="block">In the history of the world there has never been a prophet, not even among those recorded in the grand old Book, who has prophesied so accurately and with such detail. The present action of the Attorney-General, however, seems to be purely a copy of the procedure outlined by the Treasurer in every detail. Certainly the situation has turned out practically as the honorable member for Swan indicated, and I apologize to the honorable member for having given credit to the other man, and I withdraw unreservedly all I have said to the credit of the Attorney-General as to his being the originator of this scheme. To the honorable member for Swan belongs the credit, and to the honorable member also belongs this - that he has fallen from the high ideals that he formerly held to the level of the gentleman who has pirated the whole of his inspirations. </para>

                <para>Mr.WEBSTER. - The honorable member having, fifteen years ago, pointed out what this provision would mean, and its monstrous possibilities, surely could not now sit in a Ministry that would endeavour to carry out those possibilities ! My sympathy goes out to the honorable member. While I would put a halo on his head had he stood by his former views, alas, now, I cannot even erect a wooden cross to his memory. That a man such as the Attorney-General should ever enter Parliament is a monstrous thing. That he should be in Parliament, with his evil mind and his evil thoughts, to work disaster on the community is a thing that every man and woman who has the welfare of the country at heart must regard with shame. Well might he refuse to make known the terms of the memorandum on which the request for the dissolution was based. Well might one pirate another man's views, repeating them word by word, and accepting the praise and adulation for what he has done, who had received money indirectly for work he had done, not for the people but for the classes of Australia, when he was rewarded in the only way in which I presume such a man could be rewarded, by a dole from the purses of those who appreciated what he had done. If the people are so blind, so unpatriotic, as to indorse his action in this case, we shall see the same gilded patriots coming with their purses and their cheque-books to memorialize again this man who has disgraced his ancestors, and who, when this page of our history is read calmly and in cold blood, will be denounced more than any other has ever been denounced in any country under the dominion of Great Britain. Despite our political differences, I have thought highly of the right honorable member for Swan ever since I entered this Parliament, but my idol has been shattered beyond recognition, because he has accepted the office which he holds and has assisted to bring about the improper conditions which he foretold would be brought about if the section of the Constitution that has been referred to were passed as proposed. He is prepared to take advantage of what has been done, not for the welfare of the country, not for the good of the people, but so that he may remain on the Treasury bench. It is humiliating and sorrowful to the last degree that men who have played such great parts in the history of this country should fall victims to the wiles of the legal subtlety of the honorable member for Flinders and to the stratagems of the honorable member for Parramatta. In my judgment this Government has played a confidence trick upon the Governor-General, and Ministers now object to show the cards with which they played, because they know that if they did their game would be discovered. They say, " We shall not produce the memorandum sent to the Governor-General. We have got the double dissolution, and you have no right to ask how we got it, or why the Governor-General came to his decision. To your masters you must go." We are treated by the Government as the tyrants of old used to treat the slaves under their power. If one met the Attorney-General, the Prime Minister, and the honorable member for Wentworth with an umbrella and three bits of paper, one would not mistake what they were at. Their tactics imitate the devices of an element that has ever preyed on the people. Yet it is to these men that the destinies of Australia have been left; it is they who are throwing it into the melting-pot for re-casting. They will not tell us how they convinced, or deceived, as the case may be, the Governor-General. They simply say, " We have the double dissolution. We have the bludgeon. We are determined to use it on every one who has dared to oppose us." I am not one of those cock-sure gentlemen who think that the sun must always shine on them. I may not come back here, but it will not trouble me if I do not. Work of the kind  that lias been done here during the last two months does not appeal to me. I care not for party or for sections, but since I have had the power to think I have held that the one thing worth living for, to which one might bend all his talents and energies, is the uplifting of one's fellow men and women, and the making of life happier to them by having lived. I came into this Parliament as I went into another Parliament, believing that men of honour, were here, and that the highest attributes that could permeate the character of man would operate iu the proceedings of this Chamber, but I have lived to realize that the whole Parliament is more or less a mockery and a sham. </para>

                        <para>- I know, sir, that I should not reflect on the Parliament, but you will pardon me, I hope, if, in speaking, not excitedly, but collectedly and judicially, I should use any words which are not parliamentary. I withdraw the reflection I made, because I do not want this speech to be sullied or stained with anything that is not strictly parliamentary. I will say, instead, that I found the Parliament just the reverse of what I expected to find it when my aspirations led this way thirty-four years ago. For that period I have fought in the democratic movement - not as - a hireling of the movement, not as one of the men who have looked for a Government job when they have been out of work, and preyed on the Government, or done anything of that kind, not as one of the men who have always been looking for a paid position when they have been outside of Parliament, but as one of those who believed that a cause which was worth fighting for was worth working for - nay, worthy making some sacrifice for. These years I have put into this movement, not only with the accord of my better-half, but with the sympathy that any true man would value of both my wife and my daughter, who have joined me in travelling in the democratic path of reform, and it is hard to think that I am in a Parliament where the Government, if they get power in both Houses, will upset the whole of what has been done in this country for the last thirty years. They will strike a blow at manhood suffrage by a redistribution of the senatorial electorates if they get the power. They showed us last session what they were prepared to do by their Electoral Bill, when they proposed to undermine the secrecy of the ballot, the most valuable and sacred thing which Democracy possesses. They have shown us what they were prepared to do with a majority of one, and he in the Speaker's chair. What will they do if they can get an unfettered majority in each House? If that should occur, this Parliament and the country itself will be put back a quarter of a century before the party that may come after us rises to the seriousness of the position, and again realizes its obligation to posterity. Before that party gets a chance to undo what the present Government will do if they come back with a majority in both Houses this generation will have passed away, and another generation will only live to read the records of those who betrayed the country for the sake of a paltry reward, of holding office for its emoluments - not for the honour, because in such instances it cannot be an honour. </para>

I said just now that the Attorney-General  is not entitled to the credit, if there is any credit, attaching to the ideal that lies at the basis of the Government's effort during the last two or three weeks. I have said that if there is any credit due, it is due to the prophetic insight shown by the honorable member for Swan at the Convention, and that he would be entitled to the credit of it only that he is backing up the effort of the Government. He said to the people of this country, " The gun is loaded, and if it were put in the Constitution in that way it would one day go off and hurt somebody. I do not want to hurt anybody. I do not want the country to be hurt at all; 'but I tell you that the gun is loaded, and I want to save the country from the effect of a discharge of the gun." </para>

                    <para>R.- I am not going to say whether the right honorable gentleman did or did not, but I do give him credit for saying that the gun was loaded. The Constitution was submitted to the country, and the manhood alone - there was no womanhood suffrage at that time - ultimately indorsed the Constitution, which was not understood, I might say, by some of its framers. Heaven knows why they expected the ordinary " man in the street " to understand what eminent lawyers differed on, and have differed on ever since. However, be that as it may, the provision for a dead-lock is in the Constitution, and the gun is loaded. This is the first time that any one has condescended, or attempted, to use the loaded gun, and among the men who are using the gun to-day is the gentleman who forewarned the people that it was loaded. The honorable member for Swan is helping to pull the trigger, and so destroy the eminence of our Legislature, which was so logically and ably illustrated at that time. It is a page in his history which he cannot erase. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not pay any more attention to the other side. There is one other person, and only one, who is responsible for the present situation, and the halo should go on his head. That person is the  Speaker  of this House, and it is he who has made this situation. He has done what has never been done before in the history of politics in any country that I know of. This was not by voting, but by refusing to put to the vote the motion moved from these benches immediately before the division was called. The  Speaker  refused to put the closure when it was moved, and he thereby shirked his responsibility and violated the Standing Orders. When he saw what the numbers were, he ' ' sidestepped " in his duty, and refused to put the closure. Had the  Speaker  put the closure the Bill would never have gone through. Had he done what he ought to have done- </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know why there should be any serious objection to informing the House and the country as to the full text of the recommendation of the Government, and the reply of the Governor-General thereto. It does not matter to me whether there is precedent or not; the Government have broken through many of the most cherished traditions of Parliament which it is suggested we should hug to our bosoms. In my opinion section 57 of the Constitution has practically been abrogated by the advice given and accepted. It is, I know, out of order to criticise  His  Majesty's representative, but honorable members and the citizens generally are entitled to know exactly what passed when a double dissolution was asked for and granted. The people have to find the £80,000 to pay for the general election, and, as the most interested parties, they should be made aware of what transpired. Last night the honorable member for Kennedy referred to the occasion when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent asked for and obtained a dissolution of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. When the new House was returned after the general election, it was urged that, to put it mildly, correct advice had not been given to the State Governor, and the Government were called upon to lay on the table of the House the full correspondence and records of conversations that had taken place when the dissolution was granted. All that information was embodied in a parliamentary paper, and is now on record. My own opinion is that the Governor-General is very much concerned in connexion with section 57, and with the dissolution recently granted. I do not propose to criticise  His Excellency,  but I may point out that members of a State Parliament of a different complexion of politics from that of Labour have criticised the action of Governors in the past. At the time of the trouble in Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Murray, in a speech delivered at Warrnambool nn 14th December, 1908, pointed out that the State Governor was new to the situation, and must take a fair share of responsibility, and that the action taken was improper and unfair to the constituencies. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> the present Premier of Victoria, said at Moonee Ponds on 15th December, 1908 - </para>

                    <para>The Governor in granting a dissolution had not realized the true position or magnitude of his responsibility, these were strong words to use against the King's representative, but if dissolutions were to be permitted as they had been in recent days the pistol was pointed at the forehead of representative government in a way that would cause serious students of the problem to feel a great anxiety for the future. The inevitable result for the future would bc that men might be threatened by the man who held the power with the terrors of a dissolution, and if they were weak-kneed would refrain from casting a vote in the interests of freedom and material prosperity. This would be one of the great and important constitutional issues that would have to be fought immediately the new Parliament met. </para>

                <para class="block">So it appears, from the language used by prominent members of the State Parliament, that they had no hesitation on the hustings, and even after being elected, in speaking very boldly and plainly in respect to the advice tendered by the Government to the Governor, and even with respect to the reply given to that advice by the Governor himself. </para>
                <para>Professor Harrison Moore, one of the great constitutional authorities of the Commonwealth, published in 1910 a very comprehensive work on the Australian Federal Constitution. In this he said the following with regard to section 57 - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The solution is curious and unique. In the first place it will be noted that the scheme applies only to measures initiated in the House of Representatives, a fact significant of the parts which the two Houses were expected to play in government. Secondly, there is ample provision made for delay and for consideration by the House, and there is no obstacle to a resort to the familiar means of conference. The application of the principle of dissolution to the second chamber is not wholly a novelty, and was inspired in a measure by the Constitution of South Australia. But in South Australia a dissolution of the Legislative Assembly must precede the dissolution of both Houses, and the Constitution of the Commonwealth avoids the appearance of punishing or putting pressure upon one House rather than the other. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I wish to emphasize those significant words. The action of the Government, and the acceptance by the Governor-General of their advice, practically wipes the Senate out of existence as a useful Chamber. If, in future, the Labour party have a majority in this House, and the so-called Liberal party a majority in the Senate, all that the Government need do, if they desire to create a quarrel with another place, will be to bring forward a trumpery measure, no matter how insignificant, and have it rejected there twice. In that case, the precedent which has just been established will have to be followed, and the Government will be able to go to the Governor-General, and ask him for a dissolution of the Senate simultaneously with the House of Representatives. A Chamber living with a pistol continuously at its head might as well be wiped out of our Constitution, and it would be better, in the circumstances, to carry on this Parliament, if we possibly could, with one House. With respect to the powers of the Senate, Professor Harrison Moore, at pages 153 and 154 of his work, said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The power of compelling the acceptance of amendments to legislation is a very real one. If the Senate chooses to assert itself as a factor in party government there is nothing in the law of the Constitution to prevent it. </para>
                    <para>The ultimate political effect of the clauses of the Constitution on the financial powers is to strengthen the Senate, for it is entitled to exercise an effective control by means less heroic than thu rejection of an appropriation Bill. " Dead-lock," then, in the strict sense - the bringing the machinery of government to a stand-still - is a contingency so remote as hardly to be within the range of practical politics. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">He was dealing there with the financial question, and came to the conclusion that any serious dispute with the other Chamber was not within the range of practical politics, because machinery had been provided whereby an amicable settlement could be arrived at. The only dead-lock that he thought could occur was in connexion with some financial measure, and I believe that is correct. I do not believe the present situation is a dead-lock at all. It is artificial, and nothing artificial can be regarded as real. Only when there is no possibility of carrying measures for the national benefit can there be said to be a dead-lock between the two Houses. I do not think that leading authorities regard the present situation as a dead-lock at all. Future historians will call it merely a trumped-up political crisis, engineered for party purposes, and having a very damaging effect upon the influence of the Senate, and, indeed, upon the Constitution as a whole. Through the granting of the double dissolution in this case, if Supply is granted, without protest, the Senate will be practically wiped out of the Constitution as a useful Chamber. </para>

                    <para>S. - What I did was in the interests of the States. Up to a certain point, I am a State Righter. All the States have Agricultural Bureaux, and a great deal of money is spent by them in trying to educate farmers, pastoralists, vignerons, and others in their respective avocations. In the circumstances, therefore, I thought it very wrong that the Prime Minister, who pretended that he was anxious to restore sound financial administration, should propose to spend probably £100,000 per annum in duplicating a great deal of the work at present being carried on by the States. I repeat that the Government deserve the censure of the people of Australia for bringing about a double dissolution. They had no right to secure one. It means that sixty-six members of the Federal Parliament will have to go to the country because the remaining forty-five could not get their own way. Was a more preposterous proposal ever made, in the circumstances, to a Governor-General ? I believe that the Liberal party will meet their reward at the forthcoming elections, and that it will take the shape of a well-merited punishment. When we meet, after the elections, they will not be found on the Treasury bench. Honorable members opposite strive to appear cheerful, but we know that they have been dragged at the Keels of the Attorney-General, who is the most intolerant Conservative in Australia. The honorable gentleman has a tyrannical type of mind, and would ride rough-shod over the poorer classes. He believes that they ought to be kept down, and that their proper place is that of hewers of wood and drawers of water. It would be well for us, perhaps, to occupy the few remaining hours of the session - and, after all, I am not quite sure that they will be few; everything depends on the way in which the Ministry conduct themselves during the next day or two - in contrasting our policy with the performance of the present Government. We have previously described them as a Ministry of bunglers. They bungled with the sugar excise, the small-pox outbreak, and the quarantine system. They bungled in a dozen different ways. I wish now to place on record a list of their broken promises. The Prime Minister has said that we would not help him to do anything. Is it not a fact that we told the Government that we would help them to pass certain measures, such, for instance, as a Bankruptcy Bill ? On the 15th ultimo I asked the Prime Minister and other members of his Government a series of questions which may be summarized as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">All these answers to my questions may he seen in Hansard of 15th May, 1914. The point that I wish to make is that if the Ministry could " gag " the Postal Vote Restoration Bill through this House last year, and the Government Preference Prohibition Bill last session, and again this session, it was in their power to pass all the measures I have just outlined through the House of Representatives. Indeed it would not have been necessary to "gag" these measures through the House. We would have discussed the whole of them on their merits. We might possibly have proposed certain amendments, and, having regard to the history of the present Government, it is only reasonable to assume that it would have been necessary for us to do so. I take the view that the Attorney-General, who is leading the Ministerial party, and who has enforced his will upon them, does not desire the passing of any legislation of a progressive character, although he would be quite willing to pass legislation imposing further burdens upon that section of the community which is really unable to bear any increased burden. We have in this community several classes of politicians. There is, for instance, the politician who does not believe in any change whatever. People who think in that way are to be found principally amongst the large investors of capital. They do not wish any change, because they think that any change will be bad for them. A year or two ago it was suggested that Parliament should be shut up altogether, and we should cease to multiply Acts of Parliament. That would be satisfactory to large capitalists, whose time is chiefly taken up in looking through stock and share lists, and watching the operations of companies in which their capital is invested. They may be getting 10 per cent. out of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, 5 per cent. or more from Burns, Philp and Co., 10 per cent. from an electric light company, the Metropolitan Gas Company, and so on. Such men who have invested their money under the laws existing at the time in companies that continue to prosper are satisfied that there should be no change in the law. </para>

                    <para>S.- I have the most lordly disregard for money. Unhappily, when I wish to buy anything the seller will demand coin for it, otherwise I should not bother at all about money. I do not wish honorable members to think for a moment that in my opinion the capitalist is not quite entitled to so invest his money as to get a good return for it, but I take the view that if, in order that the capitalist may get 10 per cent. on his money, the workers are deprived of the means to earn a decent living, and are compelled to live and bring up their children in slums, legislation to remedy such a condition of affairs is necessary, and the capitalist must be content with less than 10 per cent.

                    <para>S. - If the honorable member for Wannon will cease to bother about the public welfare, will give up politics, and spend his time studying share lists and the operations "of companies, I have no doubt that he will soon drop across something which will return him 10 per cent, for his money. Not long ago I saw a statement in a stock and share journal to the effect that a man who invested £100 in the Ferry Company of Sydney ten years ago finds that his investment is to-day worth over £2,000. These things are going. If honorable members will give up politics and seek them, they will no doubt soon be well off. I take the case of a clever man who saves £100 - and some millionaires tell us that the first £100 is all that it is difficult to save, and there is no difficulty in adding to that amount. He invests his £100 in the shares of a company, and sells out of it later at a profit. Capitalists are a class to themselves, and tell each other of the good investments going. This man invests his profits in other money-earning ventures, and later on may be worth £10,000 to £20,000. If he is a very affectionate father he may say to himself, " I shall invest this money to the best possible advantage in order that my children may not have to work for their living." It is the greatest mistake that any man ever made in this world to save money in order to prevent his children from working for their living, and that they may be merely butterflies of society. I am glad to say that most men nowadays believe that it is better that they should teach their children a trade or a profession so that they may become useful members of the community. I personally think that it is better for a man to give his child a good education, and, by looking after him, a sound constitution, than to leave him a lot of money. </para>

                <para>It may be said that capitalists are a roost timid class of people. If when they look through a share list they find that whilst the dividend paid by one company was 10 per cent, last year it is only 9 per cent, or 6 per cent, this year, the shares of that company will at once drop in value and very rapidly. I take  the case of Mount Morgan shares at the present time. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company are the owners of a very large mine in my electorate, and employ over 2,000 men. The mine has paid about £8,000,000 in dividends since its discovery twenty years ago. </para>

                        <para>- The Mount Morgan mine was discovered on a 640-acre selection, for which those who originally took it up were paid £1 per acre by the Morgans. The people who have been interested in that mine have in one way or other received £8,000,000 in dividends from it, though I admit that very many people who bought into the mine suffered very great losses. The shares of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company were a few weeks ago worth 62s or 63s., and they are now down to about 52s. </para>

                        <para>- I apprehend that the honorable member is interested in the company. I do not speak with authority on this matter, but if honorable members read the Mount Morgan newspapers they will see that there is no occasion for panic in connexion with the min9. The point I wish to make is that capitalists axe a timid class, and if there is the slightest adverse rumour concerning a company those in it try to sell their shares and get out for fear of trouble. They are, as a rule, opposed to proposals for fresh legislation, as they consider it may diminish their dividends. When we proposed to deal with the Colonial Sugar Refining 'Company the shares dropped in value, but they have been going up since my honorable friends opposite got into power. </para>

                    <para>S. - And I was pointing out that the class which the Attorney-General represents, particularly in the Federal Parliament, do not desire any legislation. I was showing how the man who has the capacity to make money, and is economical, thrifty, far-seeing, and sober, could, if he devoted his attention to the money market and share companies, if he had reasonably good fortune, become a capitalist. I did not complete my description of the evolution of the capitalist because there is one important fact which I failed to remark upon. We will assume that a man with a genius for money-making is possessed of £1,000. He becomes a shareholder in a company which is able to pay 10 per cent. Immediately a company of any standing such as the Melbourne Gas Company, the Electric Light Company, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Howard Smith and Company, or any other company of like character, commences to pay 10 per cent., the shares, if worth, say, £1 each, double in value on the market. </para>

                    <para>S. - I am speaking of the money-making genius, not of those unfortunates who never know when to sell or to buy. The company pays 10 per cent. There are always in the community a number of trustees and investors who are prepared to put money into companies that will pay 5 per cent., so that they are quite willing to pay £2 for those £1 shares that return 10 per cent., and a man who has a thousand shares sells out at £2 each and immediately shows a profit of £1,000. That is done every day in the week, and probably no one knows that better than the honorable member for Corangamite. The honorable member does not appear to be an individual who is very much disturbed; that is to say, he is not a restless man. He is a man with a temperament that does not seem to become at all agitated. He is always rosy-cheeked and generally smiling, but there is no doubt he has a financial brain, and does not take long to size up the balance-sheets of a company. He sees that a company is about to pay big dividends, and he buys up shares at £1 each, and when a 10 per cent. dividend is declared he sells out at double the price at which he bought in. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This kind of financial operation takes place every day, as honorable members will observe by watching share quotations. As I was saying, capitalists and investors, especially large investors, such as trustees and others, invest large sums; it may be £100,000 or £200,000 or even half-a-million, but the total runs to millions if one recollects the investments by the whole of the investing capitalistic class. I am not angry with the individual capitalists at all, because in the present state of the world's affairs, if a capitalist does not avail himself of the opportunity of making money, he will probably find himself working for some other capitalist who does avail himself of that opportunity. I complain of the system under which such large fortunes are made by some capitalists at the expense of the wage-earners and wealth producers in the community. </para>
                <para>I was pointing out, before lunch, the reasons why the capitalistic class, which the Attorney-General represents particularly, do not want any change. When the Colonial Sugar Refining Company feared that the Australian Labour party would secure the passage of the referenda and interfere with the company's large dividends, the shares dropped in value a few pounds. I think they were about £45 per share a few years ago, and they dropped to £40 ; but when the Liberal party came into power the confidence of the capitalistic class was restored, and immediately the company's shares commenced to rise, and are to-day worth nearly £48. </para>

They do not think that buying houses and letting them is worth their consideration, because, after paying for repairs and the collection of rents, there is probably not more that 5 per cent, profit in the business. But it must be admitted that, at the present time, owing to the admission of a large number of immigrants who cannot find work in the country, and are obliged to remain in the city, house rents have risen enormously. </para>

                        <para>- I hope it is interesting. I understood that this was grievance day. One of my grievances is that the present Ministry will not pass any legislation in the interests of the general public, and I am trying to show that they will not do anything because the capitalistic class do not want any legislation. Any progressive legislation which would improve the lot of the wage-earning class would be calculated to interfere with the dividends of the investors. </para>

                    <para>S. - The honorable member for Corio will excuse me if I say that he should make a little further study of political economy. I will not say that he has not made any study of the matter. The honorable member has been, generally speaking, a very kindly-disposed gentleman, although really his actions in regard to the Tariff seem to me to indicate that it is time he made way for a true Protectionist. The honorable member asks, " Who pays the wages?" Will the honorable gentleman tell me of any labourer, any man on the job, any man in the trenches, a bricklayer, a plumber, a carpenter, or any other of the thousand and one operatives, who gets his wages in advance? He cannot name one. Before the labourer gets his wages he has to earn them, and, perhaps, a little bit over, which represents profit or interest. I think I have shown the reason why my honorable friends opposite, or those of them who are running the Liberal party at the present time, do not want any fresh legislation. When the Prime Minister went throughout the Commonwealth, and said that he was not going to indulge in any orgy of legislation, and was not. going to put up any record of eighty-three Acts of Parliament passed in three years, he was only voicing a sentiment which was very acceptable to the capitalistic class. If we are going to make any advance in civilization, we must interfere with the capitalistic class. The capitalist of the future must recognise that the payment of the wages of the workers must be the first charge, and that if the worker cannot get a good rate of wages, with the capitalist getting 10 per cent, on his money, then the capitalist must accept 5 per cent., or as little profit as will enable all those engaged in the production of wealth to get due payment for their services. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I am referring, of course, to all the wage-earners, professionals as well as others. Take, for instance, my friends on the press. I know that some of them have an idea that because I attack the press sometimes I am very much opposed to the pressmen individually. That is not so; I have a number of personal friends among pressmen. I want to put in a word on their behalf. It is monstrous that some of the larger journals should be paying such inordinate dividends at the expense of the staffs which furnish the brains to run them. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> £10 shares stand at £70 because the paper can pay about 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, on the original capital. If a fair thing was done by the producers of these papers the men employed would be getting about 50 per cent, more in salaries. It is time the general public realized these facts, and realized, too, that the Labour party, which is supposed to be a class party, working in the interests of a few individuals, is really working in the interests of the whole of the people. Even capitalists are better off to-day as the result of the improved lot of the workers and wage-earners. Are there not changes taking place all round in the direction of furnishing greater comforts for the rich ? About ten years ago we did not see motor cars running about the streets of any big city; and the rich-, if they did not possess their own stables and horses and carriages, had to depend on cabmen; whereas to-day, as a rule, they get about the cities in motor-cars run by intelligent chauffeurs, who get very much better wages than those received by cabmen in the past. </para>
                <para>The public should realize the difference between the Labour party and the Liberal party. The Labour party stand for the advancement of civilization and the improvement of the lot of the general public. The Liberal party stand for protecting the interests of the capitalists, interests which they consider are being challenged by the people's party. Let us for a moment look at what is being done by the Labour party in the Federal Parliament. I shall refer to a few of the measures which we have passed. The chief piece of legislation, I am inclined to think, was that establishing the Commonwealth Bank, and I pay tribute to the honorable member for Darwin for the work he did in connexion with that bank. The speeches of the honorable member in the House and in the country cultivated that public opinion which resulted in the passing of the Commonwealth Bank Bill. It would have been better, no doubt, as the honorable member for Calare suggests, had we accepted more of the advice of the honorable member for Darwin; but there is still time, and there will be opportunity later on, to amend the measure and bring it more into line with his ideas. Some day I trust we shall see representatives of the States on an Advisory Board working in harmony with the Governor of the bank. The Labour party are always open to reason and to suggestions. Another Bill which the Liberal party fought as strongly as they did the Commonwealth Bank Bill was that which imposed the Commonwealth land tax. All kinds of most objectionable slanders were uttered by the Liberal party against the Labour party in connexion with the imposition of that tax. It was said that the Labour party desired to tax the farmer off his holding, but the measure had no such result. We know that £1,300,000 is collected annually as revenue from the land tax, and we know that a number of large owners have had to cut up their estates, whereby farmers have got their land cheaper than they could have got it had the Bill not been passed. </para>
                <para>Coming to other legislation which more directly concerns the poorer people in the community, we liberalized the old-age pensions and gave pensions to the blind. The Attorney-General is opposed to that class of legislation. He maintains that it will destroy the virility of the race. I have never been able to agree with the argument that helping a person will destroy his in dependence of character. If that is so, how is it that the independence of the honorable member for Parkes has not been destroyed ? That honorable member was probably very carefully nurtured in his youth, and given all the advantages that wealth could give; he was educated at universities, and was not sent out to work in a u mine at ten years of age, as was the case with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has proved himself a very able man, but has thrown in his lot with the capitalist class. Had he had a gentler time in his youth, he might have been in a different party to-day. My argument is that, taking a child and bringing it up carefully, educating it well, and surrounding it with all the comforts of life will not destroy its independence of character. By the same token, when we give to the pioneers of Australia - over sixty years of age in the case of women and over sixty-five years in the case of men - 10s. a week for the rest of their lives we are not interfering with their independence of character or with the independence of the character of the Australian race. </para>

None of the Acts that we have passed is of any particular benefit to us as individual members of Parliament, though, of course, in so far as we come under their operations we gain the advantage of them. On the other hand, the Liberals, Conservatives, Tories, or to use the name which the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> applies, and which I believe to be the correct name, the Fusion party, which blocks us at every possible point, aims at protecting the investor, who wins such large sums in the shape of dividends and profits from the wealth produced in Australia. It pays individuals better - I refer not to the poorer members of the Fusion party, but to the rich members - to block our progressive national legislation. They reap more by doing that. This concludes the observations that I propose to make at this stage, as I shall have another opportunity to enlighten such benighted persons as the honorable member for Calare, should I consider it necessary to do so. </para>

We ask for Supply for three months. The first Supply Bill introduced during the current financial year provided for a period of six weeks, and when speaking upon it I pointed out that the very large sum of £400,000 wa.s required for the Treasurer's Advance to meet accounts for works and buildings approved by Parliament during the previous year, and still in process of construction. In subsequent Supply Bills we had to make like provision, this system dating from the establishment of the Federal Parliament. All accounts for additions, new works, and buildings have hitherto been paid out of the Treasurer's Advance until the Appropriation Work9 and Buildings Act could be passed. Last year I promised that, should I be able to do so, I would this year provide for new works, buildings, &amp;c.,, in a separate Supply Bill, and that I have done. </para>

                    <para>. - Speaking from memory, I do not think so; but I shall be happy to give all information on the subject when we come to the Bill. The measure with which I am now dealing provides three months' Supply for the ordinary services of the Government. The sum for which we ask is £3,060,020, and includes £80,000 for refunds of revenue, £200,000 for the Treasurer's Advance, and £208,578 for payment to the Admiralty for stores. The refund of revenue is the ordinary vote to enable the Treasurer to refund amounts collected which do not properly belong to revenue, such as the proportion of cable rates due to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company and the Pacific Cable Board, the value of postage stamps re-purchased by the Postmaster-General's Department, the value of postage stamps attached to postal notes, amounts paid in error, and so on. I wish honorable members to understand thoroughly that, with regard to the other amounts included, the Bill is based on the Estimates for the current financial year. The only increases of salary which will be paid under this Bill are the ordinary statutory increments in the case of officers whose salaries do not exceed £180 per annum. </para>

                    <para>.- Yes; I propose to give all the information I have at my disposal, and, if it is not enough, I shall endeavour to get more. The salaries that I have mentioned are always inserted in the Estimates, on the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner. There is no extraordinary or special expenditure included, except in two cases. One is the amount of £208,578, before referred to, which is required to pay the Admiralty for stores taken over in connexion with the transfer of Garden Island. The agreement to pay this amount was made by our predecessors, but it was too large an amount to pay out of the Treasurer's Advance, and it was not anticipated that such an amount would be required from this source. The Government, however, wish to make the payment - which is long overdue - as soon as possible. The amount is included under the following votes: - Permanent Forces, seagoing, £5,675; Naval establishments, £364; uniform, clothing, and necessaries, Naval, £10,500; medical services, £3,971; and maintenance of ships and vessels, £188,068; making the total of £208,578. The other is an amount of £1,200 included as a gratuity to Brigadier- General Gordon. This amount is equal to twelve months' pay, and it is thought that, acting on precedent, that is all that can be offered on retirement after thirty-two years' honorable service. This, it seems to me, is a poor reward after a lifetime spent with the Military Forces. </para>

                    <para>. - I am merely expressing my opinion that this is a poor reward, having regard to the time that Brigadier-General Gordon has been in the Service. Had he been in the Civil Branch, he would have retired with a pension of probably £500 a year; and he suffers under a further disability; he expected to retire at the age of sixty, and, even then, there was a chance of a further two years of service at the option of the Government. About two years ago, however, the age of retirement was reduced from sixty to fifty-eight, and Brigadier-General Gordon has not only lost his chance of remaining in the Service until he is sixty-two, but has had to retire at the age of fifty-eight. This officer has had a long career, in regard to which I might take the opportunity to say a few words. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was a prizeman for horsemanship there, and was appointed a lieutenant in the Imperial Royal Artillery in 1876. He raised the South Australian Permanent Forces in 1882, as a lieutenant, and since then he has held almost every position in the Military Service - Commandant in three </para>

                <para class="block">States, Adjutant-General, Chief of General Staff, and First Military Member of the Military Board since 1912. He has had war service, of which I have the records here. He was in the South African War- saw active service, was mentioned in despatches, and received the Queen's medal with four clasps and was decorated with the C.B.; really a great record of faithful continual service. As desired by some honorable members, I should now like, in a few words, to place before the Committee the present financial position. The revenue for the financial year was estimated at £21,462,000, and I am very glad to say that I believe that estimate will he realized. The Budget estimate of the Customs and Excise revenue was £14,900,000, and this, too, it is gratifying to say, will probably be realized. The Post Office revenue may be slightly short of the Budget estimate, which was £4,548,000, but amounts to be received from other sources will, I believe, make up any deficiency. </para>

                    <para>.- The land tax has not all been paid yet; but I am informed that the revenue will amount to about £1,400,000. The expenditure out of revenue for the year is estimated at £23,281,000, or about £834,000 less than originally anticipated, notwithstanding that the expenditure on lands required for defence purposes is being charged to revenue. When the Budget-speech was made, it was intended that such lands should be paid for out of loan moneys. The construction of the Fleet in the current year was estimated to cost £1,002,000; but work has not proceeded as rapidly as anticipated, and there will probably be an unexpended balance of £200,000. </para>

                    <para>.- Seeing that at the beginning of the year there was a surplus of £2,643,305, and that there will be a surplus of only £824,305 at the end of the year, I should say that that question is unnecessary. I remind the right honorable member again, however, that he had a surplus of £2,261,673 at the beginning of 1912-13, and also that at the end of 1912-13 he had a surplus that he had not anticipated, and that my position is similar. I think I can give honorable members even a little more hope. Notwithstanding this estimate, which has been prepared by the Department, I am prepared to make a little more liberal forecast, and to express the hope that the balance on the 30th June instant will be over £1,000,000. </para>

                    <para>.- On the transactions of the year ending 30th June, and inclusive of the surplus. Honorable members opposite, I think, are a little bit unreasonable. I pointed out, in the course of my Budget statement last year, that, taking credit for the £2,653,000 which we inherited by way of surplus, we estimated to expend the whole of our income, just as in the previous year the right honorable member for Wide Bay estimated that his expenditure would be equal to the whole of the revenue received, plus the accumulated surplus. As a matter of fact, the actual revenue which he received was far more than he estimated, while his expenditure was considerably less than an he estimated it would be, and his surplus, which he is constantly referring to, is solely accounted for in that way. If his estimates of revenue and expenditure had proved accurate, he would not have had any surplus at all. We have, however, discussed that aspect of the matter before. I wish to congratulate honorable members on both sides, and the country generally, on the fact that, notwithstanding the pessimistic forecasts of both friends and foes, such a good result has been obtained. When we reach the Works and Buildings Estimates, I shall have a good deal more to say; but I shall content myself now with moving the motion. </para>

                    <para>R.- Certainly. In this House, happily, the facts can be stated, and misstatements can be controverted. The Treasurer speaks now of an absolute cash surplus! - "audited," as he says - amounting to £2,653,000, which he inherited from the Fisher Administration. That was the position after the late Government had paid every bill that could be paid. I asked that every bill presented should be paid. </para>

                    <para>R.- But it is not always observed. The complaint now made by the Treasurer is that in my last estimate I appropriated the surplus revenue accumulated by us during the preceding years of our administration, but that we did not spend the whole of it, whilst, at the same time, the revenue received by us was larger than that which I estimated to receive. In this way, he says, we secured our surplus. The fact is that we showed a surplus on the actual transactions of the year. On the other hand, what has been done by the present Government? Even making every allowance for the economy which the Treasurer says he has practised, we find that, during the one financial year of their administration, the present Government have spent all that they received by way of revenue and income, and have, in addition, eaten into the surplus which they inherited to the extent of about £1,653,000. Is it any wonder that the honorable gentleman congratulates honorable members on both sides ? </para>

                    <para>R. - No explanation can wipe away that fact. The position is that the Treasurer in one year has eaten up more than one-half of the surplus which he inherited from us. Whoever is called upon to carry out the difficult task of financing the undertakings of the Commonwealth next year will be face to face with that fact. The difference between the position of the present Administration and that of its predecessors in office is that we inherited from the right honorable member an actual deficit, whereas he inherited from us a handsome surplus. We paid off the deficit, and at the end of three years of strenuous progressive work and legislation - the most progressive period that Australia had ever experienced - we left a surplus of £2,653,000. Time will not permit me to go into a study of the financial position at this stage, but I desire to express my regret that the Treasurer, when dealing with the maternity allowance, which he said would involve this year an expenditure of £685,000, should have said, in answer to an interjection that that was not too much, "Yes, but you are very generous with other people's money." Whose money is it? It is the money of the people of Australia. The complaint of honorable members is that the toiling masses of the community, the mothers and fathers, and especially those with large families, are over-taxed. By means of the maternity allowance some semblance of justice can be done to these people, even if we view it from no higher stand-point. It is time that the facts of the case were put clearly and distinctly in this Parliament. If there is a duty resting upon this Legislature it is that of protecting the mothers and the infant life of Australia. It is our duty also to see that a section of the people are not unduly taxed; but wherever indirect taxation is imposed, the burden of it falls, and falls unfairly upon the toiling masses, whose incomes are comparatively small. They have to spend all they earn in obtaining the actual necessaries of life, and a few comforts, nearly the whole of which are taxed through the Customs and Excise. Apart altogether from the social and humanitarian aspect of the maternity allowance, therefore, it must be admitted that it does economic justice in this respect, since it is paid only when there is another mouth to fill. It is paid only when another child is born to the Commonwealth - a future citizen who will ultimately help to make Australia and to augment its revenue. The maternity allowance certainly helps to relieve the toiling masses of the community of some of the excessive burdens of taxation placed upon them. </para>

                    <para>R. - I believe I know of cases which in the aggregate totalled £400 or £500 in an expenditure nf £685,000, and that is what the Treasurer calls " A lot of fraud." I take this opportunity of drawing the Government's attention to the statements made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> used figures, presumably received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> declaring that the death rate of infants has been higher since the maternity allowance was introduced than it was in previous years. Those figures are wrong. My investigation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline> statistics shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> used the figures in a way different from that in which the statistician presented them. I say, further, that even if that were not the fact, the manner in which the statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> would undoubtedly mislead the public mind on that question. </para>

                    <para>R.- Unfortunately, every member of the public has not a reasoning intellect like that of the honorable member. What was the purport and intention of the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> ? It was that more child life was destroyed under this beneficent piece of legislation than had been destroyed before it was passed. The honorable gentleman's statement was a charge against the mothers of Australia and against the medical men and nurses, and it was unworthy of him to say that this payment had led to carelessness and destruction of life. The facts are quite the reverse. But this is only one of the statements that are too frequently made by the Government in regard to that piece of progressive legislation. That measure was passed by a Labour Administration, and I am glad that other countries, so far from ridiculing it, are taking steps to follow the precedent which we set. Although the Government supporters have denounced the maternity bonus, they have not the courage to attack it openly. </para>

                    <para>R.- It is a policy that we are proud of, whether we were turned up or turned down on it. We pursue a policy which we believe to be beneficial to Australia, regardless of whether it is beneficial to our party or not, and it is the same policy that we have pursued ever since we came into politics. Those of us who entered Parliament at the commencement of the political Labour movement, some twenty years ago, knew that we were a pioneering party; we were not looking for coalitions in order to get into a Government, but we were standing for principles which we knew would stand the test of time. And when the time did come, in 1909, when every phase of Conservative thought combined in one phalanx to crush out the Labour party, what was the result? In 1910, because of their inconsistency and violation of every political pledge they had made, the Fusion party were swept aside by an honest electorate. I would like to quote to the Prime Minister what the honorable member for Eden-Monaro has said about him at times. If I were so inclined, I could quote what the Treasurer has said about the Prime Minister, and it would be most interesting if I were to quote what the Attorney-General has said about my friend, the Minister of Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom.</inline> Most interesting quotations could I give regarding the incapacity, inconsistency, and political shortcomings of those honorable gentlemen, but all the honorable members opposite are delighted nowadays to gather together in a little political coterie, because they need that shelter to protect them individually and collectively. They have no policy, and they never had one. </para>

                    <para>R. - And from that day onwards the people of Australia have regretted it. They put the Labour Government out, and they had their opportunity to put forward a policy. If they had had any, would they not have submitted it to Parliament? If they believed, as was alleged by some individuals, that the Labour Government was corrupt, would they not have set to work to cleanse that corruption and establish themselves by new legislation that would have won the admiration and support of the people of Australia ? But, instead, they manufactured through the press organs a false cry that the people of Australia were corrupt, that the electorate was corrupt, and they said that they were going to cure it. From that moment the legislative machine stopped owing to lack of leadership and want of policy on the part of the present Government. There has been no attempt to bring forward ameliorative or reform legislation. </para>

                    <para>. - My friend has been enjoying himself for the last half-hour, but, as usual, has said absolutely nothing, except to repeat the same old statements that have done such good duty for him throughout the country time and again, and which make up for his policy bankruptcy. I defy any honorable member of the Opposition to tell me what their policy is as a practical policy for a legislative assembly. What is their policy outside the referenda? What is their policy, except to tear the heart out of the Constitution, except to strangulate the States, except to effectuate Socialism pure and unadulterated throughout Australia ?I am waiting to hear that policy put into concrete shape. Just as when you get into a lunatic asylum, the first man greets you with the cry that every one is insane but himself, so this cry of want of policy comes from an individual who has no policy of his own to propound - I mean a policy of a practical character. Policy of spoliation? Yes. Policy of States' strangulation ? Yes. A practical, working, developmental policy for Australia? Emphatically, no. The people will look in vain on their programme for any scintilla of policy of that kind. </para>

                <para>When I ask my friend to tell us what his policy is to-day, he goes back to four years ago, and to what his party did then. He tells us that they paid for the Navy out of revenue. But who found the money to pay for that Navy? Who made the arrangement with the States which poured fourteen odd millions extra into their coffers? Who left the coffers well filled? My friends have told their tale about the country until they actually believe it, but the simple facts will take only a few minutes to recall. While we left the Labour Government a nominal deficit of £450,000, we had made the arrangement that gave them £15,000,000 extra in three years. </para>

                <para class="block">The revenues were sufficient, thanks to our arrangement with the States, an arrangement with which the Leader of the Opposition would never have agreed, and which he denounced, declaring that the States could not expect to have anything like that amount given to them. After denouncing the arrangement we made, he came into possession of it in all its glory, beneficence, and affluence, and after he had spent that money and raised the expenditure of the Commonwealth by 100 per cent, in three years, it rested with the present Government to put a scotch in the wheel of extravagance and ineptitude. As we are going to have straight talk, we had better have a little of it now. Last year, with all our disabilities, with all our lack of power here and in the Senate, and with all our difficulties in this House, the cost of government increased by per cent. only. </para>

                    <para>K.- With the revenue three-quarters of a million less than that of last year, we have governed the country, and yet shall leave a substantial surplus without any additional taxation having been imposed. My friend opposite, notwithstanding that he had £15,000,000 left to him by the arrangement we made with the States, and that the land tax gave him over £4,000,000, making in all nearly £20,000^,000 in the shape of increased revenue in the three years, could only save £2,600,000. And how did he save this £2,600,000? He left us to pay nearly £1,000,000 worth of naval liabilities which did not happen to fall due on the 30th June, but which be came due immediately afterwards. Also he left us with other obligations which we have had to meet. </para>

                    <para>K.- It is suitable for an Opposition behaving in such a way. The fact remains that with no additional taxation, and with a falling revenue, we have met and discharged all the obligations which the Labour Government left for us to meet, amounting to £4,000,000 sterling, and we shall finish up in spite of that with a surplus of £1,000,000 in the Treasury. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Let me refer to one or two of the obligations left to us by the Fisher Government. Reference has been made to the Northern Territory. Our obligation there has been a very severe one. We have had to completely revolutionize the methods of dealing with the Territory. We have had to adopt a different kind of administration, and my honorable colleague has a scheme ready which, I believe, will assist development in a way that has not yet been attempted. We  found that our predecessors had no policy except one of squandering from day to day, without knowing in the slightest degree what was to be done next. </para>
                <para>Then the Leader of the Opposition says, ' ' We laid the transcontinental railway." After an official opening, one at each end, they laid 8 or 9 miles in ten months. On the other hand, although there has been a strike for three months, we have laid 160 or 170 miles during our year of office. </para>

                    <para>K. - Does not the honorable member think that it would have been better to postpone the presentation of gold spades until the work was started? They did the same with the railway as they did with the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney. Twelve months ago the Leader of the Opposition, in the middle of an electoral campaign, laid the foundation stone for a building for the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney, and the workmen have hot yet finished excavating rock from the foundation. Would it not have been better to finish the excavations for the site before laying tEe foundation stone? Of course, we know that an election was pending, and that the advertisement was needed, all the arrangements being hurried so that the advertisement could be obtained for use at the election. We are charged with maladministration, and have been slandered in every direction, although we have had to come after the Fisher Government, to do the real work which they neglected to do. They have had all the limelight, and now the Labour party are blaming us for shouldering the burden, and paying the piper. </para>

I tell my honorable friends that the policy of this Government is to get work done to the best advantage of the country, whether by day labour or by contract. We are wedded to no scheme, and to no theory. We will do whatever is best for the country. Every one knows that where work can be carried out simply it is better to do it by contract than by day labour. The construction of the telephone tunnels referred to does not disprove that statement. We took over all the liabilities of the Fisher Government, and having footed the bill, we shall show a surplus a.t the end of the year. </para>

He accused us of almost all the crimes in the calendar, and I thought it well, therefore, to make a reply to some of his statements at once. He said that we are here, not only without a policy, but without a majority. Then why does he not put us out? If he has a policy and a majority, what are we doing in office? Are my honorable friends a lot of feeble nincompoops ? </para>

                    <para>K.- Honorable members opposite will let us do what they cannot prevent us from doing, and what we can do in spite of them. They have done their very best, during the past twelve months, to put an end to our administration of public affairs. Although they say that they have a majority and a policy, and are the financial brains of the country, the fact remains that we are about to have a double dissolution, and this Government, after administering the affairs of the country under great odds for twelve months, are still on the Treasury bench, and controlling the places of power. Are not these simple facts a reply to the rodomontade we have heard? Clearly we have a majority in this House. If it were otherwise, we should not have remained in power for one day. Why did the right honorable member for Wide Bay leave office if he had a majority? Was he merely acting a part when he advised that I should be asked to undertake the burdens and obligations of this position ? With a divided Lower House, and with our opponents in a large majority in the Senate, we had a right to expect that he would give us some help in meeting the obligations put upon us in the carrying on of the King's Government until we could appeal to the country again to redress the balance of parties in Parliament. Have we ever received one fraction of help from the other side? Have they not tried, from the very first moment, to prevent us doing our duty to the country ? If ever the times called for patriotic, self-sacrificing effort they did twelve months ago. No Government has ever succeeded to office in modern times under such adverse conditions - with such tremendous difficulties confronting them. We have had no help from honorable members opposite, and we have nothing to thank them for. We are here to-day; and, although we have not been able to carry out our programme as we should have wished, we have succeeded in governing this country, in economizing its finances, and in putting some efficiency into the various Departments. There is a great deal yet to do, and we cannot do what we would like for lack of legislation. We cannot even administer effectively until we get more legislation to permit us to do so. A great deal requires doing, and we have not been permitted to do it; but we have done something. After meeting all the commitments of honorable members opposite, and stopping the policy of spend and squander that had gone on for three years, we shall finish this year with the Departments in an infinitely more efficient condition, and with a good round surplus in the Treasury to boot. And all this without a majority and without a policy, as honorable members opposite say. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister told us that the present Government came into office in a time of great difficulty that was not anticipated. The present Government came into office with an overflowing treasury, and about £2,653,000 in cash, after everything had been paid that could be paid; and this fact has been admitted by the Treasurer, and testified to by the Attorney-General. The Prime Minister, in a prior speech, told us that we had exhausted our policy - that we had passed every piece of legislation that could be passed on the policy we laid before the country. Where were the difficulties of the present Government? The Prime Minister made a statement that he ought not to have made. When he was asked why he entered into the arrangement made by the Fusion party in 1909 with the States, if it were unfair, and would give too much revenue to the Commonwealth, and why the Government required the Naval Loan Bill, he said they had not entered into the agreement when that Bill was passed; and he maintained that to the last. What are the facts? </para>

Every State agreed to it, and it was known exactly what contribution would be given under it. That Government had an overwhelming majority in each House, and they knew exactly what the position would be before the session commenced, or just afterwards. </para>

They had a majority in each House, and they thought they had a majority in the country, because the States were behind them. Remember that there was a combination, or Fusion, in this Parliament, and a combination of every State of- the Commonwealth against the Labour party, standing alone. The Government never in their wildest dreams thought that the people of Australia would turn them down; and yet the Prime Minister says that he did not expect the Government would get this money. He expected to get all the money, and also the £3,500,000 under the Loan Bill. </para>

                    <para>R. - I can assure the honorable gentleman that I am not wilfully incorrect, but merely endeavouring to state the facts. No one can put a case better than can the Prime Minister, but I am stating historical facts. The Government anticipated that they would get this revenue under the agreement; and, when we went to the country, we, as a Labour party, refused under any circumstances to pledge the credit of the Commonwealth in time of peace for war purposes. We resisted that Loan Bill to the uttermost, but with our small numbers we could not prevent it passing. As we know, the Labour party were returned with a majority in both Houses, and one of the first acts of their Government was to wipe out the Loan Bill. I hope that no Government in the Commonwealth, except in a time of war or dangerous emergency, will draw on our loan resources for the purposes of defence. These resources ought to be left as a reserve to meet desperate occasions. </para>

            <para class="block">The Northern Territory and Port Augusta railway loans, as honorable members know, were raised by South Australia, and were transferred to the Commonwealth on the transfer of the Territory to us. The responsibility for paying them was then assumed by the Commonwealth. They were not originated by a Commonwealth Government. In answer to the Prime Minister's statement that our policy is to tear the heart out of the Constitution, I would draw attention to the fact that the High Court is at present engaged in a struggle with the Constitution, that the Prime Minister and his supporters tell the people that they are being robbed by extortionate prices, and that the toiling masses, through their organizations, are destroying the wealth of the country. And yet we have the spectacle of the National Parliament, which sees the Courts debarred from dealing with various disputes, and the Commonwealth Government powerless to prevent the spoliation of the people by trusts and combines, proposing, through the Government of the day, not to raise a hand to enable the people of Australia to protect themselves. I have asked the Prime Minister whether he is prepared to allow the Referenda Bills passed by another place to be put through this House and submitted to the people, in order that they may determine whether or not the Constitution shall be so amended as to invest this Parliament with certain necessary powers. The honorable gentleman has replied in the negative. He declines to give the people an opportunity to say whether or not the Constitution should be amended. </para>

                    <para>R.- Then the honorable member arrogates to himself the right to say whether the people shall be allowed to speak in this matter. He will not allow them to speak for themselves. The Referenda Bills are coming down to us from another place, but the Prime Minister will not take them up, and will not allow the people concerned - the people who  suffer - to say whether or not they desire the proposed amendments of the Constitution. I take the view that the Government and their supporters are afraid that the Democracy of Australia would answer in the affirmative the questions submitted to them. What a grand opportunity is going to be lost ! The Prime Minister asked my colleagues and myself, after we had been told that there was to be a double dissolution, to allow the Government to pass certain anti-Trust legislation. I assented at once. Directly the honorable gentleman mentioned the matter, I said that we would do everything possible to facilitate the passing of legislation considered necessary to protect the interests of the public. But the Government know as well as we do that this Parliament, having regard to its present limited powers under the Constitution, cannot pass any legislation that will protect the people as they should be pro-' tected. The Government will not afford the people another opportunity to decide these matters for themselves. I am not a native-born Australian, but it is humiliating to me to find young Australians unprepared to raise a hand to protect themselves, although they know what is taking place in other countries, and are aware that Australia is being invaded by foreign trusts and combines with octopus like powers. The Prime Minister has asked for our policy. He has misquoted the statement I made at Maryborough on the question of the Tariff. Does he desire to have that statement repeated again . </para>

                    <para>R. - The Prime Minister asked me a question, and I have given him a direct answer. We said in <inline font-style="italic">out</inline> statement of policy that if the referenda questions, which were then to be submitted a second time, were carried, we should provide for the new Protection; but that even if they were not affirmed we should still take an early opportunity to give effective Protection to Australian industries. That was our policy, clear, direct, and clean-cut, and that is our policy to-day, so far as the Tariff is concerned. The rest of our policy is too well-known to need recapitulation. I have laid bare the Prime Minister's inconsistency and the inaccuracy of his statement regarding his Loan Bill and his financial policy. I have now only to point out that he and his Treasurer inherited from the Labour Government a surplus of £2,653,000, and that during their first year of office they have spent not only their anticipated income, but a very large proportion of the surplus which they inherited. And this during a normal year. </para>

                        <para>- This is all very interesting, but the outstanding fact is that if the Treasurer had inherited one of those useful little deficits about which the Prime Minister spoke so fluently, he would have been in a very different position. It is just as well that the people should understand the position occupied in this respect by the right honorable gentleman. Coming now to the Commonwealth Bank business, I think that the Prime Minister, in his references to the opening of the Kalgoorlie railway, and to the laying of the foundation stone of the Commonwealth Bank premises, took up a position unworthy of the Prime Minister of Australia. </para>

                    <para>R.- The honorable member now says that he did not say anything to the contrary, but we know that he skimmed along with expressions which suggested that it was the act of the Government, whereas it was the act of the Governor of the Bank. We took care when appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> Miller to be Governor of the Commonwealth Bank not to interfere with him in any way there. The bank has been a success, and that accounts for the chagrin of honorable members opposite. I am not allowed to speak of their hypocrisy, but I may refer to their insincerity in this matter. They said that the Commonwealth Bank would be unpopular, and, therefore, it ought not to be established, but now that it has been a success, the Government have not the courage to defend it, and the Prime Minister merely says that the bank was established for political purposes prior to an election. That shows the inconsistency of honorable members; one day they say one thing, and on the next day another thing. They are speaking only for the moment, and not dealing with the policy of the country. Regarding the construction of the transcontinental railway, honorable members claim that the Labour Government laid only a few miles of rails, whilst they have laid a much greater length. They omit to mention the fact that all the preparatory work had been done for them. One does not commence the building of a railway by the laying of rails. When the present Government took control, they found the machines to hand and the rails ready to lay, and that the road had been partly made for them. The laying of the rails is the cheapest part of railway construction, but the Government boast, " Oh, we laid down more rails than you." </para>

                    <para>R. - We were not slow. We had the money, but we wanted to expend! it in the best possible way, without waste. It has always been in my mind that we made a mistake in not breaking in at a point along the Bight, and running up a temporary railway, which would have enabled us to have carried on construction from both ends. Do honorable members realize what it means to have two or three millions of money lying idle in a railway which is not being used ? It would have paid us to have incurred the expenditure on a temporary line, so that we might have made another start, and saved time in the building of the line. We have lost in interest and depreciation far more than can be imagined. But there are few people with minds big enough to grasp the possibilities of Australia. There are very few people who can really contemplate what this great country will be. We want men who, though strenuous supporters of a party, will recognise that there are some -questions which are far above party considerations. The opening up of Australia from north to south, and from east to west, whether by water or by land, is a national duty, and the mere fact that we expend a few millions on such work does not matter. The credit of the country can be safely pledged, because, not only does the railway represent an asset for the actual amount expended, but that asset increases in value as the years go by, and, therefore, such expenditure is proper. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's leader commenced the " stonewalling," and I am sorry that he did not give me notice, so that I could have prepared a few facts with which to answer him. The Leader of the Opposition stated that we came into an overflowing Treasury, and took over a surplus of £2,600,000. The reply is a simple one. We came into a Treasury which had been made overflowing to repletion by an Act of our own the benefits of which we were not allowed to enjoy. I have published to the country already the commitments which were left to us to the value of four million pounds sterling. Four million pounds of debts, and £2,600,000 in the bank! Would honorable members call that a surplus or not? Now, in regard to the transcontinental railway, the Leader of the Opposition said, " Look at what we did. All the present Government have done is nothing. We did the preparatory work; we laid the foundations. One has not to consider how many miles have been laid." May I say that I think the expenditure of public money is the test, and I find that when we caine into office the late Government had spent in three years £606,000 on the railway. During this year alone we have spent £1,340,000 on the railway. Those figures speak for themselves. Now, let me clear up this little matter of the Naval Loan Bill. I made a statement in this chamber that when we introduced that Bill we were not aware whether the extra money from the States would be available. I repeat that statement now, and a fact which the right honorable gentleman carefully concealed from the Committee, I will give to the Committee.  It  is that the Braddon clause did not expire until a full year after the Naval Loan Bill had been submitted to Parliament. We had to immediately go to election, and we had to take that referendum with us before any one could say whether the agreement would be ratified, and whether a farthing would be derived from it. </para>

                    <para>K.- Quite true, and my honorable friend and his leader increased that deficit to £1,100,000 before the end of the year. Do not forget that, please. In December of that year there was a deficit of £1,100,000, which the Labour Government had built up from the deficit of £450,000 which we had left. </para>

                    <para>K.- Of course, and we had to meet extra expenditure that year of £1,800,000. How was it made up ? In trying to cover the laches of previous years - £580,000 for defence alone. £380,000 for the Postal Department, £450,000 for old-age pensions. That is what made the deficit of that last year, and that deficit was incurred in view of the altered arrangement which was being proposed, and by which our successors received fifteen millions of extra revenue. Those are the facts, and it is time to repeat them when the honorable member for Wide Bay repeats the stale old story that the Labour Government paid for the Navy and did everything else out of revenue. </para>

                    <para>K.- Quite true, but let honorable members tell the country that we replenished the coffers for them, and filled them to overflowing) and all the money we provided for them, £15,000,000 of extra revenue, in addition to the four and a half million pounds which they themselves raised, they spent. They had a high old time, and left us £4,000,000 worth of commitments when they quitted office. Please remember that. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Meanwhile, my statement stands clear and unchallengeable, that when we introduced the Naval Loan Bill we had not the remotest certainty that we would get one penny from the new arrangement then being made, and the Braddon clause did not expire until fully twelve months after the agreement had been made, and the obligation had been incurred. What foolishness it is, therefore, with these facts on record, for the right honorable gentleman to try to bamboozle the people of the country, and make them believe that, with all this revenue flowing in, we deliberately introduced the Naval Loan Bill. That is one of those half-lies which is worse than a whole one. It is more misleading and more difficult to catch up, and that is why I have taken time now to prick that little bubble. </para>

                <para>I am glad to hear a statement from my right honorable friend, that, whatever comes in the future, he will not borrow money for the construction of naval bases. That leads me to say that nothing is more certain under Heaven than that, if he succeeds to power after the ensuing appeal to the country, he must at once begin to impose additional heavy taxation upon the people. That is the alternative, and that is the position made clear by the right honorable member's statement to-day. He cannot otherwise finance this country, no man can; no financial genius in the world could carry on the commitments of this Government, give effect to the legislation which has been passed, and pay for the naval bases and other capital works of that kind, out of the revenue of this country, without further heavy taxation of the people. </para>

                    <para>K.- The Leader of the Opposition has left the chamber, but I wish to ask him a question and place it on record. I wish to know what difference there is between constructing a Naval Base at Cockburn Sound out of revenue and buying one at Cockatoo Island out of loan moneys? When the right honorable gentleman bought his Naval Base in Sydney he did not pay for it out of revenue. What difference is there between erecting a dock at Fremantle and purchasing a dock in Sydney? The former has to be paid out of taxation - the right honorable gentleman says he will not borrow for it - and the other out of loan moneys for which we have to find the interest year by year. Could inconsistency go further ? The right honorable gentleman practically says to-day, " We will not allow you to construct Naval Bases out of loan moneys, but wait until we get in, and then, behind the back of Parliament, as we did last time, we shall break faith with Parliament, and shall contract loan obligations to pay for them." That is the position of honorable members opposite. I can appeal to the honorable member for Dalley in this matter. It was he who told his party that they had broken faith with Parliament in this very transaction. Not only did they break faith with Parliament, but they also' left the dock at Cockatoo Island a perpetual loan obligation, which the present Government has to meet year by year, while, apparently, it has to begin to reconstruct the dock into the bargain. </para>

                <para>Another point made by the Leader of the Opposition was that the Labour Government paid off so many loans during their term of office. Where did they get the money with which to do so? They incurred a debt of £9,000,000 in the shape of notes which they circulated. Honorable members may laugh, but for every note issued there is the obligation to find a sovereign. What honorable members did was to raise a forced loan without paying for it in order to pay off those other loans. </para>

                    <para>K. - It was very clever. Anybody could do it. I could take out of the honorable member's pocket, if he would allow me, the money with which to purchase my dinner upstairs.

                <para>Then as to trusts. What have honorable members opposite done about trusts? They made one or two feeble attempts to deal with them, always to have their whole efforts recoil on their heads, and if they had the power tomorrow, and were on these benches, they could no more regulate the trusts than they could regulate my backyard. None have such a record behind them in the matter of trusts as have honorable members opposite: Everything they have attempted to do has been feeble, halting, and incapable, and every effort they have made to date has recoiled on their own heads, while the so-called trusts are in existence to-day - flourishing, despite the three years' efforts of honorable members to control them. To-morrow, if the Labour party got all the power they could wish for, the trusts would still be the same at the end of three years as they are to-day. Honorable members are not out to kill the trusts ; they are only out to use them on the platform. The trust bogy is the greatest friend honorable members have. </para>

The difference between the other side and this side in the matter of trusts can be stated in few words. We propose to deal with trusts effectually ; they propose to trade on them, and leave them alone - to do nothing. That is the great distinction between us. </para>

                        who seconded the motion, said that in Victoria there was no difficulty in appealing to the people on the question of Protection, but in some of the other States the case was different. A great change, however, had come over the people of New South Wales since Federation on the question of Protection, and he believed that the Labour party could now appeal successfully to the people of that State on the subject of effective Protection, provided that the speakers could convince the workers that it would improve industrial conditions.

                        said he spoke as one who had advocated Protection all along, and he did not think they were justified in disturbing the present plank. The plank of " New Protection " was adopted, and, personally, he did not want much of the old idea of Protection for the manufacturer only. To ask the people of Australia to make sacrifices to encourage industries that did not pay fair wages did not appeal to him. If the constitutional amendments were carried they would be able to scientifically adjust the relations of the workers to the manufacturing industries.

                    pointed out the difference between new Protection and effective Protection. Victoria, before Federation, had the effective Protection, but it did not affect the workers as did the new Protection which was advocated by the Labour party. Labour stood for a fair and reasonable wage, and an industry that would not pay that did not deserve to stand. If the referendums were carried, effect would be given to fair and reasonable wages in industry.

                <para>For three years they stood behind that rock wall. At Maryborough, the honorable member for Wide Bay, for electioneering reasons only, threw this policy overboard, and said, "If we cannot get the referendums, we will give Protection without conditions. We offer Protection for your votes, and hang the workers." But notwithstanding the abandonment of the platform of the Hobart Conference, the people threw over the Labour party. They went to the country with a majority of ten in the House of Representatives, which was the equivalent of a majority of ninety in the House of Commons, and returned in a minority of one. That was the answer of the people to all their protestations. </para>

In these speeches he has not endeavoured to deal with the proposals for Supply, but has merely presented a case for his appeal to the country. </para>

                    <para>N.- The Prime Minister tells us that we would not permit the Government to do business. Had Ministers genuinely endeavoured to do business, and had they proposed measures for the benefit of the country which could be accepted by both sides, much would have been accomplished. But in the first speech of the Governor-General for which the Prime Minister was responsible, he threw down the gauntlet, leading us to understand that measures which had been placed on the statute-book by the Labour party, and strongly supported by the members of the party, were to be repealed, if possible. How could the Labour party assist the Government under those circumstances ? Having no legislative acts to boast of, the Prime Minister endeavoured to make out a good case by drawing attention to the administration of his Government. He stated that over £1,000,000 had been spent this year on the transcontinental railway, compared with an expenditure of only £600,000 by the Fisher Government. Does he forget that the Liberals, although they talked a great deal about the need for the railway, never endeavoured to pass legislation to bring it about ? It was the Fisher Government which made provision for the construction of the line, and was responsible for its commencement. Every one knows that it takes months of preparation for the actual work of construction when a great undertaking like this has to be faced. There is a great deal to be got in readiness before large sums can be spent on construction. The Labour Government paved the way for considerable expenditure on the construction of this railway by their successors, and I venture to say that had they remained in power they would have spent more money on the line than this Government have spent. The Prime Minister left it to be inferred that the money spent on the construction of the railway was obtained from revenue, although every one knows that it is loan money, on which interest must be paid. The honorable gentleman should have said that the money was borrowed money. Apparently it did not suit him to say that. In speaking of the Naval Loan Act, he endeavoured to make out a case for himself at the expense of the Labour party. He said that when the Liberals tried to borrow £3,500,000 for the construction of a Navy, the Braddon section was still in force. That was so; but every one knows that the Premiers of the States had agreed with the Commonwealth to accept 25s. per head of population in place of the Customs revenue returned to them by the Commonwealth under the Braddon section. The question referred to the people was, Should the arrangement be embodied in the Constitution ? The people followed the advice tendered by the Labour party. The facts prove that the Naval Loan Act was not passed because of the existence of the Braddon " Blot." If the Prime Minister denies this, I ask him to tell us why he and his supporters opposed the repeal of that Act. It was openly advocated by supporters of the present Government that the Navy should be built out of loan money, and they pointed out how a sinking fund had been provided, by which the debt would be extinguished in a given number of years. The Prime Minister endeavours to make it appear that the Labour Government had millions of money placed at their disposal owing to the repeal of the Braddon section. As a matter of fact, there was considerably more revenue, and it was absolutely necessary. He and his Government had been unable to manage the affairs of the Commonwealth on the means at their disposal, and they left for the Labour Government a deficit of over £400,000. There was no money for pressing works of national importance; and whatever Government were returned would have to find additional revenue somewhere. Further, the Prime Minister seeks to make it appear that the Labour Government expended money in an extravagant way; and on a previous occasion went so far as to say that there had been wanton wastefulness. The electors were told that if a Liberal Government were returned there would be no difficulty in cutting down expenditure, and, with the extra revenue, making ends meet; but the Government and their supporters forgot to tell the people that the Labour Government, amongst other things, liberalized old-age pensions, and introduced invalid pensions - a combination which meant an expenditure of something like £1,500,000 per annum. "With those measures the Government have not attempted to interfere in any way. </para>

                    <para>N.- These pensions should not be a charity. A person who has lived here a certain number of years should be entitled to receive a pension on reaching the statutory age. Again, for years, in relation to the transferred properties, we heard complaints from the States that they could get no justice from the Commonwealth, who had taken over those properties without valuation ; and it was the Labour Government who first dealt out even-handed justice in this connexion. We took over the properties at a valuation of something like £9,000,000, and on this agreed to pay 3½ per cent. Will the Prime Minister, or any of his supporters, tell the country that this was a wrong act, and that they propose either to hand back the properties, or refuse to pay the 3½ per cent. ? They dare not do so; and yet the Prime Minister forgets to mention this and other matters to the electors. The Labour Government had to launch the defence scheme, involving considerable expenditure. </para>

                    <para>N.- If the honorable member holds that an injustice has been done to the boys, he ought, during the twelve months he has been in the House as a supporter of the Government, to have taken necessary action to alter the position of affairs. The existence of the Government depended on his vote; and he could well have brought sufficient influence to bear to have his wishes" carried out. It does not come well from him, on the eve of an election, to talk about injustice to the boys. It would be much better if the honorable member and others would remain quiet at this hour of the day. When the Prime Minister talks about the commitments of the Labour Government totalling about £4,000,000, he forgets to say that these commitments extend over a number of years, and are commitments which any ' Government would have had to make in connexion with the military, the Navy, and railways. Today the Treasurer has shown that large amounts under these votes have not been expended; but the commitments are there. Supposing we come back on an appeal to the country, we shall find the same commitments facing us as the previous Government found facing them, and the same responsibility for carrying out great national works, such as the construction of the Federal Capital, the building of the railway to it, the completion of the transcontinental railway, the opening up of the Northern Territory, and the carrying on of the defence scheme. The Prime Minister accused us of an intention to knife the defence scheme, because some honorable members on this side said they were prepared to cut down the defence vote. None of us ever said he intended to knife the scheme. All that members on this side said was that where a legitimate reduction of expenditure could be made they were willing to make it. The Government have been telling the country that they would endeavour to cut down defence expenditure ever since they took office. We all applaud that sentiment, but none of us think that keeping the expenditure within legitimate bounds is going to impair the defence system. I am with those who advocate reasonable economy in that direction in the people's interest, and that is all that we are aiming at. The Prime Minister's accusation has no foundation in fact. The honorable member also said that we had borrowed £9,000,000 by means of the note issue. I venture to say that the people are proud of the note issue. It is one of the best measures ever placed on the statute-book, and we are in this happy position - that, instead of borrowing like previous Governments did from money-lenders, and paying or 4 per cent, interest, we obtained the money by means of the note issue, and are able to lend it out to the different States, and actually receive interest on it for the benefit of the whole people. That is the difference between the two positions. How can the Prime Minister tell the people that we borrowed £9,000,000 when, as a matter of fact, the money so obtained is returning interest to -the Commonwealth to the extent of between £200,000 and £300,000 per annum ?  Under the old system the Government would go to money-lenders on the other side of the world, pay so much for flotation and other expenses, and also per cent, on the whole of the money borrowed. In this case we get the money and receive interest on it, the banks have the use of the notes, which are circulated immediately among the people, and are a convenience to the people, and the people know that with the Commonwealth behind them they are absolutely secure. They know that if ever a crisis comes they can get a sovereign for every pound note they hold. That is one of the best things that has ever been done by the Labour party. The Prime Minister endeavoured to make it appear that the Government had actually been doing good work for the last twelve months, and had made the position much better for the public. He said the Treasurer had a surplus of £824,304 to show. He may have, but the late Government left for the use of this Government a surplus of £2,643,305.. If in twelve ' months they have spent £1.819,000 of that surplus it will take less' than another six months for the whole of the money left by the Fisher Government to disappear altogether. This Government came in to restore sound and economical government, and that is the way they are doing it. When the people are seized of the facts they will come to the conclusion that the financial geniuses of the Commonwealth are on this and not on that side of the House. Our party came into power, facing a deficit of £400,000, and left a surplus of £2,643,000, of which the Ministerial party in twelve short months have already dissipated £1,819,000, and have only £824,000 left at the end of the financial year. Those figures speak for themselves. They show clearly and convincingly that there is no justification whatever for the cry raised against us that we were wasting money - a cry which deluded many people at the last election into voting for Liberal candidates. The Prime Minister also had something to say with regard to the trusts, but -the Labour Government is the only Government that ever made an effort to. deal with them. In fact, the Ministerial side have always expressed a doubt as to whether  trusts really existed in Australia right up to the present moment, but almost every one is now convinced that trusts do exist. The Government have their doubts, and now, at the end of this Parliament, are going to appoint a Royal Commission to make inquiries. If the Commission reports that trusts do exist, the Government will have no power to legislate against them unless our referenda  proposals are submitted to the people and carried. Unless the people give it the necessary powers by amending the Constitution, there can be no hope of the National Parliament dealing with trusts, or with many other matters that urgently require attention. The Prime Minister cast doubts on our readiness to bring in a properly protective Tariff in place of the present revenue Tariff, but that is a part of our policy. We proposed to bring in the new Protection for the benefit of the workers and the consumers, but, as we have not the power to do so, owing to the people twice refusing to carry our referenda proposals, we have decided to go in for a protective policy. That will be part of our policy at the forthcoming elections. It comes strangely from the Prime Minister to ask where our policy is, and what we are going to the people on. We are waiting for the Prime Minister's policy. He has been in office for twelve months, and has not yet shown the people one item of any legislative importance that he is prepared to carry out. He has simply occupied the Treasury bench, doing nothing, and doing it well. The first policy that should be enunciated is that of the Government. It is their duty to take the people into their confidence, and, unless they let the people know very quickly whether they have a policy at all, they will get very short shrift when they go to the polls. It is useless for any party to go before the people making empty promises to which they have no power to give effect. The people cannot be deluded as they used to be. They take too keen an interest in politics nowadays, and cannot be misled by empty promises or excuses. The Labour party stands for getting additional power for the National Parliament. In the absence of that, we still have a bold and effective policy, which will be declared by our leader at the proper time.  When  it is declared and expounded by all of us from different platforms, the people will know exactly where they are. </para>

They know that all the dire evils that were predicted when we were returned to power have not happened, and that during the three years we occupied the Treasury bench things were much better than they have been this year. Even the Treasurer and the Prime Minister admit that the position this year is not as good as it has been in previous years. I remember the time when the right honorable gentleman would have taken up the position that the existence of a Labour Government made the conditions of the country worse than they otherwise would be. In this case, although a Liberal Government has been in power for twelve months, the conditions of the country have been gradually getting worse, the revenue has been falling off, and everything has been going to the bad so far as Ministers are concerned ; and, according to the Prime Minister, it is a further justification for their return to power to follow a like course. I venture to say that the people are not going to be satisfied with that kind of thing, and will not be humbugged. They now realize that in the past they had in power a party who gave effect to their platform, and showed no hesitancy. It is realized now that the Labour party made no excuses, but simply went right ahead with their platform. We gave effect to our views. Notwithstanding what the Prime Minister or any other person may say about increasing the taxation of the people, I assert that the Labour party never imposed an additional burden on the general taxpayer. The only thing we did was to impose a land tax, which fell upon the shoulders of those who were well able to bear the burden. The Liberal party have complained about the Acts which were carried by the Labour party, but they have never mustered up sufficient courage to say they are prepared to repeal those Acts. There is only one honorable member on the other side who has shown that he has courage, and I believe that if the electors should return him again his will will predominate. I refer to the Attorney-General, who has told us plainly that, as far as he is concerned, he would do away with the Maternity Allowance Act. The Treasurer seems to be coming round to  that view, for to-day he said that he does not believe in giving the money away to persons who can do without it, practically showing that he is gradually coming round to the view of his colleague. It is just as well for the people to know that there is a danger to be feared, and that is that the maternity allowance, which has done so much good for the mothers of the country, is likely to be taken away, or that, if it be retained, they will have to declare themselves paupers to obtain it. We on this side say that in the hour of need this money must be made available to the mothers of the country, just the same as we make a pension available in certain cases. The maternity allowance is not an act of charity, but is intended to enable the mothers to get proper nursing and medical attention. No Government that endeavours to repeal the Act will be able to obtain the support of the people of this country. I ask the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General to declare openly that they believe either in repealing the Act or in so restricting its operation as to prevent a large number of the women from obtaining this money in the hour of need. If Ministers will not declare their policy in this regard, we shall have to judge them by the statements which have been made from time to time, and we shall be justified in pointing out to the people the danger which they run in this respect. I hope, however, that the Government will muster up sufficient courage to let the people know exactly their platform, and what they intend to do before they appeal to the country. As regards the Labour party, our opponents can rest assured that we shall make our policy clear to the people. We will carry out our platform in its entirety, and anything additional which may be considered necessary will be given effect to. Our object will always be to legislate for the majority of the people, and not for the minority, because the latter are in such a position in this country that they can well look after themselves. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to address a few remarks to the Committee, and I presume that this will be the last Supply Bill we shall have an opportunity of discussing in this Parliament. The Treasurer is asking for a grant of £3,060,000. That means that a fourth of the year will have expired before we shall have an opportunity of hearing the right honorable gentleman introduce his Budget or go into the matter. When he introduced his last Budget, he foreshadowed that, after borrowing about £3,000,000, he would just make ends meet. During the last electoral campaign the people were told that the Labour party had been extravagant, that we had estimated to spend in 1912-13 some £21,000,000, which was extravagance, according to our opponents. But when the present Treasurer delivered his Budget we learned that he anticipated to receive about the same revenue, and expected to spend about £24,000,000, and, in addition, to borrow over £3,000,000, which he also proposed to spend. What is the position? Although we defeated the Loan Bill, and compelled the Government to abandon part of their proposals, the right honorable gentleman came down to-day and "admitted that there will be available at the end of the year £1,000,000. I am very glad that the honorable member for Gippsland is present, because I wish to direct his attention to one or two items in this Bill. It will be remembered that when the honorable members on the other side went about the country during the last election, and complained about the administration of the Labour Government, they quoted from a little brochure entitled <inline font-style="italic">Tha Financial Carnival,</inline> by the Honorable Joseph Cook, the  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal party, as he was then, in the House of Representatives. At several places the honorable member for Gippsland stated that he was quoting from the Honorable Joseph Cook, and that under the head of " contingencies," a sum of £3,000,000 had not been accounted for. I hope that when our critics go to their constituents shortly they will point out that the Budget which they passed last year contained just the same number of votes for contingencies, and for larger amounts than the Fisher Government had. We were told then that the Government had had no opportunity of dealing with the finances, and, therefore, had had to adopt the proposals left to them by the Labour Government, but in future years there would be an alteration in this regard. What alteration is disclosed in their present proposals? Absolutely none. Items under the head of " contingencies " are flourishing in this Bill the same as ever, and so they will continue to appear in every Supply Bill that is introduced. In the coming campaign the honorable member for Gippsland can go down to Mirboo North, Foster, Swan Reach, and other places, and instead of telling his constituents that the Labour Government have not accounted for £3,000,000, under the head of " contingencies," and " miscellaneous," he can mention that a Supply Bill introduced by the present Treasurer contained a larger amount for " contingencies " and " miscellaneous " than did any three months' Supply Bill brought forward by a Labour Government. </para>

                    <para>R.- The Audit Act requires every penny to be accounted for, as the Treasurer admits. During the last general election many fairy tales were told. I shall not say, as was remarked by another honorable member, that they were deliberate misrepresentations, for I think that some made these statements in ignorance. The honorable member for Gippsland, however, will now be able to tell his constituents that he is responsible for the continuance in office of a Government which brought forward a Supply Bill providing for the expenditure of no less than £841,593 under the headings of " Contingencies " and " Miscellaneous." He is undoubtedly responsible for their remaining in power, since, if he voted against them, they would at once be defeated. I say, as I have often said in this House, that every penny of expenditure under these headings must be accounted for, and that every penny of expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth since the inauguration of Federation has been accounted for. Supply Bills and Estimates will be introduced in this House long after we have passed away providing for the expenditure of large sums in respect of " contingencies " and miscellaneous items. </para>

                <para>Now I will tell you a little about the Labour Government's financing. Prime Minister's Department - thousands pounds. A Department never known of in any previous Government. Petty cash - thousand. Contingencies - thousand pounds. Miscellaneous - thousand pounds. Home Affairs Department - thousand pounds. When you tot these items up it amounts to two millions of money, and that amount is missing; cannot be traced; no one knows what became of it. Isn't that a scandalous thing? Two millions of money amounts to 10s. per head of the population of the Commonwealth. Therefore, you poor farmers have each lost 10s. of your money, which was dragged from your pockets by heavy Customs and Excise duties. The whole country-side is shaken in the confidence of the Labour Government. </para>

                <para class="block">The figures to which he referred appeared in a pamphlet entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Financial Carnival,</inline> which was issued by the honorable member for Parramatta before he was returned to power. Let us look for a moment at the contingencies for which we are asked to provide in the Supply Bill now before us. In the first place, in the divisions relating to the Department of the Treasury, there is a proposed vote of £15,000 for "Contingencies" in connexion with the Land Tax Office. Every one who has held Ministerial office, knows that a voucher has to be produced for every penny of expenditure, and that the Auditor-General will not pass an account in respect of which a voucher is not forthcoming. And so this item of £15,000 for contingencies relating to the Land Tax Office will be accounted for. Then, again, in respect of the Department of External Affairs, we find in this Bill, as introduced by the present Treasurer, an item of £15,000 for Contingencies in connexion with the Administrator's office in the Northern Territory; whilst in respect of the Defence Department, we are asked to vote the following amounts: - Royal Military College, Contingencies, £9,000 : Small Arms Factory, £10,000; Permanent Force (Sea-going), Contingencies, £24,000; Universal Training, Contingencies Citizen Forces and Senior Cadets. £107,000. All this expenditure must be accounted for so that when candidates assert that no return is obtained for the money so expended they are stating something for which there is no foundation. In this Supply Bill, which covers only three months, we have the following totals in respect of contingencies: - The Parliament, £2,540; Prime Minister's Department, £3,615; Treasury, £30,100; Attorney-General, £6,790; External Affairs, £34,500; Defence Department, £248,450; Department of Trade and Customs, £35,300; Home Affairs, £14,950; and Postmaster-General's Department, £316,000. I do not blame the honorable member for Gippsland and others, who at the last general election made wild statements concerning expenditure under the heading of " Contingencies " or " Miscellaneous," as much as I blame the Prime Minister, because they took them from </para>

We were told that if the honorable member for Parramatta and his party were returned to power the financial carnival would cease. But what is the position now that they are in power? Has the Treasurer, in his pre-Budget statement, foreshadowed any alteration in the finances of the country?

                    <para>R.- Yes; it means that a lot of public works for which provision was made on the Estimates, and which could have been started during the financial year now closing, have been held up. The Treasurer mentioned incidentally the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill, and I asked him if there was any schedule attached to it, and the right honorable member answered, " No." Apparently there are no new works to be sanctioned in that Bill, which will be confined to those works already authorized by Parliament. Therefore, the works already authorized have not been proceeded with during the present financial year. We told the Treasurer last session that he would not be able to expend the money mentioned in his Estimates of expenditure, and, therefore, a loan was not necessary. The Treasurer admitted to-day that, although he had not been successful in passing the Loan Bill last session as he introduced it, the Government have not been able to expend the whole of the amount for which he had obtained authority in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill passed last September or October. Every word uttered by honorable members on this side has been verified. I desire to say a word or two now with regard to the contingency vote, and I am glad that the Prime Minister has entered the chamber, because I have been quoting from that excellent little booklet, <inline font-style="italic">The Financial Carnival,</inline> which he used. It is worth its weight in gold. The Prime Minister, in one of these paragraphs, referred to the expenditure on contingencies, and spoke of the necessity for appointing a Public Accounts Committee. A Public Accounts Bill has been passed; but, although this session has lasted for nearly two months, no action has been taken by the Government to put the measure into operation. </para>

But why have not the Government done something this session? There will be nothing to the Government's credit, not only so far as legislation is concerned, but also so far as administration is concerned.

                    <para>R.- This Supply Bill contains a contingencies vote of £316,000 for the Post Office alone. That is for three months only. So if we multiply that total by four we find that the contingencies expenditure for that year in that Department will be £1,250,000, although the Prime Minister objected to the contingencies expenditure being a little over £1,000,000 when the Labour Government were in office. Of course the Prime Minister would not criticise the Treasurer's statement, but he is jointly responsible with his colleague for the introduction of this Bill, which fastens upon Australia an expenditure for " contingencies " and "miscellaneous" of £841,000 for a quarter of the year, equalling nearly £3,500,000 in the year. </para>

                    <para>R. - There will be no alteration of the system of placing in the Estimates big contingencies votes, because, as the Treasurer has admitted, every penny expended must be accounted for to the Auditor-General, and during the existence of the Commonwealth not a penny has been spent for which no account has been made. In the Prime Minister's own Department, responsibility for which he cannot shirk, the amount to be voted for salaries for the three months is £840, for contingencies, £1,350, and for miscellaneous, £230. In other words, miscellaneous and contingencies together will be double the amount voted for salaries in that Department. I say that not one penny of the contingencies expenditure has been expended in an illegitimate way, as some honorable members opposite desired to make out during the last election. Of course one cannot get a lie to do business twice, and it is possible that some honorable members, who made that wild statement, for which there was not a tittle of justification, will not be able to defend their position on the hustings when they are again asked questions on the subject. The honorable member for Gippsland and other honorable members made the wild statement that £3,000,000 had been spent in " contingencies " and " miscellaneous " votes for which there was no account, when every honorable member in the House knows that all expenditure is accounted for to the Auditor-General. This used to be one of the Attorney-General's pet subjects when he sat on this side of the House. He used to go through the votes for the various Departments and pick out the " contingencies." </para>

I have pointed out that, whilst honorable members on the other side made a great mouthful of this matter during the 1913 campaign, they will have to tell their constituents, when they go before them again, that they have voted to continue in office a Government who have introduced a greater number of contingency votes in a Supply Bill than were ever submitted by the Fisher Government.

After showing that the Labour party, during its three years' tenure of office, had received £18,342,771 more revenue than any of its predecessors - a fact which " naturally encouraged a vastly-increased expenditure that could not have been possible, or even thought of otherwise" - the Treasurer informed the House that the Cook Government " does not intend to stop the expenditure to which the country is committed." </para>

In addition, lie proposes to raise £3,080,000 by means of Loan Bills for new works and other matters; bo his gross estimated expenditure for 1013-14 is really £27,105,223- an excess of £5,687,360 over the amount spent by the Labour Government. </para>

                    <para>R.- Of course we did, and the present Treasurer has said to-day that he expects to save £1,000,000. The Treasurer explained to-day that every work included in the Supply Bill was provided for in the Works Estimates of last year. That proves that the Government have hung up works expenditure, and have failed to redeem one pledge they made to the people when they were last before the country. When they go before the people again, they will have to explain that the cost of living is higher to-day and rents are higher than they were when they assumed office, and that they have not lifted a little finger to alter that condition of affairs, although they were returned upon a direct promise that they would move in that direction. </para>

                    <para>. - To-day we listened to the Prime Minister in his best form denouncing the Labour Government. With a few exceptions I venture to say that the present is the most incompetent Ministry, from a business point of view, that has ever occupied the Treasury bench. They will go down to history and will be known in the museums of the world as the Cook political cripples. </para>

                        <para>- I shall withdraw it, but I shall put them in the museum just the same. I do not care to be savage or to say unkind things, but to-day the Prime Minister attacked the Department that I virtually created. For months before the Government took office, they said that they were going to show to the world what a crude political creature King O'Malley was. Yet they have had to retain every reform that I initiated in the Department of which I took charge. </para>

Perhaps he thinks he could learn more in Gippsland than he could in the city of New York.

                    <para>Y.- I know that Pierpont Morgan is dead, but they want a banker to take his place in the United States. Rockefeller is now very old, and will probably soon die. I will say that the Honorary Minister has had sufficient intelligence to refuse to be an animated rubber stamp. With a few exceptions the members of the present Ministry are animated rubber stamps. I do not like saying unkind things, but the Prime Minister provoked me to-day, and I do not know where I shall stop now. When the Labour Government took possession of the Treasury bench they found nothing but chaos in the Government Departments. Nobody knew where anything was. Piles of papers were stacked up as high as the ceiling. I was six weeks doing nothing but signing my name. My honorable friend, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, will admit that when he entered the Department he had very few papers to sign. Only yesterday, a Fusion candidate, speaking in Bendigo, declared how much more the present Government had done for the working men in Western Australia than had the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. In refutation of that statement I propose to quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane's</inline> report, which was almost on the printing machine when I left the Department. That report contains my proposals for the organization of the whole plant on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway. Yet the Prime Minister today would not agree that anybody had done anything but himself. There is not a reform connected with the construction of the transcontinental railway which I did not suggest. I arranged to have a car equipped with medicines for the use of the men employed on that line; I arranged for tents for them, and I arranged for them to pay so much a week out of their wages towards the organization. It was not possible to erect the tents in advance of the line, and, consequently, the Prime Minister affirms that the Fisher Government did not get the enterprise going. But we had to buy the necessary material, to organize the plant, to get everything in operation, before we could start the undertaking. When I left office, I left everything in going order. Everything was moving. </para>

                    <para>Y.- I will give it to the honorable member. In the first place, I charge the Attorney-General with being a law-breaker in that he allowed these organizers to get the names of electors off the rolls without calling upon them to lodge the fee of 5s., which the law prescribes should accompany each objection. In my own district, this practice has become a public scandal, and I have to leave here tomorrow for my constituency in order to see that the names of electors which have been thrown off the rolls by these organizers are restored. I say that such action on their part is criminal. In my opinion, it is the first time that corruption has dominated the rolls of Australia. </para>

                    <para>Y.- Very well; I shall meet the honorable member outside. It is a serious matter to throw people off the rolls. When a working man leaves his place of work, and goes across the street, and a letter is sent to where he was working on the last occasion, he does not answer it because he never gets it, and very often the letter is burnt. That has been done in my electorate. Then they proceed to throw him off the roll, and in order to drown the outcries of the disfranchised there is an uproar of a sham battle over preference to unionists. It will not work. Let us fight this election honestly and justly, and if honorable members on the Ministerial benches can put us down, we shall take our medicine. I wish now to touch on the question of finance. On the 2nd October, 1913, the Treasurer, in presenting the Budget, said - </para>

                    <para>In presenting the last Budget to Parliament on the 1st August, 1912, the Treasurer announced that, in order to meet his expenditure during the financial year 1912-13, it would be necessary to expend, not only the revenue estimated to be received during that year, but also the accumulated surplus amounting to £2,261,673, which was on the 30th June, 1912, at the credit of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Fund and the Naval Defence Account for Construction of the Fleet. </para>

            <para class="block">To-day the Treasurer admitted that after the operations for the year there would still be a surplus of about £800,000. I congratulate him upon that surplus. Bad as the times are, we should be satisfied on both sides of the House that we do not run behind, but had it not been for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> providing and gathering that surplus there would now be a deficit of £1,800,000. I had a lot of trouble with the ex-Prime Minister. I wished to spend that money, but he would not let me have it. I wished to spend it on the Electoral Department, and do exactly what Ministers are now doing, and I wished to spend it on buildings throughout the country, because I claim that our activities and national enterprises should always be kept up-to-date. We had not painted Government House for ten years. When I went to look at the building, I thought it would tumble over. It cost a lot of money to renovate the place. These were the things to which I turned my attention, and if the present Prime Minister will turn to the savings book in the Department of Home Affairs, he will find that "the man who has no business knowledge" saved Australia £194,000 on certain transactions. Parliament has not done much during the last year because we have been fighting as to who should be on the Treasury bench, but honorable members of the Opposition have always been ready to help the Government to carry non-contentious measures. Ministers could have brought down their irrigation proposals, their break-of-gauge proposals, their scheme for organizing the banking, credit, and financial system of Australia; and the Tariff ought to have been in the forefront of their programme. However, they put in their whole time fighting about a little tinpot preference to unionists Bill. It was really not a Bill. The trouble arose over a minute issued by me giving preference to unionists; and the present Government having abolished preference, the matter was done with, and it was not necessary to put in a whole year bothering about it. </para>

                    <para>Y.- Rubbish ! I gave preference to unionists because it was a collective bargain. I could do better business with the secretaries of unions, and would not be bothered with dozens of interviews with individuals. Our fight was not against the Bill. We put up our battle because the Government declared that it intended to take away from the rural workers the right to go to the Arbitration Court. Ministers wish to destroy judicial preference. We fought for a great fundamental principle. </para>

                    <para>Y.- In the State of Kansas, the Governor for thirty years did not sign a warrant for the hanging of a man; but there was a man who murdered his wife and committed other crimes that the Governor of the day could not stand, and that man was hanged, though there has been no hanging since. The Governor all the time had the right to hang a man, although he exercised it only once in thirty years. Let me deal now with the Tariff. Every one knows that our iron industry is going to the dogs. Goods can be brought here from London and from New York for less than is charged to transport them from Sydney to Western Australia. The present Tariff is no barrier against the cheap labour of Europe. In Japan, workmen can be got for from 9d. to1s. a day. How can Australian manufacturers pay high wages if they have to compete with manufacturers who can employ cheap labour, and are not controlled by boards or industrial laws? I am a Protectionist, dipped in the dew, and dyed in the wool. No new country can be successful without Protection. Yet we have monkeyed our time away when we could have dealt with the Tariff. I believe in the initiative and referendum, and in the recall. In America, they recall mayors of towns and members of Parliament who do not do their duty. I believe, too, that we should be paid better salaries. To come to another point. We have made no arrangements yet for dealing with the debts of the States. Australia has one of the biggest debts in the world, but we have made no arrangements for meeting it. We ought to have a better sinking fund - a national sinking fund - and it ought to be in the hands of trustees, independent of Treasurers. We ought to re-organize the Commonwealth Bank, and have it under a board of management, with each of the States represented on the board. </para>

                    <para>Y.- You cannot do everything. I find that the aggregate borrowing of the States for the last five years was £79,738,910, or, on the average, £15,947,782 a year. The average underwriting expense incurred in the raising of that money was £166,402 a year. That was what was spent in brokerage, bank commission, underwriting, and other charges, for which we get no return. </para>

                    <para>- The right honorable member for Wide Bay, in his speech this afternoon, afforded further evidence of the Tory character of the party opposite.  His  statement in support of high Protection constituted a Tory speech. He is not satisfied with the Tariff, which in many instances protects the Australian manufacturer against his foreign rival by an amount equal to the wages' cost of the article, and in some cases by an amount equal to from three to twelve times the wages cost. He spoke on behalf of the big man, and on behalf of the trusts and combines, which he condemns when on the public platform, but which he promises to assist still further if returned with a majority. It is by Tariffs that rings and trusts are created. So far back as 1901, I expressed regret that many members of the Labour party understood so little the true interests of the bulk of the workers that they were ready to vote for high duties. I pointed out that Protection should be limited in each case to the difference between the wages paid here and abroad; but in one or two instances they voted for duties which gave one hundred times as much as that. It is true that certain members who are now associated with the Liberal party made the same mistake, but they have seen the error of their ways, and are determined henceforth that all taxation on the people shall go into the) Treasury, instead of into the pockets of trusts and combines. If honorable members opposite are in earnest, they know that in every country in the world - in Canada, America, and elsewhere, and even in Australia when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> introduced the first Tariff - it has been always proposed to lower the duties in the case of trusts and combines. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member has not learned the story by this time, he is too old to do so now. Sensible, reasonable men realize that the Labour party ought to keep down taxation, but in Australia they are the absolute antithesis of Labour parties on the other side of the world. There they endeavour to keep down Tariffs, because it is recognised that the people have to pay the price. When the Tariff was before this Parliament, and I and others pointed out that the burden would have to be borne by the people, the fact was recognised by a certain proportion of Labour members, who voted accordingly: but, unfortunately, a majority decided that high taxation should prevail. Honorable members opposite were warned that high taxation would mean trusts and combines; and, personally I said that if I remained in Parliament for another ten years I should see the melancholy spectacle of members of the Labour party condemning the corporations which they were then themselves creating. </para>

                    <para>Y. - There are only mythical trusts and combines in England. Large combinations of capital cannot be prevented, and every blow that the Labour party has made at capital in Australia has really meant the encouragement of the capitalists already here. The Labour party declared that they would prevent the capitalists of Australia from having any competition, and, consequently, those capitalists were able to raise interest by 1^ per cent, and 2 per cent. The Labour party also said that they would "put down " the banks; and yet the dividends of banking and other companies are higher than ever. Is it any wonder that those  great companies support the Labour party, and that the Liberals cannot get any contributions for their leagues ? I know scores and scores of men who will not give a penny to the Liberal party, but declare for the Labour party on the ground that while that party talks against capital, it is really fighting for it. And, of course, if I had the same monetary sense, and the same belief in monetary privileges, I should like the Labour party to be always in power, because they take care to make capital so tight that the rate of interest must rise. Honorable members opposite try to impose taxation on wealth, although the same has been tried tens of thousands of times before, with the inevitable result that the poorer people have to pay. That is the view of sensible, thoughtful, genuine Labour men elsewhere, who are not Tories masquerading in the guise of Labour. Honorable members opposite glory in the false name they have assumed, knowing that it is a bluff which conceals the real acts of the party. A true Labour party acts in the interests of the public, but it is manifest that the so-called Labour party here legislates for the wealth of the country. In Australia there are only 10,000 persons with over £1,000 a year, and some 25,000 with over £700 a year, and it is idle to suppose that the Liberal party can depend on these for success. No real politician ever appeals to the wealthy of a community, but to the sensible workers, who are kept down, not because of capital, but because of the absence of capital. Yet honorable members opposite go about the country preaching a doctrine of hate, stirring up prejudice, and setting man against man, instead of proclaiming the religion of humanity and brotherhood. What they ought to endeavour to create is that spirit of confidence which has the effect of increasing capital. Sometimes it is said to me of the Labour party, " Oh, they mean well and I admit that they frequently do. </para>

                    <para>Y.- That is just what the Labour party do not do, or if they do well, it is only at the expense of the genuine workers of the community. Whatever claim to the name "Labour" the party once possessed was lost the moment they became the representatives of only a section of the workers of the community. There are oyer 1,100,000 workers, and of these only 400,000 are unionists; and yet the Labour party claim preference for the minority. At that moment they abandoned even the faintest tittle of right to call themselves Labour men, because if that other great part of the community are not to he considered merely because they are not organized, then the party opposite represent only the strength, and not, as they should strive to do, the weakness of the community, so that the wrongs of the weaker section may be righted so far as it is possible for legislation to do it. I do not say that legislation can effect everything. No legislation can add to the production of wealth in a country, although some honorable members opposite seem to think that they add to the wealth of the community by taxes, and by calling taxes protective they reckon on deceiving the mass of the public as to their real incidence. If, for instance, a tax of £6 per ton is put on sugar, it does not stop the competition of the sugar-growers on the other side of the world. It simply transfers the burden of that competition from the shoulders of the growers of sugar to the shoulders of the customers. I am sorry to say that owing to the iniquitous legislation of the Labour party, and the wanton waste and extravagance that has taken place in many Departments, I do not see how, at the present time, there can be effected that reduction of taxation which alone will give the people the real value of their wages. Whatever advance has taken place in wages has been solely due to the great advance in the value of our great primary industries. Out of the £60,000,000 of manufactures, at least £50,000,000 is absolutely dependent on the natural productions of the country, and out of about from £205,000,000 to £206,000,000 of national dividend, as I might call it, over £195,000,000 is derived absolutely from matters that are outside the range of legislatures or individuals. In these circumstances it is extraordinary to hear a man like the honorable member for Darwin talk about the little tail wagging the dog. Unless we are in a game to rob the public, and I decline to join in any such game, I cannot understand honorable members opposite dreaming of associating themselves with the policy of taxation. I know they have done it. There is the plain fact before them. The big rise in prices is to a large extent their tax. Apart from the rise of about 2s. in the £1, which has been world-wide, and for which no party is responsible, there is, at the very least, an additional rise of 5s. in the £1 which is due to taxation alone. Otherwise this sum of £15,000,000 a year could never be paid. Do the Labour party think the bloated importers pay taxes for the mass of the people, and do not get them back from them? If they do, and do not collect them back, they are a body of philanthropists whose names ought to be written in letters of gold, so that the whole mass of the people might bear them in mind. </para>

                    <para>Y- Everybody may have to pay taxes, but at least our duty is to see that those taxes go, not into the pockets of combines or trusts, or favoured individuals, but into the Treasury itself. If that had been done the people would have been saved £1,500,000 in respect of sugar alone. On that subject in other cases we have the report of their own Inter-State Commission, two out of three of the members of which are Protectionists. They point out that under the Tariff 95 per cent. of one trade goes to a little ring or trust. So much then for the attitude of the Labour party so-called, because, really, the more one considers the way they act the less one can excuse it. They may say they mean well, but that excuse ought not to save them from the condemnation of the people. Take again such a matter as defence. Surely if there is one thing which a genuine Labour party ought to regard with the most jealous eye, it is the growth of militarism in a community. If one told a man on the other side of the world that the Labour party. here was advocating militarism, he would immediately ask, " Do they call themselves Labour? How do they palm themselves off as Labour men?" One would reply, " Simply by the repetition of it wherever they go." He would ask, " Surely the public are not deceived by it?" and when one assured him that they were, he would say, " Australia must be a strange place. It is truly the Antipodes, because there you have a self-styled Labour party acting in the reverse way to what they should. We on this side of the world would call them the </para>

                <para class="block">High Tory party." I unhesitatingly assert that, if necessary, every man must bear his share of the defence of the country in which he lives, because the activities on which we all depend, and our very lives, hang on the manner in which we undertake that defence; but we ought to scrutinize carefully the way in which we intend to go about it. I. have no doubt that if honorable members opposite were asked, as a matter of geography, if Australia was an island, they would glibly answer "yes," but, at the same time, they seem to overlook that important fact, seeing that they forget that an effective naval defence would prevent the landing of foreign troops here in any large numbers. And so, instead of voting first for naval defence, they proceed to build up a military force by calling out, not the men, but the children of the country. It is these that this courageous Labour party are seeking to bring into military life. To be associated with such a thing is the greatest possible shame and disgrace to any party calling themselves men. </para>

                    <para>Y. - When solitary confinement has been abolished throughout the civilized world, even in the hulks and convict prisons, surely there ought to. be in this House a party who would abolish this form of punishment in the case of at least children. Deal with the parents if you like - gaol them, or do what you like with them - but do not deal with the children in an inhuman manner. No matter who the man was, even though he was a criminal, I would be against solitary confinement for him, because I know that it breaks down the mind. </para>

It remains for the party on the other side to take action on the hustings against us for desiring to abolish it.

                    <para>Y. - The trouble is, that while my honorable friends think one way, they have to vote the other way. Just to show what solitary confinement means, and how the Judges themselves regard it, I will quote a case in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hood, who wished to be very severe on a prisoner, and said that he proposed to make him feel the real effects of gaol, decreed that the prisoner should spend three days in solitary confinement at the beginning of the third, the sixth, the ninth, the twelfth, and the fifteenth month of the term ; that is only three days at intervals of three months, and a doctor, remember, to visit the man every day to see how his mental health was faring. But here we have a party who made a regulation to put boys up to eighteen years of age in solitary confinement for a period up to ten days, and to be kept there for twenty-two hours out of every twenty-four. If there was any manhood in the party on the other side, they would have swept away a regulation of this sort long ago. I am glad to say that, on our side, at least, an iniquitous regulation of that sort would be utterly swept away, and one result of the coming elections, if they return our party to power, will be that never again will boys convicted merely of an offence against military discipline undergo the awful ordeal of solitary confinement. Fancy lads being in solitary confinement from twenty to twenty-two hours day after day! We have a party of men here who have allowed such a thing to take place. I wish that I could take all the members of that party who have supported this legislation - indeed, if I knew any on this side who have done so, I would do the same thing - and give them from a week to ten days in solitary confinement, so that they might understand the evil of what they were doing to the community. </para>

                        <para>- We have to deal  now  with the question of the big expenditure on defence. As regards boys from fourteen to eighteen years of age, the fact that every other nation has abolished training for them, after trial, is sufficient proof to me that we, also, should not indulge in it. I have consulted dozens of military men, and they are all against the Labour policy of training for boys between those ages. But the party still continued the system, and I do trust that the Liberal party will alter it. I shall never cease fighting until the age is raised to at least eighteen years. I go further, and say that if our defence system is to be a good one, it must be a naval defence. The more we consider the introduction oi aeroplanes and submarines, the more should we give our attention to this matter. Now that it has come out in the newspapers, I will mention that a year ago I was informed that at one of the great naval manoeuvres twelve out of the thirteen battleships were laid low, proving how almost impossible it will be in the near future for any ships filled with soldiers to leave another shore to attack a place surrounded with water. Transport ships, at least, could not do. it in these days of aeroplanes and quick submarines - submarines which, with oil fuel, can go for 1,500 miles, and aeroplanes that can scout out 150 miles, and from an elevation see the smoke of transport ships for another 50 to 100 miles, and come back again in the evening. Our Defence Forces must be prepared to meet small raids of that sort, perhaps from a quick-steaming battleship, and it cannot be much more than that in the near future. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Werriwa is very interesting, but very erratic. He is just about as erratic in his conduct as he is in his arguments. I cannot understand why he spoke at this juncture in this crisis. The situation in which we find ourselves would not have arisen had he displayed any consistency. I understood clearly and distinctly that the last thing he was going to tolerate was a double dissolution. I certainly thought that in a crisis of that character he would have left the Government. What reliance can be placed upon his attitude in regard to militarism? Or what reliance can be placed upon him in connexion with this matter of solitary confinement? He denounced the evil, but he is prepared to support it. He supports the Government who tolerate and put into execution a regulation of this character. It is the only Government, so far, who have put the provision of the Act into operation. </para>

The honorable member has denounced that, and he stopped there with his denunciation. He went a step further. He is not prepared to associate with anybody in connexion with bringing a thing of this sort to an end. We have plenty of time to act before we go to the country.

                    <para>Y.- Oh, yes. Do not contradict me. I am just as accurate as the honorable member was when he was reproving certain honorable members in the corner. Here we have a Parliament which believes that the country needs to be defended, and which, believing that, passed a Defence Bill in which all members of Parliament are specially excluded from the fighting line. We brave and heroic men are to look on while others do the fighting. Who honestly believes that Australia stands in immediate danger of attack on the part of a foreign Power? Surely no section of the Parliament can do so, otherwise provision would have been made to ward off the danger. A country which believed itself to be in imminent danger of assault at the hands of a foreign force would begin at once to train and arm its men. But we are leaving the work to boys. The position is that the Parliament, believing evidently that this attack would take place somewhere in the distant future, has begun with the training of children. This is not the special prerogative of any particular party. The Parliament as a whole is responsible for the present defence system, and we are now told by General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton that it is going to cost us twice as much as was estimated. To defend a territory almost as large as Europe we were to have an army of 100,000 men, at a cost of £2,000,000 per annum. So far, we have not 35,000, yet our land forces are already costing us twice as much, and before we are able to place in the field an armed force of 100,000 men we shall have to face an annual expenditure of £6,000,000. And yet our anti-militarist friend, the honorable member for Werriwa, talks in this way. He is an anti-militarist only in respect of some trifling matter, and not upon the general principle. All that he has said counts for nothing, inasmuch as when he is called upon to vote he is prepared to support the very system that he condemns. The whole system is fizzling out. General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton says that we must have an adequate defence system ; and an adequate defence, if it means anything at all, means a system of defence adequate to protect the territory to be defended. On this question of Supply we are debating various matters. I listened with great attention this afternoon to the Prime Minister, who spoke of patriotic sacrifices. I admire him. There can be no doubt about it; we are a band of patriots ! We eulogize and sometimes denounce each other ! The honorable member for Darwin has a great regard for the Treasurer. The Treasurer, unquestionably, is a fine and noble character. He is the noble opulent gentleman who denounces the maternity grant because it means extracting certain moneys from the wrong people and giving it to the wrong people. But the right honorable gentleman did not object to draw a pension from the Imperial Government for many years. God knows what the pension was for; but the fact remains that he drew it, and that he had no scruples about drawing it, although it represented money extracted from men and women in the slums of London and Liverpool. It was extracted from the struggling millions, but he had no scruples about taking it. </para>

                    <para>Y.- Very well. That fits the bill just the same. The right honorable member was prepared to take this pension from the Government of a State, which had well rewarded him for his services. The receiving of that pension did not undermine his moral fibre. It was not a mere allowance of £5. By way of the pension which he drew he took in one year far more than is paid to scores and scores of poor women in respect of the maternity allowance, and which undoubtedly is doing good service. The Prime Minister this afternoon talked about the fine work the Government had done. They had been twelve months in office, and yet had not got rid of the surplus left to them by the Labour Government!  His  position is very like that of the man who, starting off with £6, finishes up with £1, and then claims that he has wound up with a surplus of £1 because he has not got rid of the whole £6. The speech made by the honorable gentleman this afternoon was in striking contrast to that which he delivered recently at Mount Gambier, where he talked of the immense responsibility with which the Government were loaded. He spoke there of its growing expenditures from day to day and month to month, and said, "I do not know how to cope with it. What we are going to do with the Post Office, I do not know. Its expenditure is going up by leaps and bounds, and I feel myself incapable of dealing with it in any shape or form." That was the confession of this great administrator. This capable man admits from a public platform that he is confronted with a situation which he does not know how to meet. Then he says that the revenues of the Commonwealth are declining. In other words, the revenue is declining while we have in power a Government which said that a Labour Administration would be ruinous to the progress of Australia. No sooner had the Liberal party got into power than the revenue of the Commonwealth began to decline. How do they explain that fact? The Treasurer tried to explain it with the statement, " How can our revenue grow in view of the increasing number of strikes and the industrial unrest which is multiplying?" And so, under a Liberal Administration, which was to restore industrial peace, we are told that strikes and industrial unrest generally are on the increase. Then the Government talk of their policy. Where is it ? What have they attempted to do ? As I have previously pointed out, if the Government had possessed a clear, -well-defined policy, and had believed that it would be beneficial to the country, it would have sought all the kudos that would unquestionably attach to it by trying to give legislative effect to it. If this Government had had such a policy, it would have sought to give legislative effect to it, and would have thrown upon the obstructive Opposition, as they call us, the onus - of opposing it. But from the moment of their coming into power they have not attempted to introduce into this Chamber any important or progressive legislation. What has become of their proposal for a scheme of national insurance against unemployment and ill health ? What, too, has become of their battle cry - especially in this State - at the last election regarding the rectification of Tariff anomalies? They said that in the very first session of Parliament they would rectify Tariff anomalies if they were returned to power. They have made no effort to do so. They have given no evidence of their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> They have no constructive policy, and never had any. They are the quintessence of reactionary legislators. They desire now to go to the country without presenting a financial statement, so that, if possible, they may come back with a majority and carry out their reactionary projects. And yet the Prime Minister talks of patriotic sacrifices and of the necessity for a Parliament that will go on with business ! What business do the Government propose? If they had an absolute majority in this House - even if they had not to meet the Labour party here - would they do anything of a progressive character? No. They are absolutely sterile of any progressive policy. That is the situation with which we are faced. The Prime Minister asked this afternoon, "Where is the Labour party's policy?" When the honorable member was asked before the last election what his policy was, he said, " To get the Labour party out of office." If the honorable member asks me what our policy is, I say that it is to do the same good turn to the Liberals. The aim of the forthcoming contest will be to give one party or other a definite majority, so that they may do something to prove themselves. That is what we have come to after eighteen months of battling. A Government that would tolerate occupying the benches for eighteen months, and doing nothing all that time should, and must, go to the country. </para>

                    <para>.- I am rather disappointed to think that members have been compelled to go to the country without the Government having taken some action in regard to the operations of the Beef Trust. Last session, I brought under the notice of the Government the importance of taking some action of that kind, and asked them if they would take into consideration the appointment of a Commission to inquire into the matter. But rather than do that, they preferred to appoint one or two other Commissions to deal with matters of infinitely less importance than this matter of the Beef Trust. </para>

                    <para>E.- No; but I think the honorable member for Echuca was looking for that position. The appointment of a Commissioner to take evidence on this subject is an altogether inadequate way of dealing with a great question. The meat industry is one of the greatest in Australia, and if honorable members have power to safeguard it, it is their duty to do so. Instead of one Commissioner being appointed, this work should have been undertaken by the Inter-State Commission, who could have collected the evidence much more speedily than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Street, and in all probability we would have been in a position to bring forward legislation which would prevent the American Beef Trust obtaining that hold on Australia, which it will have before any effective legislation can be passed under the circumstances which the Government have created. A branch of the Beef Trust, Armour and Company, have just opened a registered office in Brisbane, and another branch, Morris and </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Company, have purchased 480 acres of country adjoining the holding of Swift and Company. Other firms which are now operating in Australia will, in a year or two, be doing very little business. The trust are in a position to give a much better price for beef than other exporters to the London market can give. We were told by members of the Government, notably the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and the Minister of Trade and Customs, that the Government have power to deal with the Beef Trust, and we find that they are going to close this Parliament without any effort to do so. It is all very well for the Government to tell us that they intend to appoint a Commission to take evidence in regard to the condition of the meat trade, but they are doing this only to stave off the evil day. When the Government are in a position to bring forward legislation the trust will have control of the meat trade in Australia, and, having a monopoly, will not be afraid of any legislation that may be passed. In my opinion, their policy in this matter is alone sufficient to condemn the present Government. This is a matter of vital importance to the people. The meat industry has grown very considerably during the last few years, and yet the whole of the benefits of the trade are about to pass into one of the greatest trusts in the world. We are well acquainted with the history of this trust in America, Argentine, and Great Britain, and as they have ruined the trade in those countries, we feel convinced they will do the same thing in Australia. We are told by our opponents that cattle and sheep are bringing a better price to-day than they were previous to the trust coming to Australia. We are well aware of that. That is usually the case in a country when the trust make their first appearance. They raise the prices to the grower, and consequently the price of meat naturally increases. But when they have assumed control of the trade, the retail price of meat is never reduced, but the price to the cattle grower is always reduced. This is a matter which should have engaged the attention of the Government, and safeguards should have been adopted to prevent those people repeating the same tactics in this country as hey have pursued in other parts of the world. The export trade from Australia last year increased by 12 per cent. as compared with the previous year. That is not a very great increase, but when an industry of that description shows such an increase, there is need for the Legislature to give attention to the matter. In 1912, 1,700,000 head of cattle were slaughtered in Australia, and with a proportionate increase in 1913, the slaughtering is far exceeding the growing which is taking place. If legislation is not brought forward to protect the cattle-growing industry, we shall find in a year or two that we are not growing sufficient cattle for our own consumption, and, instead of looking to other countries to buy our surplus meat, we will not have sufficient for ourselves. </para>

                    <para>E. - In some parts of the world the people do pay 2s. 6d. for prime cuts, and at the rate the price is increasing in Australia, it is quite possible that we will be paying something like that price here. The honorable member for Werriwa said that we are looking to the other countries of the world to buy our meat, wool, hides, tallow, and other exports. But. the American Beef Trust will take very good care that no hides, tallow, or meat of any description shall be sold to the people of any other country except through them. </para>

                    <para>E.- What they did in America is what they propose doing here. Legislatures in other parts of the world are giving some attention to this great question. In the Argentine Republic we find the people prepared to exercise their legislative powers to effectively deal with the operations of this trust. Five of the nine meat works in existence in the Argentine are controlled by the American Beef Trust at the present time, and not content with that, we find from the latest accounts from that country, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> of the 15th May last, that they have secured the whole of the refrigerating space provided by the steam-ship companies trading between the Argentine and America. That is one of the tactics adopted by the trust to keep out competitors from any country in which they are operating. We understand that three or four ships have been ordered for the Australian trade, and it is clear that they intend to do the same kind of thing in this country. Swift and Company have already started operations in Queensland. They began on the 1st of this month, slaughtering 150 head of cattle per day, and they will be in a position to slaughter 1,000 head of cattle per day if the supply is forthcoming. The other people, Armour and Company, have works treating stock for them. In my opinion, they have secured control of the Lake's Creek works, because meat shipped from those works is now being branded with Armour's brand. The manager of the Lake's Creek works has made a statement to the effect that Armour and Company have not secured control of the works, and that they are merely selling their meat to these people. But the fact remains that the meat is being exported with the brand, " Armour and Company, Rockhampton, Queensland." They are shipping meat to the United States, where the price is higher than in any other country in the world, and it is clear that the profit which these people are making out of Australian meat at the present time is something enormous. This trade could he secured for the benefit of the Australian people, if proper legislation was passed by this Parliament. Morris and Company are also about to start works in Queensland, so that these three powerful branches of the American Beef Trust will shortly bo operating in Australia. These three names are commonly used by the trust in securing control of any new country in which they discover that a plentiful supply of meat is available. Last year Australia and the Argentine exported to the Smithfield market 744,109 tons of meat, which represents about three-fourths of the whole of the meat supply of the London market. In 1906, the average weight of stock slaughtered in Queensland was 666 lbs., whilst in 1912 the average weight had dropped to 5S0 lbs. These figures show that our cattle industry is gradually deteriorating, and that Ave are now slaughtering immature cattle. Unless the Government bring forward legislation to prevent the slaughter of immature cattle, our meat supply will decrease more rapidly than would otherwise be the case. Although in 1912 we slaughtered 556,000 cattle, the number of hides sold on the market was only 343,000. The reason for this was that many of the cattle slaughtered were immature, and their hides could only be classed as skins. This is a matter of great importance, and one to which the Government should give strict attention. We should waste no time in passing the legislation necessary to deal with it. When the statistics for 1913 are received we shall find that we have been slaughtering far more stock than we grew during the year. We know that our export of meat has considerably increased, and we must conclude that the growth of our stock was not as great as in the previous year. We are slaughtering two-year-old cattle to-day, when for consumption we should not slaughter cattle until they are four years old. We might have protected the industry to some extent under the Agricultural Bureau Bill, and if we had done so we would have had a greater supply of meat for the outside markets of the world. We should endeavour to secure the markets of the world for the Australian producers, and should not permit foreigners of any description to come to our shores and rob us of this great opportunity to benefit our stock-owners. The Government should have taken this matter into consideration at a very much earlier period of the session. Their delay in dealing with the matter proves that they are not serious in their professed intentions with regard to it. The American Beef Trust is undoubtedly the greatest trust in the world. One of its main resources of power is found in its attachment to one political party. Looking into the history of the trust we find that it has subscribed very liberally to the funds of a particular political "party. Its nominees have been accepted by the party, and on many occasions elected. In 1906 Armour and Company subscribed no less than $400,000 to the funds of a political party in America. We have to take into account the influence which may be brought to bear by this powerful trust upon a political party in Australia. They can protect themselves by subscribing largely to political funds. The present Government have hesitated to deal with the operations of this combine so long that we are forced to the conclusion that it may be doing something of the same description in Australia. </para>

We know that from the office in which it was formed in Brisbane a large sum of money has gone to the funds of one political party. </para>

                    <para>E. - The gentleman to whom I refer found it convenient to leave Australia on a trip to Europe immediately the Commission was appointed. We know that the financial head of the trust in America, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dawes,</inline> is closely associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lorimer,</inline> who is the guiding star of a party in politics there, and who is one of its great fighters in Congress whenever the operations of the trust happen to come under review. The business of the trust has frequently been before Congress of late, and has been very severely criticised. Yet, on account of the great influence which it can exercise, nothing has been done in the way of bringing forward fresh legislation regarding it. Its ramifications have greatly exercised the minds of the people, and have reduced many persons to abject poverty. Owing to the ruinous tactics pursued by the trust, men have been compelled to commit suicide. I feel confident that it is the intention of this great octopus to capture the whole of the meat trade of Australia. In my opinion, it will have very little opposition to face in that trade within the next year or two. Now that honorable members are about to appeal to the country, we shall not have much opportunity of preventing its operations. </para>

                    <para>E.- Yes; but I am not going to give them to the honorable member at the present time. Had the Minister brought forward the Bill which he proposed to introduce it was my intention to have thrown out the suggestions which I have in my mind. One of the things which the Minister of Trade and Customs will have to do in the near future is to establish branches of the Statistical Department in each of the States. It is now the middle of the year, and we have not yet the figures relating to the slaughterings for 1913. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> says that he cannot obtain them from the other States because they are not agreeable to act under his instructions. It will be necessary to secure those figures before much in the way of legislation can be brought forward. I shall be glad to know whether the present Government, if returned to power, will introduce proposals dealing with this matter at an -early date. At the same time I feel that they will be denied the opportunity of doing so. I am convinced that it will be the -members of the late Government upon whom will devolve the task of submitting legislative proposals in this connexion. </para>

At the present time we know that the American Beef Trust practically controls the London meat market. Until it has absolute control of that market, and of the Australian meat market, the prices on the London market will remain so low that the Australian exporter will be prevented from exporting meat to the Old Country because he can get a better price for his article locally than he can obtain for it in London. It is admitted in the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoralists' Review</inline> that the Beef Trust has absolute control of the London meat market. </para>

                    <para>.- To-day the Leader of the Opposition made it clear that when the elections occur, the Labour party again, as they did at the elections in May last, will pledge themselves to effective Protection. The Prime Minister, in reply to that statement, placed before the Committee the opinions expressed by the delegates at the Hobart Conference, held in 1912, and read from the official report, of the proceedings the motion submitted to give effect to effective Protection. It is a remarkable thing that in all the speeches the Prime Minister quoted in order to show that the Labour movement is against Protection, not one word was uttered against the principle of Protection, and that the speeches show that the majority of those connected with the Labour movement are opposed to giving high protective duties to manufacturers while sweating conditions are permitted in the industries protected. Every man and woman in the Labour movement is in favour of an effective system of Protection, and in order that we might bring about that form of effective Protection in which we, as a party, believe, we asked the people of Australia to so alter the Constitution as to -allow the National Parliament to pass the necessary industrial legislation to bring it about. We appealed to the people in 1911, and on a second, occasion in 1913, but, unfortunately for the manufacturers and the workers engaged in the industries, the electors did not respond to our appeal. After the 1911 appeal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> at Maryborough, made a clear and definite promise that if the Constitution was not altered in the direction advocated by the Labour party, his party, if returned, to power, would immediately bring about effective Protection; and to-night again, speaking on behalf of the Labour party, the right honorable gentleman has repeated that assurance. The Prime Minister has questioned the sincerity of that promise, and quoted the opinions of the delegates at the Conference referred to; but it was recognised at the Hobart Conference that there was but slight difference between the idea that the mover of the motion had regarding effective Protection and new Protection. It was the opinion of the majority of the delegates that the plank then on the Labour platform, that of new Protection, was sufficiently in accord with the views of the majority of the electors. We knew at the time that we intended again to ask the people of Australia to alter the Constitution. The honorable member for Werriwa has accused the Labour party of being responsible for the high Tariff that he declares is in operation; he throws the whole responsibility for the high Tariff on the shoulders of the Labour party because of the votes of members of the party in this Parliament; whereas at the last election almost every newspaper in Australia said that the Labour party were responsible for the fact that there was not an effective system of Protection in operation in the Commonwealth. So there we have two different opinions as to the effect of the attitude of the Labour party towards the Tariff. I am certain that if, as the result of the approaching appeal to the people, the Labour party secure a majority, one of the first acts of the Labour Government will be to revise the Tariff with a view to giving more effective Protection to many of our industries. Such a step would only be consistent with our advocacy of industrial legislation. The honorable member for Darwin to-night referred to the fact that in Japan, in some industries, workmen are paid 9d. or ls. a day. I do not intend to take Japanese competition into serious consideration at the present time. Our principal competitors in the manufacturing industries are probably Great Britain, Germany, and America. We say that industrial legislation is necessary to put our manufacturers under equal conditions in regard to competition. Under the old system of freedom of contract, one manufacturer, to compete with advantage with his rivals, would try to obtain labour as cheaply as possible, and to obtain still further advantage adulteration would be resorted to. Our industrial legislation was designed to prevent this, and to give every man and woman engaged in manufacturing decent conditions, regular hours, and fair wages. Laws passed to this end operate in every State. Yet honorable members supporting the Government, who say that they favour such legislation, advocate the removal of protective duties which prevent the manufacturers of sweated labour from being imported to compete unfairly with local manufactures. The honorable member for Werriwa, a Government supporter, says that the abolition of protective duties would decrease taxation. The abolition of protective duties might cheapen many articles in general consumption. It might, for instance, "make mining machinery cheaper. But it would also lessen the employment in the engineering trade, and in many other industries. . </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The honorable member for Werriwa tells us that the  President  of the United States of America has come definitely to the conclusion that the protective Tariff of his country has brought into existence the great trusts and combines which operate there to-day, and that they can be got rid of only by altering it. Congress has, at his suggestion, reduced the duties, although the Tariff still remains higher than that of Australia. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woodrow</inline> Wilson was elected  President,  the American Tariff was almost prohibitive, and under it the great manufactures of the country were built up. If we leave our ports open to the imports of countries where labour in comparison with Australian labour may be said to be sweated, we shall do great injustice to our manufacturers, and to every man and woman who depends on them for a livelihood. The Tariff question will be an important issue at the election, and one on which the people should rivet their attention. If a Court or a Wages Board decided that the operatives in any industry should work only six hours a day, and be paid 15s. a day, that decision would be of no value if, as the result of an ineffective Tariff, there were no work to be got in the trade concerned. We have always advocated effective industrial legislation in the form of new Protection, but, to enable the country to get the full benefit of such legislation, manufacturing must be in a prosperous condition, and the manufacturers must be protected from unfair competition of rivals abroad. It was the first duty of the National Parliament to give this protection. Every Fusion candidate in Victoria at the last election said that! it would be the first duty of his party, if returned to power, to alter the Tariff, but no attempt has been made by the Cook Government to do that. Ministers promised the people that they would bring in Protection, and would establish sound financial economies ; but, instead of dealing with national questions, they commenced by trying to pick a quarrel with the Opposition, in order to bring about the dissolution of both Houses of the Parliament. The measure introduced to bring about the dissolution was that for the abolition of preference to unionists in Government employment. As a trade unionist, I have always held that if there are any in the community deserving of preference, they are the members of unions, who have fought for, and paid for, the bettering of working conditions. But as a measure on which to dissolve both Houses of the National Parliament I say that the Bill was not worth the paper on which it was written. The question is not a national one; but this "shadow of a sham" was introduced of set purpose. The majority of honorable members on this side had the honour of being trade unionists before they were members of Parliament; and under no circumstances could they accept a measure that meant anything in the way of an attack on the principle of unionism. Although this Bill did not affect a great number of people, I was bitterly opposed to it, because if it were allowed to pass without opposition it would have been regarded by some people as an indication that, in a certain degree, we were prepared to swallow our principles. The great show-card of the Government at the last election was a system of national insurance to provide against unemployment, accident, and general disasters to workers. What has become of that proposal? There are people who are unfeeling enough to say that there are no unemployed in Victoria ; but in the metropolitan area to-day there are between 6,000 and 7,000. If the Government were desirous of carrying out the principal planks of their platform, why did they not introduce their measure for national insurance? Had such a measure been introduced with, the object of alleviating the hardships undergone by the average working man, all honorable members on this side would have been only too pleased to give it whole-hearted support. But the Government never had any intention to give effect to such a system. It is generally admitted, and it was recognised by the Attorney-General and every supporter of the Government, that the Constitution does not give Parliament the power to pass a measure of the kind. An appeal is to be made to the electors ; but we have no proposal to alter the Constitution, though I have no doubt that a system of national insurance will again be the trump-card of the Government. Even if the Government were returned to power on that issue, what would be the result? The Bill would be placed on the statute-book, but it would receive the same treatment at the hands of the High Court that was given to the Excise Tariff Act, the Trades Union Marks Act, and the Seamen's Compensation Act. I ask the Attorney-General whether he considers that this Parliament has the necessary power to give effect to a system of national insurance as advocated by his party at the last election? This is a question on which the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister should be absolutely candid. When the Attorney-General opened his campaign, he proclaimed from every platform that the Liberal Government, if returned, would abolish the system of old-age pensions. He also said that he did not approve of the maternity allowance, and would substitute something better in the shape of national insurance. </para>

At the outset of his election campaign the Attorney-General tried to direct the attention of the people to the importance of the Government scheme of national insurance; and at the latter end of the campaign he was asked by one of his audience whether he considered there was the necessary constitutional power to give effect to it. Up to then the honorable gentleman had never expressed any doubt; but when he was brought face to face with the question he made the reply, " I believe we have that power ; but, if not, we shall ask the people of Australia to give the power by an alteration of the Constitution." </para>

We shall never have a proper protective system until the people have the power of controlling the Parliament. The present Government cannot claim to have introduced any protective policy whatever. If they sincerely wish to introduce a protective Tariff, let them take the business out of the hands of the Inter-State Commission, or make the Commission hand in a report on certain matters that can be dealt with. If they say that our Government did not bring in a definite and full Tariff, I will admit it; but many articles were dealt with by us in the 1910 and 1911 Tariffs. Those measures were not merely a rectification of anomalies, but benefited many trades and callings. It is only by a technical legal twisting of the Constitution, and the bringing in a Bill that was a farce and a fraud, that the Government have brought us before the people. The Prime Minister said we went out with a majority of ten at the last elections, and came back in a minority of one. As a matter of fact, we did not lose in actual numbers.

On the other hand, the Ministerial party in the Senate went out fourteen strong, and came back only seven strong, thus losing 50 per cent. in a House of which the franchise is more equitable in its incidence than the franchise of this House. On the other hand, our increase in that Chamber was 175 per cent., let me remind the Prime Minister. He also said that we boasted that we had done away with borrowing, and taunted us with having actually incurred a debt of £9,000,000 through the note issue. Was ever such a ridiculous statement made? The present Treasurer has gone out of his way to insist on a gold reserve of 25 per cent. up to £7,000,000, and pound for pound after that. </para>

                    <para>Y.- I shall prove that the Treasurer has not kept himself posted in what the world is doing in reference to its gold reserve in comparison to its liabilities. When the banks held the gold, it was supposed to be held only against the note issue, but it must not be forgotten that they had a large fluid liability in the shape of current accounts or deposits at call. In addition, every deposit receipt held by the Associated Banks at interest was a liability upon them. I <inline font-style="italic">propose to</inline> show that it is ridiculous to say that the money raised by the note issue was a loan. It is bringing in interest to the Commonwealth, because a large portion of it has been lent to the States. This is the first time that any British Dominion has ever been so fortunately placed. <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Insurance and Banking Record,</inline> for 1909 shows that the notes in circulation by all the banks in the Australian States before the Commonwealth note issue entered into competition with them totalled £3,397,677. Adding the Treasury notes issued by the State of Queensland to the amount of £1,540,103, we get a sum total of £4,937,880 of notes issued. That has been doubled. So that at the present moment, to quote from the same authority at page 424, the Australian notes issued here are £9,765,131½, the half note being a 10s. note. It shows that the note issues have more than doubled. It shows that, possibly, not a fair tax was paid on the notes that were issued by the financial institutions. Otherwise, how in so short a time could such an increase of notes be utilized throughout the length and breadth of Australia ? </para>

                    <para>Y. - I have some little knowledge, but do not want to go into details. I was in a bank for seven years, and therefore I know something about the matter. What I want to show is that, whereas the banks had a certain amount of gold, they had many liabilities. But the gold reserve which the Treasurer is holding up to 46 per cent. - 43.85 per cent, at the present moment - is one which no country in the world has ever had. The only liabilities against that issue are the notes. There are no current accounts, no deposits at call, no deposits at interest. There are none of the liabilities which mount up to the banks, and which in hours of need and trouble that we hope will never come again are unrealizable when they try to bring in their advances. I propose to quote from page 204 of the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian Insurance and Banking Record</inline> for 1909 to show the ridiculousness of the Treasurer holding a gold reserve of 43.85 per cent. - </para>

Well, the experience of the world must, on a very large scale, bo very much what ours is. We buy and sell hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of securities in a year, and how much gold do we handle? Practically none. A little small change is needed for retail purposes, but to .have more than a pound or two in coin in your pocket is a positive nuisance. What we want is a good banking balance. 'That means gold,' many will say; but it means nothing of the kind. You could get gold, doubtless, if you were silly enough to burden yourself with it; but, then, you do not do anything of the kind. It may be said that your bank keeps your gold for you ; but we know of an instance where a Sydney bank cleared many tens of thousands in cheques in a day, and at the close of business its difference settled at the clearing was infinitesimal. There are in New South Wales banks £18.000,000 in current accounts and £26,000,000 in deposits at interest, and the banking transactions in the course of the year run up to fully £500,000,000; but the gold banks hold is less than £10,000,000, and we could double the banking deposits and pass £1,000,000,000 in cheques through the banks with a smaller stock of gold than they hold to-day." </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Any statist shows that, as regards the transactions of the New York Stock Exchange for one month only, the whole of the gold, silver, and copper currency in the world could not settle them. Quoting from page 929 of the same volume, the gold reserve of all the banks was £26,000,000, but they had- total liabilities of £122,000,000- namely, current notes, £4,900,000; deposits at call, £45,000,000 ; deposits at interest, £69,000,000; that is, only 21 per cent, as against 40 per cent., or to be more accurate 43.85- per cent, which the Treasurer wants to hold against the Australian notes. I intend to show that whereas the whole of the gold in the banks of Australia at that time was £26,000,000, the amounts dealt with by the clearing house for Melbourne from 13th April to 11th May, 1914, totalled over £27,000,000, and the balances, which were settled by certificates - that is IOU's, so to speak, which are generally printed on parchment, going up to £1,000 in value - amounted to £1,700,000. The actual balance of that huge amount settled in coin was only £1,119,000. Although the settlement in coin was not 5 per cent. , yet the Treasurer says that we ought to keep a big balance of 43.85 per cent. That means that forty-three sovereigns must be kept for every £100 of a certain currency. There is not a banking institution that could possibly exist to-day if it were carried out in such a stupid and blundering fashion. No country yet has succeeded in being great that has had a Free Trade policy. The trade of Great Britain in the earliest part of last century was built upon possibly the strongest Protectionist Tariff that it has had. Out of the 200 death penalties which then degraded the statute -book, seventy-five were for breaches of the Customs and Excise Acts. Take the history of any country in the world. Whenever manufactories have sprung up in the cities they have become populous, rich, and dominant. But according to the Boeotian intellect, as the old Greeks termed it, the country that had no manufactures, no Protection, generally failed, and fell to the lot of being conquered by the stronger nations around it. The case of </para>
                <para class="block">England itself I have mentioned. The United States of America has built up by Protection its greatness, not by any means perfect, but which will become perfect. By the power that is now causing an absolute revolution in the form of the referendum and initiative, that protective policy will be carried out. The present Government would not dare to sit on the Treasury bench, nor would any such Government be there if the people had only the power by the referendum and the initiative of insisting upon a Tariff being brought into the House. What an absurd act it was for the Government to refer the Tariff to a Commission of three members. I certainly admit that the long experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer</inline> justified his appointment to the Inter-State Commission. I feel perfectly sure that the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs will agree with me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer</inline> never betrayed partisanship on any side of politics. </para>

                    <para>Y.- That is so.  His  backbone must have been of that " gelatinous compound " to which the Attorney-General referred when describing the Liberal party's policy. He had not the courage to grasp the honour conferred upon him, but withdrew from the position. I say " fiddlesticks to such a man!" The electors of Australia would not elect a man of that type to the position of  Chairman  of the Commission. Coming to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> I have to say at once that he is a personal friend of mine, but in politics we must express our opinions regardless of considerations of friendship, and I have yet to learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> was ever a Protectionist. There is not one dominant Protectionist on the Inter-State Commission. I should not mind if we had a genuine Free Trader and an out and out Protectionist on the Commission, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer</inline> to hold the balance between them. A wise and cynical old German once said that if the making of this earth had been placed in the hands of a Commission, we should never have had it, and I am afraid that the Government intrusted the Inter-State Commission with the work of inquiring into Tariff anomalies in order to delay their rectification. Has any member of the Government definitely stated that he will support a Protectionist policy? </para>

On the other hand, every member of the Labour party is pledged to the policy of the new Protection, which will ultimately dominate the whole of Australia, and which will be stiffened and given a backbone if we adopt the initiative and referendum. With the initiative and referendum there can be no question of the " ins " and the " outs." The sovereign power of the people will prevail. Until it was mentioned by the honorable member for Darwin, no one here - not even the United States Consul - was aware of what had taken place regarding the direct election of United States senators. That has been brought about by the initiative and referendum, which has spread over most of the western States and a large proportion of the eastern States. At the present moment 283 cities in the United States of America possess that power, and the revolution which Has thus been brought about is as great as was that which followed the freeing of the slaves.

                    <para>. - I am just wondering how big my boot  is. However, I do wish to treat these Bills in a very much more ceremonious manner, and with greater courtesy and consideration, than our little Bill was treated in another place when we sent it hence. Whatever differences of opinion we may have, I hope that we shall always consider communications from another place with the courtesy they deserve. </para>

                    <para>.- I thank the Prime Minister for his statement, hut this is not a little Bill. It is a national Bill, dealing with an amendment of the Constitution, which this Parliament cannot by itself determine. The matter must be determined by the verdict of the electors of Australia, and all we are asking is that Parliament shall afford the citizens an opportunity to say whether they desire to amend the Constitution or not. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Leader of the Opposition said that these were national Bills, and must be decided elsewhere than in this House. He said that these are not "little" Bills, as was the one sent forward by the Senate. Has the honorable member withdrawn the statement which he made in this House, that that Bill was a matter of very considerable importance, or is it still a little Bill as compared with these ? I think my right honorable friend characterized the Government Preference Prohibition Bill as a matter of vital principle; now he says it was a little Bill. These Bills which are now before us are important, and they have to be decided elsewhere, just as that other matter of vital principle has to. be decided elsewhere. I repeat that we shall treat these measures with the respect and courtesy which their importance deserves, and will not attempt' to give them a twelve-inch boot. </para>
