                    <para>. - I desire to raise a matter of privilege, to have it decided by the House. It arises out of the incident to which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have just referred. There are really two points of privilege on which, with the concurrence of the Leader of the Opposition and my friends on this side of the Chamber, I desire to take the opinion of the House. One point is, that every member who rises in his place, and says that he desires to raise a point of privilege, has the right to have that point heard. </para>

                    <para>- I make a personal appeal to honorable members not to interject during the discussion that is now proceeding, so that I may thoroughly understand what is being said. A good deal of the trouble that arises now and again is due to the action of honorable members on one side or the other, who, becoming excited and heated, or for some other reason, exchange interjections, across the chamber. I appeal to honorable members to refrain from doing that now, and to allow me to deal with this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I bring this matter forward in a spirit which C hope will not provoke antagonism of any kind from either side. The first point that I raise is that, no matter what may have occurred, when an honorable member rises in his place, as the honorable member for Richmond did last  night and  addresses the  Speaker,  desiring to raise the question of privilege, it is his right to have the opportunity to state what the question of privilege is. My second point is one of equal importance to the members of the House, and with the concurrence of my honorable friends, I propose to place it in a motion which may be promptly dealt with by the House. I invite the House to decide a question which I submit is essential to its privileges. My motion is as follows : - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>That the right to appeal to the House from any ruling of the  Speaker  by objection in writing and motion, under standing order 287, is the privilege of every member or the House, and that it is essential to the maintenance of that privilege that the  Speaker  should submit the motion in the form in which the member puts it, and should not refuse to put any such motion on the ground that, in his opinion, it does not correctly state the facts or the nature of the ruling, and that the House on such motion should determine all such questions. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">What that motion is intended to convey is, that it is the inherent privilege of every member of the House, no matter what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling may be, to take the mode prescribed by the Standing Orders for appealing from it. The full effect of that appeal would be seriously jeopardized if the  Speaker  were entitled to decide any question arising in connexion with the appeal. If there be a difference of opinion between the member who raises the point and the  Speaker  as to the facts on which he founds his objection, that is a difference of opinion which I submit ought not to be decided by the  Speaker.  The honorable member who raises the point of privilege should be able to submit a motion to the House in the language that he may choose, and it is for the House to decide all questions which arise. The recent occasion which gave rise to the motion was a motion moved by the honorable member for Richmond to disagree with a ruling which you, sir, had given. You ruled out of order certain remarks which the honorable member for Wimmera was addressing to an amendment which had been proposed by me on a Bill then before the House. It is quite unnecessary in this matter to express any opinion on the merits of that ruling, which may have been right or may have been wrong. My point is that the honorable member for Richmond, having used the opportunity given by standing order 287 to 3tate his objections in writing and to move a motion based upon them, those objections, as taken by him, and as expressed in the language used hy him, whether right or wrong, should be the appeal which should be put to the House. You, sir, on many occasions have very properly, if I may say so, refused to allow any discussion of your ruling in a debate that is proceeding, telling honorable members that they have their appeal Under the Standing Orders. This appeal being the appeal of the honorable member to be decided by the House, no part of it, and nothing connected with it, should be decided by the  Speaker.  It may be that the honorable member who takes the objection misheard the ruling, or did not understand what was actually said, or misapprehended the facts upon which the ruling was given. Any of these mistakes or differences of opinion may be involved ; but if the privilege of appealing is to be effective, it is for the House, and not for the  Speaker,  to decide these questions. With the concurrence of the Leader of the Opposition I submit the motion which I have read, and hope to secure the formal expression of the opinion of the House as to whether the freedom to which I have referred is not necessary for the maintenance of one of our most important privileges. </para>

                        <para>- There is an inherent power in the  Speaker  of any assembly to see that its rules are not abused. If the  Speaker  is convinced that honorable members are using the Standing Orders to abuse the forms of the House, he has an inherent power to prevent it. If, as the Prime Minister suggests, honorable member after honorable member rose obviously merely to disturb the proceedings of the House, and for no other reason, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has the power to restore order. But what actually took place was that the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-style="italic">lond fide</inline> submitted a motion to disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling. There was no obstruction. The honorable member wrote out his motion at the table and submitted it. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> having read it, stated that it did not correctly represent your ruling. That, in substance, is what you said. The honorable member for Richmond proceeded to submit  that an honorable member who sought to appeal to the House had the right to state in his own language what was his objection, and to leave it to the House to decide the matter against him if he were wrong. </para>

                        <para>- It is for the House to decide whether an honorable member has misrepresented the Speaker&#39;s ruling. No one has the right to misrepresent the ruling of the  Speaker,  or to make any other misrepresentation. The question is whether, under the Standing Orders, it is for the  Speaker  or for the House to decide the point. If the honorable member for Richmond misrepresented your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> it was for the House, in its wisdom, to decide that by rejecting his motion; but the honorable member had the right to have his . motion put. He claimed the only mode of appeal that was open to him. When you stated that you would not put to the House the motion in the form in which the honorable member for Richmond wished to submit it, the honorable member rose, saying, &#34; On a question of privilege, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.&#34;</inline> You required him to resume his seat, which he did. He rose again and said, &#34; On a question of privilege, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.&#34;</inline> You would not hear him, but named him, and he was suspended for the remainder of the sitting. If lie had been permitted to state his question of privilege, he -would have stated the question which I now move on behalf of my honorable friends on this side, asking the House to decide the point. Honorable members will see that this is a substantive motion, which affects one of the most important rights of honorable members of this House. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. Honorable members opposite, in the last Parliament, when they were in power, ruthlessly brought into operation the &#34; gag &#34; provisions of the Standing Orders. They even applied the &#34;gag&#34; when an honorable member was in the middle of a sentence, and prevented honorable members expressing their opinions on legislation of a far-reaching character. Further, when as some of us submitted, the &#34; gag &#34; was applied in defiance of the Standing Orders, honorable members opposite would not sanction a motion dissenting from the Speaker&#39;s ruling to be submitted, and when one was submitted, what did they do? They took the business out of the Speaker&#39;s hands, and put the notice of motion at the bottom of the business-paper, with the result that, from that day to this, it has not been discussed. </para>

                        <para>- It shows the difficulty of inventing some new species of &#34;gag&#34; not in the Standing Orders. I submit that the &#34; gag &#34; provisions were abused in the last Parliament. But what was the position? When it was considered by some honorable members that the &#34; gag &#34; was being abused a notice of dissent from the Speaker&#39;s ruling was submitted. It has been the universal practice that such a motion shall take precedence of all other business on the next sitting day, but honorable members opposite, who were then in power, although there was this challenge hanging over the Speaker&#39;s head, took the matter out of that gentleman&#39;s hands, and put the notice of motion at the bottom of the business-paper in order to prevent its discussion. And what do honorable members opposite desire now? They are making an appeal to the fairness of the House, and they wish the House to decide matters of dispute with the  Speaker.  In the last Parliament, however, they did not desire that the House should have any such right. I was not allowed to give adequate expression to my views on the Speaker&#39;s ruling then, and the session was closed&#39; without there being any discussion on the motion&#39;. Last night the Leader of the Opposition, with his hotheadedness, got into a tangle with the  Speaker. </para>

As much as any honorable member, I object to. encroachments by the  Speaker  upon any privileges of individual members. It matters not to me whether those encroachments be made by a  Speaker  who comes from the party to which I belong, or a  Speaker  who comes from the other side. </para>

The point I wish to arrive at is, that if this motion had come from a new member, say &#34;the honorable member for Balaclava, it would have appealed to me, but because of the source from which it comes, it makes absolutely no appeal to me, because I know what the honorable member for Flinders did last session, when a man who. when he was on the Government benches, would not consider the rights of an Opposition member, and now because he finds himself a little bit cribbed, cabined, and confined by the action of a Government who will not resort to the &#34; gag,&#34; but give unlimited scope for expressions of opinion, submits a motion such as this, I consider that it is an insult to my intelligence to ask me to vote for it. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that honorable members on both sides will give their consideration to this motion, which affects the privileges of every honorable member, apart altogether from any display, such as we have just had, of petty spitefulness, which would be far more fittingly displayed on the roof than on the floor of this House. If honorable members would for a moment think well, they would see that the speech to which we have just listened will be a very difficult speech for any one to explain. The honorable member said that this motion was one for which he could vote if it had come from any other section of the House. </para>

Members of this Parliament, or any other similar body, cannot be too careful in regarding the  Speaker,  not only as their  Chairman,  but also as the custodian of their liberties and privileges. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to hear such littleness, though I cannot expect anything else from some quarters. Any man, with any length of view, must realize, not only that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is the custodian of the liberties and privileges of honorable members, but also that, as custodian of those liberties and privileges, the  Speaker  is bound to see that there is given to every honorable member that appeal beyond him which is laid down by the Standing Orders. That is the point upon which the recent trouble originated, and unless we can get this matter cleared up satisfactorily, as the honorable member for Cook and all his colleagues believe that it should be cleared up, if they were not aware that we on the Opposition benches are asking for it, we shall find that in future, in this House, the  Speaker  will no longer be the custodian of our privileges and liberties as  Chairman  of our deliberations, but will become master of our deliberations and the absolute arbiter of our liberties and privileges. In saying this, I speak in no way as to your present occupancy of the Chair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker;</inline> I speak to the position generally. As I do not believe that any member of the House desires that such a state of affairs should come about, I ask honorable members to vote upon the motion apart altogether from bitterness or pettiness arising from this or that sore memory, realizing only that every man with self-respect tries to do the right thing, irrespective of the person who has asked&#39; him to do it. </para>

Suppose that trouble did arise, and every member wanted to protect an offending member by tabling a motion to disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling. Each one of those members might give a different reason for disagreeing with the ruling, and the  Speaker,  in that case, in order to preserve the character of the House, as a deliberative assembly, presided over by a duly appointed officer, would intervene, and stop the whole proceedings. I do ask honorable members to preserve intact and unimpaired the privileges of members as representatives, and I ask them to dissociate from this motion any incident that has occurred, because the declaration the House may make will be more effective, more far-reaching, more flexible in its application, and a much better guide for future occasions, if the House can come to a decision that the rights and privileges of members under standing order 287 have not been affected by anything that has taken place. </para>

                    <para>. - If the last suggestion of the right honorable gentleman, that we should dissociate from this motion anything that occurred in the House, is to be adopted, the motion will become absolutely meaningless. Under the Standing Orders a question of privilege must relate to something that has recently arisen. There is no justification for raising a question of privilege unless something has arisen. Therefore, it is impossible to apply this motion to a hypothetical case. Privilege must always relate itself to some concrete case. In this instance, it relates to something that occurred last night, and that happening is our justification for raising this question this morning. It was because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> prevented the honorable member for Richmond from dissenting from his ruling that the whole trouble arose. Not only did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> say that his decision was not that which the honorable member for Richmond alleged, but he would not permit the honorable member to state another motion. That much <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> clearly shows. We were ordered down and out, and that is what the whole trouble is about. I should like to refresh the memory of the Prime Minister in regard to what really took place. I had risen to a point of order, and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report reads - </para>

                        <para>- There is no report of that in the proof I am reading. Honorable members have now heard the particulars of the incident that has caused all this trouble. The point was that the honorable member for Richmond thought, as I certainly thought, that the ruling given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> unduly circumscribed our privileges under the Standing Orders. We wished to express dissent from that ruling, and were prevented from doing so on the ground that the terms of the motion of dissent were objected to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. Speaker</inline> is to be the sole arbiter of the terms of a motion challenging his position and authority in the House, honorable members will see that nothing whatever can be done except with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> permission. Those rights conferred by the Standing Orders are our rights and they are only in the keeping of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> so long as the House places them there. They are not his rights to arbitrarily dispose of as he pleases. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that these matters of privilege must be discussed whenever that is necessary in the opinion, of the member who feels that his privileges are being impugned.  The question of privilege having been raised, it is for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to explain his decision, and then after honorable members have expressed their points of view, it is for the House to finally determine whether the question is one of privilege or not. If an honorable member may not rise to a question of privilege or submit a point of order, all our privileges are gone. We lie helpless and limp under the absolutely autocratic ruling of any  Speaker  we happen to have in the chair at the time. This is a matter that, affects our privileges profoundly now and in the future. </para>

                    <para>.- Not having been a member of the last Parliament, and not having been present last night when the trouble out of which this motion has arisen occurred, I think I may be able to discuss the matter on the abstract motion, apart altogether from its surrounding circumstances. It is not the . privileges of honorable members that cause trouble; it is the abuse of them. We repeatedly find in Parliament honorable members rising at the wrong time on a point of order, and the  Speaker  is supposed to have to listen to those points. Very often we near <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> saying, &#34; That is not a point of order,&#34; and in nine cases out of ten the honorable member who has raised it knows that it is not a point of order. But he achieves his purpose by raising a fictitious point of order to express something he desires to say. When he is ruled out of order, it is a common occurrence for him to then raise a question of privilege. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> says that no question of privilege is involved, hut the honorable member who has raised it suffers no penalty for having abused his privilege. </para>

                        <para>- That interjection shows how thoroughly biased the honorable member for Flinders is. I had not in mind last night&#39;s incidents at all. I was referring to numberless instances that have occurred in this Chamber since I have been a member. This motion seems to me to be altogether wrong. The mover of it seems to confuse two things. First of all there is the ruling, and then the reasons for the dissent from that ruling. I do not think any one is going to say for a moment that an honorable member has not a right to express his reasons in his own language, but surely an honorable member&#39;s only right of dissent is to dissent from the actual ruling that has been actually given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I shall conclude in a few words what I desire to say in regard to this matter. If the House were to approve of this motion it would place itself in a very dangerous position. The only right possessed by an honorable member under standing order 287 is the right to dissent from the ruling actually given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and not from what he thinks was the ruling given. If an honorable member sets out incorrectly the ruling given it is open to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to say, &#34; This is not my ruling.&#34; If the notice of motion did not set out the ruling actually given, the result would be that we should spend a lot of time next day in discussing a ruling that had not been given. In answer to an interjection the honorable member for Flinders said that it would be for the House to say whether or not the ruling was correctly stated in the motion. Surely that is a most extraordinary position to take up. In other words, the honorable member says that the Appeal Court is to be asked to decide first of all what the decision of the lower court was, and then to say whether that decision was right or wrong. </para>

                        <para>- That is another point. This is a matter, not of interpretation, but of fact. The honorable member, in reply to another interjection, said, I think, that if the terms of a ruling were wrongly stated in the motion of dissent, the House would reject the motion. But the effect of rejecting the motion would be to uphold the ruling set&#39; out in that motion, so that, if it were incorrect, we should have on the records of the House a ruling that might be ridiculous, and which was not given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> We find ourselves in this way beset with many difficulties. The only position open to us, I think, is to fall back upon the old rule that any honorable member may move a motion dissenting from a ruling given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> If we do that, all will be well. But if we depart from that rule, we shall open the door to endless obstruction by any party which thinks fit to obstruct the proceedings of the House by embodying in a notice of motion to dissent from a ruling by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> all sorts of statements as to what that ruling was. We might spend the whole of next day in discussing a ruling never given unless the Government thought fit to deny honorable members the privilege of dealing with the matter by putting the notice of motion at the bottom of the business-paper </para>

The motion submitted by the honorable member for Flinders, I submit, is well within the terms of standing order 287. If the effect of the standing order is to give to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> the absolute right to decide whether a motion to dissent from his ruling is in accordance with the ruling actually given by him, it seems- to me that it requires to be amended. If the motion submitted by the honorable member for Flinders is rejected, then it will be held that the whole matter is within the decision of the  Speaker.  I submit that the standing order simply lays upon any honorable member who objects to a ruling the obligation of presenting to the Chair the terms of his objection. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to debate this question without any reference to the regrettable proceedings connected with the last sitting of the House. The motion submitted is divided into three parts. With the first two divisions, every member, I think, will be in agreement. We are all agreed that every honorable member is entitled to dissent from a ruling by the  Speaker.  The honorable member for Flinders, however, goes on to lay down the principle that it is for the honorable member objecting to determine what shall be the terms of his motion of dissent. When a ruling is objected to, the notice of motion dissenting from it must be handed in in writing, and my experience extending over many years is that it is the invariable practice for the  Speaker,  if he considers that the notice of motion does not set out what his ruling actually was, to immediately call attention to that fact. The House has a knowledge of what actually transpired, and, when the notice of motion is read out, can say at once whether or not the ruling has been correctly stated. If an honorable member were permitted to set out what he thought to be the ruling given, we might have an abuse of the privilege. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot recall one instance, either in this Parliament or in the Parliament of New South Wales, where the practice I have mentioned has been departed from. A motion dissenting from the ruling of the  Speaker  is different from one to dissent from a ruling by the  Chairman  of Committees, since it is not determined immediately. It is set down for consideration on the following day, when there may be present honorable members who were not in the House when the incident took place, and who consequently know nothing of the circumstances. If the  Speaker  were deprived of the right to have his ruling correctly stated in the notice of motion of dissent, then honorable members might be called upon next day to uphold or reject a ruling that had never taken place. In the interests of good order, is it not desirable that it should be decided, as soon  as a notice of motion is handed in to dissent from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> ruling, what shall be the subject to be debated upon that  motion next day? </para>

An entirely false version of the ruling&#39; might thus be put before them next day for their final decision. Surely that is not equitable or just. We have had a long line of illustrious gentlemen occupying the position of  Speaker  of this House. The late lumen ted <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, when the wording of such a notice of motion did not convey the ruling actually given, invariably called attention to that fact as soon as the notice of it was handed in, and required it to be amended before being placed on the notice-paper. </para>

In the interests of the orderly conduct of the proceedings of the House, I urge that it would be exceedingly unwise to take away from us the power to determine really what took place, and what question should be debated when the notice of motion comes on for discussion. </para>

                    <para>.- I have hesitated a good deal about speaking on this motion, but having decided to speak, it is my intention not to vote if the question goes to a division, because the present proceedings arose out of action that I deemed it my duty to take last night, and my feelings have, to a certain extent, been disturbed by what then occurred. As there is a certain amount of misapprehension in the minds of the last  speaker  and of others who have addressed themselves to the motion as to exactly what transpired, most of them not being in the Chamber at the time, I shall, with your permission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> having expressed my deep regret at what occurred, state exactly how I viewed the position at the time, and why I wish to support the motion now under discussion. It will be remembered that last night the honorable and learned member for Flinders moved an amendment on the motion for the second reading of the Commonwealth Bank Bill. That amendment was in very wide terms, indeed in wider terms than the motion before the House. The honorable member for &#34;Wimmera was proceeding to address himself to that amendment. The proof of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of his speech shows that every sentence he uttered was in some way related to the Committee of inquiry which it was proposed by the amendment to appoint. You, sir, ruled the honorable member out of order, and I rose to a point of order, which I stated sis follows: - </para>

I submit that the honorable member for Wimmera is perfectly Sn order in covering the whole subject of the amendment, and in speaking upon each of its three divisions, provided that he addresses his remarks to them. I submit that, notwithstanding what the honorable member  may  have covered in his speech on the second reading of the Bill, he is permitted under our Standing Orders to speak at length on the &#34; control and development of the Commonwealth Bank,&#34; and to adduce reasons in connexion therewith to support the reference of the Bill to a Select Committee. The honorable member is also at perfect liberty to refer <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> length to &#34; the transfer to the Bank of the management of the note issue,&#34; and to show how that would affect the note issue. Then with respect to &#34;the relations of the Bank to the State and other financial institutions,&#34; the honorable member may refer to the relations of the Bank in any way he pleases. </para>

                    <para>. - One cannot help feeling a little sympathy for the honorable member for Richmond in the circumstances in which he found himself last night, and in which he remains today. But his chronological recital of the facts, though interesting, did not embrace the main features of the episode which has been brought under review by the motion now before the House. He did not grapple with what I regard as the essential point. That is, has an honorable member the right, in appealing from the Speaker&#39;s decision, to misinterpret it, and to place before the House an issue which that ruling did not raise ? If an honorable member &#34;was entitled to attempt to obtain the decision of the House on a misinterpretation of a ruling, our proceedings would eventually become chaotic. On that point the remarks of the honorable member for Gippsland were convincing. The proposition of the honorable and learned member for Flinders is that a member has the right to place his own construction upon a ruling, and to ask the House to give its decision on that construction. </para>

                        <para>- Although misstating the ruling, an honorable member might, and no doubt would be perfectly honest. It is not insinuated that the honorable member for Richmond did not give his honest version of the Speaker&#39;s decision. Still, the honorable and learned member for Flinders will scarcely say that a  Speaker  would be justified in allowing to be put before the House what he knew to be a misrepresentation of his ruling. </para>

                        <para>- The  Speaker  said that the point which the honorable member for Richmond was putting was not in accordance with his ruling. I was here all the time, and I have a distinct recollection of what took place. I remember the  Speaker  stating that the honorable member for Richmond was attempting to place before the House a ruling different from that which the  Speaker  had given. There is another point raised by the honorable member for Flinders, and I should like him to review it on the principle that sometimes second thoughts are best. I understood the honorable member to contend, and I believe he is right in contending, that when an honorable member rises to a question of privilege, he is bound to be heard at any stage of the proceedings. That, I believe, has been the practice of this Parliament so far; and in this regard I am quite at one with the honorable member for Flinders. But the honorable member went further, and admitted that the  Speaker  eventually had to be the judge whether the point raised was <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> matter of privilege or not. </para>

                        <para>- I would not say intentional obstruction, because the honorable member for Richmond acted under strong emotion. But no one except the  Speaker  himself can say what was passing through his mind. He may have thought that the honorable member intended to interrupt the proceedings of the House; and, if so, he would be justified, according to the honorable and learned member for Flinders, in refusing to allow him to ventilate the question of privilege. From ocular demonstration, I should say that the honorable member for Richmond was in that frame of mind that the  Speaker  was warranted in assuming that he was really not desirous to ventilate a question of privilege, but was merely using another means to take points of order which the  Speaker  had previously refused to listen to. </para>

                        <para>- I am not doing that, because I like to avoid the honorable member&#39;s example. My votes in this House have always been cast to give the utmost freedom of speech to the people&#39;s representatives. I do not wish to refer to the last Parliament, or what may have occurred there, but I think honorable members will admit that nothing occurred last evening which was not paralleled, if not considerably outdistanced , by what has occurred on previous occasions. I do not see that any good can come of pressing this motion to a division, and I hope it will not be pressed that far. Apart altogether from the merits of the matter, we are now approaching a season of peace and good will, and I think that the usual good feelings entertained at this time of the year would be considerably promoted by the honorable and learned member withdrawing the motion. </para>

                    <para>That the right to appeal to the House from any ruling of the  Speaker  by objection in writing and motion, under standing order  2S7, is the privilege of every member of the House. </para>

                <para class="block">This is merely carrying out standing order 287; and, of course, we have to follow the standing order. But the motion goes much further. It seeks to compel the  Speaker,  whoever he may be, to always accept such a motion when it is presented. That cannot be done, for the reasons which have been pointed out by the honorable member for Gippsland, and I may say that this is not the first, occasion on which the point has arisen in the Federal Parliament. Without mentioning the names of any of my predecessors concerned, I may say that, on several occasions, it has been ruled that such a. motion was not in accordance with the ruling given, and, therefore, could not be accepted. This has been done by myself before now, and also, as I say,  by my predecessors. Further, the Speaker has, on similar occasions, reminded them over of the motion that it could be amended. I do not intend to read the quotations from previous rulings that I have here, but I can assure honorable members that what I have stated is the effect of them. Perhaps the most trying duty that devolves on the occupant of the position I now fill is that of maintaining order, more particularly when feeling is. running high on both sides of the House. Of course, when honorable members are in a good humour, much latitude may be allowed, the  Speaker  knowing that he has complete control; but when, as I say, feeling is running high, it becomes necessary on his part to be very careful. When, points of order are taken, not once or twice, but a dozen times, it becomes evident to the  Speaker  that a strong hand is; required ; but, unfortunately, the Standing Orders do not set forth exactly what he must do under the circumstances. The  Speaker  is thus compelled to use his common sense in carrying out his most important duty of maintaining order within the Chamber. Without desiring to cast any reflections in reference to what took place last night, there seemed to me to be no. finality as to the number of points of order likely to be submitted. To such an extent was that the case that I, as head of the. House, desirous, of conducting the business in a proper way, came to the conclusion that it must be stopped. No doubt, honorable members who were affected by my exercise of control felt more or less, aggrieved, but my duty, however painful  it might be, was obvious. The honorable member for Richmond on four separate occasions tried to press a question of privilege, and, of course, if there is one matter more than another deserving of the fullest consideration it is a question affecting: the privileges of honorable members. But  when quite a number of points of order had been raised, and further points of order were still coming, with an evident desire to get behind the ruling of the  Speaker  by raising the question of privilege, it became my bounden duty to take strong steps, and I did so. I took the course which I believe to be the correct one under the circumstances, and it is now for the House to decide whether I am right or wrong. </para>

My recollection is that there was only one question put to the House. I understood that it was the amendment, and not the second reading, that had been put, and that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> having come from a sick bed, and having been performing your duties in the House for many hours, the scene that had just occurred having overstrained your nerves, were being relieved by the  Deputy Speaker.  On this account I was rather slow in starting, and I venture to say that, through my having been ruled out of order, honorable members lost the opportunity of hearing a brilliant and forensic effort. </para>

                            <para>- No. I raise this as a matter of privilege. For the first time in its history the House has transferred to the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> the penal power which always resides in it. The incident is closed, so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and I are concerned; but my point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> does not exercise the penal power of the House. Quite properly, when anything offending his dignity occurs, he makes his appeal to the House, and the duty then lies with the Prime Minister to take action; but whatever is done has to be done by the House, and whatever apologies have to be made, have to be made to the House. That has been the invariable practice. For the first time in our records the right honorable gentleman, the Prime Minister, framed a motion which transferred back to you, sir, that penal power which, under the Standing Orders, resides in the House. That is my point, and it is a very serious one. Under the terms of this motion, as any one can see, instead of exercising the penal powers of the House when appealed to by you to do so, the Prime Minister simply transfers the unfortunate culprit back to an offended  Speaker  to do with him what he chooses, when he chooses, and how he chooses. And this motion, if you care to exercise it, sir, would permit you to compel me to remain out of the House for the whole of the Parliament, irrespective altogether of what the attitude of the House towards me might be. </para>

I now ask the right honorable gentleman not to pursue the matter any further. If the right honorable member wishes to take exception to any action of this House it must be taken by direct motion. </para>

The motion was moved in answer to the call from the Chair, and I assure the Leader of the Opposition that the idea of offending him was never in my mind. On the contrary, I regarded that form of motion as a simple and easy way of enabling the right honorable member to return to the chamber during the closing hours of the sitting. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the questions raised by the honorable member for Balaclava yesterday, I desire to state that the only firms engaged in the metal industry that have been raided in Adelaide are: F. H. Snow, the Wallaroo and Moonta Mining and Smelting Company, of whom no adverse evidence has been disclosed; W. Steele - a former partner of Air. Snow - of whom no evidence was disclosed; and the Wallaroo and Mount Lyell Fertilizer Company, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Snow</inline> is  chairman.  That company was placed under surveillance, but no evidence against it was discovered. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Steele&#39;s</inline> business was not raided, but he was placed under surveillance. In regard to the position of Messrs. Phillips, Ormonde, and Company, and particularly in regard to the complaint which has been made to me about the suppression of the resolution passed by the Employers&#39; Federation, which the company desired to appear in the public press, I am sorry that that resolution should have been suppressed. Apparently that is accounted for by the censor interpreting in a Draconian way the instructions given to him that there was to&#39; be no publicity in regard to the raids until evidence had been found justifying them. In order that Messrs. Phillips, Ormonde, and Company may be exonerated, and in the hope that the press will now publish the resolution, together with the assurance of the Government that no evidence whatever against this firm, affecting in any way their loyalty, has been disclosed, I shall read to the House the following motion which was moved and carried by the Employers&#39; Federation - </para>

                        <para>- Will the Prime Minister and Treasurer negotiate with America, Britain, Canada, . South Africa, France, and other friendly nations for the creation of an international gold-clearing house, with safe depositories at the capital of each country to issue interchangeable certificates, so that&#39; international balances may be settled in gold at specific periods, thus doing away with the present system of transporting across seas the gross sums iu gold, at the cost of heavy freight and of considerable loss of gold by abrasion? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Flinders interjects that this is a big order. As one who has had a long and intimate acquaintance  with  the honorable member for Darwin, I know that he is accustomed to deal with big things. In this proposal he is not far away from what is actually taking place. It was at our own suggestion that the Bank of England accepted bullion and gold deposited here, and gave a credit of 97 per cent, in London during a period of the war when they were not at all anxious to ship it. The question of a great International clearing house is an important one. I hope that such an institution is going to be established somewhere convenient to us, and the possibility is one that should not be left out of account. The matter will be investigated, and we shall be glad of the co-operation of all those who arp interested in it. </para>

                        <para>- We were afforded yesterday the privilege of viewing - and I am sure we did so with intense pride and admiration - the members of the second Expeditionary Force; but some of us could not look with much satisfaction at the horses. I have no hesitation in describing very many of the horses which took part in yesterday&#39;s parade as mere scrubbers. They do not reflect any credit on the Australian horse, and, in my judgment, they will not do justice to the men who are going away, possibly to face death upon them. Will the Prime Minister - and I address this question to him in the absence of the Assistant Minister of Defence - take into consideration the desirability of doing something to make an improvement in this respect ? </para>

                        <para>- In regard to equipment of every kind, including the supply of horses, it has been the aim of the Government, and expense has not been spared, to supply the very best to our Expeditionary Forces. Horses, however, have been a source of trouble from the beginning of time, and are likely to be. We have all read the story of the two deacons who deceived each other in the matter of a horse. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister a further question relating to the very important matter of the horses supplied to the Expeditionary Forces. Among the horses in the parade yesterday, there were some really first-class animals and a lot that were moderately good ; but there were some which, to any man who has an eye for a bit of good horse flesh, are a positive menace to these whose lives will depend upon them. These are just the class of horses that are sure to be a positive danger to the men when they get into difficulties. Very little judgment could have been displayed in selecting them. One would naturally think that the best horses would be picked out for yesterday&#39;s parade. If that course was adopted, then&#39; I can only say that -our soldiers must be very badly horsed. I want to impress upon the Prime Minister the absolute necessity of weeding out some of these animals. </para>

In view of the fact that for economic reasons the Department has had to reduce the distribution of ammunition amongst rifle clubs, will the Government consider the advisableness of assisting miniature rifle clubs, not only with ammunition, but to some extent with grants such as have been given to ordinary rifle clubs,, since that would probably have a tendency to encourage rifle practice ? </para>

                <para class="block">This has been in many respects an eventful session, and, to those on this side of the House, a tragic one. This, unfortunately, is no new thing with us. I speak on behalf of every member of the Parliament when I say that we deeply deplore the death of the late Minister of External Affairs. In him the Commonwealth lost a distinguished citizen, but his memory will remain with us. I thank honorable members on both sides for the great courtesy which they have shown to Ministers and to myself in the consideration of the business of a very difficult session. The session has been an unusual one, financial measures of the gravest importance having been dealt with, and dealt with speedily. I express the hope that certain transactions which have taken place during the past few months will greatly tend to a closer association between the Commonwealth and the States, in matters material and financial, and that this association will greatly improve our credit, both here and elsewhere. I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition is not now in his place, because I wish to thank the Opposition for the assistance which it gave in the passing of measures which the Government thought it their duty to bring forward in the interests of the country. I express regret for an untoward occurrence which arose last night, but I assure honorable members opposite, one and all, that I am far from harbouring animus or personal feeling against them. We on this side recognise the honest endeavour of the Opposition to give effect to its political views, as we on this  side  of the House do the best we can to give effect to our views. To you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> we owe a debt of gratitude, because yours is at all times a difficult position to fill. The Speakership of a representative assembly is an office of high honour, and at times circumstances must arise which make it most difficult to hold the balance even. When two parties look at a question from different points of view, and feeling runs high, it is easy to think that a presiding officer is not doing his best, but it has become the tradition of this Parliament to make ready and willing acknowledgment of the impartiality and ability of your services. To the  Chairman  of Committees I make similar reference. He has fulfilled our highest expectations, both as  Chairman  and as  Deputy Speaker.  In the officers of the </para>

They are always ready to supply us with information, and to give us what help they can in all our difficulties, without regard to our political views. To the  Clerk,  the Assistant  Clerk,  and all the officers that attend on members, we are very much indebted. Some may say that they only perform the duties for which they are paid, but they perform those duties in such a way that it makes it a pleasure to have transactions with them. Long may this state of things continue.

This Parliament is the only place in the world where Australian interests as a whole are discussed - a point that it is well to remember - and the history of the country is largely embedded in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> volumes, though I must confess it might prove difficult to extract it in its proper order and sequence. Australia is a great country, destined to become still greater, and, from a national point of view, its national history can only be discovered in our record here; it is all the more important, therefore, that we should have the able staff at present at our disposal to make that record. </para>

                        <para>. - In the unavoidable absence of the honorable member for Parramatta, I have to express, on behalf of the Opposition, appreciation of the remarks of the Prime Minister on the occasion of the adjournment over the Christmas -season. The right honorable gentleman has referred to the assistance given to the Government by the Opposition, and I can only say that this session has been unique in the history of this and most other Parliaments. We met immediately after the outbreak of a war which has embroiled practically the whole civilized world; and those charged with the administration had the right to rely on the whole-souled support of the Opposition in all the many important measures rendered necessary by this great crisis. At such a time, there should be no such thing as party; we should all be imbued with the one object of doing everything that we consider necessary for the protection of the lives and property of the people, and the best interests of the country generally. I am quite certain that, were the positions reversed, the members of the Labour party, as an Opposition, would be equally willing and anxious to render the Government of the day every assistance in their power. Of course, the Opposition, in reference to other measures which have been before us, have exercised their right of criticism, and we should have been wanting in  public spirit and in appreciation of our duties as representatives had we not been prepared to resist proposals which we have for a long time opposed, both inside and outside Parliament. The opposing parties, however, have carried on their controversies without loss of dignity to the Chamber as a whole, and there is no reason why we should not now part with the best of feeling towards one another. We shall, of course, continue to have differences of opinion on certain measures, but I am sure we all have in view the one object, namely, the ultimate betterment of the people. I indorse all that has been said in regard to the valuable services rendered by the officers of the House. It is unfortunate that at almost every recess we have to regret the loss of one or more of our members. I hope that the great strain, mental and physical, imposed upon honorable members is not a contributory cause to this loss. I sympathize with you personally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in the onerous duties that you are called upon to perform, and regret that during the session you have not been in the fullest enjoyment of good health. On behalf of the Opposition, I express the hope that when Ave  resume after the recess we shall find that you have greatly benefited by the holiday. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter,</inline> the  Chairman  of Committees, we have one of the oldest parliamentarians in the House, and, with his knowledge of procedure, he has proved his capacity for the position he now holds. We all, I am sure, appreciate the impartial and skilful services rendered to Parliament by the clerks, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> Staff, and others, and I hope they, too. will benefit by the recess. I observe that, as time goes on, there seems a tendency to make the recesses somewhat shorter, and last year, having regard to the election, we had practically no holiday at all. It is not, however, with the idea of holiday only that I speak, but now that the Commonwealth is enlarging its sphere of usefulness, it is becoming more than ever necessary that honorable members should make themselves conversant with the country, and that, of course, can only be done when Parliament is not sitting. I trust that it may be possible for representatives of the Government to visit my own district, which has been somewhat neglected, in my opinion, and if they do, I shall be glad to offer them what hospitality 1 can, and assist them in gaining some knowledge of the resources of thai;  part  of Australia. </para>

During my term of office, nothing has been more gratifying to me than the way in which the officers have performed their duties, which are of such a nature that only those who come into actual contact with those gentlemen know what knowledge, skill, care, and precision are required for their proper performance. I have to thank the Clerks and others for much assistance rendered to me in the performance of my duties as  Speaker,  &#39; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter</inline> has requested me to express his thanks for what has been said regarding himself, and his hope that he may be able, as I am sure be will be, to continue to fill his position with credit to himself and Parliament. In conclusion, I have only to wish every honorable member, and all the officers in the House, so far as the conditions of the times permit, a Merry Christmas and a Happy NewYear. </para>
