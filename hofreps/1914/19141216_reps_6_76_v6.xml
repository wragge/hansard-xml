                        <para>- The casual employes will be treated in the same way as the permanent employes of the Government in regard to the Christmas holidays. The original question asked on the subject was whether the special concession would be given to temporary employes which was given in 1912. My reply to that question was &#34;No.&#34; The concession was absolutely abused, and will not be given again. The statutory holidays will be cheerfully allowed to all concerned, and will be paid for. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Trade and Customs has announced that it is intended to impose light dues, when a three-months&#39; notice has expired, and that that notice will commence before the end of the month. Therefore, it must be contemplated to take over the lighthouses from the States within about three months&#39; time. I ask the honorable gentleman whether, before the issue of a proclamation for the taking over of the lighthouses, he intends to have a clear and definite understanding with the States as to the basis of the valuation of transferred properties? The Minister will find that in one particular case there was some dispute regarding a quarantine transfer, the basis of valuation not being fixed beforehand. To make matters perfectly clear, does the Minister intend to get a definite agreement from the States before this transfer ? </para>

                        <para>- If we are to wait until all the States have come to a definite decision regarding the valuation of the properties to be transferred, the transfer may be postponed for ever. The Defence, Customs, and Post Office properties which were transferred to the Commonwealth at the inception of Federation, were not valued for several years afterwards; and I do not think that any difficulty will arise with regard to the valuation of the lighthouses. I do not consider it wise to postpone the transfer any longer. </para>

At the instance of the Grain and Fodder Board, the Government, on 20th November, telegraphed to the Prime Minister ordering 6,000 tons of chaff to be imported to this State. No reply having been received, a further telegram was sent on 7th December, and that has not been answered. </para>

                        <para>- I read the paragraph, and at once inquired about the telegrams. I find that South Australia was the only State that replied affirmatively to our inquiry, though Western Australia sent a message regarding maize, with which I have already dealt. The telegram from South Australia was, however, pigeonholed by the clerk who received it from the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, and neither the Comptroller, the Secretary of the Department, nor myself, was aware of its existence until this morning. The telegram is as follows: - </para>

Before the troops left Australia an arrangement was made by the Government through our London agents to allow of the immediate payment of our troops wherever they landed, whether in Egypt or elsewhere. Arrangement was also made for the provision of savings banks in the camps, so that every facility would be given the troops to deposit their money. There is no intention of allowing Australian notes to wander all over Egypt, nor is that desirable. But the information which the honorable member has referred to is an indication that Australian paper currency is good in any other country. </para>

We have only the one source of official information on a point like that, and that is the British Government. When the British Government say that the restriction can be removed, so far as it concerns the United States of America, it will be removed. </para>

                    <para>- Some time ago the Commonwealth prohibited the export of wool to certain countries, amongst them Japan, Canada, and New Zealand. Recently the prohibition was withdrawn with regard to Japan and Canada, but it was allowed to continue in regard to New:Zealand. As a considerable quantity of Australian merino wool is required in New Zealand for manufacturing purposes, will the Minister of Trade and Customs withdraw the embargo on the export of wool to the Dominion ? </para>

I may say that one place on another Continent to which we were asked to ship wool was ordering over a thousand times as much as went to that country last year. That is the sort of tiling we have to guard against in these days. </para>

But the Government received information which led us to believe that a mistake had been made in the values of the films, and the question I have to consider is whether we should rectify that mistake. </para>

Had the Act been passed during the current financial year, no doubt the Works Estimates for 1914-15 would have been excluded from the consideration of the Committee. This is a matter, however, that can be dealt with according to (he general consensus of opinion of the House. </para>

                        <para>- A matter of considerable importance is raised by the honorable gentleman&#39;s question. The authority of the Commonwealth under the Constitution to deal with navigable rivers and the control of waterways is very considerable, and extends, no doubt, to the power to deal with obstructions to navigation. To what extent we may deal with an Act of any State interfering with the right of other States to the use of waters for irrigation or navigation purposes, I should not like to say off-hand, but I shall look into the matter most carefully, ask for further particulars, and let the honorable member know the result. </para>

In August about &#163;2,250,000 was paid in, and last month the payments were about the same. I desire to ask the Prime Minister what is the explanation of this enormous pouring in of gold since the outbreak of war? Is it the outcome of any arrangement with the banks? </para>

                        <para>- This is a very large and important question. I have the pleasure of the acquaintance of both the gentlemen referred to. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Milne</inline> is a representative agent of Great Britain here, and Lord Desborough has been always associated with interests of the kind. I arn of opinion that it would be better to. have a Committee appointed from outside Parliament. It is rather dangerous, for Members of Parliament to be directly associated with inquiries concerning duties of Customs and Excise which may affect their own particular interests. It is better to have a delegation altogether apart from the Legislature, but, as regards the policy, the Government are entirely in favour of it. </para>

From what I know, it would be impossible to lay those documents on the table today, or, I am afraid, to-morrow. I may inform the right honorable gentleman that on the Naval Board there are members who are quite capable of dealing with the report and the plans.

                                <para>- Owing to the fact that honorable members may ask questions without giving notice of them, a dozen questions are sometimes founded on the reply given by the Minister. There can be no finality to questions in such circumstances. . Ministers are not blameless in the matter. They should ask for notice to be given. Questions will then come on in the ordinary way, and be answered, which will put an end to what now occurs. While I am anxious to give honorable members every latitude to get all the information possible, they must see that some step must be taken to curtail the practice of founding a number of questions on the Minister&#39;s reply to a question asked without notice. </para>

The Standing Orders give honorable members the privilege of asking questions without notice. As you have just pointed out, the remedy is entirely in the Ministers&#39; hands. They can regulate the matter; but I submit that you cannot interfere, so long as honorable members obey the Standing Orders. To a degree, these questions might be curtailed, but any step taken with that object in view should be taken by Ministers. They encourage this sort of thing by the speeches which they are constantly making. </para>

                            <para>. - I offer no objection to the motion; it would be useless to do so, because we are entirely in the hands of the Prime Minister. Never before in my life, when special arrangements have been made for the termination of our sittings, have I seen a business-paper so loaded as ours is now. It is useless to attempt to make arrangements with my right honorable friend. He does what he likes. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. There speaks the purely party man in these non-party days. Partisanship oozes out of the right honorable member at every joint. We have had a series of most bitterly partisan addresses from the front Government benches only this morning, and for the right honorable gentleman to say that he alone has the responsibility for these measures is so much nonsense. As to the quality of the work to be done, every honorable member on both sides of the House is equally responsible to this country. According to the right honorable gentleman&#39;s motion, all we have to do is to agree to the most preposterous things, and he says, &#34; They are my responsibility, not yours.&#34; That is a theory of parliamentary representation that could only be conceived in a House that is dominated by a party outside this Parliament; and I advise my right honorable friend to come back to his parliamentary moorings. </para>

                            <para>.- I was surprised to hear an intimation from the Prime Minister that it is proposed to sit throughout the night, because I was under the impression that, if honorable members were ready to sit right through last week and this week it would relieve us of an experience which we have had in past sessions, and which does no honorable member any good. Therefore, I was sorry to hear the Prime Minister say that honorable members would be expected to terminate this session by an all night sitting, as a means of expediting the business. I hope that that idea will not be persisted in, because, personally,&#39; I am opposed to it. </para>

                                <para>- I shall participate in those extra sittings with very great gusto. I am not one of those who believe that we should rise this week merely to allow the Government to finish their programme as they think best. Any Bill that deals with the war I am prepared to pass after a reasonable protest. We cannot do more because the numbers are against us, and, after all, the chief responsibility rests on the Government. But the Commonwealth Banking Bill is not one of these. It is not a measure for which any ground of urgency has been raised in the House. It is not connected in any way with the crisis through which we are passing, and from which I hope we shall soon emerge. But it is a propaganda measure which suits the desires of honorable members sitting opposite, and, to some extent, suits the views of many of their constituents. </para>

                                <para>- I was going to say that the Banking Bill, according to my judgment, is distinctly a party measure, and in that spirit some of us must endeavour to meet it. I am speaking only for myself, and in no menacing way. But, as it is the intention that honorable members shall separate in good-will and reassemble early in the new year, I do think that the discussion of a financial measure of such far-reaching importance as this may very well be deferred till then. If we are to push on with the Bill now, we, who are opposed to its provisions, must meet it with that opposition which we owe to our convictions and our responsibilities. </para>

                            <para>.- I rise with the idea of assisting the House out of the tangle into which it has got. First of all, I think honorable members would like an intimation as to who is the Leader of the Opposition to whom the Prime Minister can appeal when he is desirous of making any arrangement in regard to the business. We have just listened to one of the Opposition&#39;s new leaders, a gentleman who is evidently not familiar with the forms of the House, and is not accustomed to a chamber in which the Leader of the Opposition is treated with respect by the head of the Government and by the party behind him. That being so, we can quite understand the assumption of the honorable member for Balaclava that he speaks on behalf of the Opposition in regard to the Banking Bill. I say emphatically that nothing on the business-paper has been so pointedly emphasized to the House by the Government as has that particular measure. The Government intimated clearly that they desired to see the Bill pass before the House adjourns. And there are reasons for that course. </para>

                                <para>- I certainly think it would be desirable that members of the Opposition should retire and decide amongst themselves who shall be their real leader. If they will do that, we may be able to have an understanding between the members on this side of the House, who are anxious to proceed with business, and those on the other side, who, perhaps for party purposes, desire to delay the business with a view to influencing the opinion of the electors in the  forthcoming  contest that has been necessitated by the death of a member of the Government party. I hope that the Commonwealth Bank Bill will be passed ; that, true to the traditions of our party, every opportunity will be given to honorable members  to discuss every measure submitted to the House, and that there will be no resort to that brutal instrument, the &#34; gag,&#34; such as took place last session. I have always been opposed to the use of the <inline font-style="italic">&#34; S##&#38;&#83;&#62;##&#34;</inline> but ^ honorable members of the Opposition show an utter disregard of the interests of the people whom they are sent here to represent, I am afraid I shall have to depart from a principle which I have always cherished. </para>

                                <para>- No; but when those whom I represent are made to suffer, it is my duty to review the position I have taken up in this regard. I should like the Opposition to have regard to the season of peace which we are now approaching. Some of them have expressed a desire that the business of the House should continue; but this apparently does not meet with the approbation of all their colleagues. I have no wish to lecture the House, but 1 desire to bring to bear on honorable members opposite my common-sense business capacity. I do not pose as a model of political purity, but I believe that the people have confidence in me, and if the Opposition will accept from me a few pearls of wisdom the result will be beneficial to our proceedings. I do not think we should deal with this question in a purely jocular spirit. We should think seriously of what is likely to be the result of our action. The honorable member for Balaclava is new to this House, but not to parliamentary procedure. He should recognise that much business remains to be done, and that while it may be amusing to him, as a representative of this State, to keep the representatives of other States away from their homes, there is a strong desire on our part to get back to them and to our families. We are making big personal sacrifices. Honorable members who are able to return to their homes each night should have some sympathy with those who are not in that happy position. There should be no  attempt  to impose too great a strain on the health of honorable members, or to retard their efforts to concentrate their minds on the great problems which confront this Parliament. I hope that all these measures* will be allowed to go; and that honorable members opposite will release themselves from their party ties, and recognise that they are not likely to gain much of an advertisement by talking as some of them have done. </para>

                            <para>.-! do not wish to accept the challenge just thrown out by my distinguished friend, the honorable&#34; member for East Sydney. I echo the hope with which he concluded his brilliant peroration, that all the Bills which the Government had succeeded in passing would be permitted for the time to continue. We are concerned, however, not with the measures which the Government have passed, but with those which they wish to carry. I confess that I am not going to be deterred for one moment by the threat of the honorable member to make certain sacrifices to expediency aud to outrage his conscience by voting for the &#34; gag.&#34; 1 wish now to put it with all good feeling to the Prime Minister, that if the Government feel it their duty to proceed with certain measures which, for some occult reason, are regarded by them as supremely important, although having no relation to the war, and which some members of the Opposition, consistent with their duty to the country, are prepared to discuss, then they should be considered in the open light of day, when the press can report the debate, and when the discussion which emanates from the very serious purpose apparent on both sides will reach the ears of the public through the ordinary channels. I would urge it upon the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Bank Bill should not be rushed through in an all-night sitting. </para>

                                <para>- I think that  all-night  sittings disfigure our proceedings and undermine the health of honorable members. We have had many experiences  of  them, and although we conduct our business during all-night sittings with extraordinary good humour, the long strain which they entail certainly does tell upon the physique of honorable members. I urge the Government, with every desire to assist them in concluding this, of all sessions, with reasonable good humour, to have the Commonwealth Bank Bill discussed when the press can be present to report our remarks, and not to force it through in an all-night sitting. </para>

                                <para>- The protection of its interests in equity and justice is the first duty of the representatives of the people in this Parliament, who are only trustees of the institution. I agree with the honorable member for Wentworth, that it is undesirable to have an all-night sitting, and if the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to fix  any  reasonable time for the discussion of the Commonwealth Bank &#34;Bill - at a time when the representatives of the press can be present and report the debate - I shall be very glad to cooperate with him. But the  threat  of the Opposition that they will allow to pass only those measures which they suggest should be dealt with before the House rises, is not acceptable to the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to put a question to the Attorney-General regarding the calculation of estimated revenue to be reaped from this Bill. When the resolution was before the House, we had the extraordinary confession that the calculation given by the Treasurer in his Budget speech was quite wrong. In other words, the Treasurer told us, in  his  Budget speech, that it was expected that &#163;1,000,000 would be obtained this year. </para>

                        <para>- I have already explained how that error arose, and how the Treasurer was led into it. The  Treasurer was not desirous of imposing a probate duty that would yield more than &#163;1,000,000 per annum, and his instructions were that such a duty was to be levied as would yield that amount. </para>

                        <para>- If harmony between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the States &#34;had been established, there would have been no difficulty whatever in a couple of expert men from New South Wales and Victoria, the two more popular States, providing the Treasurer with an estimate which, allowing for the conjectural data, would have been sufficiently approximate. I doubt the estimate of the Treasurer, and I think the original calculation is nearer right than the amended one. This is a very stiff tax, rising to 15 per &#34;cent. The maximum in Victoria is 10 per cent. ; and, while the State Government tax estates under &#163;1,000 and the Commonwealth does nob, the heavy loads on the top of the ramp will bring in a tremendous revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, and, therefore, I put it on one side as not settling anything. All direct taxation is speculative, and when we are dealing with life and death it is more so than usual ; but we are bound to calculate whether the revenue will be large or small, and I think the yield will be much more than the Treasurer anticipates. If my idea be correct, the yield will be &#163;1,500,000 in a normal year, and approximately &#163;2,000,000 in a full financial year. </para>

                        <para>- The total probate revenue for Australia, in the year 1912-13 amounted to &#163;919,000, and, in the year before, &#163;973,000; and in neither of those years, so far as I know, was duty paid on any very heavy estates in either of the principal States. &#39;I do not think that in either of these two years there were any such estates as that of the late Samuel Hordern. </para>

                        <para>- I know there is a stage at which the tax is heavier: the angle reaches further, and it is steeper in the end; and the whole question is what happens in the case of an estate of, say,  &#163;40,000 and &#163;100,000 and over. On such, estates as these the Commonwealth yield will be vastly in excess of that of the States. </para>

This is a year in which we are going to have a crop of disaster. We must speak frankly in financial matters; and while no Treasurer would desire the death of citizens merely for the purpose of reaping revenue, there must be a crop of deaths in a time of war, drought, tribulation, and taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will willingly co-operate with the Chair, and I promise to assist him in every possible way. I regret having transgressed the rules, but I was led away by the interesting interjection of the Prime Minister. I was pointing out that the disaster, conflict, and anxiety under which we are now labouring, will no doubt have their effect in connexion with direct taxation of this kind. In a tram-car the other day I met a respectable citizen who told me that he is eighty-four years of age. He is a man who pioneered Australia in the early days, and, according to current rumour, he has amassed a considerable amount of property, both real and personal. He spoke in tones of the deepest stress of the taxation which this Government are imposing in the way of a land tax and probate duties; and certainly such a man as he is hit hard while he lives, and doubly hard when he dies. I remarked to him that he would be worried into his grave, and he said, &#34; I am worried half-way there already.&#34; Such a view may be unreasonable, and I think it is; but it is real, and will have i&#39;3 effect. Apart altogether from taxation, there is no doubt that, in times of great national upheaval, we find greater mortality than at other times amongst the more mature of our population. The honorable gentleman in charge of the Bill should have taken more reasonable steps to furnish the Committee with the grounds of his estimates; and I am astonished to hear that the State officers have refused to supply him with data. </para>

                        <para>- I thought it would be helpful if we  knew  the attitude of the State officers in regard to these proposals. All I am anxious to ascertain is whether or not the rate provided for in the schedule is likely to yield us an amount of revenue vastly exceeding the calculation of the Treasurer. In my judgment, if all the data were supplied, that would be found to be the case; and it would have been advisable to have the assistance of the Tax Commissioner in Victoria, who is a man of wide experience, with full charge of all the taxation in that State, and in immediate touch with his colleagues iu the other States. There is no doubt that this gentleman could, and probably would, have supplied thoroughly reliable data on which we might calculate the probable yield. As this is the first occasion, as I hope it will be the last, on which the Commonwealth will embark on this form of taxation for emergency purposes- for so the Prime Minister originally told us - T think we should be careful not to disturb sources of revenue on which the States rely so much. If we had better information, we should  probably  have wiser legislation. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking for myself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I shall swiftly obey any order you may make, whatever it may be. Surely it is permissible to make comparative estimates and recommendations when taxation measures are before us ? For instance, in regard to this proposal, one honorable member may wish to point out that the rate fixed is double what it should be, on the ground that other means of raising the revenue could be substituted. That course is very often followed. Honorable members may wish to show that this proposal is wrong, because better sources of revenue can be found that will be more equitably distributed over the community. Before this Bill disappear* from this or the other Chamber, the Attorney-General should get from the Victorian Taxation Office an estimate of what this tax will probably yield, because, it that information were obtained, it would probably be found that the realization would be likely to be greater than the Treasurer&#39;s expectations. I have, in a descriptive sense, and not in an abusive way, described both of the propositions for direct taxation as vindictive. Had the Treasurer been desirous of squaring the ledger only instead of serving party purposes as well, he could have found much more reasonable, and much fairer, means of taxation. </para>

                    <para>. - A statement of what this tax is supposed to do, what we expect to derive from it, and what alterations we propose to make in its incidence, should facilitate business, and shorten discussion. No doubt considerable advantage would be derived if information could be obtained from the State officials, as suggested by the honorable member for Balaclava, but I have been informed that it has been found impossible to get such information. The estimate of the amount of revenue - roughly about &#163;1,000,000 for the year - is, owing to the absence of complete data, only an estimate. Both here and in Great Britain no data can be obtained as to the proportion in which estates are bequeathed to widows and children, to collaterals, and strangers, though in making an estimate of the revenue to be obtained from such taxation, such data are vitally important. As the Government have decided to exempt all gifts and bequests to charitable, educations&#93;, and scientific institutions, and the estates of all persons who during the present war may die on active service, or as the result of disease or wounds incurred while on active service, and also to concede to widows, children, and grandchildren a substantial concession over collaterals and strangers - the rate suggested is two-thirds - the amount of revenue as now estimated will fall from &#163;1,000,000 in a year to somewhere below &#163;700,000 per annum. </para>

In view of these figures, and of the fact that, under our proposal the maximum of the rate of tax is not imposed on estates under &#163;70,000, whereas in most of the States the maximum rate applies at &#163;20,000, and, taking into consideration the proposed concessions, the proposed duty will not be heavier than those now existing in the States. It will press much more lightly than any State tax on moderate estates with values up to &#163;40,000. In the circumstances tha proposal of the Government is one that should receive the support of honorable members, and I hope that that support will be given with as little discussion as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- One feature of this proposal which is worthy of consideration is its effect on the State Treasuries. The Commonwealth estate duty will be the first charge on an estate, and will have priority of the State duties. These are now imposed on the value of the difference between the assets and the liabilities of the deceased. It would be interesting to know how far the revenue of the States will suffer as the result of our legislation. By way of illustration, let me point out that at the present time an estate valued at &#163;100,000 is liable for probate and other duties on the whole amount, but when this measure becomes law, it will probably be found that the taxable value to the State of such a property will be only &#163;85,000, that is, the original taxable value less the 15 per cent. levied in estate duty by the Commonwealth. It seems to me that there is a good deal in this point. The Commonwealth estate duty will be a debt like any other debt. This raises the question whether we should adopt this method of raising revenue when there are so many other methods which could be adopted. I do not press the matter, but should it be discovered later that my point is a good one, it will not be my fault that it has not received consideration. </para>

                        <para>- The position seems to be similar, though I do not know whether the legal effect will be the same in both cases. The war has badly dislocated the timber-getting business. In Victoria large numbers of men have been thrown out of employment because of the impossibility ot&#39; finding an outlet for timber. We do not know how long this state of things will continue, but it should be our endeavour to assist rather than to retard native industries. We should avoid the infliction of hardship in this case, even at the risk of loss of revenue. I would suggest that the Attorney-General should consider carefully the effect that this provision is likely to have on the industry of timber production. </para>

                        <para>- It is a condition of the lease, but it would not come under the proviso to section 28. The royalty is not rent, and it is not a fine, premium, or foregift. An alteration should be made in this regard, otherwise royalties will not be deductable. I submit that it is wholly undesirable to include the timber leases at all. The same argument applies to timber as to mining leases, but it applies in a much stronger way. In this case we are dealing with a perishable asset, and the right given by the Crown is a right given to an individual to destroy something and make it his own. Another practical difficulty in connexion with timber leases is that some of the greatest timber concerns do not work on leases, but get concessions or licences, and this proviso would not apply to them. The whole matter requires further consideration before the Government attempt to include timber leases under this taxation. This may involve a considerable dislocation of the timber industry, and that possibility does not seem to have been considered. If the timber lease is to be included, an alteration ought to be made to give the lessee the advantage of any royalties he pays. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to invite from the Attorney-General an expression of opinion in regard to certain timber leases in Tasmania. I believe that in that State there is a certain kind of timber lease that is in close association with the closer settlement policy, and one of the conditions attaching to the lease is that the lessee has to prepare and make available certain areas which are to be returned yearly to the Crown for closer settlement purposes. It seems to me that by including leases in the Bill we are likely to interfere with the closer settlement policy in Tasmania. I should like the Attorney-General to inform the House of what is likely to be the effect of the clause on leases of that character. </para>

                    <para>. - The inclusion of timber leases within the operation of this clause opens up a very wide field, because through the States there is a great difference in the conditions governing the management or control of timber cutting. No two States have precisely the same regulations or give the same facilities for cutting timber on Crown lands. In New South Wales the leases which this clause may be expected to cover are leases given by the Crown of the exclusive right to cut timber over certain areas. There is the ordinary licence to cut timber on Crown lands at a small fee, and there is another licence, for which a larger fee is payable, which permits the holder to cut timber on timber reserves. Then there are what are known as leases giving the exclusive right to cut over certain areas. In all these cases the licensee has not only to pay a fee for the licence to cut, but he also pays a royalty of so much per superficial foot of timber cut, so that the amount they pay for the right to get timber cannot be calculated from the amount set down in the lease. To that amount must be added the sum they pay in royalties. The Prime Minister stated that the taxable amount would be the difference between the rent paid and the economic value of the lease. But I desire to know whether the amount which is paid in royalty for the exclusive right to cut timber is to be calculated in addition to the rent, so that the economic value will be ascertained after making allowance for both. I can claim to have more timber men working in my constituency than there are in any other district in the Commonwealth, and I know they are operating under very disadvantageous circumstances. A great deal of the timber we have been marketing for some years, particularly piles and timber for wharfs and large structures, has been sent to Germany, and some of the mills were almost exclusively engaged in cutting that class of material. Since the war the orders from abroad have not been carried out, and consequently, with the exception of local orders, the mills are without work, and a great many men are idle. If the timber industry is to be handicapped bv a further charge, as it is suggested the provisions of this Bill will impose, the industry will have avery bad time indeed. I may add that it is also likely to meet with a further difficulty in connexion with the re-arrangement of the Tariff. Another fact to be borne in mind is that, as a rule, the timber areas are in very inaccessible places, and the reason for giving the exclusive right to cut is that the ordinary means of taking the timber out will not answer. Large sums of money have to be spent, generally in the construction of tramways, and other works, to carry the timber from the gorges and places which are inaccessible by ordinary transport. All these things add to the cost of the industry, and should be taken into consideration when the value of the leases is being assessed. It should be remembered that not only is the timber being marketed and employment being found for a large number of people, but when the timber is cut off the timber-getter assists in the development of the country by placing at the disposal of would-be settlers land wholly or partially cleared. I hope the Attorney-General will be able to pay particular attention to the royalties and other charges on exclusive timber areas and leases of that character. </para>

                    <para>.- I am astonished that the Government should propose to tax timber leases at all. The position in my electorate is somewhat the same as that in the electorate of Cowper. There are large areas over which certain individuals have the exclusive right to cut timber, and I should like to hear from the Attorney-General whether it is possible under the valuation clauses to make deductions for the expensive works that very often are necessary in order to get the timber. For instance, there is a licence granted by the Government of Western Australia to a company that is supplying firewood to the mines on the eastern gold-fields. That company has very large timber leases, and it has about 180 miles of tramway, a considerable length of which is not on the lease at all, because as the timber is cut out the tramway is extended into the forest beyond. I am not sure whether the provisions in the Bill would allow of the necessary deductions being made in a case of that sort, and yet the lease without such a long line of tramway would be absolutely valueless. In regard to the question of royalty, I am not at all clear that the present clauses of the Bill do permit the necessary deductions being made for royalties paid, but they certainly should be made. </para>

                    <para>. - There seems to be a misunderstanding of the effects of this measure upon leases. The basis of value remains the same in all leases. There is no difference in principle between a timber lease and any other kind of lease. A timber licence, however, is quite a different thing, and is not taxable. Most of the&#62; discussion this afternoon has had relation to timber licences which are not within the scope of this measure. Broadly speaking, the principles that apply to the valuation of a pastoral or any other kind of lease apply to a timber lease, but the honorable member for Cowper and the honorable member for Richmond, if 1 know anything of the circumstances existing in New South Wales, have been referring, not to&#39; a timber lease, but to a timber licence. </para>

                        <para>- Very well. The  honorable  member for Richmond spoke of one covering 180 miles of railway. That would be quite a considerable lease. <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> is obvious that a timber lease covering such an extent of country must co-exist -with other leases over the same area for other purposes - grazing and the like - &#187;nd the value of most of such timber leases granted will be below the taxable value, and so exempt. In any case, I submit that no hardship will arise. Difficulties - practical difficulties and difficulties of assessment - may occur. When we meet again we shall see just how far those difficulties can or cannot be surmounted. </para>

                        <para>- What else have I said ? When I put the honorable member&#39;s statement into  plainer  language, to find out whether he meant anything at all, he avails himself of the opportunity to indulge in a little abuse, a&#187;nd is immediately backed up by a very appropriate supporter. We owe it to the taxpayers that they&#39; should know exactly where they stand. We should not pass legislation exposing them to certain obligations, and at the same time hold out a vague hope of putting things right before they are called upon to send in their assessments. Every taxpayer, no matter how much or how little he may support the party in power, is entitled to know clearly what is expected of him. Our legislation should be clear and unambiguous. It is admitted, however, that this Bil&#93; is ambiguous. It does not carry out what the Prime Minister himself said would be a fair thin?, namely, that these royalties would be deducted. That being so, why can we not put the matter right, and let the men concerned know where they stand <inline font-style="italic">I</inline></para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Balaclava holds that it is a good thing to tax leases, and he has voted accordingly. Therein he differs from the honorable member for Grey, who, by his interjections, shows that he thinks it is very bad to tax leaseholders, but, nevertheless, votes enthusiastically, though silently, for their taxation ! I do not wish to embarrass my honorable friend, but I agree with him that mineral leaseholders suffer at least as great a hardship as do the timber leaseholders, concerning whom we have had this trouble this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- Certain words might be added to meet such cases. This is not a Liberal or a Labour question. It concerns all classes of the community. We find dying in the trenches persons of every creed and of all political views. Australia&#39;s noblest sons are going to the front, giving up all that is near and dear to them in order to fight for their country, and they should &#39; receive every consideration. To some of our brave men going to the front the facing of death is a mere detail compared with the wrenches that take place when they have to part with their wives and their children. We have at the front peer&#39;s sons and commoner&#39;s sons, squatters and boundary riders, members of the State Parliaments, and, I am proud to say, a member of this House. I was proud to hear from  Colonel Eyrie,  who is leaving us to serve at the front, that, Amongst the soldiers in his regiment is a number of gentlemen who occupy high positions in this country. One case he cited was that of a gentleman who owns it station estate worth something like &#163;40,000, and who is accepting 6s. a day as a private, and paying another person &#163;400 a year to look after his property in Australia. This is only one of many similar cases of men in good positions who, along with the humblest boundary riders in their service, are prepared to Weed arid die in the trenches for the liberties of their country. If a person has property of considerable value, and he happens to meet his death while performing the noblest duty he can on behalf of his country, his wife and family should not be penalized. I notified my intention yesterday morning to move this amendment, and I am pleased to think that it has the sympathy of the Prime Minister, while the Attorney-General has signified his intention to accept it. I congratulate the Government on their action in the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - It will shorten the discussion if I now state what amendments the Government propose to make in this measure. I quite agree with the contention of the honorable member for Calare. It would be a most unworthy return for the patriotic services that our soldiers are rendering on behalf of the Commonwealth and the Empire to impose on their estates and on their dependents the additional burdens contemplated by this measure. It is, therefore, proposed to exempt altogether such estates from the operation of the tax, and to do so in the following terms, which go further than proposed by the honorable member for Calare : - </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Victorian Act, for which, I understand, the honorable member for Flinders was responsible, provides that, while beneficiaries other than the widow and children pay 10 per cent, on &#163;20,000 and upwards, the direct descendants pay, on the same sized estates, &#163;6 4s. per cent., or about two-thirds. It is impossible to have a system that will fit in with the systems of all the States. I mentioned this morning how far the proposed amendments to which I have just referred would affect the revenue. Roughly speaking, it reduces the total estimated to be derived from this source by one- third. </para>

                <para>It is proposed to make amendments in one or two other clauses to which allusion was made yesterday. Clause 24, which provides that the Commissioner may, within three years after the last payment on account of duty, make any alteration or addition to the assessment as he thinks necessary, is to be amended so as to make the period one year, the reason being that the clause as it stands will tend to embarrass administration by hanging up estates. Ample provisions for dealing with cases of fraud are made. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Queensland law does. This is a Bill for the purpose of taxing estates, the intention being that the tax shall fall on estates at the time of death. It is considered fair and proper that the community should take a portion of the wealth left at death, for the purpose of the government of the country; and, inasmuch as this may be evaded by persons making a settlement during lifetime, this clause is inserted. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. The man obviously could not have had any intention of evading the duty proposed in this Bill. There are two points at issue. I maintain that the Bill should only apply to settlements made after the commencement of the Act, and my next point is that the period should be shortened from three years to one year. The intention of the Attorney-General should be to get at the transmission at the time of death, and not at a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> settlement intended to operate during life. To tax settlements extending back for three years, as against one year in the case of Victoria, will mean covering a tremendous period. The Attorney-General has shown a reasonable spirit in regard to other suggestions made, and I am sure that if he cannot take into consideration my first point, he might accept the second. </para>

                    <para>. - In connexion with the Victorian Act, passed many years ago, the Attorney-General has referred to my authority as against the contention of the honorable member for Darling Downs, but the Act of 1903 was merely an enlargement of the same class of duties that had been imposed for many years, and which, by making settlements <inline font-style="italic">inter vivos,</inline> there had been many attempts to evade, and as it merely continued a precautionary measure rendered necessary prior to that time, there was no reason why it should not come into operation with regard to settlements made before the increase of duty was imposed. In the case of the Commonwealth, however, we are starting, as the honorable member for Darling Downs says, with a clean sheet; and if we pass the measure as it now stands it will considerably affect <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> settlements or gifts made within the past three years. If they are not <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> if any interest in the property still remains to the testator, of course they do not get the benefit of our legislation. They must be proved to be real <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> gifts, in which the testator gives away the whole of his property. If this clause is agreed to, then, in the case of a man who made a settlement three years ago,, giving away his entire property - settlements usually mean dividing into smaller estates - each of the people who have been enjoying the estate in severalty will be faced, not only with the obligation to pay duty in respect to the interest they receive, but also with the necessity to pay duty on a higher rate than that applicable to the original property. I cannot imagine anything more unfair. </para>

To fix the date as after the introduction of the Bill is not unreasonable. If we place it further back, we are creating an absolute injustice, and imposing a tax, not on the estate of the person who dies, but on the portions of that estate which have been enjoyed for a long time, and at a higher rate than would have been imposed on the whole estate in other circumstances. </para>

                    (West Sydney- Attorney-General) 1.3.42 J. - The enthusiasm of honorable members in their attempt to make this a perfect measure is a little overwhelming. Every concession given them, instead of sating their appetites, only stimulates them to press further suggestions upon us. They are evidently inspired with the noble purpose of making this Bill the most perfect piece of legislation that has ever emanated from any Legislature. This no doubt is an extremely laudable ambition, but at this stage of the session I do not feel myself called upon to encourage it. I noted with great interest the fatuous admiration of the honorable member for Darling Downs for Victorian legislation - in patches. It appears that this legislation is sown with tares and wheat in such curious and unequal proportions that whenever the honorable member for Darling Downs stoops down lie gets a handful of wheat, but whenever I stoop down I get a handful of tares. The honorable member directed my attention to section 11 of the Victorian Act of 1903, but he resolutely declines to look at more than one part of the section. The measure was piloted through the Legislative Assembly by the honorable member for Flinders, and distinctly provides that every conveyance or gift by any person made before or after the commencement of the Act is covered by the provisions of the Act. The honorable member says that this was proper in the circumstances, because the Victorian Act was only amending the existing law, but that had Victoria been starting from the beginning they would have acted very differently. The honorable member for Flinders, in supporting his measure, said the best he could of circumstances which no doubt he has totally forgotten.  His  memory limps most curiously in this matter. Lest he should labour under that difficulty any longer, I shall take the liberty to refresh his memory from the pure well of the original Act. The session has been long and difficult, and many things have happened, and the honorable member has forgotten section 115 of the Administration and Probate Act of 1890, which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Bill</inline>
                    of 1903 amended. It was a consolidation of the law relating to probate and administrative duties. Section 115 is as follows: -
                </para>
                <para>If any person has made or shall hereafter make any conveyance or assignment, gift, delivery, or transfer of any estate, real or personal, or of any money or securities for money with intent to evade the payment of duty under this part of this Act, in case such person should, die, the property comprised in any such conveyance or assignment, or the subject-matter of any such gift, delivery, or transfer shall, upon the death of such person, be deemed to form part of his estate for the purposes of this part of this Act, upon which &#39; duty shall be payable under this part of this Act, and the payment of the duty upon the value of such property may be enforced against such property in the same wa.y as duty under this part of this Act is enforceable and as if such person had bequeathed or devised the said property to the person to whom the same may have been conveyed, assigned, given, delivered, or transferred. </para>
                <para class="block">Not only are all transfers and settlements made twelve months before the passing of the Act liable to duty, but all transfers and settlements made at any time are so liable. </para>

                        <para>-Yes. In any case the interest is much smaller than that of the original possessor, and it should therefore be taxed - if taxed at all - at a lower rate. The revenue is absolutely protected. It is open to the Attorney-General to adopt the same principle of operation in regard to this Bill as is adopted in regard to a Tariff measure, and make its provisions applicable from the date of introduction. I have not made an examination of the laws of the States, but I think that they afford no authority for the step which the Attorney-General wishes the Committee to take. This provision would operate with great harshness upon persons who for years have been enjoying in their own right what was once a part of- another person&#39;s estate, but has long since passed to them. </para>

Take the case of the Salvation Army, to which a man may leave large sums of money for the establishment of some institution like the  Boys&#39;  Home. Or there is the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Barnardo&#39;s</inline> Home. Institutions of that character are established by private bequest, and are governed by the deed or charter that creates them. But by inserting the word &#34; public &#34; in this sub-clause, that institution would probably not come within the definition of a charitable institution. By the omission of the word &#34; public,&#34; the Attorney-General will get nearer to his intention than if he allows the amendment to remain in its present form. </para>

                        <para>- In that case the testator&#39;s will was upset. The payment of duty had to be made, but the charities did not get any of the money that had been willed to them. From every point of view the Act failed to meet the intention of Parliament. As a result, another Act was passed last year giving the Courts greater freedom from the old case law, which stretches back three hundred years. The word &#34; charitable &#34; is as clearly defined in case law as any word in the language, but the words &#34; public charitable &#34; were very confusing to the Court. There were several reasons why that will was upset, but that was one of them. I think it would be better, in view of the experience we have had, if the established meaning of old words were adhered to and the word &#34; public &#34; were struck out. </para>

                    <para>.- I also hope the Attorney-General will strike out the word &#34; public,&#34; because I can assure him that a great many charities which are exempt under the State law will be brought under this taxation if that word is allowed to remain. The English Courts have discussed, particularly in the case of <inline font-style="italic">The Commissioner of Taxes</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Pemsel,</inline> what wore charities within the meaning of the Act. The greatest confusion has always been introduced by qualifying the private character of charitable institutions. In the South Australian District Councils Act and the Municipal Corporations Act the word &#34; charitable &#34; is used without any qualification. I think the same wording is adopted in many of the English Statutes. I do hope that we shall not prevent gifts of money to charities, by declaring that, although the object of the gifts is admirably subserved by the character of the institution, whether private or not, we shall exclude them from benefits that ought to be given to all kinds of charities.I am quite sure the public sense of the community will recognise that the insertion of the word &#34; public &#34; will place upon what ought to be the intention of Parliament a limitation which they never would sanction. </para>

                    <para>. - I can only say that my experience should be a salutary warning to those who endeavour to meet the wishes of honorable members opposite. I introduced an amendment practically upon the lines laid down by them, and am now face to face with positively hideous dangers. The bowelless purpose of this measure is exposed to the full view of a horrified public. It would appear to have its claws thrust into the very vitals of gentle charity. All this is very affecting; but with every desire to follow out the amiable and well-intentioned suggestions of honorable members opposite, I do not know what I am to do. The term &#34;public charitable purposes&#34; is very wide. As to what extent it is. narrower than &#39; &#39; charitable purposes &#39; &#39; I cannot for the moment say. Questions continually arise in the Courts as to what is a &#34; charitable &#34; gift or settlement. Is it the intention of my co-ad jutors to suggest that the word &#34;public&#34; ought to be struck out before the word &#34;education&#34;? Is that, too, wrong? </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the word &#34;public,&#34; before &#34;educational,&#34; should also come out. I do not wish to cite too many State Acts, but there is plenty of precedent for my contention. In the Municipal Corporations Act of Adelaide we have reference to any church, chapel, or building used exclusively for public worship, any building belonging to an academical institution which shall have obtained an act of incorporation, if such building be used directly for the academical purposes of such institution, and any other building, or part of a building, used exclusively as a school, &#34; whether public or private.&#34; That leaves no room for doubt. The object is not to tax people who are not making education a commercial enterprise. </para>

                        <para>- They are not identical. I do not wish to speak of any Act with which I am not quite familiar; but some of the definitions under the South Australian Act are not in line with those to Le found in this Bill. I would refer the honorable member to the District Councils Act of South Australia, and also to the Water Conservation Act of 1886, under which a question as to what was the meaning of &#34; charity &#34; arose in a case in which I happened to be engaged as counsel. In all these the intention, and, in most of them, the expression, is to give the benefit of exemption to private, as well as public, institutions of the kind. In order to prevent any doubt arising with regard to the schools covered by them the words whether public or private&#34; are used. Why should we throw upon the High Court the almost impossible obligation of finding out what is in our minds in regard to this expression ? The Attorney-General&#39;s benevolence towards Christmas should extend at least as far as I suggest, and if he will agree to strike out the word &#34; public,&#34; before the word &#34; educational,&#34; we shall accept it as something of a Christmas box. Even if the sub-clause be amended as I propose, it will not exempt as much as is exempted under the State Rating Act, and I think the State Taxation Acts. I think that the South Australian Taxation Act of 1884 contains a similar exemption of charitable lands, and that under il they are not liable to taxation. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Attorney-General will adopt the suggestion just made by the honorable member for Angas, and strike out the word &#34;public&#34; appearing before the word &#34;educational.&#34;&#39; If he does not he will create difficulties for himself in regard, first of all, to the determination of what are public educational trusts. There are many, certainly, that are on the border line, and there are many also which are of a distinctively private character, but are recognised by the States, in those cases where compulsory education prevails, as affording a sufficient standard of education. I cannot understand why there should be this limitation, insisting upon &#34;public&#34; educational institutions. One has only to stir one&#39;s imagination to recall large numbers of well-known educational institutions of a distinctly private character, and yet recognised as of the very highest standing, where students of all creeds and classes are educated ; and one cannot understand why the Attorney-General should insist on the retention of the word &#34;public&#34; in connexion with education any more than he should insist upon its retention in connexion with the word &#34;charitable.&#34; I hope that he will not. </para>

                <para class="block">There the term is applied whether there is a payment for the education granted or whether there is none. It is not material that such education should be controlled by the State. The Statute from which the honorable member for Angas quoted is of no use to us in this connexion, since we are dealing with the disposition of estates. If a testator, by a certain form of words, could so dispose of his estate as to wholly escape the payment of estate duty, that would be to defeat the purposes of this law. If a testator devised his estate to be used for the purpose of educating his own family, would the honorable member, as a lawyer, say that that would not come within the amendment suggested by him, and the estate wholly escapes payment of estate duty ? We must safeguard the revenue; and I take it that it is not the intention of the honorable member for one moment to permit any wholesale evasion of the Act by a mere disposition of property covered by such a provision. I, therefore, suggest that &#34; public educational &#34; is the proper phrase to use. If it should turn out that sufficient authority can be adduced to support a contrary view, and a form of words can be inserted which will safeguard the revenue, I shall be quite willing to insert them. I am not wedded to the word &#34; public,&#34; although it is a well-known word, and has a definite meaning. Under the circumstances, I ask the honorable member to allow the clause to pass, and I shall consult with him in the matter. If it should prove that the amendment can safely be made by inserting some words to effect our purpose and his, I shall have that done in another place. </para>

In the Acts from which I cited, the word &#34;school&#34; is used, and there may be ambiguity introduced if the word &#34;public&#34; is used here. I understand the Attorney-General wishes to give expression to the sense that schools - educational institutions- - which are exempt under local Acts, ought to be exempt under this Bill.

                        <para>- I know that there has been a great deal of litigation in England owing to the use of the word &#34; public,&#34; and even in the case of the smallest class of churches the question has arisen whether a contribution made by parishioners, in some cases to schools, took the institutions outside the category of charity in the meaning of the Act. That I wish to avoid. I might mention that in the Waterworks Act of South Australia, the word &#34; public &#34; is used, and the question of the limitation imposed by it came before the Courts. It was a case in which I was engaged myself, and after argument had gone on for a time, the Crown was convinced that such institutions ought tq be exempt, and a verdict was given by consent - the question was never decided. In the definition of the South Australian Act to which I have referred, we find mentioned public hospitals, lunatic asylums, benevolent institutions, and buildings &#34;used exclusively for charitable purposes, and the question arose whether the word &#34; public &#34; did not qualify the term &#34;charitable purposes.&#34; However, if the Attorney-General promises to consider the matter, and, if necessary, have an amendment made in the Senate, I am perfectly satisfied. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause provides for the deduction from the gross value of the assessable estate all debts &#34;due and owing&#34; by the deceased at the time of his death. I do not know whether this means that a debt must actually be payable at the time of death, because, if so, and the clause does not apply, say, to a mortgage due later on, then there will be a gross injustice. There has been a. good deal of trouble to find out what is meant by &#39; &#39; due and owing,&#34; and I think that the phrase &#34; due or owing &#34; would be the safer. I do not desire to move an amendment, because the matter is so technical, and I satisfy myself with drawing the attention of the Attorney-General to the point. </para>

                    <para>.- There may be some difficulty in lodging a notice of objection within thirty days, and I am not sure whether the Commissioner under the Bill will have power to extend the time. By clause 34 the Commissioner has power to extend the time for payment of the duty, but there is no provision to enable him to extend the time for the lodging of an objection. I think the Commissioner could waive his right to stop the appeal ; but one does not like to place the taxpayer, who may have difficulty in finding out how his estate stands, at the mercy of the Commissioner. I suggest that the Attorney-General consider the advisability of inserting words to the effect that the notice of objection may be lodged within thirty days after the service of the notice of assessment, or in such further time not exceeding thirty days as the Commissioner may allow. </para>

                        <para>.- Subclauses 2 and 3 take the question of costa out of the discretion of the Court, and provide that if the appellant&#39;s estimate of valuation is less than what the Court finds, the costs must be paid by the appellant. Such a penal provision does not appear in any State probate legislation, and I do not think that it should appear in our measure. Assessments of value are, to a large extent, matters of opinion. In dealing with estates, we are not dealing with offences, such as cases of fraud under the Customs Act, but we are dealing with something tangible, the valuations of which can be checked. There may be many opinions widely divergent as to the value of an estate, and to compel a man who made a mistake in an estimate to pay all the costs of extended litigation would be unfair. In the majority of cases people will be too frightened to risk the costs of an appeal, especially when there may be two appeals, because assuredly there would be a second appeal to the High Court. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know whether the Attorney-General has decided what relation this provision will have to the State laws. As our legislation does not override the State legislation in regard to taxation measures, it may be that any provision we make giving us priority cf charge over the obligation to the State will not be valid. I cannot say what the position is. I merely call attention to the fact that under the Constitution taxation is an absolutely independent power, and is not part of our exclusive or concurrent powers. </para>

                        <para>.- On the spur of the moment, to find the true significance of some of the clauses of the Bill is difficult. This clause professes to declare the order of liability in respect to the different parts of an estate. It unlooses the obligation on the personal estate, and impliedly makes it a charge on the realty. The laws of the different States vary upon this point. In Victoria the primary liability of the personal estate for probate duty is not exactly the same as the provision in South Australia, and the question that arises in my mind is whether, for the purpose of raising this duty, we can declare the law of liability, and so alter the existing law of liability which the State prescribes. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Attorney-General will look into this matter very closely. A will might declare that certain legacies should be paid in cash immediately. This difficulty might then arise. The executors, to pay the duty, might have to use the whole of the available cash, and would then have to sell the land, under perhaps disadvantageous circumstances. </para>

It is the penalty that is provided for knowingly and wilfully making or delivering any false returns and other similar offences.

                        <para>. - In my judgment, no Bill of this session will compare in importance with the measure now under discussion. I take no exception to the cold statement of figures made by the Minister in moving the second reading, but his speech might well have been warmed with some reference to considerations entirely outside those of finance. If by pensions is meant, as is ordinarily meant, payment to the full of services rendered to the State, the Bill is misnamed. We can never pay for the services these soldiers render Australia in the war, and, therefore, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, &#34; pensions,&#34; we may not express exactly our relationship to the soldiers in this particular measure. I am one of those who believe that the proposals set out in this Bill are in themselves meagre enough, and I frankly confess that I should like to see them made a little more liberal. I know that we treat all matters relating to pensions very charily in this House, and one has only to mention the subject to be the butt of obloquy and scorn. But when we are faced with the grim realities of a struggle for our national existence, I hope we shall approach the matter in a very different manner from the way in which we have approached it in times gone by. At any rate, the outstanding fact remains that some of our finest men have given up all they possessed, have left their occupations behind them - some of them at sacrifices which in themselves are very likely to be of a ruinous character - and have surrendered all material prospects in life to go abroad to fight for their country at this time. Therefore, I say that when we talk of payment of this kind, the word &#34; pensions &#34; is a complete misnomer as applied to a condition of affairs in which a man, without considerations of any kind but those of love for his country and realization of his duty to his country in this time of national peril, goes forth to sacrifice his life, if need be, so that his home, his country, and its institutions may be made secure. Accordingly all sides of the House, and, I think, every member in the House, approaches this Bill in only one spirit, and that is a desire to do the best we possibly can for these men, and, for the rest, to give them our blessing in the arduous undertakings of the war. </para>

                    <para>The scheme of pensions outlined by the Assistant Minister differs slightly from a draft which the Liberal Government left behind them when they surrendered office. I cannot help feeling that this Bill is very much belated. Just why it should have been kept for the closing hours of the session I do not know. I have an impression that this should have been the first legislation of the session, and there is no reason why it should not have been. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that it would in a pecuniary sense; but I do think that every man who went to the war should have known that he was leaving this provision behind him, and there was no reason at all, except the dilatoriness of the Department and the Government, why this should not have been brought forward long ago. However, it boots nothing to be critical as to that point now. We are face to fac&#174; with this measure, and I do not think it will take very long to pass it through this Chamber. </para>

                    <para>I have already stated that this matter was under our consideration, and that we left behind us a draft which was not quite complete; but, so far as it went, it was more liberal than this Bill in some respects, and perhaps a little less so in others, although the aspect in which it was less liberal was due entirely to an oversight on the part of the Minister of Defence. It was decided that the amount for the widow, even in that scheme, should be &#163;50; but the Government considered that the man who was totally incapacitated should have more than the widow for this reason: A man who has lost both hands, or both legs, or his eyesight, or has suffered total incapacity of any kind, is a much more helpless being in the world than a strong woman who has no children, and is able to make her way in the world with the help&#39; of a &#163;52 pension. That was the consideration which induced us to make the amount for total incapacitation &#163;75, instead of &#163;52, as this Bill proposes. I frankly do not think that this is a sufficient provision for the man who is totally incapacitated. All he will get under this Bill will be &#163;52 for himself, and &#163;26 for his wife. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members must remember that we have not hurt ourselves yet over this war; all we have done is to give a little of our abundance. There has been no real sacrifice, so far as the nation as a whole is concerned; nor do I think that this Bill represents a burden the liquidation of which to the uttermost farthing will hurt the country in any way. I cannot help feeling that we could have been a little more liberal with the man who is totally incapacitated than this Bill proposes that we shall be, and I would strongly urge on the Government, even at this stage, to consider whether it would not be wise to make the amount for total incapacity &#163;78 per annum instead of &#163;52. Even that would be only &#163;104 for the man and his wife, and that is not too liberal a pension for a man who has been made utterly unfit for any occupation by giving his services in the defence of his country. I appeal to the Government to consider whether- they will not make the amount for total incapacity a little more liberal than the Bill proposes. Apart from that, I shall have little to say about the amounts of the pensions, except to remark that perhaps the amounts set down for officers are very small indeed in comparison with the Imperial pensions. So, indeed, is the pay we give our officers. Australian officers above the rank of captain receive much less than the officers in the Imperial Army. If we are going to standardize our Army right through, the least we can do is to pay, officer for officer and man for man, a little more than is paid in the Imperial Army. Instead of that, we are actually paying them less, and I should not be surprised if, later on. in consequence of that fact, we have an exodus of some of our officers to the Imperial Army. </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable member must have seen that the Imperial Government have quite recently doubled the pensions, and provided for the appropriation of an additional sum of &#163;100,000,000 sterling for the payment of pensions alone. </para>

                    <para>To realize how little the war is hurting us, one has only to contrast our payments on account of the war during the year with those of the Mother Country. Our total outlay for the whole twelve months is calculated at &#163;11,700,000, but we have already read that the Imperial Government have raised a loan of &#163;350,000,000, which is to meet the war requirements until May next. In addition to that, the sum of &#34;&#163;100,000,000 has been appropriated, or hypothecated in some way, for the payment of war pensions. When, therefore, my honorable friend suggested, as he was perfectly right in doing, that the totality of our pensions would run into over &#163;1,000,000 sterling, he stated what is a very small amount indeed. After all, Australia has one-ninth of the population of Great Britain, and all through their figures show that Great Britain is expending nearer twenty-nine times what the Commonwealth is expending. I remember that when I was talking some time ago about the number of soldiers we were sending to the war, the Prime Minister quite properly reminded me that we had already a Navy in Australia. The reply to that is very simple : So far our Navy has cost us only about &#163;1,500,000 annually for the last four years. </para>

                            <para>- No. It has cost Australia about &#163;4,000,000 for the construction of the Navy, and about &#163;2,000,000 at the outside would cover the cost of administration. Iu those four years the Mother Country has spent nearly &#163;200,000,000 on the Navy, so that the introduction of the Navy into the comparison does not help us much. </para>

                            <para>- I am making: the criticism now. I do not agree with the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister that we should aim only at sending such men from Australia as we can equip ourselves from local resources. I think we ought, if necessary, to rake up equipment anywhere we can find it in the world. The whole world is being laid under contribution by the fighting armies to-day, and it is not a matter of confining ourselves to our own country when we desire to get soldiers ready for the war. You buy wherever you can obtain what is required in the shortest possible time. The all-important essential is celerity in the despatch of troops. </para>

                    <para>The point that I wish to emphasize is that, since we are sending out a limited number of men to the war, and since apparently the war is not going to cost us very much, so far as the actual equipment and despatch of troops are concerned, seeing that it will represent only &#163;11,700,000 for a whole year, we might well be a little more liberal with the pensions that we propose to provide. The Treasurer should make the minimum pension in the case of total incapacity, not &#163;52 a year, but &#163;78 per year. That would mean that a man who was crippled and a derelict, so far as the ordinary occupations of life are concerned, would, with his  wife,  receive &#163;104 per year. I do not think that this little addition would hurt us very much, but it would mean much to the man who had left everything behind him to go to the war, and had come back fit for nothing. We should not forget the kind of men we are sending, nor should we forget the position that many of them occupy. It is well known that many with big fortunes are serving as privates. That is an argument for no pension at all, perhaps, since men so situated will not need one. But between the two extremes - between the man who has &#39; nothing but his labour to depend upon and the man at the other end of the social scale, who has a fortune - there are many occupying good positions in our social and industrial life. Some of them have given up positions where they were receiving &#163;10 per week, in order to go to the war, and while on active service they will receive 6s. per day. Since all gradations and ranks and degrees of capacity for earning money are among these men to whom the lower rates of pay apply, I plead again that the scale of pensions should be a little more liberal where they are totally incapacitated. With regard to the officers, I think that the proposals of the late Government were a little more liberal. </para>

                            <para>- Our maximum was, I think, &#163;250; here it is &#163;156 per annum. As the Minister very properly showed the other day, these payments, even if they were raised, as proposed by us, to &#163;250 per annum, would be much below the Imperial rates, which, in special cases, go up to very high amounts. The scale which the Minister quoted the other day related, I think, to colonels; but above them there are other commanding officers who, I think, have special pensions allotted to them, in  addition  to the liberal ones quoted by the honorable gentleman. Our officers who go to the front will be very much below the officers of the Imperial army in this matter of pensions. Not only are they working for less pay here, when following their military occupations, but when they go to war, and suffer, we propose to give them far less than half the pension they would receive if they were in the Imperial army. Altogether, our scheme of pensions cannot be said to be particularly liberal. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking not of the loss of a limb, but of cases where death or total incapacity occurs. I understand that in the Imperial Army, in the case of total incapacity, a man with a wife and children would receive up to 24s. or 25s. per week. That would be quite as liberal as the payments we propose to make, having regard to the difference in value. </para>

                            <para>- May I remind the honorable gentleman of the figures he gave me the other day regarding the number of men we propose to send to Hie front. We have 42,000 men provided for in respect of the financial year. Of these, 20,000 have gone, 13,000 are going this month, and during the next six months there are to go only three batches of 2,000 each. Of this total of 42,000, 9,000 will be reinforcements. </para>

                            <para>- The fact remains that we are only aiming at having 33,000 effectives in the field for the year. I also asked the Assistant Minister of Defence what reinforcements it would take to maintain these 33,000 effectives in the field. His answer was, &#34;About 2,000 per month.&#34; That shows for the twelve months a war wastage of 24,000 in 33,000. The wastage of war altogether is very terrible. When I held office as Minister of Defence it was estimated, I think, at 68 per cent, per annum. I think, therefore, that there must be many kinds of invalidity other than those which the Assistant Minister of Defence mentioned when introducing this Bill. His figures seem to bear out that view. He said that to keep these 33,000 effectives in the field we should require to supply, roughly, 2,000 a month. </para>

                    <para>But the point that, is relevant to this discussion is as to how we can help in a practical way those we send to the front and who suffer in consequence. I find that in the Old Country there is a whole system of pensions payable to soldiers. The honorable member for Maranoa, himself an old soldier, will recollect that if a man there in peace time is incapacitated he is entitled to a scale of allowances for the rest of his life. The officers also, after so many years&#39; service, receive very high allowances in the shape of pensions. I saw it stated the other day that an officer in the Imperial Army who has served eight years, may leave, and, if he joins one of the territorial arms of the service, is entitled to a pension of &#163;100 a year for ten years, or a total pension of &#163;1,000 for having served in the Army for eight years. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It is material for us to know whether an Imperial soldier, who is incapacitated in the war, will receive this peace pension, to which he would have been entitled had he left the Army at the time the war began, in addition to the pension which he will receive as a consequence of any disability incurred in the war. Are those pensions concurrent and&#39; cumulative, or does one displace tha other? If the Imperial soldier gets the two pensions, he will be treated relatively better than our own men. </para>

                            <para>- I know. I am now only speaking of the relative positions of our men and the men in the Imperial Army. If the Imperial soldier gets the two pensions he will be quite as well off in point of money, to say nothing of the money value, as our own men in Australia. In a matter of this sort we ought to have some information. But I know that when I was at the Defence Department it was marvellous what little information could be obtained about the other armies of the world. I could not get any; and o:ie of the last things I did was to instruct <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pethebridge</inline> to get all the details of the Imperial pensions scheme, so that we might set about arranging one for our own Forces. </para>

                    <para>We are only tinkering with our Defence Forces if we do not secure some retiring allowance for them. We can never have that circulation of ability from bottom to top unless  there  is something for the men to leave the Army on. It is not a fair thing to keep a man in the service for years, and then allow him to go out to beggary; and the result is often that we keep him in. </para>

                            <para>- There are numbers of men in the industrial army who can make three or four times the money that men in the Defence Forces can make. If a man is an expert military officer, thoroughly trained, with a complete knowledge of his business, his ability in civil life would, in many cases, have brought him much higher pay than he caa receive as a soldier. In our Army and Navy we are now giving an education equal to that of a university. We are turning out men with such knowledge as would enable them to obtain a bachelor-ship of engineering at any one of the seats of learning. Altogether, we are giving them such a scientific training, in both Army and Navy, as would enable them to command respectable positions in the scientific and professional sections of our civil life. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so ; and, therefore, we must keep that fact in mind when we are considering the pay and pensions we propose to give them. In the British Army, and, indeed, in every Army and Navy in the world, the men have either to get on or get out ; they must keep going up or go, the idea being that there shall be the highest ability constantly circulating from the bottom to the top of the service. Therefore it is that provision is made for them in the shape of handsome pensions. I met a doctor of the Imperial Navy some few years ago, who informed me that he was entitled to a pension of &#163;1 a day after twenty years&#39; service. That is the way in which officers of the Imperial Navy are treated. </para>

                            <para>- I have yet to learn that a pension scheme such as prevails in the Imperial Army, and every other Army in the world, is inconsistent with the spirit of Democracy. The pension is only a payment for services rendered - part of the salary. In most Democratic countries pensions are paid, so that all over the world, according to the Prime Minister, the spirit of Democracy is being flouted. All this, however, only indirectly bears on the question of our officers&#39; pensions. According to this Bill, an officer of the highest grade is to be paid &#163;156 a year as a maximum pension. I suppose the Government have made up their minds on the point; but we certainly thought that a maximum of &#163;250 was little enough to pay men of great skill and ability, who are leaving so much behind them in the way of civil opportunities </para>

                            <para>- Well, to practically administer the Bill under the Treasurer. In the United States such pensions are administered by the Department of the Interior, which a writer has described as a collection of &#34; unrelated Government bureaux &#34; - a sweeping up of odd ends. </para>

                            <para>- That is largely owing to the amendment of the law made some years afterwards. I do not suggest that we should follow American methods. All I am suggesting now is that the Treasurer should administer these pensions, with such a body as has been indicated to assist him in the details. I hope that this Bill will find a speedy passage to the statute-book. The sooner we let our soldiers know that we are making some provision for them in the event of any untoward circumstances - as seems more than likely in connexion with this most terrible of all wars - the better for our own reputation, and the better for their comfort and those they leave behind. We owe it to them to do this at the earliest possible moment, and to make the provision as liberal as our circumstances will permit. </para>

                        <para>. - I should be wanting in courtesy to the right honorable gentleman, and to the House generally, if I did not say a word or two in reply to the speech  just  made. Happily there are no two opinions about the necessity for passing a measure of this kind; there are no two wishes on the part of honorable members as to what should be done in the direction of payment of pensions, subject to the limitation of our capacity to pay, and in this connexion I do not think that the proposals in the Bill should be regarded as the final instalment of pensions. But I maintain that there is a great deal of wisdom in accepting the scheme submitted now. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that the scheme should have been brought before Parliament earlier, but Ministers are not to be blamed for the delay. There were suggestions by the previous Government for a scheme of pensions, but the evidence upon which it was founded was limited and incomplete. </para>

                            <para>- Not altogether; but I say that Parliament, having already decided upon the principle in the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, we had that basis to follow ; and this measure is founded upon it, whether the rate be higher or lower than honorable members may like. No doubt there is not an honorable member whose heart would not get the better of his judgment, and who would not vote anything that sentiment might suggest, and what, perhaps, he thinks the action of those who are giving their lives for their country would justify : but, at the same time, the scheme outlined and contained in the Bill has been submitted in good faith, and in the hope that it will meet most of the circumstances. The Leader of the Opposition has introduced into this debate a number of subsidiary and somewhat extraneous subjects. One was the question of general pensions to officers of the Military Forces. I presume such pensions would also carry with them pensions to the men, because, in a Democratic system such as our defence system is, we cannot single out the officers of our Permanent Forces and leave the men stranded. </para>

                            <para>- In my wildest dreams I never thought that the Leader of the Opposition would. He spoke of the Government aud our contingents. Australia lias been singularly fortunate in what it has been able to do. It has been able to send forward a very large contingent of men, equipped in everything needed to make them a first-class fighting force, and it has been able to help in other ways both on sea and on land in a way that no other Dominion of the Empire can, but that does not relieve the Government, whoever they may be, at the present time from doing everything they can to send additional contingents. That is being done. I have told Parliament already that every available officer capable of training men as soldiers is being secured and set apart for that purpose. Indeed, some men are now being trained in order that they may train others, with the object of having our contingents thoroughly trained before they leave Australia and during the period when we have not the means of conveying them to the seat of war. We are losing no time in this direction, and there will be no end to the number of men being trained, provided that they are otherwise fit to be soldiers. Let me assure the honorable member that there is no limitation to the number of men that will be sent forward, although the number mentioned by him was the maximum number suggested by the Imperial authorities for the present. The Government have never limited themselves to the number asked for. </para>

I believe that the principle he is following is quite sound, and that it will have a good effect. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the administration of this measure should be under the Treasurer. Obviously the failure of the American system was lack of proper control. I think that a Naval and Military Board ought to decide doubtful questions, and make recommendations to the Executive. </para>

                            <para>- The point may be determined from time to time, as we see how the system works, but I should not like to be in the Treasury if every case had to be determined by the Minister. The determination of many questions in regard to invalid and old-age pensions is often difficult, but in this case there will be military reasons for certain injuries that come within the law, and also for injuries that do not come within it which it should not be the sole function of the Treasurer to determine, but which should be determined from recommendations by some competent tribunal. The Leader of the Opposition also raised the question of taking the pension from the widow who marries again. I admit that this is a question on the borders of doubt, but I think that the larger measure of protection for the widow will lie in not paying the pension after her marriage. I hesitate to go into the reasons that may appeal to the minds of many people at the present time. A lover wishing to become a husband desires to make provision for his wife throughout her life. I do not think that widows will suffer if we allow this provision to remain. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a measure which we can all approach without the faintest shade of party feeling. I congratulate the Government on having introduced it. One of the most shocking things of the past has always seemed to me, and no doubt to many honorable member&#39;s, to be the fact that some of those who have fought the battles of Empire have been left in old age to devices for obtaining a livelihood which were unworthy of the country which they had served. The substantial provision made for the widows of men in the lower ranks is by no means too large, having regard, not merely to the service to the country that is being performed by their husbands, but to their own wants. I cordially support the view of the Leader of the Opposition that the Government might well consider whether it might not be possible to make some addition to the provision, in cases of total disablement,, when in a family there will be at least two mouths to feed instead of one. I have nothing to add to the arguments which he put forward, except to say that this is a matter in which we should not count the cost too much. Of all duties that fall on Parliament, the gravest is that of making provision for those who have left us to take the terrible risks of the war. Among both privates and officers are many men who have made great sacrifices by giving up means of livelihood dependent upon their skill in business and professions which they may never fully recover. For that reason I conceive that the Government has reasonably not made the pensions of the widows of officers as high as they would be under the Imperial scheme. I do not think that we ought to slavishly follow that scheme in this matter, but I ask the Prime Minister to consider  whether  some extension might not be made for the reason that some of the officers who have gone away have, to some extent, gone under expectations grounded upon the usual practice in the Empire. It would be an unfortunate thing if they had to carry on their extremely responsible duties under a sense of reasonable disappointment. I wish to add a word or two on the point referred to by both the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister as to the aid that we have sent to the Mother Country in this struggle. I believe that the Government is endeavouring to do all that is possible. I think that the Prime Minister recognises - as we all do - that this is the hour of trial for us, and for every part of the Empire. I have no doubt whatever that the interests of Australia are perhaps more deeply involved than those of any other part of the Empire, and that the maintenance of our liberty and of our possession of the Continent depends almost immediately on the success of the Allies. We look to the Prime Minister, as the leader of Australia, to lead, not merely in the administrative work of doing what can be done in the recruiting and training of men, but also to direct the public opinion of Australia by impressing upon our fellow citizens on every possible occasion the supreme necessity and duty that rests upon them. I asked the right honorable gentleman how the volunteers are coming in, and he replied that they are coming in as fast as we are able to train them. I do not come here&#39; to criticise in this matter. It is the duty of all of us to assist the Government in every way. We are all anxious to follow the lead which the Prime Minister can give in arousing, and keeping aroused, the patriotism of the people, and the feeling that a supreme effort should be made, and must be made now. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire, in the first place, to compliment the Assistant Minister on the clear and logical speech with which he introduced the Bill, and which impressed other members besides myself. It should be a good augury for him that the measure is not a party measure. I am in agreement, with a good deal that was said by the Leader of the Opposition. I agree with him in what he said about clause 4 as to the members of the Board. In my opinion a saving would be effected if we took advantage of the experience of the </para>

I see no necessity for having a medical practitioner on the Board. We have our active Government medical officers to rely upon for reports, and it is not necessary to have a medical officer on the Board. The provision under which a widow may lose her pension differentiates between a woman and a mau. That should not be done by a Democracy. Every effort of this Parliament since its creation has been to bring the woman up to the level of the man in matters of citizenship. Many of the widows for whom provision has been made are young women. A case in point must be known to all honorable members. Were that widow to marry and again lose her husband, she would not resume her pension rights. </para>

                            <para>- The provision in regard to children is a just one. We are only the dispensers of the public money, and I am sure that if the citizens of Australia could express their opinions, they would say that all children should have equal consideration. Why should widows be treated differently? Do not the wives of workers love their mates as much as the wives of men better off love theirs? Have not the officers more money to put by than the average private possesses? We are paying the leader of our Forces more than General Von Moltke received when he led the victorious German army through France. He was then getting what was equivalent to about &#163;1,500 in English moneys We are paying our leader as much as was paid to Major-General Hutton. </para>

                            <para>- I shall continue my remarks in reference to the widow who will lose her pension. That might operate as a bar against her on her re-marriage. I think honorable members will agree that the highest ideal of marriage is attained when there is monetary independence on the part of the woman, so that she enjoys a greater equality with the man than under the old idea that the woman was only a chattel and slave. However, that, is a detail which I do not wish to press at the present time. But if a division is taken in Committee on this question, I shall vote to give women equal rights with men. I have always been somewhat timid in regard to the question, of pensions. To see the effect of the pension system, honorable members have only to look at the most, glaring example in the whole world, that of Victoria, which, in this respect, equals, if not exceeds, the United States of America. In 1851 the pension system was started at a cost of &#163;500 a year. Last year the pensions totalled &#163;360,000, although the system had been nominally abolished twenty-five years ago. I do not wish honorable members to have the idea that I desire to be unjust to the public servants of Victoria. I recognise that they entered into an honorable agreement with the Government, and were justly entitled to the pensions they drew, but the pensions to which the Government committed themselves at that time were most ridiculous and unfair to the taxpayers who paid them. The figures show that for the year 1895-6 Victoria paid more in pensions than all the other States of Australia and New Zealand combined. In that year the Victorian pensions bill was &#163;339.228, South Australian &#163;6,930. Western Australia &#163;4,998, Queensland &#163;27,960, Tasmania &#163;11,542, New Zealand &#163;29,148, New South Wales &#163;150,834, or a total of &#163;231,418. In other words, Victoria paid in pensions &#163;2 for every pound paid by New South Wales!, although at that time the latter State had a population of over 1,200,000. To-day the proportion is even worse. Honorable members will recognise that if the pension obligations of Victoria rose from &#163;500 in 1851 to &#163;360,000 in 1913, in other words, from something over &#163;1 a day to nearly &#163;1,000 a day, it behoves us to consider carefully what we do in regard to the establishment of &#34;a pension system. The figures which have been submitted to the House show that if the 20,000 men we have sent to the war meet with average mortality and injuries the Commonwealth will be liable to pay &#163;250,000 a year in pensions. But honorable members will recognise that Australia will not stop at sending 20,000 men to fight. This war may drag on for many months, and the existence of the Empire is at stake. By sending additional troops to the front we may make ourselves liable for a payment of &#163;500,000 a year in pensions, or, if we quadrupled the present figures, so that Australia were represented in the fighting line by an army of 80,000 men, the annual cost of pensions would be &#163;1,000,000. I do not object to that, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George has said, those who have much to give will bp required to give more. That distinguished gentleman stated that the revenue from the wealth of Great Britain amounted to &#163;2,700,000,000 per annum, and that if he taxed that in proportion to the taxation at the time of the Napoleonic wars, when Pitt was controlling the Exchequer, he would raise in taxation &#163;700,000,000 in one year. We in Australia must be prepared to face taxation. The worker pays his taxation through the Customs. The balance must be provided from land and income tax. </para>

                    <para class="block">Cunningham, the former of whom waa the British Minister Plenipotentiary at Berne, in Switzerland, and the figures are: - Great Britain, &#163;64 10s. 4d.; Spain, &#163;56 2s. 4d. ; Austria-Hungary, &#163;52 12s. ; France, &#163;46 13s. 6d. ; Germany, &#163;46; Denmark, &#163;45; Italy, &#163;43 18s.; Belgium, &#163;40 10s.; Holland, &#163;31; Russia, &#163;22 16s. ; and Switzerland, &#163;7. That leads up to the subject of the pensions paid by the Imperial authorities to our soldiers. I need hardly remind honorable members of the number of Balaclava heroes who have died in the workhouse. The statement made by the honorable member for Maranoa that the pension used to be reckoned at &#34; 6d. a wing&#34; speaks more eloquently of the conditions that used to obtain than any words of mine could. I have had the misery of collecting sixpences from students in order to purchase a movable hand-chair for a Balaclava hero who had lost both his legs. Over a period of twenty years, frequent operations had been performed on account of the decay of the bone, until eventually the old hero collapsed and died. That is an instance of how the rankers were taken care of in days gone by. On the other hand, the pensions of officers were fairly high and comfortable, and no one could complain on that score. I was a little astonished to hear the statement of. the Leader of the Opposition that the pension of the widow of an officer was hardly sufficient. I would have been glad to welcome from the right honorable gentleman a statement that the pension should be made equal for the widows of rankers and officers alike, for the logical reason that if the pensions to children are the same, the pensions to the widows also should be the same. </para>

                            <para>- But we do not make them in connexion with the old-age pensions. Thanks to the courtesy of the Prime Minister I am able to quote accurate figures of the estimated payments on account of old-age pensions and the maternity allowance. The estimate for the old-age and invalid pensions is &#163;2,579,264, and for the maternity allowance &#163;674,990, or a grand total of &#163;3,254,254. That is possibly the most noble example of pensions to those who need them that the world at the present moment can show. I believe in only one system of pensions; that is, for a pension which every unit in the community could claim. Having had the experience of presenting 1,500 applicants for old-age pensions, I have met men and women who were once in very high positions who blessed the Government that had brought into existence that splendid system of assistance to the needy. I hope to see the day when that pension will be increased, and when there will be only one pension, which every individual may claim. I had hoped that that might have come about had it not been for this accursed war which is blanking out the world in a horror of smoke, crime, and blood. Such a scheme would have obviated the necessity for the introduction of a Bill such as this. Honorable members must recollect the splendid speech made by the Honorable John Burns in the House of Commons, when he showed that the danger in many civil occupations is far greater than the average danger of the soldier. Having regard to the average life of a soldier, the risk he takes is a mere bagatelle compared with the risk run by those engaged in the chemical works of Rutherglen. The average life of a healthy agricultural labourer taken from the land and put into those factories is only seven years, and any woman who enters those establishments will never enjoy the God-given privilege of motherhood. Those workers cannot even cleanse their faces with the ordinary water that flows in our rivers. Their occupations are far more deadly than soldiering, and their pay is much less. One officer in our Expeditionary Forces left a position in the city at &#163;3 per week to become a lieutenant at &#163;7 7s. a week, so that by becoming a soldier he improved his position by over 100 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Those figures do not alter the comparison. The lieutenant had to pay his own mess when he was receiving only &#163;3 a week. In round figures he improved his position from &#163;3 to &#163;7 7s. a week. This is the most expensive body of fighting men that has ever gone into war; but Australia is proportionately richer than any other  country fighting to-day, and ought to be able to afford that payment as long as it is necessary. We must remember that it is not only the welfare of the Homeland that is at stake, although, if it were, and Australia were perfectly safe, I do not believe there is any one so selfish as to advocate that Australia should not give its last man and its last shilling to help the Mother Country. Much more should we be prepared to make a sacrifice when we, together with the Motherland, are fully involved, for none will gainsay that if the heart of the Empire were destroyed by a battle in the North Sea, there would be no chance of Australia ever flying its own flag in the Southern Ocean. I have made my protests. They are, briefly: That the  appointment  of a medical man to the Board should be mandatory; that a widow should not forfeit her pension because she sacrifices portion of her rights of citizenship; that we should be careful in reference to the growth of a pension system ; and that the widow of an officer should not receive more than the widow of a ranker. The commanding officer will draw an amount equal to that received by General von Moltke when he was chief of the whole of the successful German armies in France. </para>

                            <para>- Speaking from memory, about ls. 3d. per day. In Australia, military men who have remained behind, and, following the advice given in <inline font-style="italic">Pinafore,</inline> have &#34; polished up the handle of the big front door,&#34; have received very high rank. Some, who would not volunteer for active service during the South African war, now have large and important commands, and are drawing big salaries, whereas men who did go to the front, and who gained the encomiums of British Generals, have been passed over. They have volunteered on this occasion, but have not been given a chance. The truth is that they do not belong to the Frills and Feather Club. I refer to the Army and Navy Club, which is so contemptible that a German, who took the oath of naturalization, and later on took the defence oath, and entered the Automobile Corps so that he might gain a knowledge of the roads and by-ways of the country, was allowed, on certain disclosures being made, to resign from its membership. This man took an English <inline font-style="italic">films</inline> in order that he might run a swindling company here under that name, yet he was allowed to resign from this club. If I were asked by any young military officer for advice, I should tell him at once to join that club, to flatter, and spread butter, so to speak, over- its officers, and he would thus get advancement more rapidly, perhaps, than would otherwise occur. </para>

                            <para>- The matter, has not been brought under his notice. Once the Minister of Defence and the AssistantMinister learn of this, I am satisfied that these by-ways to promotion in our Military Forces will no longer be left open. It has been said that a man has only to give a motor car to the Defence Department to be allowed to join the Defence Forces with the rank of lieutenant. </para>

                            <para>- Proof of what I say can be given whenever the officer&#39;s ask for it. I compliment the Government on the introduction of this Bill, which, taken as a whole, is a splendid one. The men and women who pay our taxation, aud thus enable this Parliament to exist, the Government to control the affairs of Australia, and the Expeditionary Forces to be sent away to help the Old Land, should make this Bill the basis of a claim for like provision in respect of every worker when he becomes no longer able to earn his own livelihood. This Bill should be made the basis of a proposal to increase the old-age pensions to the same extent. A man who loses a limb or who loses his sight while working among the army of toilers, and is thus permanently incapacitated, should be entitled to relief of this kind. And so with the woman who loses her helpmate. She and her children, the future units of this State, should make this Bill the basis of a claim to obtain a pension when they are in need. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member practically said that commissions were purchased in this way. The Assistant Minister of Defence knows perfectly well that those who gave motor cars to the Department left with the Expeditionary Forces as members of the Automobile Corps. Each man drives his own car. Having presented his own car to the military authorities, he takes it with him, and, in order that he may be in a better position to render good service to his country, he is given the rank of lieutenant. It cannot be said that in this way he purchases a commission in the Defence Forces. He presents a motor car to the country in order to better assist in its defence. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the honorable member for Maranoa, if he did so, would require something more substantial than pneumatic tyres. During this debate honorable members have been allowed to ramble at will over the whole question of defence, but it is not my intention to go beyond the scope of the Bill itself. I rose because I felt it necessary to put what I consider to be a fair statement of the facts with regard to the Automobile Corps which has gone to the front. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that, if possible, we ought to increase these pensions to a considerable extent. There is, of course, the fear that the war may continue for a considerable time. I sincerely trust that, if it does, Australia will prove herself worthy of the name she has held in the past, and that she will send, from time to time, more men to the front. Should we do so, our pension list must increase, and increase to a considerable extent. Those who have gone forth to serve their country in the hour of danger are fighting for the Empire, and particularly for Australia. The bringing of the war to a successful termination practically means more to Australia than to any other part of the British Empire. I feel fairly confident that if the Home Government were to say to Germany to-morrow, &#34; We are prepared to cease our hostilities and to give you Australia,&#34; the enemy would be perfectly satisfied. Australia, so far as I can gather, is the objective of the German nation. Germany would be quite content to end the war if it were given the control of Australia. I say, therefore, that those who go to the front are fighting for the British Empire in the first place, and fighting for their own homes here. It is the duty of those of us who are not able to go to the front to see that any one who is injured or permanently invalided as the result of active service is fairly treated. I do not think for one moment that this pension list is going to be anything more than the country will be able to bear. I am perfectly certain that those who are able to bear taxation will cheerfully pay it, in order that the men and those dependent upon them may be properly treated. We have had quite a number of taxation measures before us this session, and the revenue of the Commonwealth is now to be taken chiefly from the pockets of those whom the Prime Minister has described as being best able to bear it. Let me say for those so described that they would sooner see their money used to provide an adequate pension scheme for the men who are injured while on active service than for any other purpose. Speaking for that class of people, I say that we are quite prepared to bear our fair share of taxation, in order that those who . have gone to the front shall be cared for, and, if it is possible, more adequately provided for than will be the case under the Bill as it stands. </para>

                        <para>.- I have a prior amendment that I wish to submit in regard to the definition of &#34; de pendants.&#34; According to the definition clause, &#34;dependants&#34; means such members of the family of a member of the Forces who were wholly or in part dependent upon his earnings at the time of his death. There appears to me to be a weakness in this regard. It is clear that a dependant must be a person who is dependent on the member  of the Force at the time of &#39;his death or incapacity. Thus, if a son went to the war, leaving a father and mother who could not be called dependent on him, and he were killed or incapacitated, and his father died, say, a week later, the mother, though left without support, would not, according to this Bill, be a dependant entitled to any consideration. Most of the members of the Forces are young men, and such cases may easily occur. Had the father died before the son was killed or incapacitated, then the mother would come within the operation of the Bill, and be entitled to a pension, for then she clearly would have been dependent on the son. I think that, under such circumstances, the mother, who may have been left in very straitened circumstances, possesses a vested interest which ought to be preserved. I can cite another case that will bring the matter more closely home to us. If the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> A. Roberts, who was member for Adelaide, had still been alive, and his son had volunteered, as he has done, to go to the front, and had been killed or incapacitated prior to his father&#39;s death, the widow and family would have had no claim for any consideration, though they would have been clearly dependent on the son had he lived. Life is very uncertain, and many parents have suffered great sacrifices to educate and bring up their families; and yet a widow left as I have described would be out in the cold. I suggest that an amendment should be framed to meet those cases, while at the same time protecting the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Grey. There seems to have been an oversight in the Bill, and it is one that will hurt the poor more than it will the well-to-do. If the son of a man who is earning &#163;3 or &#163;4 per week and maintaining his family goes to the war, and the man dies after his son has had the misfortune to be killed or incapacitated, the whole source of the income for the family is cut off, though, if the father had died before the son, there would, have been a just claim to a pension. </para>

Under the Old-age Pensions Act of Victoria, people were not called upon to assist in supporting uncles and aunts who were pensioners; indeed, there was the greatest difficulty in getting people to support their parents. </para>

For instance, the son of a widower, with a family of small children, might go to the war and bo killed or incapacitated before the death of his father, and the children left with no one to take care of them. This is just as hard a case as that suggested by the honorable member for Grey.

                        <para>. - Will regulations provide for the expenses of persons who appear before the Pensions Board? The pensions will probably be dealt with in Melbourne, and, as the claimants may be resident in another part of Australia, there may be hardship entailed upon them if they have to pay their expenses in travelling to Melbourne to have their cases dealt with by the Board. </para>

                        <para>. - It should not be the policy of the Legislature, and I am sure it is not the intention of the Government, to discourage marriage. Many of the widows for whom we are providing will be young women, and it would be against public policy to erect a bar against their remarrying by making it obligatory to relinquish their pensions on doing so. As to men running after them, I think they may be left to take care of themselves. I think with the Leader of the Opposition, that the pension should be retained as a matter of right. </para>

                        <para>.- In reply to the argument that the clause is a serious bar to the re-marriage of widows of fallen soldiers, I would point out that the pension amounts to only &#163;52 a year, and that a child&#39;s right to a pension would not be affected by the re-marriage of his mother. </para>

                            <para>- No. The case is one that we meet in life only too often. Those of us who have had to do with pensions know how some persons hang on to one another, and know, too, the scheming that takes place. Women entitled to a pension of &#163;52 a year for life would easily find men to marry them. The pension would at least give their husbands beer money. The clause as it stands is a protection to the widows. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad that the honorable member for Hume has raised this question. I do not know why these pensions should cease on the re-marriage of widows. A widow who re-marries may lose her second husband. Is it provided that she shall then get back her pension? In my opinion, the widows should retain their  pensions;  the amount is not a large one in any case. I am sorry to think that a great number&#39; will be made widows by the war, and &#163;1 a week is not much to pay those who suffer by the loss of their husbands. As to their being run after, they should be the best judges of the men who pursue them. They would probably choose sensibly the second time, and, perhaps, get better husbands. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the Minister will stand by the clause. Any one who knows anything of the ways of the world knows that there are plenty of men who will run after a widow, or any other woman, if they think she has money. It is unwise to shut our eyes to the facts of life, and by allowing widows to retain their pensions on re-marriage we should be putting them into a most dangerous position. It must be remembered that in some cases the pension will be as much as &#163;156 a year. To my mind, in agreeing to the clause we should be doing the right thing by these widows. A widow who marries again has no claim on the State, and the man who marries her will have no claim, as he would have if her pension right remained. </para>

                        <para>. - It will be remembered that in the Bulli disaster in New South Wales, over twenty years ago. some eighty or ninety miners were killed. It was provided that the widows of the victims, on re-marrying, should receive &#163;100 each, and within twelve months there was hardly a widow left. I do not mention that case as an argument against continuing the war pension to widows. In my opinion, we should put no hindrance in the way of the re-marrying of widows. The policy of Australia is contrary to that. If it be thought that we cannot afford to pay the whole amount of the pension to a widow who re-marries, we might pay a reasonable proportion of it. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the contention that widows who re-marry should retain their pensions. I am inclined to believe that Australia is wealthy enough to provide that if any woman should bc so unfortunate as to require  one  of these pensions, she should be allowed to retain it, even though she marry again. The pension will be only compensating her for the pain she would have suffered through the loss of her husband. I  believe  that the Government should impose a heavy tax upon bachelors at this period, and make them contribute towards this pension. If a division is taken up upon this question, I shall vote in favour of the widow retaining her pension after re-marriage. </para>

                        <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Hume reached the real principle that underlies the granting of these pensions to widows, when they said that the widow receives the pension as a right which she ought to be able to retain during her lifetime. There can be no possible question as to how the money is to be expended. It is presumed that reasonable use will be made of it for the support of herself and her family. A pension is granted ordinarily without any restriction, and it seems to me an interference with the liberty and rights of the widow herself if her pension is to be withdrawn when she re-marries. </para>

                            <para>- In America the pensions go on for ever. Widows who lived in 1812 are still drawing pensions. I should not like to interfere with the great centripetal power of affection, because the world&#39;s existence and aspirations are based on love. A great Persian philosopher has said that love was like a hen&#39;s tooth - you could not see it, but, oh, heavens ! you could feel it. I do not desire the pensions to interfere with love, because by so doing it will destroy the fountain springs of the world ; but at the same time we must not do anything that will perpetuate the pensions. While another Persian philosopher said that &#34;Love is blind,&#34; an American philosopher has answered him by saying &#39; &#39; Yes. love is blind, but marriage removes the cataracts from the eyes.&#34; </para>

There is another aspect of this question, and that is, if there should be issue of the first marriage, the responsibility of maintaining the widow&#39;s children does not rest with the second husband, and therefore the pension of the widow should be transferred, either wholly or in part, to the children. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Wimmera was rather labouring a point which, if pushed to its logical conclusion, is against his own argument, when he said that the pension which the widow receives is given as a right. The children also receive a pension as a right; but at the age of sixteen that right disappears, because they are then presumed to be in a position to support themselves. The Government put the widow on exactly the same terms in that respect. The whole purpose of the pension is to provide support for those who need it, and at the time they need it most. When a widow re-marries, the need for the pension as a means of support ought to disappear. </para>

                            <para>- So long as the widow remains a widow her pension is not  interfered  with, and when she is no longer a widow she is, or ought to be, supported by her husband. Another fact to be remembered is that the Government have on their platform a proposal for the establishment of pensions for all widows, so that whilst this Bill proposes to provide for widows who lose their bread-winners as the result of war, the Government will later on, when the finances permit, secure every widow against want. If a man undertakes the responsibility of making a widow his wife it is his duty to support her. The remark of the honorable member for New England that the forfeiture of the pension would be a hindrance to re-marriage, simply means that a pension of &#163;52 is a temptation for a man to marry a widow. I do not think that the men of this country value a wife at &#163;52 a year, and I do not think that that sum will be a sufficient temptation to a man to accept the responsibility of matrimony. On the whole, the Government are acting most generously, and the provision of this pension to widows and children at this particular juncture ought to be of great help to them. </para>

                            <para>- As partial compensation, and surely the widow, if anybody, is entitled to it. It is partly a recompense to her for the loss of her husband, and why, therefore, should we seek to deprive her of that recompense ? If the widow is young, and re-marries, the probabilities are that there will be two families. In that case we ought not to seek to release ourselves from our obligations. We should not try to do so because she re-marries, taking all her responsibilities with her. This right of pension inheres in the woman, and we are not entitled to relieve ourselves of it by reason of anything she does in her future life. I can conceive of nothing that is more calculated to bring a little added comfort into the home that needs it greatly, if there be two families, as the result of a re-marriage. The very thing that we most need in Australia, and which we are encouraging by other means, is an increase in the families of the Commonwealth. </para>

I do not believe there are many women who would be cajoled into an unsuitable marriage by reason of this paltry allowance of &#163;50 per annum. To suggest that widows are going to fall victims to wastrels because of this &#163;50 per year seems to me to be paying a poor compliment to them. </para>

                            <para>- It is time we slopped this cheap jesting. To me it is a very serious matter. It is a tragedy for the widow, and, if she has a family, who is going to penalize her? That, however, is what the Government practically intend to do if she takes it upon herself to re-marry. I can conceive of nothing more fatal to our own. policy in regard to the encouragement of marriage and the rearing of families than what is proposed in this clause. The pension should remain with the widow, and we should give to her the right to re-marry or not, as she thinks fit. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government, when framing the Bill, gave this clause very serious consideration. The Bill has been introduced to provide a pension for the widow of any soldier who loses his life while on active service, and to provide pensions in the case of partial or total incapacity. Our object is to provide a pension, ranging from &#163;52 to &#163;156 per annum, for those who lose their husbands while on active service. If there are any children left by the deceased they also will receive a pension. But if the widow re-marries, then the man to whom she is joined in the bonds of wedlock takes the place of the former husband. He takes over all the responsibilities that should be undertaken by a man entering the marriage state. He promises, indeed, to make provision for his wife. He becomes the breadwinner, and takes the place of the first husband. We provide a pension to recompense the widow in some small way for her loss, but if she re-marries her loss is made good by the second husband. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill provides for them until they reach the age of sixteen years, because we recognise that in the case of the re-marriage of the widow the step-father might not give to the children the attention that they would have received from their own father. Every man in Australia who takes unto himself a wife should be responsible for her proper maintenance. The point has been raised as to what, would be the position if the second husband died and the woman was well advanced in years. In that case she would be able - if she were sixty years of age - to claim an old-age pension. What is more, the Government hope, while in office, to bring down a scheme providing pensions for widows and orphans. We cannot, say definitely at this stage that we shall do so; but if the war comes to an early termination, and Australia enjoys a return of prosperity, it is our intention to bring down such a scheme. I hope that honorable members will deal with this provision on its merits. I emphasize the point that if the widow re-marries the responsibility of providing for her properly falls on the second husband. I hope that honorable members will stand by the clause as printed. The Government are just as anxious as is any honorable member to provide an adequate scheme of relief, but there must be a limit to all legislation of this character. We desire to do the fair thing, and I think that we are doing so. </para>

                        <para>. - The position taken up by the Assistant Minister of Defence is hardly a fair one. If we provided that, in the case of the death of a soldier, his widow should receive a lump sum of &#163;200, would the Government ask for the return of. that amount in the event of the widow&#39;s early re-marriage ? On an actuarial basis it could be shown that, having regard to the presumed life of the recipient, the value of a pension of &#163;52 a year was considerably more than &#163;200. The point that we have to consider is whether or not a woman is a citizen of Australia. If she is, then she should enjoy the full rights of citizenship. Why should a pension granted to a woman on account of her suffering and loss be stopped in the event of her re-marriage? </para>

                            <para>- That is hardly accurate. If the husband were totally incapacitated she would receive half the amount of the pension. I am confident that every association of women will say that under this Bill woman has been put back into the position from which she was originally rescued by this Parliament. Women were not allowed to vote, but were classed with criminals and lunatics; and the present is an instance of going backwards. If the question goes to a division, I shall vote against the clause; and I am sure we shall have protests from the women&#39;s political organizations on both sides against a proposal that is derogatory to women as affecting their rights of citizenship. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot help feeling that it is. a reflection on the Department that we can get no information as to what is done with regard to defence pensions in other parts of the world. For four or five years the Department is supposed to have been elaborating a scheme of pensions, and yet, to-day, we cannot get a tittle of information concerning what is done elsewhere. With all the military men going between here and the Old Country, we cannot ascertain what is the practice in the Imperial Army. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Parramatta is very indignant because, he says, we are in the dark for lack of information. I do not know whether the honorable member really means what he says, or whether he merely desires to occupy time. But he urges that the information could be got in a few hours by cable, although he was fifteen months in office and never obtained any. </para>

                            <para>- That is one reason why we should not follow the English example. Some fifteen months ago the honorable member for Parramatta objected to the pensions and allowances proposed by the Labour Government, and advocated a superannuation scheme, in which everybody should be comprehended. For months, during which the honorable member was a Minister, the Government were seeking information from the world on the subject, and got nothing; and now it is suggested that there shall be a cable sent to England, and the necessary information obtained in a few hours. I do not question the sincerity, or the insincerity, of the honorable member for Parramatta ; but what is his object? How much longer is this discussion to go on ? Perhaps this and other Bills ought to have been before us earlier in the session, but they are here now; and it would make matters much easier, and insure some progress, if the &#39; &#39; gag &#39; &#39; were applied to the Opposition. I am sure the honorable member for Flinders would be pleased to see the &#34; gag &#34; in operation, and I am anxiously waiting for it. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause provides that any soldier of the Imperial Reserve Forces called up for active service is to be treated, as long as he is a <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226; fide</inline> resident of Australia, in exactly the same way as members of the Australian Forces who are residents of Australia. The principle is quite right; but there were numbers of Australians travelling abroad at the outbreak of the war, who, instead of returning to Australia to join the Forces here, joined the British Forces. When the war is over, if these men are spared, they will return to Australia, which is their home. </para>

                        <para>. - There is another phase to be considered. We have hundreds of men loaned to the Australian Defence Department by the British Government, and, although they still belong to the British Army or Navy, they will stay here almost to their retiring age. Are we to place them in the same category as <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226;</inline><inline font-style="italic">fide</inline> Australian residents? I consider that they should be recognised as <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226; fide</inline> Australians, and come under the privileges bestowed on British Reservists by this clause. Many of them are now taking part in the war on Australian vessels, and have left their wives and families in Australia. The point raised by the honorable member for Henty is quite correct. We have heard of Australian and New Zealand Forces which have been formed in Great Britain. There will be plenty of time to deal with these matters later on; but certainly both points raised should be considered. </para>

                        <para>. - The suggestion thrown out by the honorable member for Henty is a reasonable one. No doubt there are many Australians who joined the Imperial Forces when war was declared, and are, perhaps, now on active service, whose action was just as praiseworthy and noble as that of those who have left in our Expeditionary Forces. At the proper time these individuals can be brought under the operation of this measure by a small amending Bill. No doubt after the measure has been in force for some time, we shall find that amendments will be needed to make it a complete and just one. </para>

                            <para>- In all probability the wife may be unable to do anything more than nurse the incapacitated pensioner. I think that the amount should be increased. While I am speaking in regard to the schedule, I may say that search in the Library has disclosed the fact that, under the Imperial pensions scheme, a widow, on re-marrying, receives a gratuity of twelve months&#39; pay. In addition, the pension is kept alive, to be drawn should she again become a widow. </para>

We have been fair without being over generous, and if experience shows that we have fallen short in any respect, there will be ample opportunity to remedy matters.

The Commonwealth could afford to pay to a soldier who is totally incapacitated a little more than &#163;1 a week to insure that he will be properly looked after, and can live in tolerable comfort. I move the amendment, not from any motives of sentiment, but from a sense of strict justice. </para>

                        <para>.- Is it for reasons of economy that the Government have provided that if the rate of pay of a member of the Forces is more than 50s. a day, the pension payable to his widow on his death, or to him on total incapacity, shall not exceed the pension payable in respect of a member whose rate of pay is 50s. a day? To be fair, the Government should fix the pension rates in accordance with the salary rates, right up the scale. As you go higher, the number of persons affected becomes fewer, there being very few officers, indeed, who receive more than 50s. a day. But those who fill these high posts are men possessing exceptional abilities, and in the ordinary walks of life would have a much greater earning capacity than the juniors whom they control. We must pay for ability. A general or admiral must be paid in accordance with his rank and services, and his pension should be proportionate to his salary. This is not opposed to the principles of Democracy. Even the present Government recognise that the ability necessary for the conduct of important business concerns must be paid for at high rates. Not only are the men who receive more than 50s. a day few in number, but, in the nature of the service, they run less risk of being killed or incapacitated; so that what I suggest would not unduly increase the liability of the State. The Government should give more consideration to the dependants of the higher officers. </para>

                        <para>.- In my opinion, the Government are being fairly liberal in the matter of pensions. The loss of the widow of a man in the rank and file is greater than the loss of the widow of a highly-placed officer, because her husband had fewer opportunities for making provision for her after his death. Some of the officers are receiving &#163;1,500 a year, and an allowance of 15s. a day, which they have no opportunity to spend. But the rankers are in a very different position. If the honorable member for Henty is so desirous of justice, why did he not propose that all widows should be treated alike? That would be democratic. There should be no distinctions whatever. But whereas the widow of a ranker is to get only &#163;52 a year, the widow of an officer may get &#163;156 a year. The Government are meeting the situation as well as the revenue will permit, and during the past few weeks no one has complained more loudly than the Leader of the Opposition of the new taxation proposals that have been made necessary by the war. The right honorable member has shown such inconsistency in this matter that hardly any  consideration  should be given to his proposal; because, in politics, a man should make consistency his first virtue. However, I do not wish to be too hard on the right honorable member. If I had my way, every widow should receive an equal pension, because I believe that the wife of the worker loves her husband as much as does the wife of a man in any other walk of life. However, seeing that my colleagues in the party do not agree with me on this point, I am prepared to waive my objection to the schedule. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not think the scale of pensions is quite consistent. The scale provides for the payment of &#163;1 a week to the widow of a private, and an allowance of 5s. per week for each child. Thus, a widow with four children would have an income of &#163;2 a week. If, on the other hand, a private is totally incapacitated, the allowance will be considerably less. </para>

                            <para>- Those patriotic funds in England were also raised with the object of relieving British soldiers who were incapacitated in the war. Had the people known that every injured soldier and the widows and children of men who were killed in the fighting would be provided for by the Commonwealth, there would have been no response to the patriotic funds. I fear that, now the response has been made so generously to the appeal for funds, there will be no claims by the men, who will be so well treated under this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- There may be claims, but my experience of public funds raised in the past is that the benefits have invariably filtered through to persons for whom they were never intended by those who made the contributions. I am. sure we shall have a similar experience in connexion with the patriotic funds. It will be said that the soldiers, as well as the widows and children, are provided for by the Government, and therefore there is no legitimate outlet for the funds in accordance with the intentions of the donors. Some steps ought to be taken to ask those who are in charge of the various patriotic funds to pay that money into the Commonwealth Treasury, to form the nucleus of a fund from which we could begin to pay the pensions which have been provided by this Bill: I am afraid that when the war is over and the patriotic funds are being distributed, we shall have the knowledge that those funds are being paid out to a class who do not require such assistance very much, and the excuse will be that the soldiers have been provided for by the Federal Parliament. I do not know whether the Government have approached the custodians of the patriotic funds, but if not, they have not used that precaution which is desirable to safeguard the donors of the money against imposition and misappropriation. I say again that, in my expectation, those who contributed to the funds will have grave cause of complaint in regard to the manner of their allocation. </para>

                    <para class="block">The object of this Bill is to provide machinery so that Treasury-bills may be issued to enable the revenue during this extraordinary year to be enhanced out of loan moneys which are available, and which can be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Bill is in the usual form of provision for Treasury-bills, and is, I think, correct in every particular. It merely provides the machinery on which the bills, which will follow at a later stage, will rest. </para>

                            <para>- As no authority is granted under the Bill to raise money apart from Parliament, it therefore does not provide any loan funds. I cannot find much to object to in it, except that I observe that the Treasurer is proposing under it to pay his interest more promptly than the States do. I think the States pay interest half-yearly, whereas the Treasurer proposes here that interest shall be payable quarterly. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think there is any possible doubt about this matter, and I feel sure that the Attorney-General will&#39; not suggest that this provision is not entirely outside our power. We are not given any authority to determine the general conditions under which trustees may make investments. It is entirely a matter of State control. There is no section in the Constitution which vests us with this power. In answer to the suggestion that we should adopt this clause because it can do no harm, I would point out that it may do a great deal of harm. By passing it, we shall be holding out the guarantee of this Parliament that trustees, if they invest in this particular way, with or without the authority of the State Parliaments, will be doing a perfectly legal act, no matter what the terms of their trusts may be. We ought not to place ourselves in that position. We have no power to do this. Why are we now, for the first time, enacting something that is just as much outside our power as if it related to the State railways? The only effect it can have is to mislead trustees in the performance of their trusts. It is true that, in many cases under the provisions of a State law or a trust deed, trustees are entitled to invest in any public security, including, of course, Government stocks. But if they have not that power, we are only holding out false colours, and pretending to authorize them to do something that they have no authority to do. I urge the Prime Minister to omit this clause. I can assure him that the matter is much more serious than he appears to think. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Bill is to authorize an act which, I fear, is practically already completed. It will provide the legal authority for a loan raised by the Commonwealth, through the Imperial Government, for war purposes. I have mentioned once or twice before in the House and in Committee that, shortly after our coming into office, the condition of the finances of Australia was such that the States were asking for loan money and could not get it. The Commonwealth was likely to need a little on its own account for war purposes, but we thought and believed that we should get through, at least, this financial year without raising a loan. I, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, gave to the States on behalf of the Government a promise that we should stand behind them as guarantors for a loan that might be raised in London on their behalf and for their purposes. However, the conditions of the money market were not favorable to a loan being raised in that way, owing to a difficulty in obtaining the amount required, and because of the rate of interest demanded. It was then decided by the Commonwealth, with the consent and approval of His Majesty&#39;s British Government, that we should apply for a loan for war purposes only, and after some negotiation the Home Government cheerfully agreed to put into a future war loan being raised for Imperial purposes, an amount of &#163;18,000,000 for our war purposes. This money has been raised, and two days ago, I think, we got final information that the price of the loan was 3&#189; per cent. at &#163;95, and that the period of the loan was fourteen years, making the actual interest over that term &#163;3 19s. 7d. </para>

                            <para>- And I think it is right it should go there. However, I need not discuss that matter further beyond saying that the loan has been raised. Yesterday the first monthly instalment of the Imperial loan, amounting to about &#163;1,500,000, was paid to the credit of the Commonwealth into the Commonwealth Bank in London; and by raising this war loan the Commonwealth has been enabled to lend to the States the equivalent of the amount- </para>

                        <para>. - I think the right honorable gentleman may be heartily congratulated on the success of this operation. Outstanding in my mind is the immensity of the obligation we are under to the Imperial Government for all the assistance rendered now, and at every other time. When one reflects that we have developed this country, and made it what it is, largely on money obtained from our friends oversea - men of our own race, and our kith and kin - at a rate at which we could not obtain it anywhere else in the world, one begins to understand what the Imperial connexion really means to us in a material sense, to say nothing of any other. When we consider, further, that throughout the whole century rind a quarter of our development, the total cost of protecting us and all our interests has been cheerfully borne by the Mother Country in addition, we begin to realize how privileged we are as citizens of this great Empire of ours, and what it really means to be able to call ourselves Britishers. I am not quite clear that, with all my parliamentary experience, I know very much about Loan Bills. This is our first experience of Commonwealth borrowing, and, therefore, it is, to a large extent, unexplored ground. To the Prime Minister belongs the honour and credit of initiating a borrowing policy on so generous a scale. </para>

                            <para>- On page 65 of the Estimates there is a statement showing the estimated expenditure consequent upon the war, consisting of &#163;11,575,800 for the forces, &#163;140,000 for interest on the Imperial loan, &#163;1,250 for premiums on life assurance policies of members of the Public Service who are members of the Expeditionary Forces, and &#163;25,000 for wireless stations in Pacific Islands. According to this table, and the way it is set out, it will be seen that out of this loan appropriation of &#163;11,742,050, which is the estimate of war expenditure for the year, the Treasurer is paying &#163;140,000 in interest, and an item of &#163;1,250 as the premiums on the lives of members of the Expeditionary Forces. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer now admits that he is going to pay this interest out of his loan. Yet a little while ago he was very  unctious  in saying that he would not do that kind of thing. I do not think that a fraction of the interest should be paid out of loan money, and surely the money we have undertaken to pay towards the premiums of our civil servants in the Expeditionary Forces should not come out of loan money. These matters are fair charges on Consolidated Revenue. </para>

Thus for war purposes we are going to spend only &#163;11,601,000 in the year. Interest on war loan should come out of Consolidated Revenue. Paying it out of the loan is the kind of financing we used to see in the bad old days in some of the States, which was always regarded as financing of the most unsound and &#34;wild cat&#34; character. </para>

                        <para>.- The Treasurer made it quite clear in his Budget speech that this sum of &#163;11,742,050 is made up of &#163;10,500,000 from the Imperial loan, and &#163;1,242,050 to be raised by Treasury-bills. The interest, amounting to &#163;140,000 will come out of the loan money ; I presume it will be paid out of Treasury-bills. The Treasurer, by interjection, has informed us that we shall get a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> from the States, and that is true to a certain extent - to the extent that this loan to the States is financed out of loan funds. I remind the Treasurer that any interest from the States will not go to Commonwealth revenue, but to the fund that is gradually being built up to strengthen the note issue. We shall not get &#163;140,000. We shall get a portion of it into Consolidated Revenue, but not the whole of it. At all events, it is quite clear, from the figures that are presented, that this year we shall actually pay the interest out of the money that we are raising. I hope that before the Budget is brought down next year the Treasurer will look into the matter and see that in future the interest on the loan is not charged to the loan, but is paid out of Consolidated Revenue. </para>

                        <para>. - We know that this money is to be advanced to us for war purposes only. We learn from a cable report that the loan is not only to be limited to war purposes, but is also not to be used for developmental purposes. That is the clear understanding, and I think that a certain amount of misapprehension in the minds of a good many people should be removed. The two transactions, that of borrowing money from the Imperial Government and that of transmitting it to the States, were originally connected in the minds of everybody. Now, however, that proposal has been altered, and we are, as a matter of fact, lending money to the States, the same amount of money in the same period. </para>

In order to avoid any possible chance of putting ourselves wrong with the Imperial Government on a matter of such vital importance, the Treasurer should assure the House that the Imperial authorities are fully aware of the precise steps we are taking in this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- The Treasurer has remarked upon the extraordinary generosity of the Imperial authorities in arranging the loan, and when we study the figures that generosity becomes even more conspicuous. The price at which we are getting the money has been rendered possible because of the extraordinary facility with which the Imperial Government have raised it. If the original transaction of each State borrowing the money in Loudon had been carried out, though the cost would have been nominal, it would have been much greater. -Invariably the charges to the States are: - 1&#163; per cent, for underwriting, 10s. per &#163;100 for brokerage, and a charge for advertising, and 12s. 6d. composition duty to the British authorities in the case of inscribed stock, sometimes more for debentures. Apparently the British Government have forgiven us that 12s. 6d. That is why the discount to which the Treasurer referred amounts to only 3s. 8-Jd. The expenses of the loan amount to 5s. 10#d. as against 50s., which is due to the- fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, aided by the financial interests of England, has been able to secure contributions to the loan at so cheap a rate. The more the Prime Minister studies the figures, the more will he feel glad that he has been aided by the Imperial authorities to carry out these transactions with such wonderful success. </para>

                            <para>- Then repetition here would be useless. As to whether interest is now being paid out of the loan itself, I think that the Prime Minister will find that that is happening. A net &#163;18,000,000 will come into the Consolidated Revenue, but the amount of the debt we incur will run into over &#163;19,000,000. The Consolidated Revenue, strengthened by this loan, and by the issue of Treasury bonds amounting to &#163;1,500,000, will be the source of all our appropriations. In one sense every charge this year will come out of loan. But I do not. think it is technically correct to speak of the payment of the interest being out of the loan, although all the expenses of the year will be helped by loan money. This is a matter into which the Finance Committee could well inquire. If they deemed the procedure not to be correct, I think that the House would be prepared to accept their representation. In view of former loan transactions with which we are acquainted, this is most gratifying. </para>

                        <para>. - I thank honorable members for the manner in which they have dealt with this matter. The position was very serious, and we had an anxious time for a number of days. I am grateful for the remarks that have been made concerning the action of the Imperial authorities. In reply to the honorable member for Flinders, I should like to say that the Imperial authorities know our position as well as we know it ourselves. I took the means available to me to make them fully acquainted with the whole of our circumstances. They made certain imperative conditions that we could not get away from, and one of them was that they would not raise money for any but war purposes. </para>
