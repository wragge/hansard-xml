It is highly undesirable that I should express any opinion as to the validity of State laws. We should very much resent the action of the State authorities in expressing opinions as to the validity of our laws. The validity of any law can be tested by those affected by it. </para>

                        <para>- In the letter of the Commonwealth Government which cancelled the contract with the Western Australian Government, an offer was made to enter into a new arrangement to meet the position of Western Australia. Following upon that offer, there were two conferences between the Premier of the State and Commonwealth Ministers, the second being held in Sydney. The Premier of Western Australia agreed to supply to the Commonwealth 500,000 powellised karri sleepers, and 500,000 jarrah sleepers, certain deliveries being fixed, the prices, with the exception of jarrah delivered at the western end, being also fixed. An arrangement was made under which the prices were to be reduced for sleepers proportionately with any reduction in size that might be decided upon by the Commonwealth Government. And there was a number of other matters agreed to, which I do not think my honorable friends will ask me to refer to without notice. In due course those provisions, which were agreed to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan,</inline> were inserted in a contract which was sent over to Western Australia for formal completion. The contract has come back, and it is now clear that the State Government will neither supply jarrah sleepers themselves, nor will they allow safeguards in this contract document against interference with other jarrah suppliers to the Commonwealth. Further, the State Government have decided that they will not give any <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">rata</inline> reduction in the case of any reduction in the size of sleepers, which means in practice, judging from the New South Wales experience, that, if they charged for, say, an 8-ft. sleeper upon a 9-ft. basis, they would charge at least 40 per cent, more than it was worth. Owing to the action of the Western Australian Government, which is very much regretted by the Commonwealth Government, the question of the sleeper supply has become an urgent one, and is . now under the urgent consideration of this Government. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, there is a distinct promise. That is the interpretation which I put on the despatches received by us from the Imperial Government, and which were in answer to specific requests by us, that we should be consulted before any agreement was arrived at. A number of questions have been asked on that point in the House of Commons. I have read them all, and I notice that in some of the answers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harcourt,</inline> and in one case <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ackland,</inline> expressed the view that the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments would be consulted. I feel confident that the Imperial Government will recognise their obligations to us in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- The matter waa brought before the House less than twelve months ago, I think, and representations were immediately made to the present Government in Western Australia. We asked them to specify for us the amount of money they were receiving from those charges, and the cost to them of the actual inspection, information which is obviously contemplated by section 112. We repeated that request on several occasions, but obtained no definite reply. Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bath</inline> has agreed to an arrangement, which I have already indicated to the House, and before any opinion can be taken on that section, obviously the Government must get the actual facts of the case. An arrangement has now been made to have the information supplied by the Western Australian Government to the Commonwealth officers. </para>

That agreement was thai} if the State Government desired to erect a hospital on the quarantine area they should have the right to do so. That was arranged between the departmental officers of the two Governments, and as the area is large, the arrangement was a reasonable one. Also, the State Government have undertaken to introduce a Bill to amend their existing Act so as to give them adequate power to deal with the present outbreak and any future outbreaks. We have also told them that if there are any powers under the Commonwealth law which they desire to exercise we shall be prepared to assist them to suppress the disease. </para>

                            - In view of the fact that the Minister of Trade and Customs recently informed me that he was in communication with the Government of New South Wales in regard to the removal of the quarantine station at North Head, does he think it wise to allow them to build a small-pox hospital on that site? And will the Minister consult the residents of the populous districts adjoining as to .the advisability of allowing such a thing to be done?

                        <para>- The Advisory Board reported on the designs in July, 1913. On their advice, the specifications were drawn by Messrs. Butler and Bradshaw, architects, of Melbourne. I am not conversant with all the facts, as the proceedings had been initiated before I took office, but I am making further inquiries on the subject, and will give the honorable member a more particular answer next Wednesday. </para>

                            <para>- Will the right honorable member permit me to speak? What does he mean by these mock heroics? I heard that, the other night, there was placed before the door of the room of the  Chairman  of Committees, in which , the Treasurer was sleeping, a coal-scuttle for him to fall over when he came out. It is time this sort of thing was stopped in the National Parliament. </para>

I have selected four honorable members of calm judgment - two from each side of the House - to sift the whole thing to the bottom, and to tell us all there is to be known about it. There the matter ought to rest, and until the Committee has reported the less discussion there is the better. </para>

If it were, I could give evidence about certain things that happened during my term of office, but they are things which I like to forget. Speaking as one who has been in other Parliaments, I think that, taking it all in all, this is an exceedingly well-behaved one. </para>

                            <para>- Of recent years a number of new members - men unacquainted with parliamentary procedure - have entered the House; that possibly may have something to do with  the  matter. I have confidence in the proposed Committee, and believe it will do its work well. The dignity of Parliament, I am sure, will not suffer at its hands. I shall ask my colleagues to co-operate in every way with the Committee in its efforts to sift this trouble to the bottom, so that the right thing may be done. I concur with the Prime Minister as to the elimination of the words; but, in conclusion, I desire to say that, when he is invited to make a statement of the kind, he should not consider that he is injured, and indulge in heroics. I do not feel any reflection cast upon myself by the language used. </para>

                    <para>.- When this motion was last before us, I inquired whether it referred to a general </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Bill to amend the electoral machinery, or whether it simply dealt with the postal rote; in other words, whether it was a copy of the Bill that was sent to another place last session. The Prime Minister was good enough to reply that the latter was the case; and that being so, my objection to the Bill is that it is useless for any practical purposes of electoral reform. If any evidence were required as to the utility and advantage of the system adopted at the last contest, it is supplied in the fact that a larger percentage of votes were cast than at any previous election. We have the further fact that, when the postal vote waa last in use, the majority of the electors who availed themselves of it consisted of men - not women. While I doubt very much whether it is of any great advantage for sick people to vote at all - if they are really sick - I point out that, at the last general election, such people were offered greater facilities at hospitals, and other places, than ever before, and that a fuller return was obtained than even under the old postal-vote system. There is, however, a fundamental objection to postal voting. It means that the votes must be cast some days, and, in many instances, some weeks, before the actual polling day. It is well known that elections very frequently turn on what takes place a few days, or even a day, before the voting; and a large number of postal votes, recorded a week or a fortnight prior, may depend on Government action, or inaction, which are not action or inaction that ultimately determine the verdict. Under the circumstances, while we may get a legal, we do not get a logical, or actual verdict of the people. We all recognise that an election cannot be permitted to sprawl all over the year; such a suggestion is at once recognised as an absurdity. The principle of a general election is the determination of the whole of the electorates on one particular day. Further, postal voting is an actual violation of the secrecy of the ballot, safeguard it as we may. I do not think that any one was more anxious than I was to have postal voting, or who advocated the principle, or stood by it so long as I did myself. But I found that in my own town of Gympie, as is well known to the honorable member for Lilley, the postal votes of two maids in one of the principal hotels were collected by a justice of the peace, that the maids did not vote as that justice of the peace desired, and that the postal votes were never delivered, but were subsequently discovered in a lower part of the sewer. The honorable member for Kennedy, who knows Charters Towers well, will corroborate me when I say that the mine, managers, and other influential members of the community there, made a house-to-house canvass while the husbands were- &#39; at work, and collected postal votes in <inline font-style="italic">theinterests</inline> of a particular candidate. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in a way; but not in the way now proposed. In any case, it is now a different State Government, and they do not justify the postal vote on grounds which have been suggested, but simply because they think, as they straightforwardly admit, it will be of political advantage to themselves. I am a justice of the peace myself. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but we who are justices have to do our best to maintain the dignity of the office. Every possible facility should be afforded the citizens to, first of all, be enrolled, and then to have their names kept on the roll, even in duplication, if that be necessary, to enable them to poll once. No citizen should be permitted to poll more than once under any circumstances; every person who can possibly record his or her vote should have ample facilities to do so; in hospitals and other places means should, as far as practicable, be provided for the patients to exercise the franchise. Voting by post has been abused in the past, and will be abused under any party government system. I am against the Bill that it is now sought to introduce. It has, of course, another purpose in view, but, as to that, I am indifferent. The Government have had their opportunity, if they are prepared to do so, to carry out the so-called principle they announced; but this Bill, for test purposes, is valueless, and ought to be thrown out. </para>

                    <para>.- Having regard to the state of business here and elsewhere, I do not know whether it is necessary at the present juncture to indulge in any lengthy remarks upon a Bill of this character. The Prime Minister has shown the weakness of his case in introducing it without offering any apology for his action. He introduced it as though it were something to be ashamed of, or something he could not support as he is in the habit of supporting any measure he brings forward. The tender way in which he handled the responsibilities that are upon him shows very clearly the attitude of the Government in their wild endeavour to secure what they call a double dissolution. A discussion of the matter of postal voting would be merely reiteration of what has been said time and again in this chamber. The history of the postal vote in the Commonwealth and in the States has been given on many occasions and recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It has undoubtedly been tried and found wanting as a piece of electoral machinery. If only the evidence as to the experience of the various States that have tried the system of postal voting, and the Commonwealth experience of the system, could be collected and put into one document, the people would stand astounded that at this time of the day the Government should seek to reintroduce it. Adult suffrage is the base upon which the Democracy of this country rests - the right of every man or woman to vote, and to exercise that vote by marking the ballot-paper in a manner which will give the proper expression to the opinions which are influencing him, or her, for the time being; and Australian Democracy has evolved a system whereby to every man or woman in this country is secured the privilege of being able to exercise that vote secretly. No matter what outside influence may be brought to bear upon the voter by any employer, or by party organizers, when the voter enters the polling booth and marks the ballot-paper he can do it secretly and vote according to the way his conscience dictates as being best in the interests of the country.  We, as a party, tried the postal vote; we were anxious to let every man or woman entitled to vote do so, and therefore we made the experiment, but from that experiment we learned what a dangerous weapon the postal vote was; we learned its disabilities and the way in which it undermined the whole principle of the secrecy of the ballot, and gave designing and unscrupulous persons the opportunity of exercising their skill in manipulating the votes of the people. Having tried the experiment, we had the courage, as a party, to admit that what we had attempted to do in the interests of those who were unable to get to a polling booth through sickness or distance had broken down, and that the remedy was worse than the disease. We are asked by the Prime Minister to re-enact a whole section of electoral law. Every honorable member could discuss every detail of the section, but we do not - I at any rate do not - propose to do so. I would have liked to fight this matter through to the bitter end in order to see whether this Government could possibly get to the Governor-General with a flimsy measure of this character; but recognising that the conditions are such that other things are against that being accomplished - which I regret very much - and that the party on this side of the chamber to some degree is anxious to let the Governor-General decide the fate of this Parliament, and having also learned that members in another place are equally indifferent with regard to what the Governor-General may do, there is no justification for my standing up here - as I would willingly do to the death - in order to fight an imposition of this kind, especially seeing that other honorable members feel that they prefer to go to the shambles, if such be the fate that awaits them. </para>

                        <para>- All I can say is that the fighting capabilities that should characterize the Labour party are fast becoming a thing of the past. There is nothing I deplore more than the fact that the Government should be able to masquerade as reformers, and carry into the presence of the Governor-General measures which have been admitted by the Prime Minister to. be trumpery, and to be simply trifling with the time of the country and the interests of Democracy, with a view <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> securing - what? Not a reform. This is no reform. It is a backward step; a step to undermine Democracy and take away the rights and privileges of our fellow beings, who have fought for those rights in days gone by. When I think of those days, when we were fighting for manhood suffrage and for securing a hold on the political machine so that the voice of the mass of the people could be heard in Parliament; when I recall those days, thirty years ago, when we were fighting an unpopular battle for the masses; when the propertied classes, with- plural voting, could multiply votes in every electorate; when I look back on the sacrifices that were made by men who were practically exiled for their efforts to uplift the masses of the people and give them the power that their education enabled them to use to the best advantage -when I think of all these things, I realize the attitude honorable members should adopt in regard to this Bill. If the Government should be successful in their endeavours, the Labour party take a considerable risk - no one can deny it - the risk of allowing&#39; the first step to be taken towards pulling down the citadel which our forefathers have built up for the good of humanity. I do not regard the matter from the point of view of a politician, or one who is anxious to return to the Treasury bench, or who seeks for some advantage that may be gained by manoeuvres, political or otherwise. I realize that there is a greater thing ahead, and that it is a nobler aim to maintain and retain that which was handed down to us by our forefathers to guard, care for, protect, and maintain as a precious heritage given to us, not for our own sakes, but for the sake of our children. Yet the party born among the workers, and sprung from the people who have fought to gain political freedom, now propose to allow the Prime Minister to secure the passage of this subtle thing that has had its birth in the brains of the Attorney-General, and which can - I will not say it will - secure a double dissolution. I say that there is an element of risk in this. No party knowing their business .would even allow a risk to be taken when the rights of the multitude they represent are in danger. Let us assume for a moment that the Governor-General will grant a double dissolution. What will be the result? The party behind politicians on the other side will certainly act in the manner they have always adopted, manipulating the rolls and following the tactics they are pursuing day by day with the aid of the money of those who are always oppressing the masses in any country. </para>

                        <para>- I like the man who says, &#34;Calvary,  O  Calvary 1 I believe in Calvary.&#34; That is not going to save us. The only thing that would save the Labour movement would be to fight to the death, and no other course is worthy of the man who carries the Labour flag. But I was looking at the possibilities of passing this measure. Assume that the Bill is carried, and that the Governor-General may grant a double dissolution. In that case, the advantage will lie with the party in power. They are capable of many things, as we have proved all along the line, and as I have known them to be in the days before Labour came into existence. It is the same old Satan on the Government bench that sat there in the fifties. They know well how to manipulate the electoral machinery and throw dust in the eyes of the people, and practically belie the situation and misrepresent it at every breakfast table in the country, as they did last time by misrepresenting the whole situation and slandering the Labour party, and blaming them for being responsible for the high cost of living, in this way appealing to the pockets of the multitude and gaining a shady majority over the party that would not stoop to such tactics. We have  to face the position and see what will happen by what has been done in South Australia and other places. In South Australia, the Liberals, having seen that the Labour movement is solidly entrenched, that the aspirations and hopes of Labour men have, to some degree, been realized, and that the Liberal power ie dying, what did they do? Having gained power by methods which I have just related, they proceeded to undermine the whole electoral system and gerrymander the electorates, reducing the value of votes in the Labour centres, and giving 1,000 people in one electorate as much power as 2,000 in another, and so making it almost impossible for some years to come for Labour to have a hope of succeeding in winning the seats so gerrymandered. That is what lies behind the subtle method that has been so cunningly initiated by the Attorney-General, and I say unhesitatingly that the risk is too great, and that the disabilities that will be placed upon us are something we should not accept. No party is justified in taking a risk in regard to matters intrusted to it as a sacred trust. In the face of the corruption, improper manipulation, and other malpractices that have been experienced in connexion with the postal vote, the party that urges its restoration is not the friend, but the bitterest enemy, of the people. Ministers say that they want to get the Bill through quickly. I remember the way in which the postal vote was manipulated when it was provided for in a Federal Act. Justices of the Peace were paid by the day to go from door to door persuading persons who had no right to do so to vote by post, misleading them as to the casting of their votes. They were paid, not to obtain postal votes in a legitimate way, or rather not to merely witness the signature of sick persons entitled to and desirous of voting by post, but to deceive the electors, and to ascertain how votes were being cast. It is on record that thousands of votes collected in this way by party organizations never saw the ballot-box. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman has no policy for the betterment of the people, but merely a secret, cunning, deep-laid plot to rob the people of the rights and privileges handed down to them by their forefathers. That is the desire of those who are to-day trying to work political points, and are neglecting to bring forward measures of legislation which are urgent, and would enable matters of primary importance affecting the homes of the people to be dealt with. But I have never been one to take part in a sham fight, and I shall not do so now. In real warfare, I am prepared to fight to the death for my home and my country. But one cannot fight when there is something holding him back, paralyzing his arm when about to strike an effective blow. Whatever may be the fate of this test Bill, and whatever may be the decision of the Governor-General, it shall not be said of me, a Labour man, who hae come through many fights, having had to contest six battles to gain entrance into the parliamentary arena, that I did anything to injure the movement of which I am so proud, and which I value as I would a father or a mother. In days gone by, thirty-four years ago, before Labour took any part in politics, we used to meet in the Trades and Labour Council, moulding what was destined to be the Labour policy of the future. The Labour movement has built itself up by gallant fights, and the sacrifice of time, money, and opportunity by those who supported it. They have been victimized, boycotted, and persecuted to gain the liberties at stake to-day. I am one of those who was present at the birth of the movement. I was there at its delivery, watched its growth from boyhood to manhood. I saw it reach its majority, and, at last, assume control of the government of this country, putting up a record during three years&#39; administration of the public affairs that will never be equalled by that of any other political party. To-day I feel that there is a danger that what we have done may be undone, and that the work of many years may be lost; but it shall not be laid at my door that I did anything &#34;to risk the interests of the movement. </para>

                    <para>. - 55&#93;. - I am glad that the motion has been moved, and I hope that the Bill will have a speedy despatch. It is the second of the two test Bills by the rejection of which the Government hope to induce the Governor-General to grant a double dissolution. By our action in the Senate last night, we took the Liberals completely by surprise, and if we deal speedily with this Bill, it will remain to be seen whether Ministers really want a dissolution. I shall not speak more than a few minutes now, and at the second-reading stage I propose to offer a few remarks with the object of assisting the speedy passing of the measure. When both Bills have been dealt with, we may, perhaps, adjourn for a week, or whatever time the Governor-General may require to consider the position. Then let us have a fight, if there is to be one. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that he will. Under all the circumstances, the best thing would be to grant a single dissolution. Ministers will not do business, and we cannot do anything. They know that there is an overwhelming majority in favour of dealing with the Tariff; but, although frequently invited to deal with it, -they have done nothing. Many honorable members on their side, and all on this, are pledged to support a social insurance scheme, but the Government have done nothing towards proposing it. A Bankruptcy Bill, an Insurance Bill, the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture, are all non-party matters with which this Parliament could deal, but which Ministers will not give us an opportunity to consider. Proposals for the alteration of the Constitution, which honorable members opposite have admitted to be necessary, are not presented to us. The only House prepared to do business is the Senate, where members of the Labour party have introduced a Bankruptcy Bill, an Insurance Bill, and a set of Bills proposing alterations of the Constitution. As the Government refuses to do business, let us take it at its word, and put this Bill through quick and lively. There will be no obstruction from me. When the Bill is through, we can see what Ministers are made of. </para>

I would suggest to the Prime Minister that as the BUI will be quickly disposed of here, and will, no doubt, have a happy despatch in smother Chamber, he should adjourn the House for a week or a fortnight, or as long as is necessary to enable the Governor-General to make up his mind in regard to any request for a double dissolution. </para>

                    <para>.- I have an idea that the Prime Minister is not quite so happy this morning as his smiling face would indicate. We saw the consternation on the Ministerial bench this morning. The Government are asking for leave to introduce this Bill for the purpose of bringing about a double dissolution, they say. I will not occupy the time of the House at great length in giving the reasons why I believe the Bill should not be introduced. I hope we shall test the sincerity of the Prime Minister and his colleagues. </para>

                    <para>.- As one who endeavoured as a member of the House to purify the electoral rolls, and to make the electoral law as simple as possible with a view to giving every person in the Commonwealth the right to vote, I, in opposing the introduction of (this Bill, feel that the Government are doing that which the people of Australia will object to, because the Bill contains within itself machinery which, in its past operation, created great abuses. No section of the electoral law was so abused as was the postal vote. The intention of the postal vote to provide the sick and infirm with a vote was a good one, but in operation it was surrounded by many abuses. I personally am aware of abuses committed by persons who, in the manipulation of the postal vote, did things which were not to their credit. Those things were done as party tactics, and it is assumed that party tactics are not an offence, but, to my mind, those abuses were offences that deserved punishment. No person who is desirous of electoral purity could, for a moment, support this Bill. I expect that, before many days, an opportunity will be seized by the Government to delay proceeding with the Bill. I do not think that there is an honest desire on their part to go on with it since they heard of what happened in another place in regard to the Preference Prohibition Bill. For my part, it is generally agreed that I am in the happy position of having a safe seat, but a Bill of this kind should not be viewed by an honorable member with any regard to whether his seat is safe or not. Whether my seat was safe or unsafe my voice would still be against any measure that permitted of so many abuses as this measure will. Honorable members should be very careful about re-enacting such a system as this. Does any one think that the Fisher Government decided to repeal the postal vote for any other reason than that it was abused ? Statements went uncontradicted that the vote had been used for purposes entirely foreign to the intention of the Act, and it ill becomes honorable members to facilitate the reinstatement of such a system. Of course there may be ulterior motives behind the introduction of this measure, and, so far as they can be judged, they are such that no Government in a National Parliament should lend themselves to. To put the country to the expense and turmoil of a general election in respect of two such trumpery measures as the so-called test Bills is about the last thing that any Government should try to do. A general election involves not only great expense, but gives rise to much excitement, and seriously disorganizes business. For the time being, business is almost at a standstill, and we &#39; are therefore asked to take a very serious step when we are called upon to precipitate a general election in respect of such a proposal as this. When they do go to the country, the Government will suffer defeat at the hands of the people. I am satisfied that the people will speak in no uncertain manner, and it is therefore not because of any fear of going before my constituents that I speak as I. have done this morning. The point that I wish to emphasize is that there are important measures which could be brought down by the Government, and with which honorable members on all sides would be prepared to deal. There are many important questions that we are anxious to discuss, and in respect of which we desire to legislate, but the Government refuse to give us  the opportunity to do so. If there is to be a dissolution, let  it  be brought about on something- real, concerning  which we  can voice our opinions. This Bill, I am satisfied, will be attended  with  mischievous results, and my love  of  Australia, and my desire that  it shall  progress, force me to vote against  it.  I do not .want  to  see the great work of the Commonwealth delayed by the consideration of proposals designed merely to serve a party purpose. </para>
