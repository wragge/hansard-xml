                    <para>- The honorable member for Yarra yesterday drew attention to some figures quoted by me, and pointed out, very properly, that there was an error in them which, on my part, was accidental. I was quoting at the time from figures taken from a flimsy copy of the return, and I have now to say that  " 1901  " should read "  1907."  As pointed out by the honorable member, the exact figures were  £93,549,165,  and those for  1912  were  £148,775,407. </para>

                        <para>- There are a good many" hear hears," but I point out that, although the people' cry out for automatic telephones on the most up-to-date system, they have not the patience to wait from seven to ten days while hundreds of subscribers are being transferred from one switchboard to another. Subscribers are not being charged for calls that are not effective, because, under the automatic system, there is no registration unless the subscriber obtains connexion. The trouble is that the people have not yet learned how to work the machine. If they would take a little care and trouble, instead of grumbling, it would be much better for them and for the Department. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member kindly informed me that he intended to put this question, and I asked for particulars from the architect, but, unfortunately, they have not come to hand. Speaking from memory, I understand that the marble to be used will be New South Wales Caleula marble, Victorian Buchan marble, and South Australian Angaston and Kapunda marble. There have been special reports from the architect and the sculptor, who speak in the highest terms of Australian marble; and there is now a good opportunity presented, in the erection of Australia House, to advertise the existence of excellent material in Australia for building and sculptural purposes. In fact, some of the marble has been pronounced quite equal to the Parian marble of Greece. We are also doing our' best to have Australian timbers used as much as possible in the building, and it is selected for some, at all events, of the furniture and of the panelling. I shall give the honorable member more particulars when I receive them from the architect. </para>

                        <para>- I shall try to obtain the information. It will be very difficult, as the honorable member says, to get the figures for 1901 to 1907. It may only be possible to get approximate statistics, but whatever figures can be obtained, I shall endeavour to get them. They can be taken for what they are worth. </para>

                            <para>- I can only recall the figures approximately. The vessel was originally purchased for about £10,400, and the cost of the necessary additions and repairs was £5,907. Therefore, we may put down the cost at about £16,307. I think there was a loss on the working of the vessel of about £4,000 a year ; but a mail subsidy of £2,500 was previously paid. As the vessel was unsuited for the purpose for which it was purchased, and was rather expensive to work, I eventually sold it for a net price of about £6,000. </para>

Of course, the Prime Minister's remarks are an outrage. </para>

                            <para>- I do not believe that any Liberal member did say that I stated any appointment was made for seven years. I have not read any speech to that effect, but it casually came to my notice that an assertion of that sort was made about three months ago. The explanation is that another Minister made a statement from which the deduction was made. </para>

                        <para>- I am taking this action not with any desire to delay public business, but because leading business men on the north-west coast of Tasmania - not supporters of mine, but staunch members of the Fusion party - have requested me, as the representative of the district for the last thirteen and a half years, to try to prevent this injurious attack upon the privileges that they have enjoyed for thirty-three years. I shall ask the Minister to listen, not to my own views on the matter, but to statements made by representative bodies. In the first place I direct attention to the following protest from the Marine Board, members of which support the Fusion party. </para>

                </para><para>Ultimatum issued to close Strahan Bond on and after 1st July. This necessity of the trading public and convenience of the people has existed for over thirty years in the port of Strahan. </para><para>It is now under the Commonwealth control, and is managed by the postmaster, who is also Customs officer, and holds various other titles, offices, and duties. </para><para>Its cost in management is infinitesimal compared to former days under State control. Many hundreds of thousand pounds' worth of dutiable goods have passed through the Customs here; the greater bulk is not stored, but duty paid on entry. </para><para>It is safe to say fully £5,000 have been paid to Customs revenue in this port during the last five months. </para><para>The upkeep of the bond buildings is almost nil; it is a commodious building, and was erected as an appurtenance to the Customs Department of Strahan. </para><para>The small amount of revenue as rent is said to be the reason for closing the bond; the rental of this building should not be a reason for destroying a necessity and convenience of the people. If the rental ledger is to be squared, why not allocate a small percentage of the total duties paid into Customs revenue in each port, sufficient to meet the purpose? </para><para>The effect of closing these bonds will be to increase the cost of goods to the consumer, besides turning the actual rent, now received, into a loss instead of a credit. </para><para>Foreign goods often arrive through Hobart or Launceston consigned from the Home markets to Strahan; if the invoices and documents do not arrive at the same time as the' goods, and which does happen fora space of three or four days occasionally, then, if the bond is closed against storage it is said the goods are to be returned to Hobart for bonding. This means the goods, after arrival here, if not cleared immediately, have to be shipped back to Hobart or Launceston, and when the papers arrive they will be re-shipped to Strahan, making three voyages instead of one, and that the merchants must put on the extra charges at the cost of the consumer, to say nothing of the delay. </para><para>Surely the cost of living on the north and north-west coast of Tasmania is high enough now without the present Government, who came into office to reduce the cost of living, raising costs ; and surely, at a place where the rainfall is from 3 to 17 feet per annum, the Government should do nothing to injure the people. </para><para>It will also mean that the usefulness of the bond for distributing goods, and the duty paid automatically, as they are taken out, will be destroyed. </para><para>Let me try to show what this means to the small indent merchant. He purchases, say, £1,000 worth of goods, and perhaps by the time they arrive his credit is not as good with the bank as it was previously, and he is required to pay the whole of the duty within three days. If he has not the whole amount, he can put the goods into the bonded warehouse, and that will cost him practically nothing. </para><interjection>

                                <para>We understand the reason for thus closing the warehouse is that the revenue is too small to warrant the rent of the building used. My Board feel that the public will be greatly inconvenienced by the closing of the bond at Burnie, the shipping papers often coming to hand after the goods have been landed; in some instances the papers are sent to consignees at Waratah and elsewhere, and have to be forwarded to Burnie agents by them, sometimes involving a delay of a week or more. </para>
                                <para>The Customs Department have been paying £8 per annum for the bond at this port, and my Board have instructed me to offer the building at a nominal rent of £1 per year, hoping thus to obviate the necessity of the proposed action. </para>

As this involves serious inconvenience and loss to importers, besides a certain amount of loss to this Board, we have protested strongly, and would do anything in our power to prevent this injustice. The date of closing has been fixed as 1st July. Burnley has been similarly notified, and are also protesting. For some reason, which we are unable to explain, Stanley has not, they say, received notice. We would be pleased to give any information. (Sgd.) A. P. C. Ross. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish the Minister to take a lenient view. Small business men and farmers buy in small quantities. When a farmer imports an engine into Burnie, the bills of lading or invoices may not arrive for a week or two later, and the engine will therefore be shipped back to Launceston at his expense. In his speech yesterday the Minister of Trade and Customs said that his high officials - his inspectors - had decided that these Customs bonds were not profitable. In the name of the immortal Julius  Cæsar  how can high officials, sitting in their easy chairs in a big city, know what are the requirements of a little country district? When I was Minister of Home Affairs, I confess that I received suggestions on many occasions; but before acting, I looked into them with a view to seeing how they would affect the outside public. It is true that the people who reside on the north-west coast of Tasmania enjoy a beautiful climate during the summer, but it is one which is very injurious to their health during the winter. For the sake of saving a few shillings, why should they be deprived of a right which has been conferred upon them under a British Constitution ? Do we ever refuse to give a dinner to any foreign gentleman travelling through the Commonwealth because it will cost £30 or £40? Certainly not. Yet the Government have closed these Customs bonds in Tasmania, and have thus inconvenienced a number of small business men, simply because the said bonds cost the Commonwealth a few pounds annually in maintenance. The Minister has affirmed that it is not the policy of the Government to centralize everything in the big cities. Let him prove his statement by issuing instructions that nothing is to be done in the way of closing these Customs bonds until after the next general elections. Then, if the Labour party are returned to power, these bonds will not be touched; whereas, if the Liberal party prove triumphant at the polls, we shall not be able to prevent them doing just what they choose. I say that we ought not to cancel any right that these -small ports now possess. The cities have everything. They have beautiful libraries, picture shows, the Melbourne and Sydney Cups, and, indeed, everything that art and science can supply. If a small indent merchant purchases goods upon which he has to pay a couple of hundred pounds in Customs duties, he ought to be able to put those goods in a bonded warehouse on the coast, and to take them out just as he requires them for distribution amongst his customers. But, under existing conditions, he cannot do this at the ports of Burnie, Stanley, and Devonport. However, I will leave the honorable member for Wilmot to deal with the position as it affects Devonport. I say that this is the beginning of the centralization of everything in the big cities. It is like Morgan's octopus in America, which took all the finance of that country into Wall-street. Surely, if the present Government are a Government of the people, for the people, and by the people, instead of a Government of the people by and for the monopolies, they will not do anything to injure the small business men of Australia. Why should the high officials in the Public Service of Australia, who are surrounded with every comfort, and who enjoy all the luxuries when they travel, be permitted to say what are the rights of the little farmer on the north-west coast of Tasmania ? This matter was first brought under my notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> O. Henry, a business man who has large warehouses in Devonport and Strahan. He is not a Labour man, and if St. Paul came from Damascus he could not make him one. I hope that the Minister will take this matter into consideration, and make it impossible for me to say that the Government are endeavouring to centralize everything in the big cities. The national spirit of this country is being touched, and under its influence I hope to see the public life of Australia quickened with a new sense of freedom, Democracy and progress. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the business man is now withdrawing what the party man is alleged to have said outside this Chamber. There is apparently no suggestion that this is a trick. Nor could there be. This morning a question was asked as to whether Customs warehouses had been closed only in the sovereign constituency of Darwin. As a matter of fact, the ordinary practice of the Department has been followed in the cases cited by the honorable member. For instance, on the 9th December, 1910, I find a <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice, under the name of Frank G. Tudor, Minister of Trade and Customs, in which he proclaims the closing of nine Customs stations in New South Wales, twelve in Victoria, six in Queensland, three in South Australia, and one in Western Australia. The honorable member for Darwin might also tell me whether the following places are in the sovereign constituency which he has mentioned - Penguin, Smithtown, and Wynyard ? These stations are included in the same <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice. </para>

                        <para>- It appears, therefore, that the late Government closed down all these stations, and the honorable member raised no protest against their action. The honorable member has proclaimed himself to be the first business man of this Parliament, and I would remind him that, as business men, it became necessary for the late Government to close the Customs stations in three places in his own electorate. </para>

                        <para>- This honorable member who knows everything did not know what was going on in his own electorate. I cannot believe that. I prefer to believe that he was the business man all the time. While I have been Minister of Trade and Customs it has been necessary for me to act as a business man as previous Ministers have done. I have had to close some stations. The honorable member for Darwin knows that it is our duty to reduce, as far as possible, the cost of collection of the revenue. We cannot justify the imposition of taxes upon the people, and then employ an unnecessary number of officials to collect the taxes we impose. Of course, I agree that we should not unduly interfere with trade and the operations of those engaged in business. The honorable member drew a pathetic picture of the farmer and miner who was going to be injured by the closing of the Customs warehouses at these ports. I do not suppose that he could give a single instance in which a farmer imported an engine from abroad, and had it shipped direct to- any one of these ports, nor could he -give an instance of the kind in the case of a miner importing. What does it all amount to ? In the three places mentioned the stores have been closed. What are these stores ? They are places in which dutiable goods are stored for a certain time, and charges made for their storage, but the merchant, owning the goods, does not pay the Customs duty on them until he takes them out. The case about which the honorable gentleman was most pathetic was the case of Strahan. I find that the revenue derived for twelve months from the charges on goods at Strahan was £1 6s. 7d. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the rents received on the goods stored for the whole year was £1 6s. 7d. The goods were stored for a time, and the merchants did not pay Customs duties upon them until they were taken out, but my honorable friend wishes us to believe that, on this account, the whole cost of living throughout Tasmania was increased. The revenue received for the storage of goods in bond at Burnie for twelve months was £2 2s. lOd. The Harbor Board, I think, is our landlord at Burnie, and we pay for the use of the building in which the goods are stored £8 per year. I wonder what would be said of the honorable member for Darwin as a business man if he conducted his business in that way! In this case we are practically subletting the store to the people who own the goods. Could the honorable member, as a landlord, afford to sublet a house for £2 2s. lOd. a year for which he was himself paying a yearly rental of £8 ? He must, as a business man, admit that that could not be regarded as a sound business proposition. It should be remembered that these stores are revenue-collecting institutions only. They cannot be regarded in the same light as post-offices which are used to afford facilities for rendering services to the public as a whole. I take next the case of Devonport, and I find that the revenue for the year derived for the storage of goods in bond there was £5 8s. lOd. The State Government of Tasmania are now taking back the bonded store there. It is being re-vested in them, and they have informed us that they propose to charge us a rental of £20 a year. </para>

                        <para>- The officials in this case were not arm-chair officials. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Priestly</inline> was the man who investigated this matter. He reported the result of his inspection of these places, and it was upon his report that the Collector of Customs made his recommendation to me. Honorable members will see from the facts that I could not possibly have justified the continuance of these small stores. The convenience they afforded was simply to enable merchants to pay duty on their goods as they required them, instead of on the spot as they were removed from the ship. In order to continue that convenience, the Commonwealth would lose at Devonport alone something like £14 a year. </para>

                        <para>- It would be a loss all the same, and we have to consider the accumulated losses throughout Australia at different places. We could not conduct business on those lines. We are bound to provide the public with facilities, and to collect the revenue with as little cost as possible. Big cities like Ballarat and Bendigo, and other places in the Commonwealth, might make similar calls upon us, and ask that goods should be stored there until they are wanted to go into consumption. If that practice were carried out throughout the Commonwealth, the cost of collecting the Customs revenue would be excessive. We should not add to the burdens of the people in the way of taxation by undue expense in its collection. If the honorable member for Darwin will consider this matter in this House as a business man, he will recognise that we have dealt with it on its merits. We have every good feeling towards the three districts concerned, and are glad to see their progress and prosperity, and the extension of their industries. We have every sympathy with the farmers and miners, but we are bound to be as economical as we can in the collection of the revenue. Honorable members will recognise, from the facts that I have supplied, that no case whatever has been made out by the honorable member for Darwin in connexion with the closing of stores in the ports I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the protest of the honorable member for Darwin. The Minister of Customs' statement that the Government are careful about the expenditure, and are carrying the matter on in a businesslike way, is rather ludicrous, considering their extravagance in other directions. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This is a case in which encouragement ought to be given to the rising districts in Australia. It is something like the facilities given in connexion with postal matters. Mail services have to be conducted to deliver a very few letters in outlying parts, but that matter is not put on a pounds, shillings, and pence basis, nor should this be. It is recognised as part of the scheme for the development of the country. </para>
                <para>We do not, however, find this cheeseparing in the Defence Department, or the High Commissioner's office in London. We find there the most lavish expenditure. The expenditure on the Defence Department for 1913-14 is nearly £1,000,000 more than that for 1912-13. A large amount of this has gone in the payment of extraordinarily large salaries, enabling high officials to live in great luxury. According to an article in to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the expenditure on the High Commissioner's office is some thing appalling. At the pace we are going, it is estimated in the article that our representation in London will cost us over £100,000 a year - much more than considerable European Powers are paying for their ambassadors in various countries. </para>
                <para>The Government who profess to run the Departments on business lines balk at the expenditure of a few pounds to give great conveniences to farmers, miners, and others who are building up the resources of the country, but raise no question of business arrangements or shortage of revenue when it is a matter of enabling the High Commissioner's office in London to entertain wealthy globe-trotters, or Defence Officers to live in ease and luxury. </para>
                <para>In the light of these facts, the Minister's statement that he is closing up these Customs offices and denying these advantages to the electors of Darwin because of business considerations, is all moonshine. </para>
                <para class="block">Question resolved in the negative. </para>

                            <para>.- In <inline font-weight="bold">Ms speech</inline> last night the honorable member for Henty spoke of Federal extravagance, and when I asked him to instance a case of Federal extravagance entered into by the late Government he said " the Federal Capital Site." From this remark we can now understand why the work at the Federal Capital is not going on as fast as it should; it is owing to the influence of the Victorian section of the Fusion party. Another question raised by the honorable member was the enrolment of electors, and he advised the Treasurer that a good source of getting revenue would he to put the Electoral Act in operation against those who are not now applying for enrolment, and inflict the full penalty of £2. I do not know that it would not he a good thing if the right honorable gentleman were to take that step. I do not know whether he would be wise in following the advice of the honorable member for Henty. Numbers of those who are now enrolling have been struck off the roll since the date of the last election. Many of them are persons who changed their place of address, and are only now entitled to get on the roll by virtue of a month's residence at the new address. Some time ago I asked the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs a question regarding the enrolment in the Illawarra and Riverina divisions. According to information I had received from these electorates a large number of names were being challenged, and many names were being struck off the roll in each case. I desired to ascertain who was responsible for challenging the names of these persons, especially in the Riverina electorate, where the most glaring instances had occurred. The answer I received from the Assistant Minister was that the person who was chiefly responsible for sending in objections to names on the Riverina rolls was a man who does not reside in the electorate, but has an office in Pitt-street, Sydney. I found that 2,006 objections had been sent in, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archdale</inline> Parkhill, who resides 300 miles or more from the electorate, was responsible for challenging 1,484 of that number. </para>

                                <para>- My point is that the Department has no right to take any notice of a challenge from a man who resides outside an electorate, and does not know the people to whose names he objects. I submit that if names have to be challenged they ought to be challenged by a resident who knows whether the persons challenged have removed from the district. The Electoral Act contains a provision that, with every objection to enrolment, the objector shall lodge a deposit of 5s. to show his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> I desire to know from the Department, or the Assistant Minister, whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archdale</inline> Parkhill lodged the fee of 5s. in respect of each one of the 1,484 names which  he  challenged? </para>

                                <para>- I suppose that it was an objection. A gentleman named Lloyd objected to 318, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Wise, secretary of the Liberal Association, objected to twelve, while a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bertram,</inline> of West Wyalong, objected to four, making a total of 2,006 electors challenged as wrongfully on the roll for Riverina. This sort of thing is going on all over the country, and I venture to say that if inquiries were made it would be found that some thousands of names had been objected to by Liberal organizers, secretaries, and supporters. </para>

                                <para>- I wish to say a few words on the Defence Act and the treatment of the cadets. Some time ago I asked some questions in the House with, regard to Victor Yeo, of Broken Hill, who was arrested for non-compliance with the training provisions, and the answer I received from the Honorary Minister was that this lad had been sentenced to imprisonment for a month, a portion of which was to be spent in solitary confinement, with a diet of bread and water, for something over a week. Since the present Government came into power there have been several cases of this character. The first was that of Victor Yeo, and the other cadets involved were H.  Flintoff,  the Size brothers, of South Australia, and Thomas Roberts, of Melbourne. Most of these lads, I may say, are the sons of Quakers. There was also the case of  Kreygger,  a Presbyterian, who had conscientious scruples against military training. In November of last year this youth was arrested and sentenced to twenty-eight days at Swan Island. When he arrived there he refused to fall in, saying that he had been sent there for refusing to drill, and that he would continue to refuse because of his conscientious scruples. Another boy took a similar stand, and the officer in charge instructed two cadets, one of whom, Noonan, is a pugilist, who takes part in contests at the Stadium and elsewhere, to bring the recalcitrants into line. I am informed that some very harsh treatment was used on that occasion; so harsh, indeed, that the Department decided to have an inquiry. An inquiry was held. The Court consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Major H.</inline> J. Cox-Taylor, R.A.G.A., and Lieutenants B. M. Morris, R.A.G.A., and L. F. S. Mather, R.A.E. Paragraph 6 of their finding was as follows : - </para>

                        <para class="block">This young fellow informs me that he was not allowed to have any one at the inquiry to look after his interests, and that he had to do all the cross-examining himself. We know that, under the military rules, these young men are afraid to go as far as they would like to go. It was really a civil case, because it was a case of assault, and should have been tried in a Civil Court. At any rate, the Department should have given this young fellow the opportunity he desired to be represented by a solicitor. They refused that permission. He also tells me that the officer who was in charge of the lads at the time, and was responsible for getting Noonan to arrest him, and saw the whole of the ill-usage, was removed from Swan Island two days after the inquiry, thus showing conclusively that the officer was in some way responsible for the ill-treatment. I find that the Size brothers, at Largs, were placed in a room 9 feet by 6 feet, in which nine others had to sleep, and that there was no ventilation. Even in the case of the most hardened criminals it has been found necessary to abolish solitary confinement. </para>

                                <para>- I have heard honorable members opposite declaiming against this regulation. If it is wrong it is the duty of the Government to alter it at once, and to see that these young men do not suffer in the way they have suffered. I have referred to the case of young Roberts, who at the present time is undergoing twenty-one days' imprisonment, with seven days' solitary confinement, for refusing to fulfil the compulsory requirements of the Defence Act. Reference was made to it at a recent meeting of the Operative Plumbers' Union, and the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> published the following report of what occurred - </para>

                                had stated that there was a window in the cell in which the solitary confinement was passed, his wife had visited the Queenscliff Fort. She asked to be shown the particular cell in which the boy had been placed. The reply given her was that this could not be done without permission from head-quarters.

                                then visited her son at Swan Island, and asked him if he was sure that there was not a window in the cell. The lad replied that ho was certain that the only light in the cell came from two ventilators.

                                on her return to the Queenscliff Fort. was informed that Head-quarters had been communicated with by telephone, and the reply to the request for permission to see the cell was that in no circumstances was this to bo allowed.

                                <para>- I fought my pre-election campaign upon this question, and I fought my election on it. I was sent to this Parliament because I had the courage to say that I opposed the whole system. I came into this House saying that the defence of Australia was costing far too much, and I maintain that if we are to have our present system these cruel punishments should not be undergone by our boys. Furthermore, I say that if we compel them to train we should look after them and see that they get every comfort, and that while they are in camp the necessaries of life should be provided for them. I referred, when speaking on the Address-in-Reply, to the last Liverpool camp held in March of this year. I spoke of the treatment that the boys received in that camp when the weather was so trying. </para>

                        <para class="block">At that time New South Wales had the heaviest rainfall the State had experienced for fifty years. Yet the boys were compelled to remain in camp for eight days. At Kiama I saw a photograph of the camp taken four hours after the heavy rainfall, and a number of the young men were standing outside their tents knee-deep in water. They could not sleep on their beds, and had to walk about the whole of the night, and had to undergo a forced march of 20 miles on the following day, carrying all their kits. Each young fellow's kit, when dry, weighs about 30 or 40 lb., but on this occasion the kits were wet and sodden, so that an extra load had to be carried. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 26th March contained the following: - </para>

                        <para>And this during one of the wettest seasons that we have experienced in New South Wales for forty or fifty years. Rain began to pour as soon as the boys went into camp. An order should have been issued at once to break up camp and to return the lads to their homes. But no such direction was given. The boys were kept in camp the full period, and at the end of it had to take part in the review before General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton, in the Centennial Park. Many of those lads came from my own district. They told me that they suffered a great deal, and that, on their return home, many of them lost considerable working time because of colds and other troubles that they had contracted while in camp. I hold that if we are to have compulsory training we should make the system as comfortable as possible for these boys. It is wrong to force lads under sixteen years of age into camp. At Broken Hill, a brother of the lad to whom I have referred, who is only fourteen years of age, was fined for failing to drill; but, as the result of pressure that was brought to bear, it was eventually agreed to forego the fine. I have before me a long list of cases of boys who have been haled before the </para>
                        <para>Court. In Melbourne, there is a police magistrate named Read Murphy, who, when dealing with such cases, tells the boys that they are comparable with criminals. A magistrate who uses such language ought not to be allowed to deal with offences of the kind. In conclusion, I desire to refer to a deputation which I introduced to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, New South Wales, regarding necessary alterations to the telephone service between Sydney and Wollongong. The  Deputy  Postmaster-General admitted that the service at Wollongong, so far as the telephone was concerned, was in a very bad way, and he promised that the matter would be inquired into. So far, however, nothing has been done, and business men in Wollongong doing business with Sydney, are compelled, because of the delays of the telephone exchange, to wait for hours to get into communication with the capital city. </para>

I should not have done so, but for some interjections that were made in an undertone yesterday while I was addressing myself to another matter. I did not catch their full import at the time; but upon inquiry I found that some of them insinuated that, by reason of action I had taken in the House, old-age pensioners had been prevented from obtaining an increase in their pensions. </para>

We reduced the age for women to sixty, brought in the pension for invalids, removed the embargo upon pensioners owning their own homes, and in other  ways liberalized the Pensions Acts. The part that I took in the discussion of old-age pensions and the efforts I made to liberalize the pensions were referred to, yesterday or the day before by the honorable member for Yarra. </para>

Thus about forty minutes was given by the Government to the consideration of that Bill,  to  remove some of the disabilities under which the old-age pensioners are labouring. Then, on the 18th December, Parliament was prorogued. </para>
                        <para>Now I come to the present session. The alteration of the old-age pensions was of such importance that it was included in the Speech of the Governor-General in 1913, which indicated the business for that session. But I have read every paragraph of the Speech with which the late Governor-General opened the present session, which I hold in my hand, and I find not the slightest reference to old-age pensions. </para>
                        <para>This shows that the Government have absolutely dropped the matter. There has been no appearance of the Bill which was brought forward last session. The Government have not asked for leave to introduce such a measure, no motion for leave appears on the notice-paper, and, apparently, the Government have no intention of dealing with the question. </para>

I did absolutely nothing of the kind. The Treasurer has been trying to find something in the records  to  confirm that statement, but he cannot  do  so. His statement is pure invention.  I  have asked the  Clerk,  who now sits at the table, and who keeps a complete record of what takes place in this House, for any such reference, and  I  find that there is not  the slightest justification for the insinuation that I had anything to do with the Government dropping this measure. </para>

There is a majority of only one on the Government side, and if the honorable member says that there must be a vote on this question, a vote there must be. But if the honorable member says that he desires a vote taken, and is not prepared to take the action necessary to have that vote taken, he shows himself to be totally insincere. </para>

                                <para>- That is not correct. We liberalized the Pensions Act by ?250,000 per year. The honorable member cannot deny that the power is in his own hands to force a vote on the question of increased pensions. He claims to have independence of the Fusion to do things that are necessary in the interests of the people. Then let the honorable member join honorable members on this side, every one of whom will stand by him, and we can force the Government to make an increased allowance to the old-age pensioners. </para>

                        <para>Let me deal with the effort that has been made in that direction. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro, with such haste that nobody else had an opportunity, placed a notice on the business-paper soon after the House met, and as the fact of such a notice being on the paper prevented other honorable members from taking similar action, the honorable member had a monopoly of the business-paper in that respect.

                        <para>I pointed out at the time the disability that was being placed on the honorable member for Eden-Monaro in regard to his motion, and in order that an opportunity might be given to private members to proceed with their business, an amendment was moved by the honorable member for Kennedy - a Labour member - in these words - </para>

The matter is in the hands of honorable members opposite.

                            <para>.- I wish to discuss one or two matters affecting the Defence and Customs Departments. The replies given on behalf of the Minister of Defence to some questions which I asked this morning are not only unsatisfactory, but also totally misleading, though in harmony with the replies usually received from the headquarters of the Defence Department. I have before characterized the Headquarters' staff as a body of persons who beat every other set of departmental officers at delaying, evading, and misleading when asked for information. I wished to know why certain payments for services rendered some two months ago at the Garrison Artillery Camp at Newcastle had not been made. The replies I got were these - </para>

                                <para>All claims connected with recent Garrison Artillery Camp at Newcastle have been paid. A certain amount of delay occurred because the claims were not rendered immediately on conclusion of camp. When received, the claims were not in order, and had to be referred back for amendment, thereby creating further delay. </para>

                                <para>Inquiries are being made regarding the first portion of this question. In regard to the second, I am informed that comparatively very few complaints have hitherto been received, and that there would have been no delay in this instance under ordinary circumstances, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> if the claims had been rendered in proper order at the time. There does not, therefore, appear to be any necessity at present for instituting different arrangements. Instructions are being issued that all possible steps are to be taken to insure prompt payment, and that no unjustifiable delay shall take place. </para>

                        <para>That reply is misleading, and almost untrue. I have just received information from the spot that the accounts have not been paid, and that the money was asked for before the camp broke up. This is the second occasion on which delay has  occurred, the same thing happening before, a year ago, when payments were held back for over two months. The accounts are such as are rendered in connexion with every garrison camp. I am informed that - </para>

                            <para>A sufficient amount of money was asked for whilst in camp to pay all claims before leaving. </para>
                            <para>The paymaster cut down this amount so that claims for officers' field allowance, waiters, and cooks, advance party and sergeants'  mess  allowance could not be paid. These claims were according to regulations, and are paid at all other camps but this. Why should they be debarred ? </para>
                            <para>The sum of £128s. for officers' field allowance was received on 10th instant, nearly two months after camp. The money was asked for on the 11th April, and waited for until 2nd May, when vouchers wore forwarded, and the only response is the receipt of the above amount (£12 8s.). There is still a sum of £22 owing for sergeants' mess allowance, waiters, and cooks, and gunners' advance party. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">When men are compelled by law to give up their private time to attend these camps, the Department should provide for the ordinary services that are necessary there. The officers taking part in the camp should not have to pay cooks, attendants, and others out of their own pockets, and then be made to await the convenience of the officials at headquarters, who draw big salaries, and cavil at small items. This sort of thing will tend to destroy our military system. It will tend to cause those who are enthusiastically engaged in studying how most effectively to man the guns to throw up the sponge in despair. The whole matter requires thorough investigation. When it is urged that there is no reason why a departure should be made from the existing system, my reply is that that system is a hundred years behind the times. If some of those who now occupy responsible positions cannot improve upon that system, they should give place to others. There is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. It relates to the Customs Department and to our Public Service Act. I blame the Act for the fact that, instead of securing the services of skilled seamen to take charge of our Customs launches, we are much more likely to obtain the services of clever students who have quite recently left school. I hold in my hand an advertisement calling for applications from persons competent to take charge of a Customs launch in Sydney Harbor. The  test to </para>
                        <para class="block">Which  applicants were subjected was not  one  involving their seafaring qualifications, but partook wholly of the character of a clerical examination. I ask honorable members if that is a proper test to apply to persons who are desirous of being placed in control of a launch which is to perform service amongst  our  merchant fleet? A man may be able to multiply £15 6s. ll½d. by some thousands, but it does not necessarily follow that he will make a good coxswain of a Customs launch. I repeat that the fault of the present system is to be found in our Public Service Act, which should be amended at the earliest possible moment. If candidates for these positions are to be tested only from the stand-point of their educational acquirements, we shall build up a service in which those engaged will be jacks of all trades and masters of none. I have here a copy of the examination papers which candidates were required to answer, and I have no hesitation in saying that they are merely fit to test the qualifications of lads of fourteen  or  fifteen years of age who are just leaving school. </para>

The examination to which these candidates were subjected was decided from the stand-point of their proficiency in arithmetic, dictation, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c.</inline> If that does not produce a condition of things which will endanger the lives of people in our harbors, and bring about poor results in the management of these vessels, I do not know what will. Men who, I am sure, the Minister would rather place in charge of  these  boats have failed to pass these examinations, merely because they were not so smart in solving arithmetical problems as were some of the younger candidates. </para>

                                <para>-According to the advertisement he will not. As a matter of fact I know that the successful applicant secured the appointment because he' was the most proficient candidate in arithmetic. The same system obtains in other Departments. It is time that our Public Service Act was altered in such a way as to encourage men to become specialists in their own particular lines. It is idle to judge men by their knowledge of dead languages, which will never he required in the course of their official duties. I trust that the Minister will see that applicants who possess all the knowledge that is required for successfully managing these boats, hut who may not be so adept in arithmetic as are some of their younger competitors, will receive more consideration in the future. </para>

                                <para>- I wish to say a few words in connexion with the system of vaccination adopted with the idea of preventing the spread of small-pox at the time of the outbreak of that disease in Sydney, and to make special reference to the matter as affecting my own electorate, where I saw a good deal of what was done in connexion with the establishment of depots for vaccination. At the time of the outbreak of the disease, action was taken by the State authorities, and particularly by the Federal Government, to establish vaccination depots at different places in the State. People were induced to attend these depots and be vaccinated in order to prevent the spread of the disease. At the time of the outbreak of the plague, and on previous occasions when cases of small-pox were discovered in the State, a different system was adopted, and the houses in which the disease occurred were isolated. On this occasion the system of general vaccination was adopted, and those who were vaccinated, although they might have been contacts without the knowledge of the authorities, were allowed to mix freely with the rest of the community. I can say, from personal knowledge of the vaccination depot established at Newcastle, and the doctors and nurses employed there, that it was not possible to have a more up-to-date establishment for the purpose. The bad results which followed were doubtless due to the issue of new lymph, or lymph that was wrongly prepared. The difficulty is that many of the victims of vaccination under the system adopted are marked in a worse way than they could possibly have been if they had suffered from small-pox itself. </para>

Some time after the depots were established, a number of people became ill from vaccination, and as a consequence many lost confidence in the treatment and were afraid to go to the depots and be vaccinated. The smallpox would appear to be as bad now in the State of New South Wales as it was before. </para>

                                <para>- It is only a question of degree; the disease is still there, and a number of cases have recently been reported. I know of the case of a man who was in charge of a big business, of whom it was reported two or three times, after his vaccination, that he was dead.  His  condition, after, as he said, he was burnt by the stuff that was injected into his arm, was so bad that he was bold enough to petition the Government for an inquiry. From that time to the present, the Government have refused to grant the inquiry for which he asked in order that it might be discovered whether people had been vaccinated with inferior lymph, or with something else. The head of one business firm in Newcastle, with a desire to meet the Government in every way, induced his employes to be vaccinated, and no less than sixty of them had to go to bed. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member may call the disease what he pleases. Although the gentleman to whom I have referred petitioned the Government from time to time for an inquiry into the matter, and went so far as to call at Melbourne with a view to securing an inquiry, he was not granted the inquiry he desired. It is true that he was told to see <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston.</inline> Naturally, the head of the Quarantine Department differed from the position taken up by independent medical men on the subject, and he asserted that thousands of other persons had been vaccinated with a similar class of lymph, and that no injurious results had followed. That statement was not true, because wherever the people were vaccinated during the late epidemic of small-pox, dire results followed in Sydney, and in Newcastle also. In the interests of the safety of the people, and in order to secure information to establish the value of vaccination for the prevention of the spread of smallpox, I hold that a searching inquiry should have been made into the matter as requested by this gentleman. No Government, State or Federal, has the right to let loose upon the people for the purposes of vaccination something which they call lymph, that introduces into their bodies germs which bring about other forms of disease. As medical men who examined many of these cases said, nothing could have been introduced into their systems that would bring about the diseases that followed so quickly as some of this stuff did. To show the necessity for a full inquiry as to whether vaccination is the proper method or not, or whether the lymph is being properly and scientifically produced, last year some of the members of the House were coming back to Sydney on a Japanese boat, which had small-pox aboard, and before they could land they had to be vaccinated. Some chose Australian lymph, others Japanese and American lymph, and all those vaccinated with Australian lymph had a thoroughly bad time of it. We want to know whether the lymph prepared here is up to the highest standard, and whether people should be vaccinated at all, especially as so many medical experts are against vaccination as a preventive of small-pox. </para>

                                <para>- The number against vaccination is increasing every day. Men who have believed in it for fifty years have turned against it. The medical men who examined the case of the man who suffered so intensely, and who was given up for dead - he is as fine a specimen of manhood as one could set eyes on - almost failed to diagnose the disease that had been introduced into his system along with the lymph. The position is regarded as so alarming in this district that it is essential to have an inquiry by a thoroughly competent Commission, in order that confidence may be restored, or that we may learn whether the lymph supplied was foul, and so be able to sheet home the responsibility for what has happened. </para>

                            <para>.- I should not have spoken in this debate but for certain statements made by the honorable member for Illawarra about the number of names taken off the roll m Riverina. This is the first time that Riverina has ever been0 organized politically from one end to the other. It is now organized by the Liberals, and by the farmers and settlers. These bodies are going through the rolls, and ire challenging the right of names which should not be on the rolls to remain there, and sending in those names through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill,</inline> the general secretary of the Liberal League. The names are not being objected to by a man who knows nothing about them. They are being objected to on the authority of local bodies, who are in a position to know all the men in the different districts. I have already, in this House, given instances of ten names in one town which are on the New South Wales roll, and also on the Victorian roll. In the next town further up, which is only a small place, there are nineteen names duplicated in the same way. Do honorable members opposite say that they should not come off? </para>

In Riverina, as the Liberal candidate, and as the representative of the farmers and settlers, all I ask is a " square go." </para>

                                <para>- The local farmers and settlers of Riverina, who have known me all my life, asked me to become a candidate, and I did so, with the result that I am in this House. I understand that my old opponent is now busy running around the electorate, at the risk of his health and reputation, making the statement that I am a squatter, and that I am in Parliament only to get the land tax repealed if possible. I said in my election address, and I have said time and again since in this House, that the principle of the limitation of estates is a good one - the only good principle associated with honorable members opposite. </para>

                                <para>- If honorable members opposite do lose me, the satisfaction will be mutual, for I never listened to greater twaddle than I have heard from the Opposition benches since I entered this House. As a matter of fact, I have been familiar with eloquence of the kind since I was a boy, for I have over and over again heard the gentlemen who represent the shearers talk the same old stuff. The Supply Bill ought to be passed without delay. Honorable members opposite have been talking against time, hoping to the Lord that something would turn up; and something did, but it was the absence of their own members at critical moments. We on this side have been jeered and gibed at as being afraid to go to the country, and some one has just suggested that the election will result in my absence from this House. I can only ask honorable members opposite why they do not accept the chance to lose me, and go to the country. Each day, however, we find honorable members opposite resorting to some new device, and clinging to some fresh straw, because they know that some of the Labour representatives must leave the Senate, and that about half-a-dozen in this House will never return. I am sorry, but such is the fortune of war. </para>

                                <para>- I may be, but so far from being a disadvantage to me financially it will prove an advantage. Honorable members opposite do not, however, care to face these little accidents which are incidental to this profession of ours. I have been flatly contradicted when I have stated that union men are not allowed to vote as they think fit; but honorable members opposite, who profess themselves to be very keen about the secrecy of the ballot, know very well that if a labouring man appears at election time, he is immediately seized hold of by organizers, and put into the booth, even if he is going to vote Liberal. </para>

                                <para>- It is what happens in my electorate. When certain union men signed my nomination, the organizer of the Australian Workers Union came down and threatened to have them expelled if they did not withdraw. Five of them who were rather weak in moral fibre did withdraw, but there were seven who told the organizer to go not only to Hay and Booligal, which are in my electorate, but much further on. It will be seen, therefore, that union men are not allowed to vote as they like. </para>

At the last election I received 1,500 more votes than did the Labour Senate candidate, so that it does not follow that, because a man is associated with Labour, he is in favour of Socialism, or of the policy of the Labour party. Honorable members opposite talk much about political unrest; but, despite their disclaimers, I cannot see how we can hope to avoid it when such a premium is placed on the preaching of it. The honorable member for Bendigo, who lectured us on the waste of time, and has since himself laid down the law, quoted the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to show that I am justified in my statement that social differences are used as a means to stir up strife, I should like to read an extract from the encyclical of the late Pope on the <inline font-style="italic">Condition of the Working Classes -</inline></para>

                                <para>- Yes; because,' as regards points, honorable members opposite can beat a porcupine every time. The double dissolution has not shaken the foundations of the Constitution, but it has shaken members of the Senate. It was a simple solution of the difficulty with which we were faced. We passed a Bill, the Senate disagreed with it, and it was sent back to us; we sent it back to the Senate again after three months, and the Senate had the choice of passing it or facing a dissolution. The provision in the Constitution is a guarantee that the Senate will not reject a measure a second time unless the members of that Chamber regard it as of vital importance. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly. If Labour had a majority in the House of Representatives, and there was a majority of Liberals in the Senate, and if the Labour majority sent up a measure which the Senate rejected twice, they would have the same opportunity of securing a double dissolution. That procedure is quite fair. </para>

                            <para>.- It is to be hoped that the honorable, member who has just spoken will be able to put much more potent arguments before his constituents in favour of a double dissolution than he has uttered in this Chamber. He will find that even comparatively uninformed voters will be able to see through his argument. He boasts in proof of his fighting prowess that ten generations of his family have lived in Tipperary. I venture to tell him that there are some other Tipperary people about. </para>

If they have made out a good case - and they appear to be proud of it - I cannot conceive why they do not bring down the document and publish it for the information of honorable members and the country. The only conclusion the people can draw from the present action of Ministers is that there is something in the document which will not stand the light of day, or that Ministers have taken advantage of the fact of the Governor-General being a stranger, and of his unacquaintance with the practices of the Constitution, and have misled him. </para>

                        <para>I am glad to see that the Treasurer is in the chamber. I would like to appeal to his sense of justice in regard to the matter of an increase in the old-age pensions paid to people on the Western Australian goldfields and in other remote parts of the continent. No one knows better than the Treasurer that 10s. a week at Kalgoorlie, or in the outlying portions of Australia, will not purchase as much of the necessaries of life as the same amount will purchase in Perth, or in any other city adjacent to the coast. Therefore, it is plainly unjust and unfair. </para>

                                <para>- Undoubtedly it is unjust not to make some allowance for the surroundings in which the recipient of the pension is placed. When the Government of which the right honorable gentleman was a member framed the Commonwealth Public Service Act and regulations, why did they provide for a goldfields allowance? In the Parliament of Western Australia, the Treasurer always recognised that there should be a goldfields allowance and a tropical allowance. Is that not so? </para>

                                <para>- That is so. To show that the people of the gold-fields feel that an injustice is being done to them, I should like to explain that I have received a letter from Coolgardie, where a meeting of old-age pensioners was held, asking me to point out that the cost of living there is considerably more than in other places, and that, owing to the rise in the prices of the necessaries of life, a pension of 10s. per week is by no means adequate to their needs. I fear, however, that I cannot expect much sympathy from the Treasurer owing to the influence of his present associates. </para>

Since the Fusion Government have been in power the trusts have commenced to operate with a freer hand, and, as the Treasurer knows, have raised the prices of commodities. I would also remind the right honorable gentleman that I did not receive this letter three years ago. It has only just reached me. I presume that those who feel the pinch are the best judges in the matter. </para>

                                <para>- The Treasurer certainly came into the controversy at the last moment, but his action had no effect. When he saw that the strike was about to be settled he got into the limelight by sending telegrams to local newspapers and mayors, intimating a certain course, wanting to take credit to himself for the settlement. Believing that he was sincerely anxious for the early construction of the line, I appealed to him months ago in a letter in which I placed before him all the facts. </para>

                                <para>- My letter was not so indorsed, but the Treasurer marked his reply " Private," so that I was unable to use it. He allowed the work of constructing the East- West railway to be held up for three months, and since a mile of rails can be laid every day, his inaction means that the line so far constructed is 90 miles short of what it would otherwise have been. I have no desire to go into the question of the sleeper contract, since it has already been sufficiently ventilated in the House, but I believe that the right honorable gentleman will find, when he goes before his constituents, that they are not at all pleased with his action in that matter. </para>

                                <para>- Unfortunately, under the Standing Orders, I have but a limited time to speak, and I therefore cannot detail what the right honorable gentleman did, or failed to do, in connexion with that matter. Another subject on which I wish to bring him to the bar of public opinion relates to his action when the Premier of Western Australia came to Victoria and announced that he could not, for the time being, build the broad-gauge line from Kalgoorlie to Perth in connexion with the transcontinental railway. What did the Treasurer do? He gave interviews to representatives of the newspapers in the eastern States, announcing that this meant the repudiation of an undertaking given by Western Australia. </para>

The Government of Western Australia are perfectly justified in delaying the construction of that line until they have the necessary funds. It ill became the right honorable gentleman to cry out "repudiation" when the State Government were spending all their available money in building local lines, to give producers in the Treasurer's constituency a freer and clearer entry to the markets of the world. </para>

                                <para>- I would like to draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to a very severe injustice that is being inflicted on some of the youths who are being trained to defend this country. I brought before the House the other day the case of a young man who was sent to the .Melbourne gaol for thirty days, for part of which period he was kept on bread and water, because he deserted from one of the war-ships on which he was employed as a stoker. The work proved to be very distasteful to him, and had he known its nature he would never have undertaken it. I called for the papers, and, to my amazement, I was unable to find out what authority had ordered the lad to gaol for thirty days. It appears that the Defence officers have the right to use the civil machinery to punish naval or military offenders, without any reference to a civil Court. The Government ought to look into this case. </para>

He did not desire to continue in the employment of the Navy, and he started mining near Southern Cross, where he was arrested, brought to Melbourne, and sent to gaol. A case like that requires to be explained to the people, or, at any rate, the justification for such treatment should be laid before Parliament. </para>

                        <para>Another case has arisen in connexion with the training of cadets. I refer to a young man named Williams, of Kalgoorlie. The circumstances of this case show how careless the officers are, and their readiness to take advantage of any little lapse - although there was none in this case - on the part of the cadet. The father of this lad, Thomas Williams, wrote as follows to the local paper: - </para>

                            Might I claim space to bring under notice the case of Thomas Williams, who some time ago was notified to the effect that he was required at the drill hall. Having no objection to drill, he put in an appearance, and was listed in a company. He attended a couple of drills or parades, when he was notified that he was too big for that corps, and was dismissed from same to be transferred to another. He received no communication whatever relating to the transfer, excepting a notification instructing him to return all gear, &amp;c, belonging to the company from which he was dismissed. Having no gear or uniform of any description no notice was taken of that order. The next communication he received was a summons to appear at the Boulder Police Court for not having attended a number of drills. He, of course, attended, and received seven days with the military authorities. Little more than a week elapsed when he received two more summonses, one of which stated that he left duty on 7th March before being dismissed. He was fined 20s. and costs. The second summons was for leaving duty on 21st March before being dismissed. Now. sir, the lad was not at drill on 21st March, but this fact did not embarrass the prosecution in any way. We find them conveniently altering the summons to read "absenting himself from drill on the 21st inst."; fined 40s. and costs, noth withstanding the fact that the lad had attended a parade on the day following, from C.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m.

                            <para>Then, again, does the prosecution think the fining of lads affects them? If so they are making a huge mistake. It is always the parents who pay. In conclusion, let me quote an impression gained by a visit to the Commonwealth ground one evening a month or so ago: I saw companies of cadets in all directions, and in almost every case the officer (I suppose he is called an officer) in charge was some small, under-sized youth, who, in a small, shrill, treble voice, ordered his company to shoulder arms, &amp;c. I, for one, do not wonder at insubordination in the rank and file when one sees men being ordered around by boys. </para>

                        <para>I would like to refer now to the manner in which the electoral rolls are being manipulated. The worst that could be said of the rolls used in connexion with the last election was that they contained a large duplication of names. While I have listened to everything that has been said on the subject, I have not seen any proof that a considerable number of people voted twice. After all, that is the main thing. It is far better to have a few names duplicated on the rolls than that there should be efforts made, as undoubtedly efforts are now being made, to keep people off the rolls who ought to be on. Better duplication than disfranchisement. It is a most extraordinary thing that the present Government, who connived at a law which compels everybody to enrol under a penalty of £2, should be now adopting measures to excise the names of people who may be temporarily absent from their homes. Innumerable cases of that kind have occurred; and, apparently, the Liberal Leagues of Australia are depending for success at the next election on eliminating the names of Labour voters from the rolls. </para>
                        <para>I have here a statement by a man named Sambell,  President  of the People's Liberal party, who says, "Many thousand names have been objected to by the Liberal organizers." I desire to know what justification exists for these Liberal organizers going round the country in order to disfranchise the worker. We know that they are all very well paid for this business, or they would not be engaged in it. And we may infer that the sinews of war are being supplied by the trusts which are now bleeding the community. But a Government should be above that kind of thing. They should desire to take the free and unfettered opinion of the people of this country. Another of these Liberal presidents, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hughes,</inline> is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 6th June as having said - </para>

                        <para class="block">Apparently, the farmer who has a workman at the plough is to compel him to vote the Liberal ticket, and the lady who invites her friends to afternoon tea, and the wives of the workers into her drawingroom, is to use her influence to induce them to vote for candidates recognised by the Tory party. The reference to the woman in the kitchen means, I suppose, that illicit and illegitimate influence is to be brought to bear on the poor servant girl, to cause her to vote the Liberal ticket. </para>

The other day u gentleman named Herbert Brookes - I do not know if honorable members have heard that name before - in addressing some organization over which he presides, gave great praise to the gentleman who ordered the double dissolution, and denounced as "mercenary" Labour leaders who had been guilty of criticising that functionary. This man, who, I believe, was formerly a single-taxer and a pronounced Democrat, now says, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 6th June - this is an index to the game that is afoot - </para>

                        <para>Something has been said about the Senate being a party House. The Senate has been a disappointment to the Tories of Australia. Did the Treasurer ever imagine, when the Convention was framing the Constitution, that there would one day be a big Labour majority in the Senate? Of course he did not. Everything was beautifully arranged, so that a Conservative or Tory majority should always be there to checkmate the democratic House of Representatives. In the Treasurer's sense, the Senate has been a very disappointing House ;  but  from my point of view, it has nobly vindicated the intentions of the framers of the Constitution. A Victorian functionary, an imported Viceroy, speaking recently at the Premiers' Conference, said - </para>

                        <para class="block">That is so. The pundits are strictly correct. Neither under the Constitution nor the Colonial Office regulations had he any place at such a conference. Many years ago at Kalgoorlie I said, and I repeat it now, that the Conferences of Premiers were an excrescence on the Constitution, and should not be recognised by any party in this House. </para>
                        <para>Finally, let me remind those who talk about the Senate not having proved a States House, and not having guarded the rights of the States, how it has acted on various matters affecting the States individually. The New South Wales senators have looked well after the Federal Capital site; the Queensland senators watched carefully to see that their State got the sugar bounty and duty; the South Australian senators managed to impose on us the Northern Territory; the Victorian senators fixed up the Murray River Waters Agreement; the Tasmanian senators got a financial grant for their State, and succeeded in lowering its telegraph and postal rates; and the Western Australian senators have obtained for their State the transcontinental railway. So, whatever may be said to the contrary, the Senate has proved a very faithful and vigilant guardian of the rights of the several States. </para>

                            <para>.- I was disappointed with the speech of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie; I expected something better from a man of his age and experience.  His  caustic utterances are not an example for younger members to follow, but I should like to reply to some of his arguments. Let me take the last one first. He said that the Senate has represented the rights of the States. I ask him how has the Senate dealt with the proposal to leave the control of Savings Banks with the Governments of the States. That was agreed upon at a conference of the Treasurers of all the States, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan</inline> representing Labour Ministries, and the others Liberal Ministries. The first person to object to the arrangement in this House was the Leader of the Labour party, and he has been supported by the Senate. If the Senate represented the States, every senator would support an agreement of the kind to which I refer. As to the </para>

                        <para class="block">Commonwealth Bank, I am of opinion that it should be controlled by a board of directors. No, doubt the Governor of the bank is one of the best men who could have been chosen for his position, but to intrust the control of the finances of the Commonwealth to one man is to cast on him a very big responsibility. Although honorable members opposite profess to be democrats, and to abhor autocrats like the Czar of Russia, they have made the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank an autocrat. The Bank of England, the Bank of France, and European, American, and Australian banking institutions generally are controlled by boards of directors. The Bank of England is governed by a court of directors consisting of thirteen members, and surely a system that is good for that huge concern would be good for our bank. </para>

He offered to teach us mathematics, and to give us lectures on the Budget, and told us that when he was at home, and felt tired or downcast, he would sometimes get his "missus" to read a few pages of the Budget to him, because he found that that acted as a tonic. After having made this statement, the honorable member declared that the Government were spending £150,000, and desired to know what 4 per cent, on that amount would represent. He asked himself that question over and over again, and finally had to give it up. This is the gentleman who is going to teach us finance generally. He is the great authority on finance. </para>

                                <para>- I consider that the Commonwealth Bank should be conducted on similar lines to those upon which other banks are conducted in civilized communities. Instead of lending money to the farmers at a low rate of interest, that institution is charging them 6 per cent, upon advances Yet we were told that the establishment of this institution would result in the farmers obtaining cheap money. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie also claimed that old-age pensioners on the gold-fields of Western Australia should receive larger pensions than should those in the other States, on the ground that they have to live in a tropical climate, and were therefore entitled to a tropical allowance. Now I would ask honorable members to peruse the <inline font-style="italic">Kalgoorlie Miner</inline> and to compare the prices which obtained in that city for fruit, vegetables and other commodities, with those which obtain for similar commodities in Perth. They will then find that there is practically no difference between the cost of living in the two places. I venture to say that living at Kalgoorlie is cheaper than it is at Perth. </para>

He moved in this matter in 1891, before many members of the Opposition had ever seen political daylight, and yet we are told that his action was so much bluff and window-dressing.

                                <para>- I would invite the honorable member to study the records of the Parliament of New South Wales,  and he will then find that the  Hon.  C. G. Wade was the first to introduce invalid pensions in Australia. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie attributed all the delay which has occurred in the construction of the transcontinental railway to the action of the present Government. He said that but for the strike the construction of that railway would have been further advanced to the extent of 90 miles. But who was responsible for that strike? Surely the present Government cannot be blamed for it ? If the employes on it chose to down their tools notwithstanding that they were working under the best conditions given to that class of labour in the world they have only themselves to blame. Under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Fisher Government these men were paid lis. 8d. per day. Without a moment's notice they threw down their tools and went on strike. The Prime Minister agreed to meet them by offering them 12s. 6d. a day. But they declined to accept his terms and demanded 13s. 4d. a day. In this connexion I would point out that for similar work in the Northern Territory the honorable member for Barrier, when Minister of External Affairs, paid only 10s. a day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scaddan,</inline> the Premier of Western Australia, is paying the same wage for similar work at Kalgoorlie. </para>

                                <para>- It is absolutely true. Only the other day I discovered that quite a number of fettlers on the railway who are distant from Sydney some 250 miles, are in receipt of only 8s. per day. The Kalgoorlie men downed tools, and would not work under 13s. 6d. a day. It is a monstrous thing to blame the Government for that strike, in the circumstances. </para>

                                <para>- We have been perambulating all round the country. My honorable friends opposite, when addressing  themselves to the Estimates, box every point of the political compass but the right one. I may be permitted to direct attention to a few matters connected with the Supply Bill. I have gone into the figures, and I find that, during the three years from 1908 to 1910 in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> held office, he received a revenue of £34,082,584. Of this sum, he was obliged under the Braddon section of the Constitution to return to, the States £24,875,000, leaving a sum of £9,206,000 to carry on with. I find that from 1911 to 1913 inclusive the Fisher Administration received a total revenue from all sources of £43,243,613. Of this sum they had to return to the States under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> arrangement £17,045,777, leaving £26,197,836 to carry on with. These figures show that during their three years of office the Fisher Government received £15,380,000 more from Customs and Excise than did the Deakin Government, and they received from the Federal land tax £4,301,536, or a total additional revenue of £19,681,556. In spite of these figures our friends opposite have been complaining all over the country that the Deakin Government showed a deficit of £600,000, whilst the Fisher Government left the tremendous surplus of £2,000,000. Why should they not, with such a tremendous inflation of revenue? Let me give honorable members a simple illustration. If an artisan in Melbourne receiving £200 a year found that after twelve months' operations he was in debt to the extent of £15, some people would be inclined to blame him, and consider that he was an impecunious individual, since, he spent more than he earned. If, in the next year, a rich uncle left him £1,000, and he spent £800, he would show a surplus of £200 for the year, but would any one say that he would be any better a man? The two cases are analogous. The Deakin Government had to get along as best they could with £9,000,000 to spend, whereas the Fisher Government, in their three years of office, received £19,000,000 more than did the Deakin Government, and our friends go through, the country claiming <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> on that account, to be one of the greatest financiers Australia has ever produced. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> had had to be content with the revenue at the disposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> namely, £9,206,000, instead of showing a surplus of £2,600,000 he would have shown a deficit of £7,800,000. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable member does not think I am speaking the truth, let him go to my sources of information. If he goes through the late Treasurer's figures carefully, he will find that what I have said is absolutely true. Great objection has been made by the members of the Opposition to the Government borrowing money for defence purposes. I do not altogether favour that policy, but there are certain defence items which should come under that category. The honorable member for Wide Bay, when in office, agreed to borrow £870,000 for the Cockatoo Island dock, a debt which the States are carrying at the present time. </para>

                                <para>- From the States. The amount is due at the present time to New South Wales. He borrowed an additional amount of £2,100,000 from the Trust Funds. If he borrowed in this insidious manner, why should he blame us when we come on to the open market and borrow in a fair and open way? The Government and their followers are to be congratulated on the way in which they have held their own in the House during the last twelve months. In that time there have been a hundred divisions on contentious matters, and in those there were 3,618 votes cast by Liberal members, as against 3,199 by Labour members, an average of 36£ per division for our side, and 32¼ for the Opposition, or an average majority of 4.2 for the Government. The members of the Opposition tell us that we ought to resign, or have a single dissolution, but our answer is to point to that splendid record in an evenly divided House, where the  Speaker  holds the majority. The facts show that we have stuck to our principles, and devoted great attention to our duties. Recently, when in the Cowra division of my electorate, I found that the circular entitled " Cook's Latest " was being distributed broadcast. It contains the statement, " The police are taking names off the rolls, but will put none on." Nobody in Australia can prove that assertion. Not a single name has been taken off by the police. The Labour organizations are circulating this lie, for 250,000 of these circulars have been spread broadcast throughout the country, but every Labour member in the House knows that the police have no authority to take a single name off the rolls. </para>

                    <para>I should like to know from the Leader of the Opposition what on earth there is to confer about in connexion with a simple Supply Bill like that before the House. If the right honorable gentleman will tell me that, I shall be very glad to confer; but after a fortnight's talk, it is the most wonderful suggestion I ever heard. The right honorable gentleman is apparently waiting for me to consult him with regard to the closing of the debate. Why? What for? Honorable members opposite have been talking about everything under the sun, and nothing in particular. </para>

I should be ashamed to attack women as do honorable members opposite. They have never known us on the Liberal side to do so in regard to their women - we should not think of it. </para>

                            <para>- The conduct of some honorable members certainly calls for some remarks of a severe character from the Chair. It is not at all in keeping with the dignity, reputation, and character of the House or its proceedings that honorable members should continually interject as they are doing, and in such a spirit of levity as is displayed. I feel it incumbent upon me to speak in this way in order to express my disapprobation, and, I take it, the disapprobation of the House, of such conduct. </para>

                            <para>- I have done nothing at any time to interfere with the electoral arrangements. I have done nothing that is not in keeping with the promise I made to the right honorable gentleman himself; and it is time these insinuations ceased, unless honorable members opposite have something to sheet home; and if they have, let us have it at once. I invite them - I defy them - to prove that there has been any wrongdoing in any one particular regarding the electoral arrangements. It is over the odds that day after day we should have to listen in this Chamber to imputations on our honour. I do not mind fair political criticism, nor do I mind honorable members opposite making points, but I draw the line when they begin to make imputations and charges against my honour in connexion with electoral matters. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman is reported in the Melbourne press as referring to Labour people who were quite decent. The citizens of Australia who have avowed the principles of Socialism belong to a party which is accused by honorable members opposite of having violated the first principle of a social community, namely, the marriage tie, and the accusation is that we are not fit to be honest citizens. We have from the Prime Minister to-day a display of the highest indignation, because the Supply Bill does not pass at the particular moment Ministers desire. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that no anger or passion will ever make me guilty of an unjust statement. The Prime Minister will remember that his former leader at one time launched a manifesto directly and distinctly against the honour and integrity of the Labour party; but even with the press behind him he absolutely failed to carry the country with him. Ministers are asking the country to believe that they are paragons of virtue, and must not be discussed in a political capacity, and they complain that they are being treated unfairly. No Parliament has ever treated Ministers in such a position more fairly. </para>

                            <para>- Very well; but the Prime Minister might easily have let me know that he wished to have the Supply Bill through to-day. Had he done so I would have co-operated with him to put the measure through, and enable him to get Supply as early as possible and practicable. It would not then be delayed very long. The usual courtesy displayed in all Parliaments is for the Leader of the Government to approach the Leader of the Opposition in matters  of this kind. I accept the Prime Minister's statement that he has communicated his wish in this way, and I tell him that I shall co-operate with him, but at the same time I can point out that all the time occupied in the discussion of Supply has not been taken up by members of the Opposition. Fourteen members on the Ministerial side have spoken, five of them twice, including the Prime Minister himself. Honorable members who were not in the last Parliament might as well know that the Opposition in that Parliament kept the House sitting on one occasion for fifty-three hours, and not one member on the Government side spoke. Ministers did not squirm or appear as injured innocents, nor did they apply the closure; they simply awaited their opportunity. Our present  Speaker,  who was in a different position then, will recollect those circumstances very well. Of course, that incident is now, for honorable members supporting the Government, a matter for hilarity, while the present circumstances are regarded as infamous and as affording cause for indignation. It all depends upon the different point of view from which we regard things. Men who are elected to honorable positions are supposed to regard themselves as men, and to take as much as they give. I promise the Prime Minister to show Ministers that cooperation for which he asks, and perhaps earlier than he really desires it he will have the Supply Bill. </para>

                        <para>. -  The Leader of the Opposition has made a somewhat obscure reference to myself, and a speech that he alleges I have made. He has accused me of having stated that " a section of the working people are respectable; some of them are decent." I have never in any utterance, public or private, thrown the slightest doubt upon the respectability or decency of the whole of the working people of Australia. On the other hand, I have made it my particular endeavour to repudiate attacks which have been made on that class, or any other class, as a class. The Leader of the Opposition claims that he is entitled to attack this side of the House, and he does attack this side, and we do not object to being attacked; but when the attack takes the form of innuendo and insinuation, and not the form of direct statements which can be met and dealt with honestly and above board, we certainly object. That is just what the Prime Minister has said. We have the right to ask that if we are charged with anything dishonorable or dishonest the charge shall be made in express terms which we can meet. We have all heard the frequent use of the term " manipulation " as applied to the Government. There has been talk of " manipulating the rolls " or " manipulating the electoral machinery," and " tampering with it." The Leader of the Opposition knows perfectly well that if such an accusation were made against him he would be the very first to insist, and very rightly so, that individual instances should be given; and that is all we claim. There has been no instance brought forward that has not been abundantly disproved, so far as the Government is concerned. The statement alleged to have been made by me is merely one example of the kind of attack of which the Leader of the Opposition seems to be peculiarly fond. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to accuse the Government of acts of commission, but I accuse the Department of which the Prime Minister is the head of acts of omission. If the Prime Minister wishes to know why the police have been blamed - and, in  my  opinion, unjustly - it is because their instructions were to remove names, and not to put them on the roll. In several  cases throughout Melbourne the dividing line between electoral divisions is the centre of a street, and the odd numbers on the street are in one division, while the even numbers are in another division. If the police officer finds ah odd number in the division where only the even numbers on a particular street should be found, the notice of objection sent out to the person concerned is not sent out saying, " You are in such-and-such a division," but saying, " You are not in this division," though the person may have been living in the house fifteen or twenty years. This is an act of omission which could have been remedied by the Prime Minister, as head of the Department of Home Affairs, issuing an instruction that where the police find that a man is enrolled in respect of the wrong subdivision - the two sides of the street in which he lived representing different subdivisions - they should advise him where to go to secure proper enrolment. The Divisional Returning Officers who have been appointed in Melbourne and suburbs are among the best officers I have met. I think they know their duty well. </para>

                            <para>- The Government Whip - the paid  "barracker"  for the Government - is now interjecting. My statement, however, cannot be successfully controverted. I do not say that the Government would unjustly cause any name to be removed from the rolls ; but what I do say is that the officers under the control of the Minister of Home Affairs do not make it possible for every man and woman who should be on the rolls to secure enrolment, and that names are wrongly removed. The honorable member for Yarra told me to-day of a man thirty years of age who was still living in the house in which he was born, and who waa struck off the roll because he was said to be no longer residing there. He sent in a claim card, but the Registrar would not accept it, and has not yet placed his name on the roll. I have before me at the present moment particulars of three cases of the kind to which I referred a few moments ago. Where it is found that a person is enrolled for the wrong subdivision, the police, instead of leaving the notice of objection at present used, should leave a card stating that the ground of objection is " That you do not live in this division or subdivision, and have not so lived there for at least one month." In one case husband and wife had lived in the same house for years, but while the name of the wife was allowed to remain on the roll, that of the husband was struck off. </para>

This is not a laughing matter. Such a remark is sufficient to raise the righteous indignation of any respectable man. It is on a level, however, with a circular which was issued by the Liberal Association in South Australia, and scattered throughout the Commonwealth, wherein it was stated that the only use which Socialists had for their womenkind was to make them breeding cows, and that their desire was that the State should take care of their young, instead of the animals that bred them. That is the kind of mendacity to which it is high time a stop was put. </para>

In pretending to repudiate, and make other people responsible for these things, they are indulging in the very tactics I complain of. The honorable member for Brisbane has referred to the " breeding cows " statement, for which, he says, Liberals are responsible. </para>

                            <para>- Is there an honorable member inside this House, other than the honorable member for Cook, who would dare to impugn the honour of the honorable member for Corangamite as to anything? If there is a man who stands above all reproach in this House, or out of it, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manifold.</inline> What, then, is the insinuation that is made? This is the campaign of mendacity that I have referred to. Because somebody has written something with which the honorable member for Cook does not agree, and there is a man remotely connected with that paper in quite another part of the country, the honorable member holds him directly and personally responsible. That is the sort of campaign I complain of. </para>

I am complaining about the campaign of innuendo and slander which the honorable member is propagating throughout the length and breadth of this country, and two excellent examples have been given in the House to-day. As to the statement about what women are saying outside, may I remind honorable members opposite that some of their own menkind are making many of those statements to-day. I was reading only to-day in the <inline font-style="italic">Hobart Post</inline> a controversy between the editor of that paper and a prominent follower of the right honorable member for Wide Bay, who stood against the present Attorney-General in the last election for Flinders. </para>

                            <para>- It is just as fair as much that has been said. I referred to the matter to make this observation : There are in every camp persons who are not what they ought to be. That will be so until the end of time. But why apply criticism, which ought to attach to such individuals alone, to the party to which they belong? I have never done that in my life. It is not fair fighting. It is no more fair to say that the statements which are criticised have emanated from the political parties to which the persons who made them belong, than it would be to say that the Leader of the Opposition or his followers are rank atheists, because one man in the Labour party' announces himself to be an atheist. Why make these constant imputations and innuendoes against men on this side because of something written or said in some distant part of the Commonwealth? This sort of thing should cease. At the outset of the campaign I expressed the hope that there will be less of it than we have been having lately. Let us fight the issues out fairly. I do not care how hard honorable members hit, but let them keep above the belt. I hope that the Supply Bill will bo passed as soon as possible. </para>
