Nothing has yet been done in regard to the matter, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> promised me that he would cause an investigation to be made at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that there has been a cessation of work at the western end of the railway, and I deeply regret the fact. I am not aware that anything the Government have done has caused this cessation of work. All I know is that the work is there for the men to go to, and that those who are engaged in pick and shovel work are striking against the wage of 12s. 6d. a day. I desire to add that the Government have substantially raised the wages of the men over and above those they were receiving during the time of our predecessors. We desire to deal with the men fairly, and, on the other hand, I think they ought to be prepared to deal fairly with the Government. I do not think that, in the circumstances, they were justified in dropping their tools, and leaving their work before the matter could be investigated. </para>

Private contractor control would appear to be an excellent thing. </para>

I admit all the disadvantages of distance and: isolation, and that is all being expressed in the price we pay, as well as in the matters we take to them in the shape of comforts of various kinds. Honorable members would be a little surprised if they knew all the things we are trying to do in looking after the welfare of these men.

                        <para>- It is not a fact that there are 1,000, or anything like 1,000, fewer men employed at the Federal Capital than when the present Government took office. The fact is that the Military College, which has already cost £177,000, and has nothing whatever to do with the establishment of the Federal City, has now been completed, and the men engaged upon the construction of the College have gone off their labour. The present stage of the Capital City construction is, as my predecessor will understand, in the engineering period, and at the last date on which I took the figures for the information of the honorable member for West Sydney there were more men employed on engineering works in the Federal Territory than there were when the present Government took office. </para>

                        <para>- I. have reason to believe that a Navigation Act is still on the statute-book. Since we have been in office, the regulations have been pressed forward and furthered. An advertisement has already been inserted in the newspapers for the appointment of a Director of Navigation, and the matter of staffing the Central Office has received attention. The Act cannot be proclaimed until the regulations have been properly drafted and submitted to the consideration of the authorities contemplated by the Act itself. At this stage, I can give no idea as to the date on which the Act can be proclaimed. </para>

                            <para>- Would it be possible to have five of these Returning Officers in Tasmania, by reducing, say, the number in the States, so that one man would run a city like Adelaide and two men a city like Melbourne, or a city like Sydney ? In that way, there could be five men in the State of Tasmania, and only seventy would be wanted in all. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the conditions in Tasmania are very much simplified owing to the conterminous character of the boundaries of the State and Federal electorates. In addition, they already have one roll for Tasmania. I wish we could have the same conditions applying all over Australia. It would simplify matters very much. We submitted the whole question to the late Premiers' Conference, but I think they did not deal with it favorably. I cannot promise to take any of the seventy-five of these officers away in order to give Tasmania five. If Tasmania is to get five on her own account, it will mean the appointment of five more than are at present contemplated, and our advices are that it is not necessary to do this in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is hardly fair to characterize what happened as victimization. Questions were raised as to whether a certain letter had been sent out. A conference was held with some of the manufacturers, and information was given. Inquiries were made from the different States, but the replies that we received did not indicate victimization. If the honorable member would like to see them, I shall make them available to him or to the House generally. There was certainly nothing done which would justify the Government in instituting proceedings for a breach of any existing law. </para>

                            <para>- That is another point.. The honorable member is asking with regard to a question of policy. With regard to the other point, I must be fair, and say, as a Minister, that there are differences of opinion upon the question. As regards the general quality of all the Australian leaf that has been produced, evidence shows that parts of Australia can grow a magnificent quality of leaf, and, in fact, are growing it. The scheme of the duties undoubtedly was imposed by Parliament with a view to the encouragement of the Australian-grown leaf and its utilization in Australian manufactures. The question of whether the existing duty is or is not satisfactory is a matter that could be inquired into by the Inter-State Commission. </para>

                        <para>- During the few months we have been in office we have expedited matters as much as possible, and have appointed a Director and central staff and other officers. But no attempt was made by our predecessors to approach the Governments of the States in regard to the remission of the light dues upon the transfer of the control of the lighthouses to the Commonwealth. Consequently, we put before the State Premiers, when we met them in conference the other day, the desirability of their Governments relieving the shipping of the Commonwealth of taxation to the extent of the expenditure of which we were relieving them. </para>

We propose to treat contractors much in the same way as the Victorian Government, for example, treats private activities in this State with regard to railway carriage. In addition to the three works which I have named, for which one contract is being called, tenders will also be asked for immediately for the construction of the main sewer, which will be a big work. I understand that tenders will be invited within a week. </para>

                    <para>- On receipt of the telegram, inquiries were made by telegraph in Brisbane and Sydney, and I think that a letter is now in the post informing the honorable member of the result of the investigations of the Department. It was discovered that the maize imported into New South Wales gave no indication of the presence of the pest, though signs of the moth were found in some of the sacks in which the maize had been imported into Queensland. This maize was emptied out of the sacks, and closely examined by the State authorities. The bags were subjected to treatment, and every precaution was taken to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth, to prevent the pest from getting into the country. </para>

                    <para class="block">Before dealing with the political questions covered by the Governor-General's Speech, I desire to express my regret at the approaching departure of  His Excellency  from Australia.  His Excellency  has discharged the duties of his high and dignified office with credit to himself, and I am sure, with a great deal of benefit to the people of Australia. Socially,  His Excellency  and his good lady have been extremely popular, and they will be much missed. Although Lord Denman is severing his official connexion with Australia, I feel sure that he will not cease to speak and work in its interests when he returns to the Old Land, and that we shall find that, although not immediately connected with us, he still has at heart the well-being and advancement of Australia. My sincere wish is that every happiness and prosperity shall be the lot of  His Excellency,  his good lady, and his family. I wish now to express my appreciation of the honour which the Government have conferred upon me by assigning to me the duty of submitting this motion. I regard it as a compliment, not only to myself, but to my constituents. My experience of honorable members justifies my anticipation of their forbearance while I deal very briefly with the questions covered by  His  Excellency's Speech. I ask for their forbearance, since I have, unfortunately, a very bad cold. We are told that a cold always attacks the weakest spot, and it is, perhaps, because of this tendency that the cold has settled in my head. I need not concern myself, at the present time, with the opening clauses in  His  Excellency's Speech. They deal with matters that were the subject of considerable debate last session, and they speak for themselves to-day. It is not my desire to utter one word that will unduly extend the debate on this motion. We have heard repeatedly during the recess that the last session of the Commonwealth Parliament was barren of results. That taunt has constantly been hurled at us by members of the Opposition, and, in the circumstances, we felt that it was absolutely necessary that the House should be given an early opportunity to retrieve its position. </para>

I am not a glutton in the matter of dissolutions and elections, and I always contend that the man who prates about his anxiety to go before his constituents at a general election is a good deal of a humbug. Passing by the first four clauses in the Governor-General's Speech, I come to that relating to the Conference of State Premiers which closed only a few days ago. For the first time, so far as I am aware, in the history of such gatherings, the State Premiers in conference were approached in a truly Federal spirit by the Commonwealth Government. </para>

The Commonwealth Government approached the Conference of State Premiers with a full recognition of the importance of State rights, fully conscious of the fact that the States existed, and were doing a useful work before Federation was thought of, and that they had made it possible for the. Commonwealth to be created. As the result of the attitude adopted by the Commonwealth Government, the Conference was fruitful in achievements the like of which had never been even nearly approached before. </para>

                            <para>- I shall endeavour, a little later on, to show what the Conference has made it possible for this Parliament to do. One of the questions discussed by it was the transfer of the State debts, and if as a result of the Conference a solution of that difficult problem can be arrived at an enormous saving will be secured to the people of Australia. I trust that honorable members will throw no obstacle in the way of such a happy consummation. The position of the Commonwealth Bank was also the subject of discussion at the Conference. I have always held that the true function of the Commonwealth Bank is to transact the whole of the banking business of the Commonwealth and State Governments, including the flotation, redemption, and conversion of loans. It appears to me that the offer made by the States to transfer its current accounts to the Commonwealth Bank in exchange for the small savings bank business which that institution is now carrying on is a very liberal one, and I think we ought to embrace it without demur. The honorable member for Darwin will agree with me to a very large extent on this question. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is an authority on these questions, and I may say, in passing, that I would take his advice on business matters as readily as I would that of any other member of the Opposition. The question of a uniform railway gauge was brought before the Conference of State Premiers, and 1 hope that the action taken will lead to a uniform gauge for Australia. We, as practical men, know that the longer we defer dealing with this question the greater must be the cost. I have long entertained the idea that the laying down of a third rail would be one means of getting over the difficulty of securing uniformity without going to the heaVy expense of laying down new tracks. Before the matter is finally settled, some such scheme may be evolved. In any event, I am convinced that, action must be taken in the near- future to deal with the question. Reference is made in  His  Excellency's Speech to the agreement arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia in regard to the use and control of the Murray waters. It would be incorrect, perhaps, to say that this has been a burning question for many years, but it has undoubtedly been a very important one. No one will deny that we shall be wise in endeavouring to conserve the thousands of millions of gallons of water which are annually allowed to escape into the sea. The scheme for dealing with the Murray waters will not only give employment to thousands of men on a reproductive work, but will enable us to place at least an additional 500,000 settlers along that great river and its tributaries. In the succeeding paragraph of  His  Excellency's Speech we have reference to a subject which is certainly related to that with which I have just dealt. I refer to the statement that the Government hope to place before Parliament proposals for State and Commonwealth co-operation in regard to immigration. I have always maintained that this Parliament should have a hand in the work of immigration. The Commonwealth should select the immigrants and land them on our shores, first satisfying themselves that the States have made ample provision for their reception. Recently I saw a letter in the press, in reply to some arguments advanced as to the unsuitability of some immigrants for work on the land and their utter want of knowledge in this regard. That letter recommended that a training farm should be established in the Old Country; and while thoroughly agreeing with the idea, my opinion, is that such a farm should be established in each State here, in order to give our own boys an opportunity of learning what can be done with land. </para>

                            <para>- Those colleges are beyond average town boys; and I suggest a different plan. We know that there are tens of thousands of boys growing up in the towns every year without the slightest knowledge of what the land can produce or how to produce it. A great many of those boys, no doubt, desire to remain in the town, but numbers of them would, no doubt, be willing to go and work in the country if they knew how. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection brings me to the question of the high cost of living. Do honorable members think that' the cost of production can be increased day after day, and year after year, without the selling price of the article produced also being increased? Honorable members talk about " a decent wage ' ' ; and I suppose they think that if m'en were paid £10 a week for their work people should still be asked to sell their wheat for 2s. 6d. a bushel. -That is the way in which honorable members opposite talk because they do not happen to produce wheat. </para>

I notice that reference is made in  His  Excellency's Speech to the Inter-State Commission's Tariff inquiry. I have followed the evidence given before the Commission, and I am satisfied that it is going thoroughly into the questions placed before it. I hope that we shall soon be in possession of a progress report, which will enable this House to deal, partially at any rate, with a certain number of items, and place the industries of Australia on a thoroughly sound footing, having regard to the interests of the consumers as well as to the interests of the producers. ' The question of the development of the Northern Territory no- doubt suggests the need for a great deal of information and much thought to enable the Minister of External Affairs to deal with it in a satisfactory manner. I believe that at the present time that honorable gentleman is in possession of information which will enable him to place a policy before this House for the development of the Territory. It seems to me that the Northern Territory, like every other part of Australia, will have to be pioneered by the pastoralists. We shall have to supply those who enter into the pastoral industry ' there with means of conveying their produce to the seaports, and thence to the markets; and then, as they make progress, closer settlement will, no doubt, follow. As to the coming session, I trust that, if honorable members opposite desire to assist the Government in enacting laws to give effect to a good deal of the work done at the Premiers' Conference - to assist the Government in enacting laws for the benefit of Australia as a whole - they will early, indicate their desire. If, on the other hand, they are determined to fight the Government, then the. sooner they show that determination, and the sooner the "whole box and dice" of us go back to the people for fresh orders, the better I shall be satisfied, whether I am returned again or not. Thank goodness, I could live before I came to this Parliament, and I can live if I do not come back to it. We are, I believe, all anxious in our own particular way, and from our own points of view, to do the best for the people of Australia. There is no doubt a wide difference of opinion between the two sides of the House. Parties are very evenly balanced; and I should like to see the whole of us unite for about a couple of months peaceably to pass into law measures which would have the effect of affording employment and furthering the development of the country. </para>

                            <para>- We on this side claim to have the majority. The question of the initiative and the referendum was raised to-day by a notice of motion that was given; and if such a change could bring about a better state of affairs than was the case during last session I should welcome it. It appears to me, however, from the little experience' I had here last session, that, if the people issued a mandate, and that mandate did not please the majority in the House, it would not be carried out. If it were possible to have this House 'bound to carry out such a mandate under certain penalties, I should welcome the plan. I think I have taken up sufficient time; and, as I am not very well, the honorable member for Robertson, who is to follow me, has promised to deal with any' points I may have omitted to mention. </para>

I trust that the present session will be more fruitful in good work than the last, and that the feeling in the House will be kindly from start to finish. If we have to say hard things of each other's policy, we need not employ hard sayings to each other personally. I thank the whole of the House for the very kind hearing that has been given me. I have spoken with much difficulty; and I am sure I should have felt nervous but for the fact that in the past I have received so much consideration all round the chamber. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to second the motion, and I may say at the outset that I am quite prepared to deal with paragraph 3 of His Excellency's Speech. The previous speaker has been asked why he did not deal with that paragraph 3. I am quite prepared to deal with it, and * say what I believe it means. The function of .a Legislature is ,to put into concrete law the will' .of .the dominant  political  factor pf the day. When the previous Administration were in power, they brought in a law which put the people' of Australia in an entirely new political position.  No doubt, they thought they were doing that work as representing the dominant political factor of the day, but there are two things to be . considered when dealing with a question of this kind. The first is - has the dominant political factor actually expressed itself at the ballot box; the second is-r-is the party in power able to construe properly the will" of the dominant political factor? The position that has arisen in the Commonwealth is that the previous Administration, when in power, brought into operation a law altogether new to Australia, and one which was directly opposed to the principles of the British Empire and honest British fair play. </para>

                            <para>- The function of a Legislature is two-fold - administrative and legislative - and, to my mind, the administrative is the more important. I have often heard it said, " Let me write the songs of the people, and I care not who makes the laws." From our earliest childhood, we have seen the effects of administration. In the United States of America, the Courts are overriding the Legislature .every day&gt;' showing that an administrative act is always of more importance than legislation. However, what I wish to arrive at is this: Paragraph 3 of the Governor-General's Speech has a deep and significant meaning, not only for the House, but for all Australia, because it touches on the primary principles of the British Empire. The paragraph stands for British liberty and fair play. We on this side are striving for equality of the people in the eyes of the law, the fundamental principle on which British liberty is based; but it lay with the past Administration to deny to the people of Australia the operation of that fundamental principle. Another meaning in paragraph 3 is that we believe in equality of opportunity at the ballot-box. In fact, we believe in these two great forms of quality - equality in the eyes of the law, and  equality  pf opportunity at the ballot-box; and when we give the people these, there need be no further talk - and we hear it whispered here and there to-day - of social revolution. Never in the history of the world has there been social revolution of any moment where the people have had free expression of opinion at the ballot-box, and where they have been treated equally before the law ; and we on this side of the chamber stand all the time for liberty in those two respects. That is the meaning of paragraph 3; and when we go before the people, I at least shall be prepared to go on the platform and fight it from beginning to end. There are two other very important matters in the Speech ; one is the handling of our facilities, using the term in the broadest possible sense, as they exist to-day. There' can be no doubt that the Prime Minister, at the recent Conference of the Premiers of the States, went far towards putting us in a position to use to the very best advantage the facilities as they exist in Australia to-day. But we can go beyond that. When we come to deal with the development of our resources, it seems to me that any one who is in earnest need only look through the Speech of the Governor-General and see in three paragraphs - take paragraphs 9, 15, and 16 - that there has emanated from the present Administration what might truly be called a big Australian policy. If we look merely at the way in which the Government are prepared to handle the Commonwealth Bank, we see the difference between the present Administration and the previous. The previous Administration put up a skeleton with no life in it; but the present Prime Minister went to the Premiers' Conference and breathed life into the figure; so that all that now remains is to put it properly to work - the life is in it. We have done away with the pettifogging ideas of the previous Administration. The proposal now is to deal with the National Bank in a broad national manner, on a basis which is just and generous and vigorous, as should be the policy of a National Bank. Why need the National Bank of Australia go pettifogging round with savings which were well handled, and have been well handled for many years, by the States? Instead of that, the Prime Minister launched out and offered a vigorous policy, which the Premiers of the States, whether they were with us or against us, were quite prepared to accept. </para>

                            <para>- He arrived at something new, and that is the main thing; in fact, that is the difference between the parties. Honorable members opposite always offer things new, but never get there; whereas we do the new things - we arrive. That is the fundamental difference between the two parties. I do not wish to delay too long in this matter, but it seems to me that there are a couple of striking omissions from the Speech. There is no mention 'of our interests in the Pacific, and there is no mention of the Post and Telegraph Department. I sincerely hope that the Postal Department will be pushed on for all it is worth, because there is no matter of greater importance to country dwellers and those in the far-distant parts of the Commonwealth than the proper development of the post and telegraph system. </para>

That is why I strongly support, to the best of my ability, the Speech of the Governor-General ; because it puts forward a comprehensive policy for Australia - what we might call a big Australian policy; and it goes further, and gets down to the fundamental principles. We are going to stand for equality for all people in the eyes of the law, and equality of opportunity at the ballot-box, and upon these principles we are prepared to stand or fall. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish in a few words to refer to a matter that I have already brought under notice. The request of the Minister of Trade and Customs must be my excuse. I wish to inform the House, and through the House the Minister, of the exact position. Two shipments of maize have already been landed in Australia from South Africa, the bags being branded, I understand, " Maize, sound, clean, and good, from South Africa." A large portion of the shipments was landed in Sydney without any difficulty, and immediately went into consumption, but a portion of both shipments went to Brisbane, and in both cases the maize was condemned. The Minister has said that a few bags were condemned; but I think my information is correct - that the whole of the Brisbane shipment, amounting to over 1,000 bags, was condemned. It is futile for the Minister to say that a few bags only were found infested with cora moth. I saw three sacks landed which were simply infested with the cocoon unhatched of the moth, while I have  testimony  to the effect that on the wharf where the maize was landed the hot, moist, humid weather was hatching, out the moths by hundreds. These moths were finding their way all over the country. It is not a question of every precaution having been taken. The fact is that the maize has been landed in Sydney, while the very same shipment was condemned in Brisbane out of the same ship. It is impossible to imagine that the maize would be infested in Brisbane, and not equally infested in 'Sydney. Of course, they might not hatch out so quickly in Sydney, but the fact remains that there has now been landed in Sydney several thousand bags of South African maize infested with one of the most dangerous pests that can possibly affect the farmers of this country. </para>

                            <para>- This matter is entirely and absolutely in the hands of the Federal authorities. The State officers are simply acting in the Customs Department as quarantine officers for the time, and the State Departments are paid by the Federal Government for their work. My contention is that any future shipments of this produce should be absolutely prohibited in the interests of the farming community of the Commonwealth. I notice that shipments of maize are arriving from Java. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we are in .danger of the introduction of an equally insidious and dangerous pest with maize from Java. If the Ministerial party are as anxious to protect the farming community as they profess to be, the Minister will see that immediate steps are taken, not only to prevent the importation of maize from South Africa, but to cause the most careful investigation to be made with regard to the  shipments  expected from Java. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister and of the House to the question already raised by the honorable member for 'Kennedy with regard to the House sitting three days per week. The House has been sitting four days per week for some years past. No other Legislature in the world attempts to sit for the same length of time, and the reasons against it are many. In the first place, if Ministers are occupied with their duties in the House for four days a week, the control of administrative matters must pass from their hands into the hands of the officials, and it. is clearly the duty of Parliament to prevent this, whatever side is in power. If Ministers' time is taken up with administrative matters, they cannot be occupied at the same time with the legislative matters that have to be attended to while the House is sitting. With the House sitting for four days in the week affairs are frequently at a high tension, and this is very trying for the health of members. We saw that two members died last session, and probably the length of sittings had something to do with the fact. When we have been wrangling for a long time, the strain of the week's, work is too great upon members, and the only relief that they are able to get is by going out of the chamber and staying out during a large part of the debates. That, again, is not in the best interests of parliamentary government, because men ought to be able to sit here for the whole time. If we want to test how long men may devote themselves to intellectual work, we shall find that in all countries the amount of intellectual work men may do is limited in the bulk of instances, in the case of the law, at any rate, to something like five hours a day. A man is not, as a rule, able to give full attention to his work beyond that time. Of course, we know that there are exceptions, but I am taking the generality of cases. When men are sitting here every day, how is it possible for them to do what they should do in the direction of finding out whether similar legislation has been introduced in other countries, and what its effect is, and to give the benefit of the knowledge thus acquired to other members who have probably been engaged in other work? To enable us to do that, I think this House would be doing an excellent thing by adopting the three days of sitting per week, which is certainly as long as men should sit to attend <inline font-style="italic">-to</inline> their legislative work. We find that the best men devote something dike 'twenty-five hours, in (the whole 'week to judicial work. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This House might well take note of the fact, and revert to a sane procedure. If we sit too long, the effect is to delay instead of hasten legislation. A feeling of irritation is set up in the minds of men.. rendering them incapable of taking that sound and calm judgment of matters that certainly should be brought to bear on, legislative work. I think I am well within the mark in saying that practically two-thirds of the members on both sides of the House are thoroughly agreed that the House now sits too long. To adopt the usual hours will cause no delay in legislation, but will distinctly encourage a quicker procedure. It will be to the advantage of every man in the House, and of the country, if the days of sitting are limited to three. I would ask the Government to take the matter into their early and serious consideration. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Werriwa with regard to the House sitting only three days a week. I desire to discuss with the Prime Minister a little matter affecting Tasmania. I cannot s.eewhy that State should- be deprived of its five Divisional Returning Officers simply because it is small. Napoleon was a little man, and yet he conquered Europe. Some of the greatest minds that Australia ever produced came from Tasmania. Tasmania is the mother of Australia, and why should it not get five Divisional Returning Officers? With regard to the* other States, let us take Brisbane as an instance. There will be three or- four constituencies in that city, and oner Divisional Returning Officer with a clerk could manage them. The same would apply to Adelaide; and then without having to increase the cost we could have five in Tasmania. The five divisions are; absolutely separate in Tasmania. Hobart is only one constituency, and the others? come' into the suburbs of Hobart. I want the Prime Minister to look into the matter, and see if he cannot put Tasmania, on the same- level as the other States. When I was there last there was a lot of ill-feeling; not alone on the Labour side, but on the side that -my honorable friend represents. In. fact, men whom I met said that, they did not consider the proposal was fair. I wired to the Prime Ministerpointing this out at the time, but I hoped' to see him later on, and had not the opportunity. I hope he will do justice to little Tasmania, not on account of heir weakness, but on account of the fact that all the States must be treated on an equality, and the cry must be justice to all. We must not give the big States the supreme control. </para>

                            <para>- It would not be possible to examine every grain of maize, or even to make any thorough general examination. The discovery of the moths in the bags is a very serious matter, and the whole of the shipment should have been destroyed. We are suffering in Australia from the introduction of pests in the past, and any Minister, whether Labour or Liberal, should be most careful, and even drastic, in dealing with these matters. There is not a pest in Australia to-day that cannot be traced to some particular importation, and laxity on the part of those who are administering matters at the time has permitted these pests to cause considerable damage to the whole of the farming community. The whole of the potato crop of Australia has been in certain years practically destroyed through the introduction, of a disease. The same remarks apply to the fruit-fly, and to a number of. other pests that have come in from time to time. The most drastic measures should be taken to prevent the introduction of this new pest, even though the destruction of forty shipments of maize might be necessary. Should the pest get a footing in the country, it would seriously affect the locally-grown maize, and at the present time we have to go to a great deal of expense to keep down the weevil pest. I did not know that maize was imported into this country. Certainly no other crop grows more luxuriantly here, and enormous yields of maize have been obtained in almost every part of the Commonwealth. Every endeavour should be made to prevent the introduction of pests, and infected shipments should be destroyed. The pest in question is very minute, and could not easily be detected by the examination of a few samples of grain. Coming to another matter referred to by the honorable member for Werriwa, the suggestion that we should sit fewer days per week, I would point out that. this. Parliament sits more hours a day, and more days a week, than any other in Australia. The length of our sittings, and the consequent strain imposed on the first occupant of the chair, was largely responsible for his death, which was a disaster to the Commonwealths When I occupied the chair I was at the end of the session in a state of health which made it very painful to continue my duties, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will bear me out in the statement that each week the fourth day's sitting is a great trial, and that the occupant of the chair is then in a state in which it is very difficult for him to do justice to the position. Further, the sittings of Parliament being extended over four days, Ministers have not the opportunities which they should have for administrative work, and there is a danger that they may be forced into becoming mere automata for the approval of the decisions of the permanent heads of the Departments. It would be better for the work of the House, as well as the administration of the Departments, if we sat only three days a week. There is a general impression abroad that a member's work is confined to attending the sittings of the House ; but, as a matter of fact, five-sixths of it is done out of the Chamber. There is nothing more tiring and exhausting than the examination of documents and statistics to obtain the information with which members have to prime themselves to do justice to the work of Parliament. In addition, they have an enormous correspondence to attend to, some of them having to deal with more than 100 letters a week on the average. In the interests of good government, and of the health of members, we should sit only three days a week. </para>

                        <para>. - The attention of the Minister having been drawn to the danger of the importation of pests from South Africa, I hope that he will take immediate action to provide proper preventive measures. There are in South Africa a number of pests which are not yet established in Australia,one of them affecting wattle bark. which is imported here. We have suffered a great deal from the introduction of pests, unwittingly or innocently. Rabbits, foxes, and other animals have done a great deal of mischief, and there are in addition all the insect and other pests which have been brought here. I hope that the Ministry will carefully consider how the introduction of pests can best be prevented, and will give special consideration to the pests likely to he introduced by the importation of wattle bark. </para>

                        We have been informed by the Minister of Trade and Customs that of a shipment of maize half that was landed at Sydney was found to be free from corn moth, and the other half, which was landed at Brisbane, was found to be infected. I take it that the inspection in Sydney was lax. That reveals a very serious position. If laxity in the examination of one importation can be proved, it may obtain generally, and under a lax system we do not know what pests may not be introduced. It is not likely that only that portion of the maize which was landed in Brisbane was affected by the corn moth. The chances are that the whole shipment was infected, but that the pest was not discovered in Sydney because the examination there was lax. The officials who have been guilty of laxity should be brought to book by the Minister. The farmers of Australia have already enough to do to make ends meet, and we do not want to add to their burden. The honorable member for Gippsland laughs at that, although, in his district, there are very large growers of maize, and they are much interested in this matter. It is no laughing matter to the farmers about places like Orbost. They are anxious that there should be the most thorough examination of all importations. It surprises me that maize is imported into Australia, seeing how much we produce. I trust that the Minister will not rest content with the explanations that he has received from his officials, and that he will order a further investigation to ascertain who is to blame. As to the suggestion that we should sit only three days a week, I would say that were we sitting in a chamber that was properly ventilated we might, perhaps, well sit four days.

Probably Victorians have more time than they to deal with their correspondence. I trust that the Prime Minister, when framing the sessional orders, will give consideration to the request that has come from both sides that we shall sit on only three days a week. Reference has been made to the great losses of last session. The honorable gentleman did me a good turn in providing me with a three weeks' spell at a time when, owing to the labor- kms nature of the work, I badly needed it.

                        <para>.- I had no intention of addressing the House this afternoon, and I have never before offended in connexion with a motion for adjournment, but I wish to reply to certain reflections which were made upon me deliberately by the honorable member for Ballarat. Gippsland is practically the only maize-growing constituency in Victoria, and has produced the best average yield of maize obtained anywhere in the world, a yield of 60 bushels to the acre. I did not laugh, as the honorable member for Ballarat suggested, at the introduction of a new maize pest, because I know that the producers of this country have already quite enough pests to deal with; what occasioned my smile was the honorable member's statement that we did not want to put any further burdens on the producers. I smiled at the idea of honorable members opposite attempting to lighten the burdens of the farmers. The possibility of the introduction of a new pest is too serious a thing for any one to smile at. I am surprised that the maize which has been referred to was allowed to enter the country. It may be that when the maize was being unloaded in Sydney the pest was in an undeveloped stage, in which it was too minute to discover, and that it developed on the journey to Brisbane. The Customs authorities in Sydney may be  to blame, but probably the honorable member for Brisbane himself could not have detected the pest in the Sydney shipment. </para>

                            <para>- It is only a circumstance. Notwithstanding what the honorable member for Gippsland has said, it seems to me that the inspection must have been very lax, and that, if the larvae existed in the maize, the inspector should have been able to detect them. The incident is but another illustration of the many faults arising from dual control - a matter to which I have had to refer on previous occasions. The honorable member for Kennedy has said that the officers concerned should be brought to book for the laxity displayed by them. I would remind him, and the House, however, that they are employed by the State. If any action were taken by the Commonwealth, they would snap their fingers at us, just as some of the State officers do in connexion with Commonwealth public works, and the States would probably condone anything done by them in this direction. Even if it were proved conclusively that the larvae existed in the maize when it was landed at Sydney, and that if ordinary precautions had been taken their presence could have been detected, the officers would find plenty ready to support them in their previous contention that no larvae could be found. This is a very serious question, affecting not merely the districts  around  Sydney and Brisbane, but the whole farming community of Australia. Honorable members opposite who profess to represent the farmers are responsible for every pest with which the farmer has to contend from the Chinese to the kanaka; the prickly pear to the rabbit.

                        <para>. - The statement just made by the honorable member for Hume that the State inspectors could not reasonably be expected to detect the presence of microbes or the existence of certain pests or diseases in grain has occasioned me a good deal of surprise. If it is too much to expect of these officers then why are they employed? If there is any country whose exports of produce and live stock should be subject to the closest scrutiny, it is South Africa, and the very fact that this maize had come from South Africa should have induced the officers concerned to make a most minute inspection of it. We have in this instance another illustration of the way in which the Labour party, which is said to be a menace to the farmer, is prepared to' come to his rescue, while those who claim specially to represent him, remain silent. </para>

                            <para>- There is not a ventilator or window in the wall which separates this chamber from the Queen's Hall, one of the largest in the building. Surely if a hole were knocked in it the ventilation would be improved. I have been fairly regular' in my attendance, and always desire to hear the debates, hut I have made up my mind that, unless the ventilation of the chamber is improved, much of my parliamentary work shall be done outside. Is it to be said that we have not in Australia engineers capable of improving the ventilation of the building? I think that the vitiated atmosphere has a good deal to do with the bad temper that is sometimes displayed. Anything that would tend to improve the health of honorable members would be a step in the right direction. I understand that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have charge of this matter, and I hope that efforts will be made at once to deal effectively with it. </para>

                        <para>.- The question which has been raised in regard to the importation of maize infected with corn moth is one of the greatest gravity. Every precaution should certainly be taken to keep any new pests from Australia, for, it is beyond cavil that any pest which exists elsewhere will certainly flourish here. I should like, however, to ask my honorable friend who has raised this question what else the Government could have done. The moment the discovery was reported to the Minister he issued instructions that every precaution should be taken, and the most complete efforts made to deal with it. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite apparent that I do not know half as much about maize as some of my honorable friends opposite. I desire to say, once for all, that the Government ought to take every step possible to prevent these diseases coming to . Australia. If my honorable friends opposite can suggest any better regulation - any better method of inspection, or any more competence in dealing with the matter - I hope they will do so. We shall consider any suggestions made, and, if practicable, put them into operation at the earliest possible moment. In this case, apparently, the best has been done in the circumstances; and the officers concerned, who for this purpose are our officers, were thought the best men who could he put in control by the predecessors of the present Ministry. As both sides concur in the arrangements made as the best possible we may fairly conclude that the machinery is as good as any that could be thought of by those best able to advise. As to the days of sitting, I am becoming apprehensive of a general strike in this Chamber; and I am afraid it looks like a strike with conspiracy behind it. Honorable members on both sides are in agreement on this very important matter ; and it looks very suspicious. As honorable members will have observed, instead of moving the usual motion relating to the days of sitting, I purposely postponed it with a view to considering the whole circumstances. </para>
