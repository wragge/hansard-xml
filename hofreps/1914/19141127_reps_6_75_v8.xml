                        <para>- It is difficult to give such preference by a Tariff measure. We have no means of ascertaining the industrial conditions obtaining in Canada in regard to goods manufactured there and exported to Australia. But any preferential trade treaty or agreement which may be proposed must be assented to by Parliament before it can have effect, and this will give the honorable member aud others an opportunity to deal with the phase of the question that he has* mentioned, which I consider very important. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that some of the German officials, who have been taken to Sydney as prisoners of war, are being accommodated at the expense of the Government at the Hotel Australia and the Hotel Metropole? If such is the case, having regard to the treatment of British subjects in Germany, does the right honorable gentleman not think it advisable to put those officials to some useful employment, and see that the money at present expended in their upkeep is applied to assisting the wives and families of men who have gone to the front"? </para>

                                <para>- The facts are that the question of the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was under discussion at the time of the elections, and for some time prior to that, but we deemed it to be our duty to make no re-appointment during the elections. We thought it fair to this House, and to the country, that that appointment, should be made by a Government who had established themselves in the confidence of the country by the vote of the people. In those circumstances we refrained from making the appointment. </para>

Then there appears a statement that the late Government intended to reappoint <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid for an extended term, the only  question being as to whether the re-appointment should be for three or five years. Three days after the general elections, when the late Government received notice to quit, a minute was written with the apparent object of committing the present Government to the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid. This is the only document in the file which refers to the extension of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's term to three or five years. </para>

Had I thought for one moment that the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid would come before the House in this way, and in these circumstances, there would not have been any question of his reappointment by the present Government. The appointment would have been made, and made secure, long ago. I would have taken care of that had I thought that the House would treat the matter in this way. What are the facts?. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid came out to pay a visit to Australia. </para>

I can tell the honorable member more. The matter was discussed in Cabinet, and the Cabinet decided that, in the circumstances, it would be more appropriate not to make an appointment at that time, but to leave the matter to whoever succeeded at the elections, and whoever should be in possession of the confidence of the country and of this House. That is the proper constitutional course to take in regard to all these high appointments. If we had been actuated by the motives suggested by the Assistant Minister o? Home Affairs, would we have taken the course we did ? If we had had prompting us the motives that came out in the bitter speech we have had from the Assistant Minister to-day, we would have taken good care to make the appointment secure, and put the matter out of the reach of the present Minister or any of those who are talking in the same way to-day ? </para>

That gentleman possessed the fullest confidence of the late Government, as, I believe, he possesses the fullest confidence of the whole of the people of Australia; notwithstanding some honorable members' interjections, and notwithstanding some bitter speeches that have been made, I would fain believe that he possesses the confidence generally of honorable members on both sides of this House. At any rate, that is my impression at the moment. I should be sorry to believe anything else. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid has been a good and faithful servant to Australia, and has done his duty by this country as well as any public servant could do it, and he well deserves re-appointment for a substantial period at the hands of this present Government. However, Ministers have taken their course, and re-appointed him for twelve months, a course which is not calculated to inspire him with the desire <inline font-style="italic">to do his best. I</inline> think that a man ought to feel secure in that position. If he is to do his duty properly by this country he should feel secure in his tenure. If there is any doubt about the matter, terminating the appointment would be better than keeping <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid on, not knowing what his fate is to be. </para>

                                <para>- Then I hope that what the Minister has said about the matter will preface the report, and the reason for the debate will then be understood. The Assistant Minister says that there was a minute put upon the file after the election. Does not the Assistant Minister know sufficient of these matters to know that it was the usual course to take? The proper thing is for the retiring Minister to leave minutes for the benefit of the incoming Minister concerning all big current questions being considered in the Department. </para>

                                <para>- What the minute referred to clearly shows is that the last Cabinet had been considering whether the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, when it was made, should be for three years 'or five years. It shows nothing more. It was the proper thing  to leave upon the papers of the Department a minute from the outgoing Minister, telling the incoming Minister what was in his mind regarding this high and responsible appointment, but the Assistant Minister sees in this action of his predecessor in extending this courtesy, and in following this constitutional propriety, some deep-laid political plot. By making these innuendoes and statements to-day the Assistant Minister is simply showing the suspicious character of  his  own mind. It would be very much better if he rid his mind of all such things. The outgoing Government did its duty by this country and by this House, and left to its successors, as it was entitled to do in the circumstances, the duty and privilege of making this high appointment for a further term. That is all there is in the matter. The Assistant Minister cannot make more of it, no matter how he rummages among the papers. With this statement I leave the matter. I think that it is due to the House that we should hear the Minister in charge of the Department. </para>

                            <para>. - As this debate has arisen upon a question submitted by me, it is only right that I should make some explanation. I met a dear friend of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, and a dear friend of mine, though he is opposed to me in politics, and he asked me, " Have <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's friends turned him down, seeing that they did not appoint him? " I said that I could not say. Whereupon he said, " I believe that they have done so. Will you ask the question ? " It is for this reason I put the question. I yield to no man in my friendship to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid. I dare say that if our hearts could be opened and read, it would be found that I am a better friend of his than even some who were in the late Ministry. When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking I interjected that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid had come out here last year. He returned to England early in March. I did not interject because of any desire to puzzle the Leader of the Opposition. I think the late Government treated <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid infamously. </para>

                                <para>- I shall communicate with the High Commissioner on the subject, but my impression certainly is that the late Government turned him down on the occasion of his visit to Australia last year, and treated him very badly. " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN</inline> (Angas) [11.18].- It is with regret that I find it necessary to discuss this matter in the House, since I do not know to what extent communications which have passed between the High Commissioner and myself are confidential. I have received correspondence from him, and have also had conversations with him, for- 1 think it is the duty of a Minister, quite independently of mere official matters, to have many chats with the officers of his department. _ <inline font-style="italic">So</inline> far as my memory serves me, the position is that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid visited Australia last  year, the Government which wo succeeded having given him permission io come. I confirmed that permission, and he came out on a trip which was originally suggested to him  by family considerations. While he was here we discussed various matters. He thought that it would be well to renew his familiarity with some of the aspects of Australian, life, and he therefore extended beyond the limits of his original intention his tour throughout Australia. Just before leaving for England he spoke to me about his re-appointment, and I think it is due to the House that I should say something about the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid wrote me a letter, on 3rd February last, and as it is not marked " private," I think I may quote from it. After he had mentioned that the result of his trip to the Continent had been absolutely satisfactory he referred to his tenure of office, and went on to say - </para>

                            <para>At the same time I wish to assure the Government that my own mind is entirely in harmony with the spirit of the Act, and that I should only continue to hold the office so long as I could continue to do so with credit to myself and advantage to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para class="block">He was explaining to me, for guidance as to future arrangements, that he thought he ought to have an early intimation as to whether his re-appointment was probable. I think that I had an informal chat with one or two of my colleagues on the subject, and came to the conclusion that it would be rather premature at that time to make a reappointment, and so to forestall any decision of the Ministry during the nine or ten months which would elapse before the original appointment expired. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid that I thought I ought to mention the matter to the Cabinet, because I considered that he should receive an assurance as to his position four or five months before his appointment expired. He was enjoying an income of over £4,000 a year when he took office as High Commissioner, so that he made a big sacrifice in accepting the appointment. He is now, 1 think, about sixty-seven or sixty-eight years of age, and if he came back to Australia it would be a very difficult matter for him to pick up again that practice which his abilities entitled him to command at the time he left here. He has occupied a position of distinction in England; he has been a big public man, and if he returned to the Bar here he could hardly hope to realize the income he enjoyed at the time of his departure. These are considerations which ought to weigh with us regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's reappointment, and while I thought that we ought not, as a rule, to make a re-appointment of such duration as to give rise to the assumption that there was only one man for the position, I considered that in his case the circumstances were very exceptional. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was eminently fitted for the office. He had discharged his duties excellently, and, in the circumstances, I considered that he should have a renewal of his appointment for some period to be determined by the Cabinet. </para>

                                <para>- I think not. Everything that is relevant, or official, is on the file. This was a personal letter addressed to me. I assured <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, after I had mentioned the matter informally to my col leagues, that it was too soon to come to any settlement on the question of his reappointment. About the same time, in answer to a quest-ion put to me in the House by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid had asked for an increase of salary, or for re-appointment, I said that the matter of re- appointment and of the adequacy of his allowance for expenses was under consideration, and that I believed the High Commissioner should receive fair notice of what his position would be. I did not go beyond that. After an informal chat with my colleagues I assured <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid that my conviction was that he would be re-appointed. I could not say exactly for what term, but I said that my feeling was that the only matter to be settled at a Cabinet meeting some months later was whether his re-appointment should be for three or five years. The dockets will show, I think, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid wrote to me recapitulating the fact that I had told him that the question to be determined, in my opinion, was what ought to be the duration of his re-appointment - whether it should be for three or for five years. There was a letter written by him to me in April last, which I can show the Minister, and I think there is a copy of it on the file, in which this statement is made. Circumstances occurred to prevent the re-appointment being made. I, personally, would sooner he had been re-appointed at once; but the dissolution took place, the war broke out, and it was difficult to get a full Cabinet meeting. I raised the matter in Cabinets, but there was not a full meeting, and soon after we went out of office. In order that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, pending the determination of the duration of his term, should not be prejudiced, I wrote to him, about June or July last, setting out what the facts were, and telling him that he might act on the assurance that he would be continued in office for at least a year, pending the settlement of the other question. </para>

I therefore wrote out a statement of the position before I left office. I did so, not to forestall the decision of Ministers, but merely to record what I knew was only partly recorded on the files. I did this with regard to other appointments. There was, for instance, the question of the appointment of an Administrator of Norfolk Island, which had not been absolutely settled. The re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murphy</inline> had not been absolutely settled, and I took the same steps with regard to him. Instead of making these appointments ourselves, as we were going out of office we left them open, but placed on record what Ave  should have done had we remained in office. </para>

                                <para>- I gave <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid' my personal impression, after having consulted my colleagues in order to test their feeling in the matter. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid that, though there was no decision, he might act on the assurance that the only question was whether the reappointment should be for the term of three or five years. That was in February, and it was too soon to determine the matter then; but later on in the year, in order that he might not be under any misapprehension, I told him that he might take it that he would certainly be in the position for another twelve months. The reason I did this was to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ge'orge</inline> to make necessary arrangements. I can assure the House that, when the last Government left office, the only question undetermined was whether the appointment should be for three or five years. </para>

                                <para>- There was never any name mentioned, or any application made by any one; the only doubt on the part of the Cabinet was whether we .should appoint any one for a further period of five years, or for ten years altogether. In order to guide the discretion of the Cabinet, I made inquiries as to the duration of appointments of similar officials for other countries, and I ascertained that while in Canada one appointment had been for eighteen years, in other places the terms were comparatively short. The question, therefore, was left over for decision; and a record of what took place was left by me when I left office. No one can say that that record was left with any idea of forestalling a decision which we, for some  sinister  motive, declined to make. </para>

                            <para>.- There seems to be a good deal of make believe this morning about the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues. One would get the impression that they were engaged in a high-minded endeavour to do the best possible for Australia in regard to this appointment, but it seems to me that they are extremely anxious lest the Government should follow the example that has been set by Liberal parties at all times. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's appointment was, without doubt, a political appointment. I do not agree with the ex-Prime Minister that it is impossible to find in Australia a man who can carry out the duties of the High Commissioner so well as does <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who, after all, is only a very clever after-dinner  speaker.  I do not think that the present High Commissioner fills the position as the business people of Australia would like it to be filled. </para>

                                <para>- I suppose we may take it it was by accident; and, no doubt, most of us carrY a lot of correspondence in our pockets. It is said that the contents of a man's pockets are a pretty good indication of the state of his brain, but I should not like my brain to be gauged by the amount or the diversified character of the correspondence which I carry. Some explanation is certainly required of why the ex-Minister of External Affairs, if he was " caught on the hop," happened to have so many of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's letters with him. It seems to me that there has been a deliberate attempt on the part of the members of the Opposition to raise the question at the very earliest moment with a view to endeavouring to secure <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid in his position, because of the fact that they have been " caught on the hop," as the previous Fisher Ministry was in regard to the Inter-State Commission. </para>

                                <para>- Any one would think that honorable members opposite had been suddenly informed of something of which they were not previously aware, although they have themselves been saying the same thing for months past. The previous Fisher Government made a great mistake in not appointing the Inter-State Commission before they left office. If there is anything in the contention of the ex-Minister of External Affairs that the wishes of an outgoing Government in regard to appointments, as set forth in memoranda or minutes, ought to be respected, why did the late Liberal Government not respect the wishes of the previous Fisher Government 1 </para>

                                <para>- I have observed, and it was not necessary for me to search through my files of correspondence in order to be able to discuss a matter that is one of common knowledge. What did honorable members do when in office in regard to the Inter-State Commission? Those high-minded gentlemen, who say that it is wrong to appoint a man of your own party to any position, did not give the present Attorney-General a seat on the Inter-State Commission, and thus accord to the great Labour party some representation on so important a body. There is no doubt that the present Attorney-General is a man perfectly well fitted for such a position, but the late Government ran to the Victorian Parliament, and selected a man of independent mind, who was a bit of a trouble to the honorable member for Balaclava. Here I may say that I think the honorable member for Flinders had a good deal to do with that appointment. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and other Liberal newspapers, of course, had much to say about the qualifications of a certain gentleman for the position; and certainly no one would deny the business capacity and integrity of that gentleman. But, nevertheless, it was a political appointment. </para>

                                <para>- Was it necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who appointed the Leader of the Opposition as a State Minister in New South Wales, to ask for his assistance in such a matter? When the Leader of the Opposition was " cornered " he had to admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid had written to the ex-Minister of External Affairs, and that the matter had been considered in Cabinet. I think members of the Opposition ought- to give up their endeavour to mislead the public in such a manner. However, I hope that the Government will not be deterred by any questions that may be raised by members of the Opposition, or any motions for adjournment, from doing what they consider to be their duty in this or any other matter. </para>

                            <para>.- So far as I can gather from the remarks of my amusing and esteemed friend, the honorable member for Capricornia, the idea he seeks to place before the House is that it is a very proper thing for the Government to make party appointments; and he concluded his remarks by saying that he hoped the present Government would not be induced, by anything the Opposition might do, to make the reappointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid for a longer period than that on which they had determined. When the question of the appointment of a High Commissioner was first before Australia, the name of my distinguished and gifted friend, the honorable member for Capricornia, was one of those assiduously placed in front as a suitable competitor for the office. </para>

If the honorable member still desires the position, we may, in the place of the prosaic and dull, and somewhat stupid, after dinner speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, have all the wit and eloquence of the honorable member at the disposal of the Australian people. I urge on the Government that the High Commissioner will be valuable or not according to the confidence which those at the other end of the world have in him. It does not matter how gifted, how able, and how well fitted for his work he may be, if he is held by the British people not to be <inline font-style="italic">'persona grata</inline> to the Australian people, he cannot give his true value to the Commonwealth. I ask honorable members, therefore, to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid is supported in the very able services that he is giving to Australia. I ask them not to make appointments to the High Commissionership that will be in any way political. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was recognised throughout Australia at the time as a man peculiarly fitted for the High Commissionership.  He was accepted universally, and during the three years that the last Labour Administration was in power, Ministers did not dare to attack the appointment, nor attempt to alter it. The term for which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was appointed is now coming to a close, and honorable members opposite have an opportunity to fill the office with some other person. If they appoint one of themselves, and take from the office a man so worthy of it, and so capable of doing such big things for Australia, they will prove themselves unworthy of the positions they hold, and will act detrimentally to the interests of the Australian people. </para>

                                <para>- My statement wa3 made with judicial calmness and without any desire to arouse animosity. The honorable member for Melbourne has been blamed for having raised this question, but during the last few days it has been referred to by several honorable members opposite. The facts relating to the reappointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid to the High Commissionership  were stated by me without comment. No member of this Government has aught but the highest admiration for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid personally, and it would ill become us to depreciate his long services in the public  life of Australia. Nor do I regard the remarks of the honorable member for Capricornia as depreciatory of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid as a public man. The honorable member had a right to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's appointment to the High Commissionership  was a political one. He had a right to thus draw attention to the hereditary incapacity of honorable members opposite to make appointments from any but their own ranks, and to their invariable practice of ignoring the claims of political opponents. </para>

Our friends opposite must shoulder the responsibility for this discussion - a discussion which is much to be regretted. The Government has dealt with the re-appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, as with other administrative acts, on the merits, and with just appreciation of the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid held in Australia as well as the reputation that he has won in Great Britain. </para>

I have given honorable members the facts as disclosed by the official files, and from these they can form their own conclusion. The central fact is that the late Government officially promised <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid to extend his term by twelve months. This Government, whether rightly or wrongly, considered itself bound by that promise, and regarding it so, we have literally given effect to it. </para>

                            <para>. - I concur in the expression of regret which has fallen from the Assistant Minister of External Affairs that this matter should ever have arisen in the House. I feel regret also that, in dealing with the matter, the Assistant Minister made such an uncandid and disingenuous statement. The matter first arose by way of a statement by the Prime Minister. Speaking from memory, the language which the right honorable gentleman used in making the announcement to the House was, that if the late Government had remained in office, the term of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid as High Commissioner would probably have come to an end. </para>

                                <para>- The Prime Minister himself lias said nothing whatever to justify the insinuation which he threw out against the late Government, but has thrown on the Assistant Minister of External Affairs the obligation of making good that statement. Now, the Assistant Minister has not only taken the foundation from under the statement made by the Prime Minister, but he has gone further.  His  statement, and the minute3 and documents which he read, show that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was guaranteed at least as much as the present Government are giving him. Therefore the statement made by the Prime Minister, which conveyed  to this House that the present Government were giving <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid a year's extension of his term, but if the late Government had remained m power his term would probably have come to an end, is disproved by the language in those papers. It is of very little moment to ane,. and I feel sure it is of very little moment to any member of the late Ministry, whether honorable members on the Government side accept the assurances which we give them or not, but the ex-Prime Minister has given an assurance to the House that the only question ever debated by the late Cabinet with regard to the extension of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's term of office was as to whether the extension should be for a period of three years or five years. I desire to indorse, not only that statement, but also the other statement, that from the moment when this matter was first mentioned in Cabinet to the time of the late Government leaving office, there was no mention or suggestion, direct or indirect, of the possible appointment of anybody except <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid. </para>

                                <para>- I am not here to speak an eulogium of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid or anybody else, but I cannot help saying that I believe that the expectations which were entertained practically unanimously by this House at the time of his appointment have been more than fulfilled. And it seems to me that the extension of his appointment for one year is a circumstance that gives rise to grave apprehension that the appointment will not be extended for more than one year. I would remind the Prime Minister that during the whole of last year the political situation was disturbed, not only by the election, which commenced in July, but, as he knows, and as we have been often told, the late Government were challenging the general opinion of the country, and were bringing forward matter on which the country was to decide whether the party  that is now in power or ourselves should control the machinery of government. I ask the Prime Minister to say whether, in those circumstances - not merely during an election, but during a period when the Government were deliberately challenging the opinion of the country, it would have been proper on our part to bind those who might be- our successors, by an appointment of this character. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is wrong. The appointment of the Inter-State Commission was made almost immediately after we returned from the- polls, having obtained the sanction of the country. It was months after that appointment that a critical position arose, and the late Government decided, rightly or wrongly - the country says wrongly - to challenge the whole question of political control. I ask the Prime Minister to say whether, if he had been in the place of the honorable member for Parramatta, he would, at any time during the previous year, have taken the responsibility of making an appointment of the High Commissioner for three or five years ? I think it is fair to ask the Prime Minister whether, whilst the whole political position was in the melting-pot, and the Government were about to consult the opinion of the country, he would not, had he been in our place, have adopted the same attitude, and said, " In these circumstances, we do not feel entitled to anticipate the verdict of the country, and to bind those who may be our successors in the Government." </para>

                                <para>- I do not object to the Prime Minister making any supposition he chooses, but what I say is that his public statement, having regard to his position, and the fact that he had the papers before him, was calculated to convey to the public the idea that he believed that if we had remained in office <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid's term of office would have expired by effluxion of time at the end of this year, and would not have been renewed. I do not think that honorable members can say that that is an unfair statement. The Prime Minister has not done anything to substantiate his insinuations, but has left that indication to the Acting Minister of External Affairs, and the House may now judge the extent to which that has been done. Honorable members have heard the absolute assurance of every Minister of the late Government who has spoken on this matter, that there was no other person's name mentioned, and no thought of any other person being appointed; that reappointment for an extended period was under consideration, that we were considering whether the term should be three or five years, that we did not feel ourselves capable honorably of binding those who might be our successors, by making the re-appointment until after the general elections; and that after the elections the re-appointment would have been made. I conclude by expressing the hope that an appointment to what, after all, is in some respects the highest and most important office to which we can appoint anybody, will not be made simply the prey of party politics. </para>

                        </continue><para>Mi-. WEBSTER (Gwydir) [12.14].- I always listen with interest to the honorable member for Flinders when a question of this character arises, because I do not think he has any equal in Australia as a special pleader. He confuses the point at issue all the time by the constant repetition of some other issue which is altogether foreign. However, the honorable member could not remove this fact, which is the main factor in the case, that the ex-Minister of External Affairs acknowledged that, through him, when they were in power, the late Government had decided, and had intimated to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, that he could rely on his term of office being extended for at least twelve months. That <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid could at least rely on his term being extended for twelve months was in the minds of members of the late Ministry when they were in office, but when political exigencies altered the position, and they found themselves deprived of office, the twelvemonths' idea dropped out, and the honorable member for Angas suddenly realized that the virtues of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid entitled him to an appointment for at least three or five years. Why did nob the Cabinet, of which the honorable member was the mouthpiece in that minute, sign the minute when they decided what is set out in it? Why did they not sign it before the elections? They could have done so. By not having done so they permit the inference to be formed that,, if they came back to office after the elections, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid would be reappointed for twelve months; but that if <inline font-style="italic">they</inline> did nob continue in office they would kindly suggest bo their successors that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid should be kept in office for three or five years, until, possibly, they might come back again to office, and be in a position bo appoint  one of their own crowd. </para><interjection>

Without a doubt, the late Government had in their minds the making of a comfortable position for a member of their Ministry. No doubt it was the honorable member for Swan they had in their mind to appoint, had they been returned bo power-. 4'hat is why the ex-Minister of External Affairs indicated an appointment for twelve months only, but after the elections were over honorable gentlemen, including the honorable member for Flinders, pub their signature bo a minute recommending what the Government never intended prior to the elections. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member did so in the sophisticated way to which he is prone, but which is not satisfactory to one who seeks an intelligent reply. This matter is only another example of the manner in which the party opposite adhere to the policy of spoils to the victors. Nob only are they prepared to give these spoils when they are in power, but, even when they are out of office, they endeavour to compel another Government to give them to their party. This question should not have been brought forward, because, to some extent, it will undermine the importance of the  office  of the High Commissioner. I have not said that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid is not specially fitted for the position. </para>

                                <para>- I might have, but possibly I might have been looking forward to getting on some other stage. The honorable member for Flinders said that if they would only remove me from the stage he would remember it all his life. They were even going to send the honorable  member for Balaclava to my electorate, but he was told that I was " dead meat." Had they sent the honorable member to my district, my majority would have been doubled. I hope that this is the last time that a Government on leaving office will attempt to dictate to those who are succeeding it as to what should be done in the best interests of the country. </para>

                            <para>. - I was rather surprised at the absolutely cruel and unfounded accusation made by the honorable member for Capricornia. I think that sufficient answer to his accusation, and also the imputation made by the honorable member for Gwydir, will be found in the remarks made by the present Assistant Minister of External Affairs on the occasion of the departure of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid from Australia, on the 27th January, 1910. He then said - </para>

                                <para>- The extract has been made within the last half -hour. I am; surprised at the Assistant Minister attempting to repudiate it. Four years ago, speaking on behalf" of the whole of his party, he said that if the House had been called upon to elect the High Com-, missioner the choice of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid would have been practically unanimous, and yet he now appears to repudiate his words. We all know that when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was appointed the appointment was approved of almost unanimously in the House, and throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I have no Intention of suggesting that a political job is to be perpetrated, but, after the lapse of five years, one or two individual members in an irresponsible way are making that suggestion. </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall not occupy many minutes in discussing this matter. I probably should have taken no action, but that, rightly or wrongly, I felt yesterday that I was subjected to a complete humiliation which I did not in the least deserve. I desire this morning to refer te the facts in the hope that the matter may be cleared up once and for all. It arose from my taking objection to a statement by the Attorney-General, which I regarded as a gross reflection upon the Courts outside. It is a well-known rule of Parliament that we may not reflect on Courts of justice in the performance of their duty. When, therefore, the Attorney-General said that one of the reasons for the introduction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was to prevent the Court doing a stupid act of injustice, I regarded that remark as a grave reflection, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and called your attention to it. But because the point of order was not taken with lightning speed, you held that I had no right to raise it. You said that considerable debate had ensued, and went so far as almost to suggest that you did not accept my word. </para>

Coming to the question as to what time elapsed between the making of the remark objected to, and my calling attention to it, I find that jb allowed a rapid  speaker  in this House to utter forty-seven words, and even they were in the nature of a dialogue between two honorable members. In these circumstances, therefore, not more than a third of a minute could have elapsed. I said yesterday that a minute had elapsed, but you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> controverted my statement, and said that considerable argument had ensued. Here is the fact - that forty-seven words were uttered by a rapid  speaker  between the making of the remark objected to and my calling attention to it. I do not know what we are going to do in this House; it seems that we shall have to spring like cats to our feet when we wish to raise a point of order. Then, again, what naturally led to some feeling on my part was the fact that while you would net permit me to take a point of order, yon allowed the Attorney-General himself to make a personal explanation concerning the very same matter. Altogether I considered myself to be very unfairly treated. You laid down the rule that words to which exception is taken must be taken down by the  Clerk.

The words to which I objected were not such as are contemplated by this standing order. The standing order refers to offensive wor,ds spoken of one honorable member by another. It does not relate to an ordinary point of order taken concerning some reflection made in this House upon a Court of judicature outside. I submit&gt; therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that your ruling was entirely wrong in the circumstances, and that I suffered a grave injustice not only as to the ruling itself, but also as to the circumstances and facts concerning the whole question. I do not desire, however, to provoke any debate. That is not my purpose. My point is done with now; but I feel that I was' justified in calling attention to these facts, and in pointing out that I was properly entitled to raise the point of order in order to prevent the Attorney-General, of all others, making such a reflection upon a Court of justice. </para>

                        <para>- Does any honorable member desire to speak to the motion ? As there seems to be no wish to debate it I should like to say, in the first place, that although the Leader of the Opposition seems to feel aggrieved, I took the action that I did yesterday because at the time I believed it my duty to take it. I can assure the right honorable member that there was not the least! desire on my part to subject him to any injustice, and that lie will have exactly the same opportunity to discuss any matter before the House as is afforded every other honorable member. ^ I "have 'had probably as much experience as has any honorable member of the exercise of the closure, and of resort to other expedients to curtail debate, and I can assure the House that no one will more 'zealously guard the rights and privileges of honorable members than I shall do. In my political career, extending over twenty-two years in the State aud Federal Parliaments, I have always striven to preserve the rights and privileges of honorable members, and I should, therefore, be sorry if the right honorable member thought that the action which I took last night was due to any desire on my part to curtail debate. Unfortunately, almost from the inception of this Parliament, it has been the habit to interject freely across the Chamber, and some very insulting interjections are sometimes made. When I was on the floor of the House, I was in this respect, perhaps, no better than any one else, but it must be realized that the practice is improper, and honorable members must refrain from it. </para>
                    </talk.start></continue><para class="block">My ruling last night was based on standing order 281, which provides that words to which exception is taken shall be taken down by the  Clerk.  That course has been followed in other Parliaments, although it has not been the practice in this Parliament to take them down. Under the immediately preceding standing order, au honorable member who is addressing the Chair, may not be interrupted except (1) to request that his words may be taken down, (2) to call attention to a point of order or privilege suddenly arising, or (3) to call attention to the want of a quorum. These are the only exceptions. I think that action is necessary to prevent interruption, and I quote this standing order with a desire to indicate what I intend to do. If the House decides that I must follow precedent, I shall do so, but, if on the other hand, it considers that I should continue upon the new course I have laid down, I shall certainly do so. </para><continue>

                        <para>- I am sure of that. In my judgment there has been a complete breakaway from the understanding in both Houses as to what the composition of the Committee was to be. If there was one thing made clear, it was that it was to be a non-party Committee, composed of equal numbers from either side. This is recognised fully in the case of the unpaid Committee; and the fact seems to me to emphasize and place the Prime Minister's present action in a very strong light. The Prime Minister has left the chamber, but I have to say that I have never known a Committee of this kind to be set up without some indication being given of the work to be undertaken by it. In the present case there is not the slightest indication of the kind : and I should like to know whether the Government have in their-mind any work on which the members of the Committee may earn their honest pay. </para>

                        <para>- What is the use of talking like that ? Surely we ought to know whether the Government are going to waste the taxpayers' money in setting up a huge piece of machinery to do nothing. It is not necessary to ask what the late Government were going bo do or were nob going bo do. The pre.sent Government are responsible for their own actions, and I desire to know whether they have in view any result that this Committee may accomplish. The appointment of the members of the Committee will mean  nothing  unless a secretary has been appointed, offices secured, and all the other necessary arrangements made. I ask the  Minister  of Trade and Customs, in the absence of the Prime Minister, whether this has been done? </para>

I am pointing out that before the Committee can do anything there must be plans and so forth submitted to the House; and I should think that the secretary of the Commission would have something to say in this connexion. Have the Government any public works projected ? </para>

We ought, however, to know what we 'are launching ourselves into, be cause it is virgin ground that we are breaking, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. The Prime Minister simply submits a motion containing certain names, and that is not all he is required to do. The procedure laid down in the Act is definite and intelligible enough, but we have not had a word from the Prime Minister in this regard. </para>

                        <para>- An amendment made by the Senate prevented absolute equality, but it was intended that the representation of the two political parties in Parliament should be as nearly equal as possible. During the discussion, the honorable member for Henty gave us the benefit of his experience in the Victorian Parliament, and argued strongly that both parties should be equally represented. Speaking on the matter when the Bill had come back from the Senate, I made these remarks, which will be found on page 4793 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report for 1913 - </para>

                        <para>- M.y statement holds true of New South Wales at the present time. Matters of national importance should be kept above party consideration. Each side should select its own representatives, and the representation should be, as nearly as possible, equal, so that the Committee should have no party complexion. But what did honorable members do before they consulted us in regard to the composition of this Committee ? My honorable friends on the other side had their own caucus. They selected their own nominees, and then they told us what they had done, and said, "Here are two positions for you, if you like 10 take them." That is far removed from the whole atmosphere of the Bill when it was being placed on the statute-book, and what is more important still, it is far removed from the intention and the purpose of a measure of this kind. However, here is the Act, and I suppose that there is no possibility of the matter being rectified at this stage. My honorable friends have rectified it in the' other case, but really that only accentuates the unfairness and the impropriety of what they have done in this case. Here is the fact outstanding that while in one case as to which there is to be no payment, we are conceded an equal number, while in the other case in which there is to be payment, my honorable friends opposite monopolize the positions for themselves, and take care that we get the smallest possible modicum. I submit that it is most unfair. It is not in keeping with the spirit and the intention of the whole proposal, and I believe will not work out to the advantage of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- I took a very keen interest in the Public "Works Committee Bill when it was before the House, and it may be recollected that I announced that I would not be in any circumstances a candidate for a position on the. Committee if the Bill should pass, and, consequently, I felt myself free to talk on the question from an independent point of view. When the Prime Minister was asked, by way of interjection, the object of appointing four members from the Government benches and two members from the Opposition benches, he said it was based on a fair representation of the number pf the parties as we sit to-day. He must have forgotten that the Public Works Committee Bill was introduced for the purpose of giving Parliament a greater control over the expenditure of the Government, not of Parliament. If we exclude the members of the House on whose actions the Committee is to report, and the officers, it reduces the number of members on the Government side to exactly the same number of members that are on this side, namely, thirty-two. If our opponents are going to be honest in the appointment of the Committee, apart from the other arguments which may be brought forward, clearly equal representation ought to be given to both sides. When the Bill was under consideration I moved an amendment, with the approval of the Leader of the then Opposition, reducing the number to six, and the right honorable gentleman made a speech. </para>

I was about to say that he made a speech in which he agreed with a remark I had made by way of interjection that six would be a better number, and, in his judgment, a more effective number for a Committee of the kind. If you exclude the members of the Government to-day from the members on the Government side of the House, and take the proportion that they would be entitled to, then you cannot, under any circumstances, work it out as a fair representation of parties in Parliament, and say that there shall be four on one side and two on the other. </para>

It was the deliberate, expressed intention that as the Committees were to be appointed for the purpose of giving greater information than was supplied by the Ministry on proposals submitted to Parliament, the parties should have equal representation, so that a matter could be discussed freely and fairly on a non-party recommendation. It is a peculiar thing concerning the two proposals on the notice-paper for to-day that, whereas in the case of the Committee whose members are to receive no payment for their services, the principle of equal representation is recognised; in the case of the other Committee, the members of which are to be paid, we have a request by the Government for four nominees from the Ministerial benches, and only two from the Opposition. What conclusion are we to draw? </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Ah, now I understand the reason for the interjections by the honorable member for Denison.  His  is the last name submitted for this Committee, and I presume that if Parliament decides - I admit there does not seem to be much hope of it doing so - to be honest and give fair representation to each party on the Committee the name of the honorable- member will be the first dropped. Therefore, I can quite understand the perturbation of the honorable member. Reverting to the only reason which the Prime Minister gave for appointing four members on his own side, and two from this side of the House, we have the statement that that was in order to give representation according to the numerical strength of the parties. The whole of the members on the Government benches, including the Government, whose actions this Committee will be supposed to report upon, number forty-two, which, divided by four, gives a result of ten and a half. </para>

I was saying- that four, divided into forty-two, gives one representative on the Committee, to every ten. and a half members on the Government benches,, and by allowing the Opposition two representatives the effect will be that sixteen men on this side will have only the same representation on the Committee as ten men on the Government side. </para>

So jealously is the principle of equal party representation regarded that when our present Attorney-General- that is the honorable member for Flinders - was returned with a following of sixty at the time of the Kyabram movement, and the Labour party numbered only nineteen, each party, notwithstanding the difference in numbers, elected two representatives. </para><para class="block">That ought to be a sufficient answer to the Government. </para><interjection>

I believe that the number was altered to eight, but when the Bill reached another place a membership of nine was reverted to, and in order to preserve the proportions of the two Houses, six members were allowed to the House of Representatives and three to the Senate. That gave .the government two representatives from another place to the Opposition's one, an advantage which they were entitled to have. If it had been known that this would be a party Committee I venture to say that the late Government would never have attempted to pass the Bill, and as one member constituted a majority in the last Parliament, I would not have allowed the Bill to go through, because, rather than see an Act bring into existence a Committee that was merely to be a party body to enable the Government's own followers to indorse their actions, 1 would have voted against it. It is to be appointed to advise the House in respect of certain public works which are to be referred to it by the House on the initiative of the Government. Now, if the Government have a majority of their own supporters upon the Committee - knowing as we do the method by which the Labour party conduct its affairs - will not the fate of all these public works be decided before they ever come before the </para>

All that we shall be doing under this Bill - if the Committee is to be constituted as the Government propose - will be to create four additional paid positions for members of the other side. Such a course of action is unworthy of any party charged with the government of this country. I would like to hear arguments advanced in justification of the action of the Government, and I would like a comparison to be instituted between their attitude in granting equal representation to both parties upon the Public Accounts Committees and their attitude in declining to recognise that principle upon the Public Works Committee. Whether it be pleasant or unpleasant, I consider it is the duty of honorable members to point out the position so that we may know exactly where we stand when the country realizes what is being done.

I feel that unless the motion be amended so as to give equal representation to both sides of the House it would be far better for it to be rejected. If it be not carried the country will at least save the money which will have to be placed on the Estimates to provide for the expenses of the Committee. The Committee will be practically a useless whitewashing body if it is to consist of six representatives from one party in this Parliament and only three representatives from the other. We ought to see that on a non-party Committee equal representation is given to both political parties. Consequently, T intend to move that all the words after "works" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words " the names of three members from each party in this House." </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Certainly not. It is for that reason that I was anxious to omit the whole of the names. That would alford the Government an opportunity of reconsidering the position and of submitting their own nominations. It would also enable them to follow the clearly expressed intention of Parliament at the time the Public Works Committee Bill was under consideration, that both parties in this Chamber should be equally represented on that Committee. </para>

The honorable member for Flinders was not then in the State House. He had disappeared, and come to this House. I have no desire to enter into an argument with the honorable member for Balaclava. I admit that under that honorable member many things changed in Victoria. The honorable member changed himself; he changed the Constitution; in fact, he changed everything that it was convenient for him to change I am simply explaining that the honorable member for Henty made an inaccurate- statement, and  putting  him right, so that he will not make the statement again. I am sure he will thank me for what I am doing. </para>

                    <para>.- The object of the amendment moved, by the honorable member for Henty is the reopening of the question of equal representation of members in the House of Representatives upon the Public Works Committee. The remarks of the honorable member for Brisbane are an example of the liability that exists in all party discussions for honorable members to get away from the real point at issue. The honorable member gave quite a wrong impression of the point put by the honorable member for Henty. In view of my experience in the State Parliament of Victoria, I can firmly vouch for the fact that the advice tendered from this side of the chamber in regard to this matter is sound advice, and that the creation, and maintenance of any Committee of the House as a non-party Committee, by equal representation of both sides,, is a wise course to pursue. The honorable member for Bourke has alluded to a bad practice that undoubtedly crept into the Victorian Parliament in the early stage of the existence of what is known as. the Railways Standing Committee. But the wider experience gained by the Victorian Legislature in regard to the big developmental works submitted- for the consideration of that Committee fully proved the wisdom of making the- Committee a non-party body. It had been started with that conception, but it got away from the original design until ten years ago, when the matter was rectified, though during the last ten years there has been a very extraordinary disparity of numbers in the Victorian Legislative Asembly. Within my own recollection there have been forty-six Ministerial members and nineteen Opposition members. </para>

                        <para>- I am now dealing with the Railways Standing Committee, which is a parallel body to that proposed .here. I shall deal with the case of the (Harbor Trust .later on. I am not an advocate of the Government necessarily picking a certain .number of every Committee from among the Opposition supporters. Sometimes I think that the Government should choose the men in the House whom they judge to be best fitted to exercise the important functions to be carried out. We found in  Victoria that the House was more likely to accept the a'dvice of a Committee which was in no way coloured by party than that of a Committee chosen upon party lines and subject to party influences. Notwithstanding the extraordinary disparity in the State House, forty-six Ministerialists and nineteen members in Opposition, the State Government, with wisdom and fairness, decided upon the equal representation of parties, and members of the Opposition at the time acknowledged the absolute fairness of that attitude. In consequence, the reports submitted by the Victorian Railways Standing Committee have proved of immense economic service and value, arid have, -without exception, been accepted, which fact is a tribute to the wisdom of' the Committee, and to its assiduity in carrying out its duties. In the discussion of these matters one's own experience is always valuable, especially when .it has been obtained in regard to matters which may be similar to the experience this Parliament is likely to have with reference to the Committee whose appointment is now being considered. The reception accorded to the "recommendations of the Victorian Railways Standing Committee was. entirely due to the fact that there was no party- colour given to the' Committee, and during the period of the greatest constructional activity in Victoria its reports, were immediately accepted by both parties, and its recommendations adopted and put into- the Statute law of the country. We may have wider knowledge in this Parliament in these matters, but I doubt it, because the States, having to conduct such a vast programme of public works, are likely to have more knowledge, of. this subject. The present prospect is that upon our -Committee, there! will -be four men from the, Government, side and two mcn from the  Opposition. These men,.. every year before the opening of Parliament, are to submit' to the Governor-General ' a report on :!the general character of their work, while the joint Committee will report to us with  'regard  -to matters remitted to them' "by resolution of. the. House, though, of course,: 'in this Chamber  we  shall rely on the character of the recommendation -made by the six representatives of this House  upon the  Committee. The Opposition are more likely .to accept .the reports of this Committee if, no matter what the relative strength of the parties may be in the Chamber, there is not the slightest party character given to the appointment of the body to which the works construction programme of the Government is to be submitted for report. This requirement in. regard to the appointment of the Committee is all the more necessary because there is a " Caucus " Government on the other side of the chamber. We use this term on the platform outside sometimes in a bantering spirit and sometimes in the spirit of fierce opposition. Let us consider the actual working of that particular machine .which honorable gentlemen opposite have grafted on to our Cabinet system of government which still, ;happily, is ruling this Parliament. The honorable gentlemen whose name's are submitted for appointment to this Committee from the other side presumably were balloted for by members of the party opposite- in Caucus. </para>

                        <para>- I know their younger brethren in another Parliament. I presume that honorable members here have the same feet of clay that members of the State Legislature possess; that they are animated by the same motives, and lifted up by the same laudable ambitions. I do not think that there is any difference between them, though we may lay the flattering unction to our souls that we are children of a larger growth. If we consider the way in which the proposal will probably work, we shall have no hesitation in agreeing that the four honorable members appointed to the Committee by the party opposite will feel naturally bound to put through the propositions submitted to the Committee if they can find any reason in them at all. I should prefer to take the recommendations of a responsible Government having still the shattered fragments of Ministerial responsibility resting upon those who occupy the Treasury bench, backed up by departmental evidence, than those of a Committee coloured by party considerations or prejudice. I have said that as inoffensively as I know how. I thank honorable gentlemen for taking what is my sincere and analytical view of the situation in which, so far as I am able to judge, they find themselves. Can we not take a broader and less dangerous track, apart. from the views held by the parties on both sides, last session, when they were differently situated? Can we not say at once, as men of the world and of affairs, that the House will take the decision of a non-party Committee with much more respect, and adopt its recommendations with much greater alacrity, than it would be prepared to do if honorable members regarded it as a party Committee? I do not think that honorable members opposite can gainsay that. If the party on this side shifted into office at the next election, I should certainly hold the same view on this question. </para>

                        <para>- On the question of the evidence, the honorable member will find, as I found in a responsible position in a State House, that it will be impossible for Ministers and honorable members generally to go through the evidence collected by the Committee. We found in the Victorian Parliament that we had so many other things to do that we could not go through question after question, and answer after answer, of the evidence submitted ' by the Railways Standing Committee on matters of railway construction alone. We satisfied ourselves with reference to the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee. When, in connexion with one particular proposal, we found 5,000 or 6,000 questions asked of 200 or 300 witnesses, it was clearly impossible to analyze the evidence, and the practice has been to accept the analysis and deduction's of the Committee, and to say that they shall represent the policy of Parliament. We shall have to do the same here. Our public works will grow in extent. Additional railway propositions will be made in the Commonwealth. Proposals for all kinds of developmental public works will increase with the growth of the Commonwealth, and we shall not be able to go through all the evidence collected in connexion with them. We shall leave that work to those to whom these problems will be submitted, and will say to them, " Give us your findings after hearing the evidence." The honorable member for Brisbane must sse that that will be the result. </para>

I say that we shall not have time to study the evidence, and we should, therefore, constitute the Committee in such a way that we may have some confidence that it will recommend only proposals that are reasonable. I am informed that when the Bill providing for the appointment of this Committee was submitted to this House, honorable gentlemen now on the Treasury bench were sitting in Opposition, and they strongly recommended equality of representation. </para>

If that be so, we cannot wonder that honorable members sit in uncomfortable silence during this debate. There is no joy in their faces at all, except it be in the case of the honorable member for Barrier. </para>

                        <para>- I hope, sir, that you will not hold me responsible for this interlude. The honorable member for Barrier took my breath away when he said that he would like to tell me what he thought. I was so interested to learn what the honorable gentleman did think that I incautiously laid myself open to this interruption of the proceedings. I was about to say that, if it be true - and <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> can reveal the truth, or otherwise, of the statement - that when this  matter was discussed in the last Parliament, honorable gentlemen who are now Ministers, and were the-n sitting in Opposition, urged equality of representation, and have since, because of their accession to power, altered their views, no more lamentable exhibition of moral inebriety has been exhibited by honorable gentlemen opposite within my memory. Can those honorable gentlemen, by ransacking their memories and their consciences, say what additional evidence they have obtained since assuming power which justifies them in supporting to-day views) which three months ago they considered to be wrong? I do not claim for the' party with which I am identified an absolute monopoly of consistency. </para>

In order, however, that the House may have no difficulty in appreciating the difference between a State or Commonwealth .Committee of Public Works and ah administrative body, with no recommending -power, for the control of local government functions, I shall deal with the question in. anticipation of the Minister's remarks. ' The honorable gentleman has thrown upon me a labour that I did not expect; but knowing, as I do, something of the matter, I am in justice bound to describe the difference-. We reconstituted the Melbourne Harbor Trust some two years ago, reducing it from a small, allegedly representative Parliament of seventeen members to a body of five Commissioners. The duty of that body was to control and extend the port facilities of Melbourne, just as it is the duty of similar bodies to control and improve port facilities in other parts of-'  Australia. The  Melbourne Harbor Trust had large' borrowing powers. We increased them ' to the extent of £ 2,000,000. It has a revenue of a little over a third of a million, and it pays every year to the  Treasury a huge sum as a contribution for certain assets. It has also a very large .and constantly increasing surplus. We found this little Parliament a mere debating society, which left in the -hands of two or three bureaucrats the administration or neglect pf the port. </para>

W«: at once' raised the opposition of those whom the honorable member for Darwin is pleased to address as comrades and brothers. In other words; the Labour party in the State Parliament said to us, " You are going to destroy the democratic principle of representation; you are going to give these positions to men - some of whom will devote the whole, and others a considerable part, of their time to the work - who will .be, not elected, but selected by the Governor in Council." .Our reply was that the Harbor Trust system was growing, like our railway system, and that we desired that it should be managed in something like the same way, by Commissioners that there should be a responsible Minister, who would be able' to supply Parliament with information when it asked for it, and' that we should have Commissioners to govern this important and growing machine. The Harbor Commissioners have no recommending power Their duties and powers are prescribed by Statute. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's exceeding . frigidity led me to think that he had a double personality - that he was two . different persons in the one pair of boots. We appointed five men to improve the administration of our ports and harbors. We selected the best men available, and already, in the brief time during which they have held office, they have achieved reforms which, according 'to the admission of the mercantile community of Melbourne, interested only in securing up-to-date improvements, are little short of marvellous. The honorable member for Henty is one of the distinguished members of that Commission. Not only is he distinguished as a successful member of that quintet, but he is there to. represent the important -exporting' interest, and does so with conspicuous ability. Whether honorable members agree with the views of these five men or not, they must admit that they are doing good work. But here is the point of contact between myself and the Minister in charge of the House : He implies by his interjection that an administrative body like the Melbourne Harbor Trust is on all-fours with an investigating body such as that we are now discussing. If the honorable gentleman will reflect a little more - and in the busy life he is leading, struggling with his own party, over the- Tariff and other matters, he has not had much time for reflection, as many of his interjections show - he will recognise the difference. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must conclude thai there is a vital difference between the two- bodies. The one, according to the Statute providing for its creation, must be a parliamentary body ; it must be composed of members of this Parliament. On the other hand, members of the Melbourne Harbor Trust need not be members of Parliament. The State Government was at liberty to select the men it considered best fitted to conduct that big concern, and the Commissioners have large statutory powers. There is a vast difference between a public works committee, which is merely an investigating and reporting body, and the Mel bourne Harbor Trust, the Geelong Harbor Trust, and other like bodies that are doing a useful and fruitful work all over Australia. I do not wish to labour this question. Those who read the Act carefully will see that in passing it this Parliament was in a grave mood. It prescribed a course with which those who have sat in our State Parliaments are familiar, declaring that all works the estimated cost of which exceeded a certain sum - £25,000, I think- must be introduced, reported upon, and started in a certain way. So important did- it deem the ' functions of this Committee to ! be that it imposed upon those acting upon -it the' obligation of taking a fresh oath. It evidently' felt that the duty of recommending Parliament to pass a substantial sum in respect of any work imposed a higher ' obligation than is ordinarily cast upon -a . member of Parliament. . It therefore 'prescribed in a schedule to the Bill that the following declaration should be made: - </para>

                        <para>- They will discharge the duties as well as they are able. Upon the Minister himself is imposed, for, the first time, the statutory obligation prescribed with regard to public works in the future, and the members of the Committee will, in accordance with the statutory form, undertake to perform the. duties of their office faithfully and to the best of their ability. That being so, it is clearly our duty to elect a Committee in whom the House will have faith. If we start off scratch, as we are now doing, with unequal representation, how do you expect us to accept without qualification the reports of the Committee? There must be occasions when a minority and majority report will be presented by such a Committee, the four members representing that side reporting in favour of a certain proposition, and, possibly, the other two reporting against it as a minority. What position will we be in then? If party lines divide the members of the Committee, as they inevitably must, the Committee being constituted as proposed, this side will not take any notice of their recommendations, and we shall, have got no "forwarder" iri the desire for an impartial investigation. The honorable member for Henty said, " Parliament is evidently impressed with the fact that we have not sufficient impartial information given to us now with respect to important public works proposed by Ministers, and has said,  Let us appoint a tribunal with a system which will give it to us.' " Parliament, iu other words, feels at a loss. Party lines compel us to vote for or against a proposition for public works, although sometimes there is no party incidence in it. Let us construct a scheme which will give us all the information we desire regardless of the views of the Ministry, and then we shall be in a position to pronounce, without undue delay, on the wisdom of the proposed works. This is the wisest Ordinance that Parliament has passed in that respect, judging by the experience of Parliaments in other parts of Australia ; but I beg the Minister now to consider that, unless we keep party colour out of the Committee, all our endeavours will be futile. If we get a minority report, .we shall be justified in using all the evidence collected either by friends or foes of the proposition in this House in debating the proposal. This will intensify and prolong, rather than simplify and shorten, discussion. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Barrier accepted the denial, and it is a breach of parliamentary etiquette for him to repeat the assertion now. On the previous occasion the then Opposition pleaded for equal representation; but,  having  gained office, they have changed their attitude. That is unworthy of them, seeing that no new light has burst on us regarding the adoption of what is described as the " spoils to the victor " attitude. Spoils to the victor are all right if all the brains are on one side and all the dullness on the other side. If you cannot find in the Labour party a man to manage a bank, you have to go to the much-denounced plutocratic class to select a man. The party opposite cannot always give spoils to the victor, because they do not always have competent men from whom to choose; and that is what happened in regard to the appointment of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                        <para>- I modify that remark by saying they do not always have eligible men; and, in view of the vast amount of money which the honorable member for Darwin has amassed, I know he is not seeking for the responsibility of. conducting the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. That is doubtless why he went to the then Treasurer and said, " I am not a candidate for the position ; please get some one else, even if he be an unqualified man."- Generally speaking, however, the most efficient man is chosen ; and if, in the Harbor Trust illustration, to which the Minister of Trade and Customs has drawn my attention, it had been possible for us to get a man whom we regarded as more highly qualified for the administrative work from the ranks of the Labour party, that party would have had its chance. But we did not find such a man, and none of the party applied - there was no Labour party man in the "offing." </para>

However, I am probably merely beating the air, seeing that honorable members opposite have made up their minds; but I emphatically register my view that the wrong procedure is being adopted. The time will come within a few years, whether parties change or not, when we shall recognise the futility of the present course of action, and affirm the principle, regardless of the numbers on either side, of equality of representation. In that spirit I hope the Minister will consider the amendment carefully. It is not submitted in a fighting spirit, though my Caledonian friend disguised that fact somewhat successfully : but in a spirit of due humility. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to offer a personal explanation.  It has been stated during the debate, and repeated with emphasis, that the proposal of the late Government was to select two members from the Opposition and four members from the Government side. I wish to say that my intention - and that intention has never been deviated from for one instant - was to give, as far as possible, equal representation to the parties, recognising, as I do now, that the Government are entitled to the odd man. In the Bill that we sent to the Senate, provision was made for eight members, giving absolute equality of representation; and, when Labour senators decided on an odd number, my intention was - and this intention also has never been deviated from - to have the Committee composed of five Ministerialists and four Labour members. </para>

                        <para>- I sympathize with the honorable member for Franklin, for, if there is a member in the House who ought to be on this Committee, it is that gentleman. Did the honorable member for Parramatta expect that, with seven members in the Senate, two of his side would be appointed to- the Committee? At the present time, the honorable member's party is represented in the Senate by only five men; and even with seven members, as was then the case, could he expect two to be appointed while only one represented the- twenty7nine Labour senators? The honorable member for Balaclava, pretends that his party in the Victorian State Parliament is so' eminently fair that they have . given the Labour party equal representation on all Committees. . . ; </para>

                        <para>- The people' outside understand though, and the honorable member's bluff - I do not suppose that is offensive - will not go down here as it has elsewhere. The honorable member has referred to the Melbourne Harbor Trust and the Geelong Harbor Trust, and, though I have nothing to say against the members of those bodies personally, I ask, Were the men who were chosen to fill those positions chosen because of their merit alone? </para>

                        <para>- I find no fault with appointments in regard to which only merit is considered, but I do not think that members of the honorable gentleman's party here have all the merit. One might think, from what the honorable member for Balaclava said, that his party would act differently from the manner in which we have acted. I remember, however, that the Deakin Fusion party appointed six of its members to a Library Committee, consisting of seven members. What about the Food Prices Commission? Were not the consumers entitled to representation, and were none of them of sufficient ability to fill a position on the Commission? The Commission was formed of three men, one of them a Government official, of whose politics I know nothing, and two others belonging to the Liberal party. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member, when he brought down the Bill providing for the appointment of a Public Works Committee, proposed a Commission of nine members. The number of members was altered to eight, and then back to nine again. I feel confident that the members who have been proposed for the Works Committee will do their work as ably as any other members of the House could do it. I trust that the amendment will not be carried. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Foster. - Still, the Committee is proposed to be a partisan one. </para>

                            <para>.- I would have liked the Minister of Trade and Customs, if he could have seen his way clear, to tell the House why, in the case of this Committee, equal representation is given to both sides of the House. I would have liked the honorable member to state whether he agrees with the argument submitted by the Prime Minister in the first case, namely, that there ought to be proportional representation, and, if he does, why he is not now proposing to give proportional representation to the honorable members on the Government benches. The members- of this Committee will have to work without payment or hope of reward. Why should the Government, in the generosity of their  hearts,  give equal representation to both aides of the House in this case, and not in the other ? It is much more remarkable that the Minister of Trade and Customs did not utter a solitary word as to why the proportion is as it appears in the motion. If I may be permitted to reciprocate the feeling which he expressed in his remark, that he hopes that he retains whatever friendship existed between us, I may say, with the greatest of good feeling, that friendship will always exist between us. But I hope that anything we may find it necessary to say about one another will not be affected by our personal feeling or regard. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is. I have a very high regard for the Minister of Trade and Customs. I hope that amongst the numerous friends I have in the House I have a good many friends on the other side as well as on this side, but I shall never at any time cease to give expression to my opinions, whether they offend or not, either members of my own side or members on the other side. With regard to the appointment of Committees by Governments generally, may I say to the Minister of Trade and Customs that when the Bill to reconstitute the Harbor Trust was going through the Victorian Parliament an attempt was made in the Legislative Assembly to make it purely a Government nominee body; but Parliament would not adopt the suggestion, and ultimately it stipulated that certain classes of individuals or different groups should be entitled to be represented. As the honorable member for Yarra knows well, each of the "five groups has its own representation, and the only function which the Government have in the matter is to make the appointments from the nominees selected or submitted in that case. I, as a member of the Trust, represent a huge exporting interest in this country, because I am connected with the business, and not because I was a member or ex-member of the State Parliament. I wish to clear up the idea in the honorable member's mind that the appointment of a man to that administrative body was made on the ground of his connexion with politics in any shape or form. There is quite a number of persons outside Parliament who think that once a man becomes a member of Parliament he loses all qualification to fill any position outside. I am not one of those who hold that view, and I hope that it never will be held generally by the community. It is an insinuation often thrown at members of Parliament, and even after men go out of politics, if by  any  chance they should be appointed to a  public  position, that they have been  appointed  by the Government because they were members of Parliament or colleagues. </para>

                            <para>- Some persons hold that opinion, but they are few. There is a great number of persons who think that once a man is thrown out of public life any qualifications he ever had for a public position are gone. I certainly would like the Prime Minister, before this motion is passed, to give some reason why he has departed from the principle he adopted in the case of the previous motion. Surely we are entitled to get some explanation of the variation, or is the motion simply, in the classical language of the honorable member for Capricornia last session, to be " drummed through by a brutal majority " ? </para>

In the one case he told me that the Caucus had already decided on the nominees, but as -they had not decided on the nominees for the Finance Committee, he would be very glad to try to secure equal representation on it. He has done so. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not know whether the Prime Minister will be very satisfied with his address when he sees it in print. It is practically an acknowledgment that now that Labour has come into its own he hopes to give it the deferred rewards of many long years. That is not the kind of reasoning we had from the Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to the appointments to other Committees. I believe that if this spirit is prosecuted in any widespread way we had better tear the Public Service Act, rip up half the Statutes-- </para>

                                <para>- And bury all the Liberals, though my honorable friends will' find them the liveliest corpses they have ever endeavoured to inter. Undeterred! by the interjection, let us push the matter to its fullest logical extension. If it be a question of giving the sweets and rewards to either the officers or the rank and file of the Labour organizations, which they have been denied by social pressure so long, why do we not say that the Public Service Act shall give to supporters of the Labour party employment, and that wherever we can reward a follower by preference or preferment or promotion of any kind it shall be done? That is what the speech of the Prime Minister boils down to. There have been countries which have done that, but they are mostly " black " countries. The head-hunting African generally likes to reward the man who hunts with  him  slays with him, and lives in savagery with him, and is his pal. But civilized countries have been working away from that for generations, and the last to emancipate itself was the great American Republic. </para>

                                <para>- The great American Republic at one time permitted the introduction and growth of this great cancer. Until successive Commissions reported on the absolute inefficiency of the services of the United States of America, and by steady procedure, chiefly developed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt</inline> in his second term of office as  President,  they wiped out, if not all, at least the great bulk of the application of the theory which the right honorable gentleman has enunciated to-day. I hope he will not permit the growth of that thought in his mind, because it is a noxious weed, and if it is applied as he now seeks to apply it, it ought to be applied in a general fashion. The appointment of equal numbers from both sides on the Committee of Public Accounts seems to be an acknowledgment by the Government that they ought to have done the same thing with the other Committee, but, unfortunately, the request came too late. If that is so, why does not the Prime Minister acknowledge it? We are justified in assuming that it is because the Works Committee is paid that equal representation of both parties will not be granted. </para>

Following the point taken by the honorable member for Balaclava in regard to the system under which the Ministerial party conduct their business, I ask the Prime Minister what has he to offer Australia in return for the appointment of a Committee to investigate certain works which probably the Ministerial party have decided upon in advance, when a small number of that party, being a majority of the Committee, are to set to work to decide whether the propositions which the party as a whole have resolved upon are fit and proper works to be carried out? </para>

                            <para>- I think an adjournment from the middle of December till the middle of February would be convenient. It must be remembered that these are times when it may be necessary to convene Parliament at any moment; let honorable members beware of that. Do not let us have the idea that Parliament can be shut up for a long period, because even in a period of two months it may be necessary for Parliament to be hurriedly convened. Subject to that, we should endeavour to have a fairly lengthy adjournment over the Christmas and New Year holidays. </para>

                        COOK (Parramatta) [4.10J. - I hope the Prime Minister will not be niggardly in regard to the duration of the adjournment. I candidly do not believe that Parliament ought to reassemble in the middle of February, the hottest time of the year. The earliest date at which we should return to our labours is the month of March. There will be nothing spoiling in the meantime, and I am sure the right honorable gentleman himself will admit that he will be doing bettor service to this country and to the Empire if he is not bothered with party matters in the House. That is my profound impression. It is as much in his interests as in mine, and it is more in the interests of the country than  it is in his or my interests, or the interests of the parties we represent, that there should be a fairly long recess. Remember, we have had practically no recess this year. I submit that the right honorable gentleman looks as if he needs a rest for the sake of his health, and I think, therefore, that the latest date at which we can meet again is time enough for party squabbles. The Tariff will come all in good time. Meanwhile, let it not he forgotten that as a result of the war we have a prohibition over a large area of our ordinary importations at the very moment. My impression is that there will be nothing spoiling in that respect, and we shall deal with the Tariff all the more intelligently if, before addressing ourselves to it, we have the report of the Commission which is now investigating it.

I have had to drag myself here, and to remain listening to what he had to say, and it has pained me beyond measure. There is another question I should like to ask the right honorable gentleman, and it arises out of something said by his colleague during the course of debate. That honorable member said that one of the Commissions appointed by the late Government had been appointed on a party basis. He referred to the Foods Commission, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin, Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline> The right honorable gentleman will recollect that when that Commission was appointed I notified him of its composition, and he was good enough to send me hi3 approval. </para>

                            <para>- After what the Prime Minister's colleague has been saying, with all the bitterness his tongue can command, it is necessary that I should ask the right honorable gentleman whether that attack was because two of the members of that Commission belonged to the Liberal side when they were in politics? It is well known that both of them retired from active politics long ago, and I say that there are no two fairer-minded men in the community. These are the considerations which entered into the composition of the Food Commission. </para>

Upon the question of Protection I feel very strongly, and therefore I resent the jocular tone of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. I would like the Prime Minister to- tell us when he intends to introduce the Bill relating to the initiative and referendum - that great question which some Liberals are alleged to favour. If that measure be introduced before the Christmas adjournment, it will be a great education to the people who are hungering for it. I can assure Liberal members of this House that when that Bill becomes law, and the power over legislation rests with the people, they will never again have an opportunity of appointing Committees similar to those to which reference has been made to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to do so. But every night after this House rises I have occasion to travel on the Broadmeadows line as far as Essendon, and I seldom fail to see a number of soldiers on their way to the camp at Broadmeadows in a condition which is  a  hardship to their comrades, a disgrace to their country, and a reflection on the administration. Surely it is time that something was done to put men who are disgracing their comrades, in a place where they can disgrace them no longer". It is shocking that there should be so much claptrap talked about dry canteens, and that we should allow -this sort of thing to go on nightly without a word of protest. </para>

Most of our troops, I believe, will do credit to us there, but the Government should certainly take some action to eliminate from our Expeditionary Force those who are disgracing the King's uniform, </para>

                        <para>. -  Whatever else honorable members may do, I suggest that they should not discuss in this House the matter to which the honorable member for Robertson has alluded any more than they can avoid. Having said that, I may be permitted to express my own view, which is that the superior officers in camp have been very lax in that particular matter.' </para>

                            <para>- I think that their labours are practically over. They made a communication to me some time ago, but their usefulness docs not seem to be eo great now, and we find that the information can be obtained equally well through the Departments. It is only, fair to- say that the gentlemen comprising the Commission have- no desire to continue as a Commission now that their services are no longer required for that purpose. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that they were a very good trio for this particular work, and that they did good service. </para>
