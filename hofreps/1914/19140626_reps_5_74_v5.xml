Does he not think that action should be taken iri regard to the vile, wilful misrepresentations of papers like the <inline font-style="italic">Argus J . .</inline></para>

                                <para>- If I had the smallest suspicion that entering into a contract with Vesty Brothers would in any way raise the question to which the honorable member has referred - that is the matter referred to the Royal Commission - I would not have negotiated with them; but we have had plenty of inquiries into the project, and all the evidence is in their favour, and it is stated that they are strong opponents of the Beef Trust. In my opinion the arrangement with them has been one of the best steps yet taken in regard to the development of the Northern Territory j and it is not only my opinion, but it is also the opinion expressed by men who are competent to give a judgment on the matter. The arrangement will mean the expenditure by Vesty Brothers of about &#163;200,000, and not merely the minimum of &#163;100,000, as provided for in the agreement. The conditions of the agreement are fair to the Commonwealth, and we have nothing to lose by entering into it at once.. I do not propose to delay the matter, as the honorable member suggests. In fact the agreement has already been sent on for the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Vesty, and, in all probability it has already been signed. </para>

                        <para>- I have received a telegram from Kalgoorlie stating that the Engineer in charge of the western section of the Trans-Australian railway has discharged the vice-president and three prominent members of the &#34;Workers Union. Further, that he refuses to reinstate them, although he admits they are capable men, and that the only objection against them is that they are agitators. Does the Prime Minister propose to allow victimization to be practised against these men ? If so, I tell the right honorable gentleman, here and now, that a much bigger strike ia likely to eventuate than any that has occurred in the past. I ask a question, and give a hint at the same time. </para>

                        <para>- When coloured pugilists come in to have a little play at boxing, they are under the ordinary exemption provisions, and in one case - that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McVea</inline> - the term was extended for a few. months to enable him to complete his contracts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McVea</inline> called on me, and I remember that we had a chat for ten minutes or so about Carpentier. I think that he was in Australia altogether for about two years; and when such a period as that has elapsed, and the pugilists&#39; ordinary contracts have expired, they are expected to leave our shores. They come into Australia, as I say, under exemption, which covers, in some cases, more than six months; but, while in some instances they are engaged for a particular bout, in other cases they are here for a series of contests, and everything depends on the circumstances. If the applicant is a good fellow generally, he is allowed to remain a reasonable period. </para>

                            <para>- All I have to say about the 5s. is that during the whole of the three years of the term of honorable members opposite there was only one 5s. fee lodged. That is the answer to all this rodomontade. Honorable members keep on asking these silliest of questions. All that is happening and causing all this outcry is that they by their Act have prevented the police officers taking round claim cards. They, by their legislation, laid upon the people of the country the obligation to enroll themselves. I wish the people outside to understand this. It is not something that the present Government have done; it is the result of what my friends opposite have done; and we are quite unable to do what they wish us to do because they passed legislation which prevents us from doing it. </para>

                            <para>- In this morning&#39;s paper it is stated that the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs in another place had said that lists of those persons who had been struck off the rolls would be displayed in the various post-offices after the issue of the writs. I do not know whether that is a misstatement of what the honorable gentleman said, but it is obvious that the display of lists at such a time would be of no service. &#34;Will the Prime Minister look into this matter? If the lists are to be displayed at all, they must be displayed before the last opportunity has passed for persons to get on the rolls. It may be that the honorable gentleman was misreported. </para>

                                <para>- I will look into the matter. I think this list will be  2648 <inline font-style="italic">Punishment of</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Cadets.</inline> extremely valuable, even if it is displayed after the issue of the writs. I admit that it would be more valuable if it were displayed before the issue of the writs, and if that can be done it will be done. My own idea is that if any person&#39;s name is struck off, that person should be able to know as soon as possible. </para>

                            <para>- Oh yes, you did. You both instituted the system and put the trainees under it. I have never believed in solitary confinement for boys, and I do not now; but it is not so easy just to know what to do with recalcitrant boys. We are inquiring into the whole question to see whether we can get some other system. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I may inform the honorable gentleman that there is a regulation in force dealing with solitary confinement, and it was put into force by the late Minister of Defence. I can obtain a copy for the honorable member almost immediately. I had it in my hands the other day, and I think I gave the number to the House at the time. If the honorable member desires it to be published, of course it will be published. But he must take the responsibility for it, just as this Government will take the responsibility for terminating that form of punishment. </para>

                        <para>- An agreement was entered into with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> and with an assistant of his which, I think, will expire about August next.  His  duties are to examine the existing oil fields on which discoveries have been made and on which boring operations have begun, as well as any other likely shows, and also to prepare a geological map. I understand that there are very great risks in the selection of sites, and that a geological map is very necessary. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> came out I went into the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grebin,</inline> the oil expert in the Department, who explained the whole subject to me, and I was somewhat seized of the significance of the appointment. There are now three parties at work on the oil fields. One party is developing a new bore put down, on the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> at the site, approximately, of what is known as Lock&#39;s previous bore. An other party is engaged, on the other side of the Vailala River, in nutting down a second bore, under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade.</inline> The third party, working under <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> himself, is carrying out a geological survey. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> also advised us as to a harbor, and with his advice, in conjunction with that given by the officers placed at our disposal by the Navy - I have to publicly acknowledge the good work done by them -  we have been able to find a site for a harbor much better for our purposes than the one on Yule Island. </para>

The Governor of the bank replied that he refused to give any information. In reply to my telegram - I think the two telegrams must have crossed - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> assured me, as Treasurer, that the bank was amply secured in anything he had done. That was yesterday. I have done nothing further since. </para>

When the Prime Minister was speaking on that momentous occasion on which he stated that we were slandering Australia, in reply to something he said about purifying the rolls, I interjected, in a jocular mood, &#34;Will it take two years?&#34; I did not make any statement; I simply asked a question of the Prime Minister. Possibly the gentleman representing the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in the gallery, and also the writer of the leading article, are Scotchmen, and as it is difficult for people of that nationality to understand a joke, perhaps the error is excusable. At any rate, I repeat that I made no such statement. </para>

I have ascertained that the Defence Act provides for the detention of cadets in some place of confinement to compel them to undergo their drill, and for the purpose of. punishing them, and the late Government selected the fortresses as suitable places. </para>

                            <para>- The cadets in certain cases have been confined in cells- - I do not wish to understate the punishment - and have been detained in solitary confinement. There is before me a list of four cases which were dealt with before this Government took office. Cadets Green and Fells were committed on the 9th June, 1913, for one day only. They belonged to the Fourth Military District. Cadet Philipson was committed on the same date for two days, and at some time earlier a boy named Yeo was committed at Broken Hill. All these cases occurred before we took office. We have carried on the system that was already in operation. As I said this morning, I do not wish to make political capital out of this matter, and honorable members ought not to try to do so. In my opinion, a wrong course has been taken, but mistakes will occur in the best regulated establishments, and the only thing we can do is to discover them, and remedy them. We are having the whole system inquired into. It must be remembered that something must be done with recalcitrant boys, because discipline must be maintained. If one lad is allowed to do as he pleases, it is not likely that eighty or ninety other full-blooded boys will submit to discipline, knowing that the authorities may be defied with impunity. That has to be provided against. But the harsh treatment of the boys should cease. Honorable members may take my word for it that there will be no more solitary confinement for cadets. We have come now to the end of this Parliament, which is unique in many ways. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, the whole Parliament is to be dissolved, and to make an appeal to the country with every interest and every issue thrown into the scale. For the first time we shall have what I hope, will be a really democratic appeal to that great tribunal - the people. Whatever may happen in the coming campaign, I trust that we shall not lose our respect for each other. There will be hard hitting - that is inseparable from any conflict of the kind - but I hope that we shall be able to shape the issues and keep them before the people in such a way that an intelligent verdict may be recorded concerning them. That is much more important than some may imagine. Our Constitution is on its trial. </para>

                            <para>- All I have to say is that, in my opinion, honorable members would do very much better if, in respect to all these matters that have been raised, they would put the entire blame on my shoulders ; that is the place where blame must rest, if blame there be. The more we keep the Governor-General out of these controversies the better I think it will be for all concerned. It would seem as though it were not possible to utter a sentence without getting on somebody&#39;s nerves; and it evidently is time we had a breath of the free ambrosial air of the mountains, away from all this keen partisanship. In the coming campaign it is just possible there are some who may be slain, as, indeed, is always the case ; and one cannot but regret those personal happenings. Those of us, however, who come through the battle will, I hope, meet again with our personal respect for each other unimpaired, and our spirits even less embittered than they are to-day. In the meantime, before we take ourselves to this controversy, it is due to appropriately recognise the magnificent services rendered by all the officials of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has had, perhaps, a more trying time than any of his predecessors. The circumstances have been peculiar, and I think all will agree that that gentleman has made a magnificent effort to be fair and square in all his dealings. </para>

                            <para>- I admit it; and, whatever happens, no one will be able to say that the Prime Minister ever received any concession from the present  Speaker  - a tribute to his strict impartiality in his high office. I congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> on such a record, and make my due and warm acknowledgment of your bearing and conduct in these days. The same thing must be said of the  Chairman  of Committees, who, I think, has been scrupulous in the observation of the rules and customs of the House, meting out fairness and justice to both sides. In the peculiar circumstances of this Parliament, both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  Chairman  of Committees have had to perform duties which, I know, must have been disagreeable to them. Behind these gentlemen there are the everlasting ones of Parliament, who go not out with us, and come not in with us, but are part of the institution, and who, with rare fidelity and great ability, assist the proceedings of the House from year to year and session to session. I refer to the Clerks of the Chamber, to whom we are indebted for a multitude of courtesies and assistance rendered freely to every member who, at any time, may call upon them. Indeed, these officers do much more than we sometimes think in keeping the proceedings going in the proper way. I have also to pay my tribute to the valuable services rendered by the messengers, who, somehow, are never absent from my mind. In all the little ways which come within their duty they make life pleasant to us here in many forms, which, otherwise, would not be possible. I must not forget the masters of the winged art - the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters - to whom we are indebted for many reasons. </para>

                            <para>- Something like that. There is another matter on which, perhaps, I ought to say a word. I know that a good many honorable members on both sides feel a dissolution and an election to be a very serious financial burden; and there is no disputing the fact. Men devote their whole lives to the performance of their parliamentary duties, and the position has serious bearings for many, especially those coming here from other States. There has been an anomaly ever since Federation began, in that the members of one House receive full salary up to the end of the year, while the members of the other House have their emoluments suddenly cut off by the dissolution proclamation. I am not able to say anything definite in this connexion except that my own personal feeling at the moment is that the matter should be considered when the House resumes after the election. At present I content myself by expressing my deep obligation to all who help in the conduct of the business of the Chamber, and moving </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with pleasure to the valedictory remarks of the Prime Minister. He has spoken of this Parliament as an eventful one, as a remarkable one, and as one that has made history, and will have great constitutional consequences. In my opinion, it will be distinguished for other reasons. For instance, there have been barren sessions. However, it is not my intention to intervene with a jarring note of that kind. We are soon to appear in another place, inviting the free and independent electors of Australia to express their opinions, not only on our actions in this Parliament, but also upon our actions from an individual point of view outside it. From the point of view of our party having lost by death two members within a month, the Parliament has been a tragic one, and remarkable in other respects. I hope that no honorable member, no matter how long his service may be in Parliament, will ever witness another like it. I have not been able, to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> on many occasions, but I have always cheerfully admitted that he has endeavoured to do his best. I have felt it necessary to take dutiful action to preserve the rights of members, but I have always recognised the honest efforts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to do his duty. It matters not what honorable member is elevated to the position of  Speaker,  he must occupy an honoured position,, and have due respect paid to him. The same remarks apply to the  Chairman  of Committees and other officers who have guided the deliberations of this Chamber. I agree with the Prime Minister that the officers of the House know no party, and know no individuals, but I think the right honorable gentleman indulged in a little romance when he said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was more severe on him than on any other honorable member - </para>

                            <para>- They seem to have a sound prescient insight into what an honorable member is trying to say, and without redundancy we find the record of it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Some people would like to see <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> abolished. I am not one of those. I am inclined to think that in a Democratic country it is well for the people to know the history of its public men and their expressed ideas. One good idea in a thousand volumes may greatly assist towards the country&#39;s development. What the gods have on their laps for us no one knows. I do not agree with the action the Government have taken, but I feel pleased that the battle is to be transferred from the halls of Parliament to the hustings, where political programmes will be freely discussed, and a policy settled at the ballot-box. I join with the Prime Minister in the hope that, no matter how strongly we may feel politically, our personal relations will be unaffected. The only way to keep public life clean is for men to be fearless in the expression of their opinions on every matter on which they think it is essential those opinions should, in the public interest, be expressed; and if we endeavour to keep that standard, whoever may succeed or fail in the coming contest will have this consolation to lay to their souls - that they have endeavoured to serve their country to the best of their ability and according to the opportunities that have been available to them. I wish one and all health and prosperity and fitness for the fight; and may the best win. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to express my thanks to the right honorable the Prime Minister and the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition for their expressions of appreciation in regard to my conduct as the officer presiding over the deliberations in this Chambe&#93;&#39;. I wish to say that, in accordance with a promise I made when I was elevated to the chair at the beginning of this Parliament, I have conscientiously and honestly endeavoured within my own limitations, of which I am fully conscious, to preserve the best traditions of the Speakership, and to be as absolutely fair as I possibly could to both sides of the House and to every honorable member. Of course, honorable members, at some time or other, are apt to feel, in moments of irritation, that they are the special objects of severity on the part of the occupant  of the chair. I remember that during the Speakership of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder, especially when I was new to parliamentary life, on many occasions I thought that I was very harshly treated by him, and felt rather sore at the time; but I have since been able to appreciate how really patient he must have been, how irritating I must have been to him, and how much I must have been in the wrong; because I am perfectly sure, after reflecting on the matter in cooler moments, and under other circumstances, that I did not at the time appreciate the difficulties, and the mental and physical strain under which the occupant of the chair necessarily labours. The office has been no sinecure, as I think honorable members on both sides will agree, since it has been my lot to preside over the deliberations of the House. I can only say that if any honorable member on either side thinks that he has been under any disability as the result of any conduct of mine in the chair, there has been no intention on my part really to place him under that disability. My desire has always been to preserve the balance evenly, not only between both sides, but between honorable members individually on both sides. I have endeavoured, as far as I could, to carry out the Standing Orders as I found them. There have been times, perhaps,, when some honorable members thought, that I might with advantage to themselves have adhered less strictly to the Standing Orders ; but I remind them that a relaxation by the  Speaker  of the- Standing Orders might be very convenient at one time, but might be very inconvenient in regard to the same standing order at another time, and the only safe course, therefore, for a  Speaker  to pursue is to- stand by and behind the Standing Orders all the time, even although they may appear to operate harshly. It should always be remembered that they are not the Standing Orders of the  Speaker,  but the Standing Orders of the House, and can be at any time altered by the House if it so desires. I would like to say a few words, if honorable members will bear with me for a moment or two, about motions of dissent on the notice-paper from rulings I have given. I regret, perhaps more than anybody else, that an opportunity has not been given for the discussion of these motions, which would have enabled me to quote supporting authorities; but I take this opportunity of saying that I have ample authority to justify every ruling I have given. Before giving a ruling, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to acquaint myself with, not only our own Standing Orders and the procedure of the House, but also with the practice of the House of Commons. My rulings have not been given in a haphazard  way, but have been the result of careful thought and study of the authorities at my command. I desire to thank the officers, one and all, and the attendants - every one connected with the work of the House - for the faithful and loyal service which they have at all times rendered to honorable members generally and to myself as  Speaker,  and to express my warm appreciation of their loyalty and their fidelity to their duty, and particularly my warm appreciation of the assistance I have received from the Clerks at the table. Perhaps the  Chairman  of Committees might like to say a few words after I have finished, and before the motion is submitted to the House; but before sitting down, I wish to express the hope that honorable members will enter the coming political campaign free from all personal bitterness towards one another, or towards myself. For my part, I entertain feelings of warm personal friendship for many honorable members whose political views do not coincide with my own, and to all I cherish no feeling other than of personal goodwill. I wish honorable members to know, and to feel, that, as  Speaker,  it has been my desire to be a friend to each and every one of them. So far as the campaign and the election ahead of us are concerned, it is always to me a matter of extreme personal regret that these contests have the result of severing us from association with members with whom we have been accustomed to mingle in friendly personal relationships; it takes us a very considerable time to accustom ourselves to seeing new faces in the places which have been previously occupied by others. That is one of the sad features about an election. I om afraid that I cannot honestly express the hope that every one of us will be returned again; the present fight is to prevent such a result, but at the same time I cannot contemplate the coming election without a feeling of sorrow prompted by the thought that we shall perhaps miss many faces which have become familiar to us, and many identities for whom we have had a warm personal regard. </para>

                        <para>.- Like Oliver Twist, I want more. With reference to the first notice of motion on the business-paper for to-day, I had hoped that the Prime Minister could have given me an answer, but he was called out of the chamber. There is another notice of motion to which I would like to draw his attention, and which is No. 19, in the name of the honorable member for Barrier. As we are parting good friends, I think this is the psychological moment to suggest to the Prime Minister that the House might be given an opportunity to pass, on the voices, what I know would be a very acceptable resolution to the honorable member for Barrier, myself, and others.-.

                    <para class="block">No doubt those who come back will be glad to see familiar faces. I hope to see a few faces missing on the other side - politically, not personally. Politically, of course, I know no friendships. The motion to which I refer might, I think, well be decided at once on the voices, and I make the suggestion to the Prime Minister in perfect good faith. On the business-paper there are a good many propositions which we certainly should have had an opportunity to deal with. Whether the honorable member for Parramatta has the honour of leading the House or the Opposition in the next Parliament - the two highest posts in the House to which a member can aspire - I ask him to consider whether it is not worth while to set aside one night for private members&#39; business, so that an honorable member may be enabled at least to get a division taken on a motion. From twenty to twenty-five motions could in that way be dealt with in a night. It is very rarely, indeed, that the eloquence of an honorable member in the House, or the facts he has adduced, have changed the opinions and vote of another honorable member. Regarding the other proposals on the notice-paper, I feel sure that the House would carry the motion in favour of the Constitution being amended to empower this Parliament to grant pensions to young widows with children dependent on them. Again, there is the motion on the great question of Home Rule in the name of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. Australians are gifted with the greatest franchise which has ever been given to a continent, and therefore I think that we in this House should have been afforded the opportunity of showing by our vote how many of us are prepared to see extended to another part of the world that which we ourselves enjoy. There is also on the notice-paper a splendid notice of motion by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, who desired that the old-age pensions should be increased to the extent of 2s. 6d. a week. I do not suppose that we should have been able to induce the Treasurer to agree to that proposal. The right honorable member would not hesitate to borrow money for the purchase of ironclads, which, ten years hence, would be on the scrap-heap, but he would never dream of borrowing to enable the Commonwealth to help a human being, whether it was an old-age pensioner, a widow, or a child. I regret, also, that we have not had an opportunity to deal with the notice of motion standing in the name of the honor able member for Gippsland in favour of the initiative and referendum. That proposal, I tell the Government, will soon be carried into effect, and the people will then control the Parliament all the year round. When the people are dominant they will not allow the time of Parliament to be wasted as it has been since we met in April last by the discussion of ridiculous measures. Finally, I desire to say that I am, and always have been, a Protectionist. I do not say that Protection will ever remove poverty or misery, but it will give every country that adopts it an educated body of workers, who can be taken into municipal, State, or Commonwealth workshops when the wisdom of those governing bodies leads them to establish such institutions. The honorable member for Robertson will agree with me that when you build a locomotive in your own country, you will still have the money in the country when that locomotive is worn out and has to be replaced ; but that if you obtain it from abroad, when it is worn out you will have neither the locomotive nor the money which was spent upon it. The honorable member for Wimmera will have to lean towards the policy of Protection and the introduction of the initiative and the referendum if he does not desire his big majority to be reduced. I am satisfied that in the next Parliament we shall have a majority favorable to the immediate revision of the Tariff on protective lines, and to the principle of the initiative and referendum. We shall do next session far more than has been done during the last two sessions. I wish, in conclusion, to give my meed of praise to our brothers of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, who, during our all-night sittings, are sweated in an infamous way. We should follow the example of the Parliament of the school-house of Europe, and meet in the day-time. To the officers of the House I must also plead guilty, with others, for having kept them here at night. I ask them, however, not to blame us, but to blame the absurd system under which Parliament is carried on. We should meet in the day-time, and a sitting of eight hours per day should be long enough to enable us to do all that we require. Such a reform, I am satisfied, will be welcomed by the officers of the House, who are loyal and true, and who, even when their brains and eyes are 2658 <inline font-style="italic">Adjournment.</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Proclamation.</inline> weary with long hours of labour, never complain. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the Minister has any power over that Commission I hope he will see that ample evidence is available for the House when we are asked to deal with the Tariff. I also trust that, in the meantime, any report issued by the Commission will be distributed amongst honorable members. I regret that I have not had an opportunity to submit my motion, because I believe that I had a sufficient backing to make the Inter- State Commission recede from the position taken up &#34;by it in regard to the taking of a full report of the evidence given before it. The practice of taking only a summary of the evidence landed it quite recently in a certain amount of trouble. A mere summary of the evidence is not sufficient to enable us to frame a Tariff on truly scientific lines, and I hope that we shall have passed such a Tariff before next session closes. </para>
