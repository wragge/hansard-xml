It is not correct, although it soon will be correct, that a deputation of those who were working on these particular jobs will wait upon me; I expect them this evening. It is not correct to state that there is any association between statements that have been made as to how the work has been conducted and the fact that we are discharging certain men. We are finishing up the jobs, and dispensing with the services of the men. It is intended to keep sufficient men to carry out the works which are outlined for the current financial year, and it is estimated that the whole of the works provided for in the Estimates will be completed by the men who will be retained by the 30th June. </para>

                            <para>I am unable to say. An order was placed some time ago for a modern common battery switchboard of the latest pattern to be installed at Ballarat, and the work of its erection has already been commenced. It is proposed, when new switchboards are required in telephone exchanges with more than 500 existing lines, to give consideration to the suitableness of automatic and semi-automatic systems. The working of the automatic switchboard at present  installed  at Geelong is being carefully watched, and the experience gained will be utilized  in  deciding the type of working to be adopted in other telephone network, each of which must, however, be considered entirely on its own merits. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Although, presumably, there is no chance of my obtaining a vote on this important motion, I do hope that the Government will see their way to meet the wishes of a large body of men and women in South Australia who unanimously consider that an injustice has been done to them. This is not a question which merely affects this Government . It is one which involves the honour of this Parliament and the honour of the Commonwealth. I am going to ask the House whether it is prepared to allow to be broken what is practically a contract entered into in the name of the people of Australia with the officers of the Post and Telegraph service of, at least, South Australia. Some of my remarks will apply equally to officers of various other Departments - such, for instance, as the Department of Trade and Customs - in South Australia, who have not had their rights preserved; but, for the sake of convenience and conciseness, I shall confine myself this afternoon to a statement of the case, as I understand it, on behalf of the Post and Telegraph Association of South Australia. I shall endeavour to show that, intentionally or not, by accident or design, something approaching a confidence trick has been perpetrated on a large body of men and women who, under State control, gave enthusiastic and loyal service to the Crown, as the result of which, an undertaking was given that their positions would not be worse, but rather better, when they came under the control of the Federal authorities. I know many of these men and women. Some of them were schoolmates of mine, many are old friends, and, from my knowledge of them, I have no hesitation in saying that they are a fine body of men and women, of whom the Public Service of Australia has every reason to be proud. They are giving to-day loyal and enthusiastic service to the public, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth ought not only to be prepared to listen to their appeal for fair play, but should be eager to give them justice. A feeling of intense surprise and chagrin came over officers when, in June, 1904, the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner's " classification " was issued, and it was found that the salaries of a large number of officials were reduced. Prior to that, there was not a man in the Service who did not implicitly rely on the Constitution and the Commonwealth Public Service Act preserving " all the existing and accruing rights " enjoyed under State Acts. About 100 postmasters had their incomes detrimentally affected in sums of from ^5 to ,£150 per annum - an average of about ;£34: - and eighty or ninety officers, entitled to "increments," were called upon to lose from <inline font-style="italic">£Io</inline> to ,£30 per annum - most of them ^25. When classifying the Service in 1904, the Commis»sioner found postmasters and postmistresses in South Australia in. receipt of certain payments or allowances, such as rebate on sale of postage stamps - of these there were only a few - cases - and Savings Bank salary, &amp;c, in addition to statutory salary. With the exception of one or two small allowances, such as fees for registering births and deaths, which the postmaster retained only until transferred to another office, the Commissioner abolished all emoluments, and, with only two or three exceptions, classified the officers at their statutory salary. The result was that sixty-four postmasters, and a large number of other officers, were deprived of portion of the remuneration which they had receive1?! under State control. Several postmasters were also deprived of increments to their statutory salary, which had accrued, and were accruing, under State law. The question to which we have to direct our attention this afternoon seems to me to be, " Why should officers be penalized when transferred from the State service to the greater service of the Commonwealth?" That that was not intended by the framers of the Constitution I shall show by making one or two small quotations - they could be extended - from the reports of the Federal Convention. At the Adelaide sittings of the Convention, in April, 1897, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Connor</inline> - now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor - used these words - . </para>
                    <para>I think we are all agreed that when an officer is taken over' by the Commonwealth, he should not be placed in an unfair position or lose any rights by being taken over, because it is no fault of his that the continuity of his service has been broken. </para>
                    <para>Then we have no less an authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> - now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs - saying </para>
                    <para>I think it is important to put in the word " accruing." It is a principle we have adopted in Victoria. When gigantic establishments like the Post Office and Customs are taken over, there must be some hundreds and thousands of officers taken over, some of whom have rights now existing, and others who have rights accruing. In Victoria, when we have passed new Public Service Acts, we have been very careful not to take away from a man any interest he may have acquired when he joined the Service, irrespective of whether those interests have ripened into actual rights or remain in an inchoate state. When we transfer men to the Commonwealth -  and this is the point I wish to emphasize -  it behoves us to do them no injury. We ought to preserve to them not only their existing, but their accruing rights. </para>
                    <para>Another member of the Convention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon</inline> - now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon - referring to the public officers, said, ' ' Let all their rights be preserved." He went on to say - </para>

                    <para class="block">That pledge made in this Chamber imposes an obligation on this Parliament to-day.  I  do not know what public servants in other States were promised when the public were invited to vote " Yes " for Federation, but </para>
                    <para>I  do know that in South Australia from the public platform, as well as in the press, State servants who were likely to be taken over by the Federation were distinctly promised that their existing position would be improved in the Federal Service. On 18th May, 1899, Messrs. C. C. Kingston, then Premier, and Holder, then Treasurer, of South Australia, addressed a meeting convened by the South Australian Public Service Association for the purpose of giving civil servants an opportunity of hearing their views on the Commonwealth Bill. They said that public servants would lose nothing by Federation; the rights of transferred officers were amply preserved under the Constitution. On the contrary, said Messrs. Kingston and Holder, they thought the probabilities were that the public servants would gain by the transfer. Public servants, they declared, had everything to hope for, and nothing to fear from Federation. But the experience of a large body of men and women in South Australia is that that promise has not been fulfilled, and the South Australian Post and Telegraph Association, which comprises a large body of officers, set out their claims as follows :  -  "(1)That the Federal Convention intended that no transferred officer should be worse off under Federal control than he was under State control, and enacted section 84 to insure that intention being carried into effect. (2) That the first Federal Parliament felt bound by section 84 to respect the rights of transferred officers, hence section 60, Commonwealth Public Service Act. (See <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne's speech in moving second reading - Federal <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Session 1901-2, page 1084 ; also see <inline font-style="italic">Quick and Garran's</inline> Commentaries on Constitution, page 818, and pages 656-661.). (3) The High Court in <inline font-style="italic">Cousens</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Commonwealth</inline> ruled that officers did take over with them rights - such as the right to a certain salary - in their transfer from the State, but that the Federal Parliament was a competent authority to vary or abolish such rights. (4) That the Public Service Commissioner, finding himself clothed  with  all the powers of Parliament in respect of Service matters, exercised the power claimed for the Parliament by the High  Court  in the Cousens case, without regard to the moral obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by the tacit agreement between the Convention and the Service <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> section 84), and in disregard of the direction given him in section 60, Commonwealth Public Service Act, by the First Federal Parliament. (5) That this action of the Commissioner, under the circumstances, amounted to an abuse of power, and, though his action by virtue of the powers conferred upon him by the Public Service Act has the force of law, it was an unjust and oppressive action, and a distinct repudiation of the Commonwealth's obligations towards its servants. (6) That the law, apart from the Commissioner's action, did not forbid, but clearly contemplated, the continuance, until their natural expiration, of the accrued and accruing rights of transferred officers. (7) That, in view of the Attorney-General's statement that the Commissioner would not have been acting unconstitutionally had he, in his classification, recognised and provided for the accrued and accruing rights of transferred officers, the matters in dispute should, by direction of Parliament, be settled by arbitration on the grounds of equity without involving the officers in the heavy costs of a suit before the High Court or the Arbitration Court." </para>

                    <para class="block">That clearly shows that, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, there was nothing to prevent the Public Service Commissioner from recognising the claims of his officers, and the promise contained in the Constitution, which promise was also made on behalf of the Government of the day by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. The following is a copy of a letter sent to the Postmaster-General, Melbourne, on behalf of the South Australian Post and Telegraph Association, and as it contains their case in a very short compass, I wish to submit it to the House. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ult., and beg to thank you for same, and for minutes of deputation. </para>
                    <para>The managing committee of this association desires us to express its great regret that you are unable to meet the wishes of the South Australian officers with regard to the requests placed before the Prime Minister in a memorandum of the 14th October. The committee had hoped that the principles involved in the " accrued and accruing rights" questions, and also in the claims of the South Australian postmistresses to be placed on the same footing with postmistresses occupying similar offices in New South Wales and Tasmania, would have appealed to the sympathies of your Government. Indeed, the association is most reluctant to believe that the present Government, by adopting a negative attitude in regard to the flagrant injustices inflicted upon South Australian transferred officers by the Commissioner at the time of classification, indorses the repudiation of the moral obligation imposed upon the Commonwealth by clause 84 of the Constitution, and recognised by the Federal Parliament in clause 60 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Nor does it seem possible that the Commissioner's demand that the postmistresses shall accept a degradation in status as a condition precedent to receiving a small increase of salary, can have the approval of a Labour Ministry. To indicate how keenly the postmistresses feel the slight cast upon them by the Commissioner, I beg to quote the text of a letter from a postmistress declining the Commissioner's offer - " In reply to your letter received on the 22nd instant, I note your acknowledgment that an increase to my salary is possible, but I must respectfully decline the alteration of my designation and subsequent degradation from the Clerical to the General Division. I have done nothing to deserve such indignity, and I feel I should be wanting in self-respect if I accepted it." </para>
                    <para>Most of the postmistresses have indicated their intention not to accept the increased salary with such a condition, and my committee respectfully but strongly urges that increases should be given and their present designations retained. </para>
                    <para>From inquiries made, we gather that it is doubtful whether the accrued and accruing rights questions come within the scope of the Public Service Arbitration Bill now before the Federal Parliament. If the Court has jurisdiction on these matters, however, they appear to be prejudged by the provision that awards may be disallowed by Parliament if they conflict with the Commonwealth law or regulations. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the legal position stated to us by the Honorable the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was good enough to advance the opinion in a letter of 22nd February, that, had the Commissioner granted the claims of transferred officers in his classification, he would not have acted contrary to law. It is clear to us, therefore, that it was an act of the Commissioner - as a  deputy  of Parliament - which raised the legal difficulties spoken of by the Honorable the Attorney-General, and not any express act or intention of the Legislature. </para>
                    <para>Our committee would be glad to know if your letter of the , 14th November must be regarded as final reply of the Government to the association's requests, contained in memorandum of the 14th October, to the Prime Minister. Also whether it will be competent to submit the questions of "accrued and accruing rights" to the Arbitration Court under the proposed Act, and which of the matters mentioned by us are covered by the proposed, amendments to the Public Service Act, <inline font-style="italic">vide</inline> paragraph 4 in your letter. </para>
                    <para>The only reply to that letter was to the effect that the Postmaster-General thought these accrued and accruing rights of transferred officers could be dealt with by . the Arbitration Court, but the Court itself would decide what matters were within its jurisdiction. Those matters to which I am referring are not new to the present Postmaster- General, or his predecessor. The grievances have been felt for a considerable time, and are causing discontent, more or less, throughout the Department, which has given, and is prepared to give in the future, loyal service to the public. So impressed was the predecessor of the present Postmaster-General with the facts brought before him that he made a distinct promise to this Association in Adelaide.

                        had said that unless the rights of the transferred officers were protected, a large number of the community might be induced to vote against Federation in defence of their own rights and their living, and in defence of justice. That was practically the keynote of the matter in connexion with the rights of transferred officers.

                    <para>The Postmaster-General said that if that was the point, they would see that, in view of all that had taken place in the past, it was rather a difficult thing for the Government to say that it would pay these emoluments, but he would promise that if the officers would suggest a friendly suit to meet the case, the Government would do all it could to meet them. </para>

                        is not. My wish and the wish of the Government is to have the whole thing settled; all, if possible, by arbitration. Where there are constitutional questions which cannot be settled by arbitration, it is impossible for us to say what will be done. But in regard to any point which can possibly be referred to arbitration, the Government are quite prepared, willing and anxious to have it referred. We cannot say anything about those questions which cannot be referred to arbitration. While you are here, you must see the Attorney-General on these points, and you can deal with him. As far as the Government is concerned, we are only too anxious, but we cannot go behind the law and the Constitution. As far as I am personally concerned, I am one of those who are against the lawyers every time ; but, at the same time, we have" a Constitution, and I am not in a position to say that we can go behind the Constitution.

                            supported and claimed that, though State Acts had been superseded by Federal legislation and the Commissioner's classification, the Commonwealth Public Service Act of 1902, section 60, kept alive certain rights enjoyed by transferred officers under State control. Section 60 was practically a repetition of section 34 of the Constitution, and he quoted the words of
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>
                            Lyne when moving the second reading of the Public Service Bill in the House of Representatives.

                            Lyne had said : " I wish to emphasize the point that, under clauses 51 and 52 of this Bill (clause 60 of the Act), and under section 84 of the Constitution, there is a provision to make it absolutely certain that no trouble shall arise with regard to transferred officers, and that all rights that accrue to those officers who are taken over from the State will be respected."

He quoted the case of <inline font-style="italic">Cousens</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth, "</inline> in which the Court lays down the position very clearly, and decides that section 84 of the Constitution, preserving accruing and accrued rights, is subject to Commonwealth, legislation, and it is not a right that is immutable, but that it is subject to legislation by a competent body." Opinions by various Attorneys-General supporting this view were quoted by the Attorney-General, all of which, he said, went to show that the points mentioned could not constitutionally be submitted to arbitration. </para>

                            <para>- -The Federal Convention, in dealing with the question of the rights of transferred officers, was faced . with the possibility that, if the transferred officers were left open to possibly unjust treatment by their new employer, they would vote against Federation. Those very words were used by one member of the Convention. The various members of the Convention referred to what had been done in a particular case in Victoria, and another case mentioned in India, when the servants of one company or one service went over with the business to another service. In each of these cases it was stated that the rights of the officers were so preserved that they could not suffer loss ; and clause 84 of the Constitution was designed by the Convention for their protection. I take that to be the whole tenor of the debate. It was designed to prevent the officers who were to be transferred being unjustly treated or losing anything under their new employer. That is the way we viewed it, and that is the way we accepted Federation. </para>

                    <para>The Attorney-General.  -  I quite agree with you, but would like to point out the difference between a private employé who has a contract with an employer and a public officer who is working under a Statute, both being transferred, is that the one has a contract which is not at all subject to anything except the terms of that contract and its interpretation in a Court of law, while the other is working under a Statute which can be annulled., modified, or amended by a competent authority. When they are handed over or transferred to another public body either to a State or to the Commonwealth, that qualification upon their rights continues, and that other body, that other Legislature, whatever it may be, has the right to take away every privilege and every right which he possessed. That does not happen at all in the case of a person who has a private contract. If. you have a private contract with me that I must pay you, say, £10 a week for life, it does not matter how much the thing is transferred. It is like the case of an apprentice transferred by one employer to another - if the transfer is properly done, then all the apprentice's rights continue to the transfer ree, and the new employer has upon him all the burden that the original employer had. The transfer does not alter it, nor can he alter it without consent. I only want to point out to you that the analogy of a private employer is quite different from that of the State employer. The South Australian Legislature could, if it liked, of course, simply say. that all its employes should have£600 a year, or on the other hand only£50 a year, and there would be an end of it so far as the law is concerned, but not of course so far as other things are concerned. </para>

                    <para>The Attorney-General.  -  That is perfectly right. The only point is that the interpreter of the Constitution is the Court. I am only giving you what the Court says, and its reading of what is declared to be the law. As to whether the thing is right or wrong is a matter upon which we can all have our opinions: </para>
                    <para class="block">The South Australian Post and Telegraph Association has been legally advised that it is extremely unlikely that the Court would make an award retrospective to the date of their claim. Unless the award dated back to the time of the classification, in 1904, it would be absolutely useless to the South Australian officers. This supports their contention that the Arbitration Court cannot satisfactorily deal with the matter in dispute. I think I have shown: - 1. That it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to provide that officers transferred to the Commonwealth should not be reduced in status or in salary. That is clearly shown by the debates in the Federal Convention, and by the provision in the Constitution.  2.  That the first Federal Parliament, in the Public Service Bill, undertook to preserve all rights of public servants, it being stated on behalf of the Government of the day that provisions were included in the measure to make it quite  certain that no trouble could arise with regard to transferred officers. 3. That the classification of the Public Service Commissioner not only did not preserve existing and accruing rights, but actually reduced officers in status and salary, and in respect to the age of retirement. 4- That, recognising the special claims of officers of the South Australian Post and Telegraph Association, a promise was given on behalf of the present Government, to refer their claims to an arbitrator - not the Arbitration Court. 5. That such promise cannot be redeemed by inviting the officers to take their case to the Arbitration Court, as the Court would not be likely to make an award retrospective to the date of their claims. If we are to have an efficient Public Service, we must remove all suspicion of grievance or cause for discontent. Officers in South Australia feel deeply that a grave injustice has been done- to them. They are appealing to their employer, the Commonwealth Government, representing the people of Australia, to consider their claims, and give them a fair and square deal. The people of this country were invited a few days ago, in eloquent phrases by a Minister of the Crown, to liken Australia to " the great Temple of Liberty, the corner-stone of whose strongest arch is universal justice, and the Bill of Rights and our matchless Constitution are its solid foundation." I accept that invitation, and to-day, on behalf of a deserving body of men and women, who are giving loyal service to the Commonwealth, I appeal to the Government and to this Parliament for that measure of justice which our " matchless Constitution," in the words of the Minister, decrees shall be given to these public servants. These men and women, loyal servants of the public as they are, ask for no favour or concession, but they do appeal to this Parliament and to the Government for a fair hearing of their claims, confident that those claims are reasonable, and that justice will eventually be done to them. Although I have not had the opportunity of moving the motion which I had upon the business-paper, and of obtaining from all sections of the House that support which I am sure would have been forthcoming to such a reasonable request, I do sincerely hope that the Postmaster-General will give this matter all the consideration that he possibly can, that he will realize the difficulties which confront the officers in approaching the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and that he will see if it is not possible for this -country to do bare justice to its servants. We do not want to reduce either the status or the salaries of the men and women who are giving such good service to the Commonwealth. We wish, rather, to remove all feelings of discontent from the ranks of the post and telegraph officials, because we recognise that they are rendering valuable service to the public. We want that service to be not only a loyal but an enthusiastic one, and the only way in which we can secure that object is to make these transferred officers feel that, when they left the State Service, they entered one which is prepared to pay them well, to deal justly by them, and to see that the conditions which they enjoyed under the State are fully preserved under the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>.- I must compliment the honorable member for Boothby upon the clear and convincing case which he has made out for Ministerial consideration of the claims of transferred officers. As far as my memory serves me, I can bear out his statement that the position of these officers is a matter upon which opinions have been given by Attorneys-General upon four or five different occasions. Their opinions related, not merely to the South Australian transferred officers, but also to the transferred officers of Victoria, and of some of the other States. In all cases, I think, the opinions stated that it was competent for this Parliament to interfere with the salaries or privileges of such officers, which were the equivalent of payments, by legislative enactment. I think that was the advice which was given by ex-Senator Drake when he was Attorney-General, and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon. If I remember rightly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> also expressed the opinion that certain claims made by transferred officers were capable of alteration by this Parliament. But the point is that, though the matters at issue are comparatively small in regard to some of the States, they amount to a very substantial sum in the case of the South Australian transferred officers- As has been mentioned by the honorable member for Boothby, under the classification scheme which was adopted by the Public Service Commissioner, and which became effective on the ist June, 1904, the South Australian postal and telegraph officers suffered an incidental reduction of their salaries ranging from <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">£150</inline> per annum. I do not say that the Public Service Commissioner- was not obliged by the terms of the Commonwealth Public Service Act of  1901  to classify them in such a way that there would be an incidental reduction of their salaries. There may be two opinions upon that point I understand that the present Attorney-General has ventured the opinion that the classification might have been so made that the claims of the transferred officers could have been recognised. But, whether that be so or not, it is competent for this Parliament to so amend our Public Service Act - without referring this matter to the High Court - as to give to those officers who thought that their position would be untouched! by Federation, the salaries which they consider to be their " accrued " and " accruing " rights, as well as the other privileges which they would have enjoyed if Federation had not been consummated. The South Australian officers say that there are four privileges or rights which they enjoyed under the Public Service Act of that State which have been interfered with by Federation. The first is their right to annual increments of salaries, which would have placed them in a much better position financially than they occupy at the present time. The second is their right to extended furlough. The third has reference to the question of retirement. Under the South Australian Public Service Act, they were entitled to remain in the Service as long as they were capable of discharging their duties. There was no provision in that Act for their retirement upon reaching the age of sixty-five years. They were also entitled as part of their salaries to an allowance in connexion with the sale of stamps and for business done by them in connexion with the Savings Banks. When all these amounts are totted up it. will be found that, through the classification scheme which was framed by the Public Service Commissioner, and adopted by this Parliament, there has been a very substantial reduction in the salaries and privileges which certain of these transferred officers enjoyed. When this matter was mentioned about  1903,  I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner estimated that, in the case of South Australia, about  ,£4,000  a year would have covered the whole amount which was then involved. It does seem to rr.e that at that time Parliament would have agreed to any amendment of our Public Service Act which would have made special, provision for these transferred officers. They did understand that the provision in the Constitution relating to their accrued and accruing rights would have preserved to them, not merely their pensions, but their annual increases as established by the South Australian Public Service Act of  1874.  That Act has been respected by the State- I do not think there has been more than one reduction under it since it was passed. In one year, I believe, there was a percentage reduction made in the salaries of the public servants of South Australia, because it was a time of very great financial depression. It is rather significant that the officers whose salaries were made up of annual salaries and allowances were affected under the classification of the Public Service Commissioner, not only by percentage reductions in their salaries, but also in their allowances. They contend that the allowances which have been cut. off by the Commonwealth Public Service Act of  1901  were part of their regular salaries, and ought, consequently, to have been preserved to them as an accruing right. But apart altogether from the legal aspect of the matter, I ask honorable members to recollect that the public servants of South Australia were told, prior to Federation, that if they were transferred to the Commonwealth, their existing and accruing rights would be respected. What they had in mind was, not merely pension rights, which have been respected, but certain statutory increments of salary. There is no doubt that an Act of Parliament could have altered their position prior to Federation. Hence the High Court decided, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Bond</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth,</inline> and, later, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Cousens</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth,</inline> thereby indorsing the opinions of Attorneys-General, that whatever a State Act could have done in the way of altering salaries, it was competent for a Commonwealth Act to do, the Commonwealth being the sovereign body to which the State powers in the matter have been transferred. But the question we have to consider is whether it is politic to stand strictly by the legal position. Did not these public servants think that their salaries would be as good, and their increases as regular, after Federation as they were under State control? They were led to think that, not only by what was said in the Convention, but also by what was said by the honorable member for Hume when he introduced the Public Service Bill, and by the fact that section  60  of the Public Service Act practically repeats the words of the Constitution preserving their accrued and accruing rights. The annual outlay involved in meeting their claims would be comparatively small, and would diminish as the officers concerned leave the Service or die. The proper course would be to bring in an amending Bill permitting the Public Service Commissioner to pay, in addition to the ordinary salaries fixed according to the classification, such an amount as would keep South Australian officers in the position which they would have occupied had the States not federated. I think that is what the suggestion of the honorable member for Boothby amounts to. I do not think that the Arbitration Court could, under the Act of last year, decide the question of accruing rights. You might refer to a tribunal the question whether, in view of all the circumstances, provision should be made for the case of these transferred officers, but it is competent for Parliament to. deal with the matter without such a reference. You cannot refer to the Arbitration Court, or to any other tribunal except the High Court, the question whether, under the Constitution, these officers are entitled, as accrued or accruing rights, to the increments of salary, furlough, allowances, &amp;c, of which they have been deprived by the classification. That is a pure matter of law, which can only be determined by the High Court, and that tribunal has practically decided already that this Parliament has the power to alter the status of officers transferred from the service of the States to that of the Commonwealth. But, considering the way in which the words " accrued and accruing, rights " would3 be interpreted by the man in the street, would it be proper to send the question to the High Court? The proper course is to refer it to a Committee, or to some other body on which proper representation would be given to the officers concerned, or, better still, to deal with it in an amending Bill. I think that if the facts were thus laid before Parliament with the clearness arid convincing logic that the honorable member for Boothby has applied to-day, honorable members would not hesitate to make the small provision that would be necessary to realize the just expectation of these officers. As. for arbitration proceedings, unless the Government helps the officers to put their case clear of technicalities, they may be defeated. I am doubtful whether they constitute a body that can be an organization within the meaning of the Act.' </para>

                            <para>. - The question that has been brought under the notice of honorable members affects the honour of this Parliament, and is of great concern to many officers in South Australia. Although the present Postmaster-General must meet the case submitted by the honorable member for Boothby, the difficulty is a legacy which was left to this Government by its predecessors, and without wishing to reflect on earlier Parliaments, I say that it is to be regretted that a matter of so much importance was not . settled long ago. I hope that the debate and the inquiry by the Postmaster-General will finally dispose of it. A large body of public servants ought not to be permitted to feel that, although the law is against them, they have a good case in equity. I shall not go over the ground traversed by previous speakers, but shall mention one or two points that have occurred to me. Prior to Federation, the public servants of the States were told that their transference to the Commonwealth Service would not destroy the rights which they enjoyed under State control. In South Australia the principle has been laid down that, whenever a change of conditions is made by the passing of an Act, the status and salaries of existing officers shall be left unimpaired, any alteration affecting only those who were appointed afterwards to the Civil Service. That is a principle which has been recognised by Governments all over the Commonwealth, and I believe outside of Australia, too. In the Convention there was a great amount of tall talk indulged in by those who were advocating the Federation of the Colonies. Very often they must have had their tongues in their cheeks when they were addressing the public, knowing, full, well that a good deal of what they were saying was buncombe, and would not be realized. I do not know whether that was the impression with regard to the rights of civil servants, but. it seems to me .that deception, was. practised in that respect. The Constitution, as submitted to the people, was one which had been drawn up by lawyers. There was a feeling amongst the people of Australia- unwisely, I think - that it was well that lawyers should have the settling of a matter of such great importance,  as laymen, although all very well in their way, knew nothing about such questions. What are the facts of the case? The lawyers knew full well when they indulged in their tall talk that a measure could be passed by the Commonwealth Parliament which would break all the promises made to civil servants, and which, while annulling their rights in equity, would still be sound in law. In the face of that it does not seem to me remarkable that, although leading men had made promises to civil servants that their rights should be protected, they passed a measure in this House "knowing that those rights were being taken away. I believe it is a matter of law that as a State could vary its contracts or the salaries of its employes,- so the Commonwealth inherited all the rights which the States possessed in that respect. I submit that the gentlemen who advocated the adoption of the Constitution knew all that. Unfortunately for the postal employes of South Australia, who, of course, had had no legal training, they accepted the statements of these men, believing them to have been made in good faith, and they have fallen in. In submitting the measure which empowered the Public Service Commissioner to fix the status and the salaries of public servants, including the employe's of the Postmaster-General, what seems to me not at all a fair or just thing was done. A clause could have been introduced directing the Commissioner to recognise the moral claims of these men, and to see that justice was done to them. What was put in the Bill? Nothing at all. We have occasionally heard a quotation from a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, that the men were entitled to all their rights, to this, that, and the other; but that could not have been the opinion of the Attorney-General who sat by him, for he must have known that his colleague in charge of the Bill was allowing the House to draw an inference which would not be borne out. Without passing any reflection, I hold that in consequence of the error of judgment committed by previous Parliaments of the Commonwealth, this grievance of postal employes in South Australia should be finalized. It appears to me that for some reason or other there has been an error of judgment or a general muddle all round. It should be remembered that these men are not lawyers. They are very much in the position of the man in the street, who knows absolutely nothing about law, and who is bound to take in good faith statements made to him by those who occupy responsible positions, and ought to know the law, and how it affects the equity of a- case of this description. Therefore, it is of no use for the Postmaster-General to tell me that his employes can appeal to the High Court, because that Court has already ruled that their claim is untenable. If they appeal to the Arbitration Court, what is likely to be the position? I take it that if they did appeal the Arbitration Court would rule that it had no jurisdiction over matters which arose a considerable time prior to its being clothed with power to deal with appeals from public servants. I am of that opinion, and have hesitated over and over again to advise postal employes in South Australia to place any faith in the jurisdiction of that Court. Now, what course can be taken to finalize this grievance? The honorable member for Angas has stated that it is possible for Parliament to pass an Act to grant the justice to which these rr.en are, in my opinion, entitled. What I would urge the Government to do, and what I believe would bring about finality, would be to submit the equity of the case between the Crown and its employes to the decision °of an arbitrator who might be a Judge, or other person of ability in the Commonwealth. We' want the matter dealt with in equity, and not in law, because we have had plenty of law already. In my youth, in the .Old Country I heard of the fusion of law and equity. There is a fusion of law and equity here, but not so far as these postal employes are concerned. They can get any amount of law which does them an injustice all day long, year in and year out. If the Government will agree to refer the question in equity to an arbitrator of the kind I have suggested it would be competent for the Parliament to adopt his recommendation. I admit that this grievance is well known to the representatives of South Australia, but its merits or demerits are not so well known to other members of this House. It would take the latter a considerable time to make themselves familiar with the merits of the case. I think it would be better settled as- I have suggested. I do not know how the- </para>

                            <para class="block">Government view my suggestion. They may take up this attitude. " As our predecessors were not disposed to act when the matter was ripe, and as the postal employes have evidently slept over their rights for a considerable time, we are not going to intervene." Undoubtedly some Governments would be disposed to take that line of action, but I do not know whether it will be taken by the present Government. It would be no reflection upon their dignity to accept the decision of an independent arbitrator, and if the arbitration should go against the postal employes in equity, they would know that they had had a fair inquiry. They would know that the matter had been fairly gone into, and if the proceedings had not worked out as they thought they would, they would have to put up with the situation. In a case of this kind, the supporters of a Government do not care to oppose them when they have taken up a certain line of action, and there are many reasons why such a question cannot be settled on the best principles in an assembly of this kind. The facts show that this is a trouble which the Minister has inherited. A decision has been given, which I hope will be reversed, and an effort made to finally settle the matter. A few days ago I called the attention of the Postmaster-General to this difficulty, which I have had under my attention for some time, and I am very anxious that it should be settled. Unless it is, it will be raised again in the next Parliament, and is bound to be canvassed until the men feel that their grievance has been referred to some equitable tribunal, and that they have had :i fair deal. Australians labouring under what they believe to be an injustice are not likely to remain quiet. I think that these officers will continue to do their duty to the Commonwealth as they have always done. I take no notice of the threats that have been made; but as long as they have a grievance - and a grievance they have - they will find that there are in this Parliament men who are prepared to ventilate it. If the Government desire a healthy agitation of this kind to cease, the best thing they can do is to devise a means of finalizing it so that we shall be free to devote our attention to the grievances of other sections of the community. We do not want to have this vexatious question constantly before us. I hope that the Minister will disregard the fact that this is a trouble which he has inherited, and that he will deal with it on its merits. I certainly trust that the Ministry will not decide to give us two or three editions of law. We know all about the law at the present time. We know that it seldom helps any one in equity. The law Courts , may afford a very ready means of spending money; but these employes of the Commonwealth have no money to waste on the lawyers, and they have too much wit, I trust, to do so. Money spent by them on the lawyers might just as well, for all practical purposes, be thrown into the sea. I ask the Minister to deal with this grievance from the stand-point of equity, and to be prepared to waive his legal right. The honorable member for Angas said that to grant what was desired would involve an additional expenditure of about ^4,000 per annum; but I am confident that the Commonwealth Government is not so poor as to think it necessary to retain ^4,000, or even <inline font-style="italic">£8,ooo,</inline> year after year if there is any section of the Service honestly entitled to receive it. In the long run, we shall be none the poorer if we deal with this trouble on just and equitable lines. </para>

Honorable members will recollect that the general manager of that company, who was called before a certain Royal Commission to give evidence - and was called first on the very reasonable ground that he was in the best position to give technical evidence as to the affairs of his company - asked permission to make a statement, and that that permission, which had been granted to other persons appearing before the Commission, was refused to him. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member adds to the gaiety of nations, but I cannot otherwise understand him. When the general manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was refused the right to make a statement, he went on talking, apparently, while at the same time the  Chairman  did so; and his attitude before the Commission was described, shortly afterwards, by Ministers, as tantamount to brawling, as contempt of Court, as intolerable conduct, as conduct which not only must be put down, but called for a special amendment of the Royal Commissions Act to prevent the recurrence of such a terrible thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> it was, who, if this be brawling, as Ministers said, brawled. There are, of course, other directors of the company, and one of them happened at the time to be in a delicate state of health. He was the one man who could not possibly have brawled, even had he wished to brawl. When the question of prosecuting the directors of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for their action before the Commission came to be decided, against whom, do honorable members think, proceedings were instituted? Was it the brawler - the alleged breaker of the peace in the presence of Royal Commissioners? Not at all. The Government went for the man who was too sick to brawl. They went for a man who knew so little about the evidence that it would be perfectly safe to prosecute him, since he could not enter the witness-box and swear as to what took place before the Commission. Had they proceeded against the alleged brawler, he would have been able to go into the Court, and on oath state exactly what were the facts, and, bearing upon those facts, why he thought it was unreasonable to ask him to appear before such, a Commission. The Government, however, attacked the unfortunate <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Normand</inline> MacLaurin, a sick man, who had no part in this brawl.

He must recognise that it is not right to do so. </para>

The point really is this : To-day the Attorney-General, in answer to a question put by me, told us that the information laid against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> and others had been withdrawn. I am making the mere passing criticism that it seems to be astonishing; apart from the merits of the question altogether, that where there are a number of alleged malefactors, one should be singled out, whilst the others are passed over. It seems to me that when the Government are about to proceed against a number of persons, they ought to proceed against the principal malefactors first. </para>

                                <para>- This newspaper is not securing the sole right, then? It merely happens to be the only user in Queensland? What a delightful piece of sophistry. This advertisement states most clearly that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard</inline> has secured the sole right to this cable service. The Postmaster-General, in his reply to me to-day, said that it has done nothing of the kind. He stated that the terms upon which this independent cable service receives monetary assistance from the people of Australia are specified in the <inline font-style="italic">Governmerit Gazette,</inline> and that they receive <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 2,000 a year, on the condition that no monopoly shall be established. Yet this Labour daily newspaper alleges that it has received a monopoly at the hands of the Independent Cable Service. The Minister in his reply goes on to say that if the Independent Cable Service has made any such arrangement as this Labour newspaper alleges, he will take immediate steps to terminate the subsidy. As the Independent Cable Service managers know the terms under which they receive the subsidy, we may take it for granted that they would not quarrel with their bread and butter. It is clear, therefore, that this new Queensland Labour newspaper is setting out upon a career of mischief with a lie of the most obvious character. </para>

                                <para>- I received this circular through the post only within the last day or two, and have not had time to ascertain what Queensland newspapers are doing. In New South Wales, one newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> takes the Independent Cable Service, and I presume that there are other newspapers that use it. Surely my honorable friends opposite do not mean to tell me that this service, which the people of Australia are paying for, is specially provided to cater for Labour journalism ? Do honorable members opposite mean to assert now what they denied with so much heat when the proposal to establish this service was before the House - that arrangements are in existence which will prevent any other paper in Australia getting this publicly-subscribed-to cable service? </para>

                                <para>- It is very convenient for the Government to be able to tax the public of Australia to start a newspaper like this - the first Labour daily, I believe - which cannot even state the fact correctly as to how it is getting this cable service. If the paper were as accurate as it states it is going to be in its news, it would have said that this cable subsidy was granted with the express intention of helping the institution of Labour dailies in the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- The circular says that this paper has secured the" sole right"; and even the Honorary Minister, in his most honest moments, could not rise to heights of mendacity equal to this. I suggest that it is "a little bit over the odds " when Ministers try to tell us that the brains and intelligence of their party - the persons they select to preach the gospel to the public in black and white; not in red ink - do not know the difference between the " sole right " to a thing, and being the only user of a thing. It may be possible that this newspaper is the only user of the service, but the statement that it has the " sole right " is untrue and unworthy, and augurs badly for the future decent conduct of the first Labour daily newspaper in the Commonwealth. I do not wish to detain honorable members any further; the time I have taken is due to the refusal of my friends opposite to appreciate the plain English of this red-type advertisement. I implore honorable members who take an interest in Labour journalism - I implore the sophists opposite, including the Honorary Minister - to advise their friends in Brisbane that it is bad business - I do not ask them to advise on commercial morality - to issue false advertisements as to the nature of a publication to be issued. I hope that this circular will be immediately withdrawn, and that the first issue of this newspaper will explain to those persons who have been induced to subscribe by a false advertisement that it was not intended to convey anything that was not the truth, but the fact was that those who issued the circular did not know the difference between having the " sole, right " to a thing, and being the only newspaper that cared to use the right. </para>

                            <para>. - I desire to take this opportunity to make a few remarks in reference to the classification of the Public Service in South Australia. I should have preferred a direct motion on which we could come to close quarters, because in this connexion there has been trouble ever since the classification was made a few years ago. I feel confident that until justice is done to those who are affected there must be continuous trouble. I do not blame the present Government, for this is a heritage from previous Governments; but, all the same, 1 he results are most unfortunate for members of the Public Service. Men who were well advanced when the classification war. made have been made junior to others who joined many years after them, and, further, in some cases they have, for many years past, been deprived of a portion of emoluments which they received when in the service of the State. It is true that these payments ' were made under different forms, but, under the State Government, they were recognised as part of the salaries attached to the offices. Perhaps the worst case of the lot is that of an old public servant who was utterly "broken up" by this classification. He had given long and faithful service, having joined about the same time as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd, and he found that under the classification he suffered to the extent of ^150  3  year. There are- many other cases in which loss has been sustained, though, as  1  say, the one I have cited is, perhaps, the worst. It is quite clear that at the Federal Convention, when this question was discussed, it was fully intended that, under the section which has caused the trouble, the rights and accruing rights of the transferred public servants were to be preserved. I wish to make a brief reference to the points raised in connexion with this matter at the Convention. When clause 83 of the Commonwealth Bill was before the Convention in its original form, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Mr. Justice,</inline> Gordon, one of the delegates from South Australia, drew attention to the fact that it did not cover all rights and accruing rights of transferred officers. He was followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, who said - </para>

                                <para>- There has never been a mark against them. Their present position is due entirely to the classification. Quite a number of officers who filled important positions for years are to-day receiving far less remuneration than when they were taken over by the Commonwealth. I am quite sure that that was never the intention of the framers of the Constitution. I do not believe that it is the intention of this House that the injustice which these public servants have laboured under for so long should continue. If the Minister finds that he is legally not in a position to do justice to these men, I am satisfied that this House will support him if he takes the necessary action on grounds of equity. The men for whom I am speaking, and whose case has also been put by the honorable members for Hindmarsh and Boothby, desire only fair play, and they will never consider that they have been given fair treatment while the settlement of this matter is deferred. We cannot expect that men who have had up to £150 a year cut off their remuneration, and who have been classified as  juniors to men who were boys when they held prominent positions, will be satisfied with such a condition of things. I trust that the Minister will have a thorough inquiry made into the matter, with the object of having justice done to a number of public servants from whom it has been withheld for a very long time. </para>

Based on the present rate of cutting, this would be equivalent to about thirty-two years' supply. To the south of the Blackwood River there are also considerable supplies of this timber; but, being so constantly intergrown with karri, blackbutt, and red gum, no fair estimate of quantities can be given. In addition to these areas, there are several millions of acres of jarrah country not of sufficient commercial value for milling purposes, but which will, as the railway system develops, afford immense scope for sleeper-hewing. </para>

I hold that the sleepers for that railway should be hewn in this tract of country, which is suitable for no other purpose. Men can hew them there in a quarter of the time that they can be obtained by any other means. I have had tens of thousands of sleepers hewn, so that I know what I am talking about. Where time is a consideration", obviously it would be common sense to adopt the course which I have suggested. By doing so, we should obviate the necessity for spending thousands of pounds in erecting mills, and providing machinery, horses, whims, &amp;c. The report from which I have quoted conclusively proves that in the construction of the transcontinental line, we should use timber which is suitable only for sleeper hewing. We ought not to utilize the timber of our best forests in building this transcontinental railway, when we have large areas of country which is suitable only For the hewing of jarrah sleepers.

Practically none of the sleepers had been renewed when the line was purchased, and since that time the Railway Department has renewed about 4,300, equal to about 3.9 per cent. in eighteen years; and the balance is still in the road. </para>

                        <para class="block">There is no mention of karri. Wandoo is not much used, because it is so expensive to cut. During the time that I have been in Western Australia, karri has been barred in Government specifications, and had we put it in the railroads, we should have done so at our own risk, and should have had to take it out again. Although the Commonwealth Government is undertaking an enterprise such as it has never before engaged upon, and its officers, perhaps, have no practical knowledge of Western Australian timbers, it is ignoring the experience of that State, and failure is bound to follow. Karri was used in the first jetty at Port Darwin, which was constructed with iron spans and karri beams, but the 'white ants ate the beams, and the teredo riddled the piers. Honorable members must bear in mind that in this matter the Commonwealth has nearly ,£2,000,000 at stake, everything being made to depend on the success of a process called powellizing, which may be a good one, but on which we are not justified in risking so much with bur present knowledge of it. It will take nearly ,£1,000,000 to provide the first lot of sleepers for the railroad, and the replacing of them with jarrah will cost a great deal more, because the work will have to be done without disturbing the traffic, and the replacing of sleepers under such circumstances costs ten times as much as the original laying. The acid sap of karri eats away the dogs, which, if removed after they have been in position for a time, are found to be flaked with rust. </para>

                                <para>- I shall deal with that directly. It is necessary, in any preserving process, to first withdraw the sap from the timber, by creating a vacuum, or in some other way. Freshly cut karri is as full of moisture as a carrot, containing 40 per cent, of water. To be powellized it is put into a bath, but I have been told that when timber so treated has been afterwards cut up it has been found that it has not been affected for more than one-eighth of an inch from the surface. On only one railway in Western Australia were karri sleepers used, and every one of them had to be pulled up, because they rotted so much that* in treading on them one's foot sank to the ankle. Karri is useless for sleepers, unless it can be preserved. For waggon building, and other work in which it is exposed to the weather, it is one of the finest timbers of the world when properly seasoned, but should be cut two or three years before being used. I built between 150 and 200 railway waggons with karri, which had been cut for over three years, and no finer timber could have been used. The freshly-cut karri will shrink as much as an inch in a foot, so that if you want a length of twelve inches you must cut thirteen. The karri to be used on the proposed line will have to be carried altogether a distance of 800 miles, and, as 30 or 40 per cent, of moisture is to be found in the freshly-cut wood, it will be seen how costly its transport will be. Even if jarrah sleepers had been determined on, a supply should have been commenced as soon as the construction of the line was agreed to, because the longer sleepers have been cut before being used the better they last. Australian timber rarely gets a fair show in railway construction in this country. When it is exported to South America, India, and other places, it is laid down in a much better condition than here, because of the seasoning it has received while lying in stacks previous to shipment and on its journey. We are risking nearly £2,000,000 on the faith of an experiment made with thirty sleepers put into a cutting near Perth, 400 miles from the proposed railway. They were laid on sandy soil, and it is known that white ants will not work on such soil, unless there is clay with it, because they always use clay for their covering. I sent the following telegram to find out the position - </para>

                            <para>Karri sleepers have never been used in Government railway construction. Great Southern Railway was laid principally with karri, which had to be replaced with jarrah. A few years after existing railways experimented with about thirty powellized karri sleepers in cutting between East Perth station and river now reported good as day put down six years ago. Small quantity untreated karri laid same time and place rotted within two or three years. </para>

                                <para>- It has been made for six years with thirty sleepers, but we are going to use 3,000,000 sleepers. Why did they make the experiment in a country where white ants cannot live? Why did they make the test in the sand near Perth? In dealing with railway construction inland, there is quite a different proposition. It is not only a matter of white ants, but also a matter of dry rot. I saw at Broken Hill years ago verandah posts which had been put into dry soil. While that portion of a post which was above the surface was as sound as a rock, one could kick his foot through that portion out of which the dry soil had taken all the nature - dry rot had made it perfectly useless. </para>

                                <para>- From the Prime Minister of New Zealand. I wired to the head man there, in case my statement might be questioned. The fact that this timber powellizes for waggon-building has nothing to do with matter, because I can prove without doubt that before powellizing was invented karri was a great success for waggon-building, and was always looked upon as a good timber. What has the fact that powellized timber is good for waggon-building to do with the position? The best excuse which they can find for these sleepers not being unsatisfactory is that the process was not properly carried out. That is what they say afterwards. It is more likely that the process was properly carried out in experimenting with a few sleepers than it will be when millions of sleepers are being handled, and the cry is constantly coming, " Send them along; we* must keep the work going." That is the time when the process must be done in a rush, and it will not be carried out properly. I claim that we are taking too big a risk in this matter - a risk which should not be taken when there are millions of acres available from which to get hewn sleepers of the best jarrah. We should not be asked to make this experiment. We certainly should not act on five or six years' experience of only thirty sleepers. </para>

I personally advocated the use of jarrah sleepers in the work, but the reports concerning the powellized karri are favorable, and it is to be hoped that the anticipation will be realized to the fullest extent; though I regret to say that from what I saw in Melbourne an effort had been made to push forward the karri rather on the demerits of jarrah than upon its own merits. This, in my opinion, is altogether wrong. Jarrah has a world-wide reputation as a durable timber. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. I want honorable members on that side as well as on this side to look at this matter without any feeling. I desire to protect the Commonwealth from a big error. I wish to do this in the interests of the Commonwealth, and not of a particular State. When we have in Western Australia timber which is suitable for the purpose why should we make an experiment? The question at issue is of so much importance that we should not be experimenting. I doubt whether it was ever mentioned when we were considering the Bill that this was to be an experimental railway in applying material which had never been used before, or that we were to experiment with processes which would make some material altogether unsuitable before that date suitable now. We are not authorized to make these experiments. We should proceed on good fixed lines - on a certainty. We ought to build this railway so as to get the best use of it for the greatest number of years. We should adhere to some well -beaten track, using good material. I advocated the use of  80-lb.  rails, and I wish to congratulate the Government upon using them, because to-day I read a report to the effect that the great Canadian Pacific Railway Company had decided to pull up the last part of their  60-lb.  rails, and to put in  80-lb.  rails. There is no harm in our being a little ahead of them, because it is recognised throughout the world now that a heavy rail is the cheapest in the end. Would it not be a calamity if under these splendid rails we were to put sleepers which would have to be continually renewed, because if they will get dry rot anywhere, they will get it there? I do not know of any place in Australia where it would be more costly to carry material, and to pay wages for men to renew these sleepers a few at a time, than it would be on that long stretch of line. I trust that the Government will seriously consider this matter. If, as the Minister has told me, a contract has been entered into, I hope that they will look through the papers, and see whether it cannot be cut down to the minimum. If we are to have an experiment of this kind, let it be a small one, and let it be made at either end of the line, where the sleepers can be kept under close supervision, and, if unsatisfactory, can be readily removed. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is to say it eats away the " dogs" -  than was the case with any of the  other  saps.  First of all, we have the statement that dry-rot is assisted by the decomposition of the sap, and then we have the further statement that the sap of karri is found to decompose when exposed to the air. The effect of this sap on the " dogs " is very like that of spirits of salts. It is so acid  that  it eats away the " dogs " altogether. In this report, a table is given showing the moisture per cent. of  dry  weight in various timbers. In this, it is shown  that  there is  54  per cent. of moisture for green karri of all sizes, and that for sizes up to  30  square inches sectional area, there is  38  per cent. of moisture after six months, whilst for sizes from  60  to  80  square inches sectional area, there is 37 per cent, of moisture after twelve months, and  28  per ;cent. after two years. This is a very heavy percentage of moisture. Every one knows .that the eucalyptus tree contains .a certain amount of acid, but an excessive quantity is found in karri. "The sap breeds a fungus. If we take .a piece of wood which is full of moisture, and place it, .as we do a sleeper, on the surface of the soil, we find that a fermentation takes place, and breeds a fungus which is very like a cobweb. It then proceeds to rot, in an oval shape, leaving the corners. I have seen karri sleepers rot in this way. Many people have told me that, in the interests of Western Australia, I should not bring this matter before the House, but I bring it forward in the interests of not only Western Australia, but Australia generally, believing that I should not do justice to myself or to the country if I did not place before honorable members all that I know in regard to this matter. I should have liked before speaking to look through the reports which the Minister has kindly consented to lay on the table of the House to-morrow, but I hope that other honorable members will do so with a view of determining their true value. They will find that those reports have been made by people who have not had, as the right honorable member for -Swan and I have had, an experience of Western Australia extending over twenty years. They come from people who know little or nothing about the country, or it may be that they are connected with the Powellizing Company. That company has nothing to lose and everything to gain by the use of these timbers. I think that the Powellizing Company could be induced to view this matter in a reasonable light. It is immaterial to them whether they "powellize" jarrah or karri. Even if we use jarrah sleepers we can, if it is thought necessary, powellize them. </para>

If it is true that powellizing is a good thing, by all means let us powellizedd the good timber, and use that timber on our railways. Let us powellizedd timber which is known to be suitable for use as railway sleepers, and not a timber that has been proved to be unsuitable. </para>

                            <para>.- I desire to 'refer to the question introduced (by the honorable member for Boothby, regarding the rights of a section of <inline font-style="italic">-the</inline> Public Service in the employ of the Postal Department in South Australia. This much-agitated question was carefully considered -by myself, and, to some extent, by my fellow -members of the Postal Commission when we were inquiring into this great service. We devoted much time to the consideration of the question whether we as a Commission could deal with a. matter of such complexity as this eventually proved to be, and the majority of the Commission finally decided that we could not. In view of its many interests and issues it was considered that it was not a matter that could be reviewed effectively by such a Commission. My own opinion is -that it should form .the subject of a special inquiry by an individual qualified to analyze and to assess the merits of the case. We referred to the matter in our report, and expressed the opinion that it was one with which we could not deal. I feel, however, that it should be settled one way or the other. There is no doubt that these men were led to believe, prior to Federation, that their rights would be preserved. Some misrepresentation certainly took place. The statements I have read convince me that those who tried to satisfy these men that their interests would be safeguarded under the then pending Federation either sought to deceive them or were themselves unaware of the exact powers in regard to classification conferred by the Constitution. This question at first involved a very large number of officers, but the number is not as large as it was at the time of the Public Service Commissioner's classification. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon.</inline> - They are dying out. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WEBSTER.-</inline> Many of _ them have had their cases adjusted in the ordinary working of the service, birt there are some who still feel that they are labouring under an injustice- They felt that the rights which! they had under the State <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> should have been preserved to them, and that they were entitled to receive from the Federation that treatment which they were led to believe was safeguarded under the Constitution. But to investigate the matter fun. requires a -qualified person .to give the whole of his attention to it. He must look into the merits of the four "or five issues involved. Then he must consider the unadjusted cases, and make a recommendation to the Government for dealing out justice. I am well aware that the Public Service Commissioner, standing on his rights, with the judgment of the High Court behind him, has set aside these claims. He considers that there is no room for further discussion. I do not agree with him. Even if the High Court decided upon some technical point of law that certain men had not rights which they were led to believe were reserved to them, this Parliament could not afford to allow an injustice to continue. It would be to the credit of the Postmaster-General if he would set aside the domination of the Public Service Commissioner in this matter. The judgment of the High Court was a very convenient one as affecting the Public Service Commissioner's classification. I do not wish to consider now the methods whereby the Service was classified. I shall not deal at length with the anomalies that were left unadjusted, and the many apparent injustices that were created. The whole subject bristles with difficulties. Considering the haphazard methods adopted in the various States for assessing the value of the services of individual officers, it is astonishing to me that more trouble did not arise out of the classification than was the case. But while many difficulties have been adjusted during the last few years, and whilst the Public Service Commissioner has climbed down from his high pedestal, and practically set aside all those essentials which he had insisted upon during eight years of administration, nevertheless there remains this small section to whom, apparently, justice has not been done. I do not know how the Postmaster-General regards the matter. It is essential that he should say something.  His  predecessor, the present Minister of External Affairs, made things rather worse than they were before. He promised these men that they should have an opportunity of discussing the merits of their case with the Public Service Commissioner- That was a proper promise to make; and I fail to see why any officer should be so high and mighty as to deny a body of men the right to present their case to him. If the Commissioner had a just case, there was no need for him to refuse to listen to fair representations. If he had not a just case, and the case of the men was right, he was not acting as a fair-minded public officer, but in an arbitrary manner, in not allowing the men to have an opportunity of explaining the grounds of their contention. </para>

It was for that reason, apparently, that he would not respect the promise which the ex-Postmaster-General made to these men that they should have an opportunity of", presenting their case from their own standpoint. When the ex-Minister approached the Public Service Commissioner, evidently that officer told him in so many words that the case was closed. I say that the Minister was weak in accepting that position. The Government in other matters forced the Public Service Commissioner to climb down. There is no doubt about that. He should have been forced to climb down in this instance. The Minister should have persevered respectfully and courageously in his attempt to induce the Commissioner to give these men the opportunity which they and all other officers had when the Royal Commission was pursuing its inquiries. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; he refused to carry out the Minister's promise. I take it that the ex- Postmaster-General was perfectly sincere when he made his promise. Any man in his position would naturally think that these officers were entitled to a hearing; but when he came to Melbourne his promise went by the board. I say, unhesitatingly, that these men should have an inquiry. I do not want to go into the case fully, because it would require some time to deal with ali the details ; but it is sufficient to know that the matter in dispute cannot be dealt with by Parliament, or b&gt; the Postmaster-General, who has not time to unravel a difficulty of the kind. It can, however, be dealt with by an officer capable of analyzing evidence, and of seizing the facts of a difficult position. I trust that the Minister will see his way clear to give the House a promise that the matter will be finally, settled by some tribunal that will be called upon to give him that guidance which is necessary to determine whether the claim of the men is equitable or otherwise. There is no necessity to say anything more, because the matter rests with the Minister. If he will not grant an inquiry, this House can do nothing. I am. satisfied, however, that honorable members have no desire to see any public servants labouring under what they believe to be an injustice. Feeling as I do in this matter - knowing that much of the trouble has been settled, and believing that more will be settled in the future - I see no reason why the Minister should not grant an inquiry, which would not cost a great deal of money or occupy much time if concentrated on the one case. This would rid this House, and relieve the State, of what has been a source of difficulty ever since I came into Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; and I should have been very much better pleased if I could recommend karri timber, <inline font-style="italic">Eucalyptus divericolor,</inline> which is one of the finest of the eucalyptus trees in the world, and a valuable product of Western Australia. I do not suppose there is another timber that grows so high or has such girth, and I should have been glad to be able to say nothing but what is good in regard to it. However, I owe it as a duty to this House and to my country to do my best to see that, in the construction of this railway, only, such timbers are used as have stood the test of time, and proved their durability and other qualities. A plentiful supply of the renowned jarrah, <inline font-style="italic">Eucalyptus marginata,</inline> may be. obtained closer to the scene of the construction work, as cheaply, and, indeed, I think more cheaply, than can karri. Jarrah is in universal use in Western 'Australia and is largely exported, and has been used for many years in the construction, of railways, jetties, wharfs, and so forth, where durability is required both in and out of water, and under and above ground. Karri timber, on the other hand, is excellent for superstructures, and, as the honorable member for Fremantle has said, for the manufacture of waggons and many other similar uses. This timber has tremendous strength, and is used for very long spans in preference to other timber ; but never for sleepers in the construction of railways. About 300 miles of the railway constructed by the Great Southern Land Company to Albany was constructed with karri sleepers, jarrah being used for the remaining fifty ; and I know from personal observation that the karri rotted in a very short time, and had to be replaced with jarrah, whereas the original jarrah sleepers lasted for the ordinary period of fifteen to twenty years. In my opinion the Government are taking an unnecessary responsibility and risk in electing to use karri. I cannot understand what has induced them, in a great work of this kind, to select timber which, except in the instance I have given, and in the case  of  some jetties at Carnarvon, and further north, where it proved a failure, has never been used for the purpose. In Western Australia there are 3,200 miles of railways - Government railways for the most part - and all have been constructed with jarrah sleepers. I- never heard of any other timber being used, but I can well understand that the wandoo, <inline font-style="italic">Eucalyptus</inline> redunca, might be suggested as a very hard " timber ; although this could not be found so near the scene of the work, nor is it so plentiful as jarrah. With these facts before us, what can be said  of  a Government who ignore all previous experience in a great work of this character, in which sleepers cannot be replaced except at considerable expense. The selection  of  karri cannot be due to the fact that it is the more plentiful or cheaper, or can be obtained near at hand. There seems to me no practical reason whatever for this decision of the Government. </para>

                                <para>- I think that jarrah is the cheaper of the two, seeing that it will not have to be carried so far, and that it is just as easy to work. I saw some prices quoted which seemed to indicate that karri sleepers, powellized, are dearer than jarrah sleepers; indeed, I fancy that the price paid for the few thousands of jarrah sleepers already used is lower than that of karri. I have been associated with the construction of railways in Western Australia for over thirty years - from the construction of the first railway to the present time - and with the one exception I have mentioned, which proved disastrous, when the karri was the closer timber, jarrah has invariably been selected. The only reason for the decision of the Government is that there is a Socialistic wave in Western Australia at the present time, and the State Government are carrying out a good many works. It has occurred to the State Government that they can run Government saw-mills and cut and supply timber. I have read in the press, and I have no doubt the statement is true, that most of the convenient jarrah country is leased to private companies. It is not an inexhaustible product, although there is an immense quantity of it in Western Australia. A great deal of the good karri country is still in the hands of the State Government. They do not propose to lease it, but to work it themselves. There is railway communication near to the karri country, and it could easily be taken into it; and in carrying out their policy the 'State Government propose to erect mills and supply karri timber as a Government enterprise. If they can get a large order from the Commonwealth Government they will be assured of an easy market for their timber. The karri is a good timber for superstructures, and no doubt for that purpose the State Government could get a market for it beyond Australia, though not for use as sleepers; but if would be much more convenient for them to make a contract with the Commonwealth Government, and to be able to send the timber by rail from their mills straight away to the place at which it is to be used. There could not be any objection to that if the timber were suitable for the purpose. I do not say that the powellizing process may not yet be proved to be all that is claimed for it, but I do say that our experience of it ls so limited that we are not justified in using powellized karri sleepers for this very extensive work. </para>

                                <para>- I have no desire to say anything against the karri timber. It is not to the interest of any member of this House to decry any product of the Commonwealth. At the same time, we should not let our interests carry us away in so important a matter. I was anxious to find out all about this proposal to use karri timber, and at the beginning of the session asked several questions on the subject of the Minister of Home Affaris. I cannot say that the honorable gentleman met me in the spirit in which I had a right to be met. There were several attempts made to avoid answering the questions. To such an extent was this the case that I at last gave up asking questions on the subject. I was answered as if I had some ulterior object in view, and desired to serve some party purpose. My questions were not answered as they should have been answered. I asked whether karri timber was being used in the construction of railways in Western Australia. The Minister, said it was. I did not pursue the question, but I now deny that it has ever been used in the construction of railways in Western Australia, except in the case I have mentioned where it proved disastrous, and the Minister must have been grossly misinformed when he made that misleading reply. To say that karri was being used in railway construction because thirty powellized sleepers were laid on a line as an experiment is a subterfuge. It was dis-: creditable .to the Minister to give such an absolutely incorrect answer. I then thought that I would apply for information to the Commissioner of Railways in Western Australia, whom I know very well. I asked him what length of line in Western Australia had been laid with powellized karri sleepers, and in what locality. I could not get an, answer. The honorable member for Fremantle has given an .answer, and I should like to know why I could not get one. I think it must have been because the Government did not .desire that I should have the information. I think that is a reasonable conclusion for me to arrive at. At any rate, we now find that thirty powellized karri sleepers have been laid down in Western Australia. If it was desired to make an experiment, a mile of line, in different localities, should have been laid down with these sleepers. The fact that thirty powellized karri sleepers laid in one locality have stood a good test for six years should not be sufficient to induce any reasonable-minded Minister to embark upon an expenditure of about £1,000,000 for powellized karri sleepers for a great undertaking such as the Trans- Australian railway. I am surprised that the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Defence, who know all about the matter, should be parties in any way to so great a risk being run in connexion with this undertaking. We should let the company concerned go on powellizing karri and other timbers, and give them every opportunity to show the durability of powellized timber. No one will rejoice more than I shall if they are successful. But we should not permit any one to foist upon the Commonwealth timber for sleepers,, whether powellized. or not, the 'durability of which we have not jet had sufficient experience of. We know that karri timber, if it is not powellized, is useless for this purpose. Another thing which has to be borne in mind is that no mills have been erected yet for the cutting of these karri sleepers, and that it will take several mills to cut the number of sleepers required by the Commonwealth Government for this railway. </para>

                                <para>- I expect that many of them will be used green. It would be better, of course, if they were seasoned before being used. As no mills have yet been erected to cut these sleepers, I should Tike to know when they are to be delivered. I think the Government pro"posal means delay, and unnecessary delay. On the other hand, it would be an easy matter to let contracts for the immediate supply of jarrah sleepers. There are two or three companies in a position to supply jarrah sleepers at a reasonable rate. I saw that the price paid for jarrah sleepers recently was less than for powellized karri sleepers. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. Most of the jarrah sleepers used in Western Australia are not sawn sleepers, but have been cut by hewers, and they are really better than sawn sleepers. Large areas of jarrah have been specially reserved for hewers, and there would be no difficulty in getting a large supply of jarrah sleepers. Why, in the circumstances, do the Government turn aside from this big and certain supply to follow this will-o'-the-wisp down into the karri country where no mill has yet been erected? </para>

                                <para>- That is so; whereas there are many lines already connected with the jarrah country, and there is an  army  of hewers at the work of cutting sleepers. I may say that practically all the sleepers- used on the Western Australian railways' are provided by hewers. Why all this risk - all this delay? It is intended to assist the Western Australian Government in their Socialistic enterprises. I do not mind that, so long as they provide the Commonwealth with a good sleeper; but why should we incur all the risk ? I will not be a party to foisting upon this Commonwealth a timber which has not been proved to be suitable for railway sleepers. The suitability of karri depends upon the effectiveness of the process of powellization, of which we have had insufficient experience. I am surprised that, notwithstanding the plentiful supply of. jarrah which is available for the purpose, the Minister of Home Affairs should have lent himself to this scheme, which will only bring discredit on him and injury to the country. </para>

                                <para>- For experience of it, I can only go- to those countries in which it' has been tried. The honorable member for Fremantle, and' the honorable member for Swan, stated that, with the exception of six years, we had had no experience of the process in Australia. But even that six years' experience has been sufficient to demonstrate the superiority of powellized karri over un-powellized jarrah. I know that a storm of opposition has been created because we have seen fit to go outside of certain specified timber rings to obtain the sleepers required for the construction of the transcontinental railway. Recognising, that, I shall' endeavour to put before honorable members the opinions of men who are without bias upon this question. For a long time I was not prepared to adopt powellized sleepers - at any rate, not until I had had a thorough examination1 made of them; but I do not believe that because our great-grandfathers and grandmothers did not change, we ought steadfastly to refuse to change. We know that the things which suited them wil'l not suit now. What would be thought of us if to-day we insisted upon travelling by the old stage-coach instead of by  railway train? We do know that for the past six years  powellized  karri sleepers and  un-powellized  jarrah sleepers have been down in Western Australia. </para>

                                <para>- In that State the two sleepers have been subjected to a fair test. I propose to show honorable members that whilst the jarrah sleepers have been bored through with white ants, the  powellized  karri sleepers are just as good as they were on the day they were laid. In fact, they are better. They are more durable. From that six years' experience, it seems safe to predict that they will last thirty or forty years longer.; and we know that fifteen years is the average life of a sleeper. I hold in my hand a copy of a memorandum dated 17th July, 1912, from the Engineer-in-Chief of Railways to the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, which reads - </para>

                            <para>With reference to the Powell wood process, I beg to furnish the following notes : - </para>
                            <para>On the 2nd May, 1911, I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Light,</inline> Chief Engineer of Existing Lines, Government Railways, Perth, asking him for information as to his experience, and his opinion, of the process. On the 31st March, 1910, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Light</inline> forwarded a letter to the managing director of the Australian Powell wood process, stating that certain karri sleepers were treated by the Powell wood process in 1906, and were placed on the road on the 16th November, 1906, alternately with some untreated karri sleepers. In November, 1909, an examination was made. One sleeper of each kind was handed over to the Departmental analytical chemist, who showed that the untreated sleeper was affected with dry-rot, but that the powellized sleeper was free from disease. </para>
                            <para>A report on the Powell wood process by Professor Norman Rudolph, M.Sc. (Victoria and Liverpool), Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland, Chief of the Department of Applied Chemistry of the Indian Institute of Science, deals chiefly with the treatment of Indian timber, and is undoubtedly very favorable to the Powell process. </para>
                            <para>There is a report dated 20th August, 1907, by Professor D. F. Mackenzie, Fellow of the Surveyors' Institute, Fellow of the Botanical Society. It concerns the treatment of three sections of karri sent to him to test for "dry-rot" on the 13th November, 1906. The specimens were embedded " in active dry-rot " for nine months. The untreated timber became covered with fungus. The treated timber remained unaffected. </para>
                            <para>There is another report by Professor Mackenzie, dated 4th November, 1905, where he writes, apparently to the Powell Company, that he is prepared to indorse all that they claim for their process. </para>
                            <para>Professor G. S. Boulger, F.L.S., F.G.S., F.R.H.S., A.S.I., in a book written by him, says that the processed wood will take paint or varnish, and is completely immune to the attacks of dry-rot. . </para>
                            <para>On the 24th July, 191 1, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bethell</inline> wrote te* me forwarding two samples of Victorian mountain ash, both out of the same board, one in its natural condition and the other powellized seasoned, showing a very great improvement due to the process. This was in compliance with a request which I had made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bethell</inline></para>
                            <para>On the 2nd September, 1922, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Light,</inline> Chief Engineer of Existing Lines, Perth, wrote to me on the subject of the Powell process. He said : - " Some years ago a number of processed sleepers, karri, were placed in the line sandwiched in between sleepers badly affected with dry-rot, and have stood the test well, proving thoroughly resistant to the inroads of the fungus. " The Public Works Department also has carried out exhaustive tests with powellized timbers in the north-west of this State (where white ants are particularly numerous and voracious) to determine the efficacy of the treated timber in resisting the attacks of the termites, with generally satisfactory results." Then he adds : - " The value of the treatment having been- fairly well established, the Government authorized the construction of a powellizing plant, and one capable of processing on an average 9,000 sleepers per week has been erected at Bunbury." </para>
                            <para>I think it will be seen that the evidence as to the effect of treatment of karri by the Powell wood process is very favorable. </para>
                            <para>Since writing the above, a telegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Light,</inline> Chief Engineer of Existing Lines, Perth, conveys the following information : - " Powellized karri culvert perfectly sound, although erected for test purposes inside old jarrah culvert, which has been destroyed by white ants." </para>

                            <para>The question of the supply of sleepers is one of considerable importance. The forests in Australia where the best classes of timber grow are becoming rapidly depleted. This is particularly the case on the eastern side of the continent, where, at one time, ironbark was considered the only timber suitable for sleepers. Since then, owing to the growing scarcity of ironbark, other very good but relatively inferior timbers are being used. </para>
                            <para>In Western Australia the forests in the southwest can yet be depended upon for large supplies. Jarrah is the only suitable timber, karri not being sufficiently durable or resistant to white ants. -"The Railways Department of Western Australia possesses a powellizing plant, and the results are said to be most satisfactory. The process seems to cause a wonderful improvement in the quality of even poor timber. </para>
                            <para>In Gippsland and Tasmania there are large forests, including the so-called mountain ash, messmate, and bluegum. These timbers treated by the Powell process seem to be completely altered. Judging by results on other timber, they would resist the ravages of white ants and dry-rot, in which case they should make remarkably good sleepers, and afford a source of supply for the South Australian end of the railway. I have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bethell,</inline> the manager of the company in Sydney, to furnish me with particulars of the plant which would be suitable for erection in Port Augusta, on the assumption that it would be necessary to treat  4,000  sleepers per day. </para>

                            <para>On the 17th November, 1909, one set of these sleepers was examined in the road, and "dry-rot " was found to exist in some of the non-treated ones. One of each kind was removed from the line, and has been examined by the Departmental Analytical Chemist, a transcription of whose report I have much pleasure in submitting hereunder for your information :  - " With regard to the above, I have to state that I have physically examined the two sleepers submitted. I find that the untreated karri sleeper is affected with  dry-rot.' This timber disease seems to have travelled in a certain direction, as one side and the end are the parts most affected. I found in several places along the side that the apparent affected area extended to a depth of five-eighths of an inch. At these places the fibrous nature of karri has almost disappeared, having given place to a granular and friable mass, which can be readily removed with the finger-nail. This structure is best seen with a microscope, which explains the cause for the disintegration. </para>
                            <para>It is impossible for me, at this stage, to say whether the 'dry-rot ' has penetrated deeper. If it has, the fibre has not been visibly affected by it. </para>
                            <para>I have examined the powellized karri  sleeper, and find it free from the above disease. In no part of the sleeper could any of the fungi be found, and the fibre is sound all over the portion exposed. The condition of this sleeper is much more sound than the untreated sleeper." </para>

In order that this test might be thoroughly reliable, I took care to produce and maintain the necessary conditions to induce the attack of the " dryrot" fungus. These conditions are moisture, temperature, and full contact with a vigorous fungus. As is well known, the moisture and an equable temperature predisposes the wood by dissolving the soluble matter and softening the cell walls, rendering it liable to attack from fungoid plants, and thereby causing rapid decay. </para>

These were all attacked by this "dry-rot" and partly consumed, while those sent by you had no appearance of being even touched by Mycelium, and, what may be considered a good feature, the tissue was hardly at all affected by months of contact with moisture. </para>
                        <para>Examining the tissue of your treated timbers under the lens of a powerful microscope, I did not find a single " thread " of Mycelium or a spore. There being no penetration by Mycelium there was, consequently, no disintegration of the cells or general tissue. </para>
                        <para>Making a similar examination of the untreated wood, I found the whole tissue permeated with the Mycelium of the " dry-rot " fungus, with a large proportion of the cells and tissues disintegrated and collapsed. A more severe test than I have made would be impossible to carry out. </para>

                            <para>With reference to the powellizing of sleepers and timber for the transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, we assume that at least two million sleepers will be treated out of the total amount required, and that at least twenty million feet of timber will be required for various other works and buildings, or, say, a total - not taking into account any future requirements during the continuance of the patent - of one hundred million super, feet. </para>
                            <para>The royalty we asked, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> two shillings (25.) per 100 super, feet, is the same amount that we are receiving from other Governments, and would amount on this basis to ^100,000. We are willing, however, to accept the sum of sixty thousand pounds (,£60,000) payable in cash or Treasury bonds, for the right to use the Powell process during the continuance of our patent, for the treatment of all timbers required by the Commonwealth Government in connexion with the transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. </para>

                        <para>The amount we would receive per sleeper is about fourpence, which is small compared to the value in the lengthened life of the sleepers, apart from any cost of renewals, and the results of the process to date are as definite as it is possible to be. </para>
                        <para>With regard to the white ant resisting timbers, we venture to emphatically state that there is no timber suitable for sleepers that will resist the attacks of these pests, more particularly those in the country through which the proposed line will pass. </para>
                        <para>The Western Australian Government recently powellized the whole of the jarrah sleepers and scantling required in the Port Hedland to Marble Bay Railway, and are enlarging their present plant to powellize all timbers used by them. </para>
                        <para>It has been found by the Indian railways that the ravages by white ants and dry-rot were increasing to an alarming extent, so much so that a Commission was recently appointed to go into the question. The report of which shows that timbers hitherto looked upon as dry-rot and white ant resisting, were found to be quite the reverse. Two further powellizing plants are to be erected in India to cope with the increasing demand, so satisfactory have been the results of all tests made. </para>
                        <para>We would also take the liberty of pointing out that the establishing and proving of the Powell process in Australasia has entailed the spending of large sums of money, but its proved efficiency" will make thousands of acres of inferior timbers into valuable marketable ones, so that the benefit to the country at large is of such magnitude as to make the sum we ask of small account; and with all due deference we would point out that the use of steel sleepers - inferior as we think they admittedly are to wooden ones - would probably entail the spending out of the country of considerable sums of money which would otherwise be spent here. The adoption of the process would doubtless be of benefit to us, but it would also be a great advertisement for Australian timbers throughout the world, whereas the use of steel sleepers would be the opposite. </para>
                        <para>We quite recognise that the powellizing of this amount of timber will entail considerable outlay on the part of your Government in the erection of works, but we think this amount will not reach twenty thousand pounds (£20,000), nor do we think the cost of these works should altogether be put against the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway; we hope and believe that the benefits of the process will be such as will induce the Commonwealth to treat other timber for further works. </para>
                        <para>The plant is one that, owing to its nature, suffers only slight depreciation, and we have no doubt that should it meet with your wishes, the South Australian Government would from time to time take advantage of the plant being on its territory, to have timber treated there. </para>
                        <para>We take the liberty of sending herewith some few reports and testimonials. </para>

                        informed me that all the Government Engineers have convinced him that powellized karri is better than treated jarrah, and as the karri forests are quite in the hands of the Government, whilst the jarrah areas are almost exclusively in the hands of. Millars Company, the State Government are determined to utilize this timber (karri) for their own benefit.

                        the Chief Engineer for Existing Lines, is thoroughly convinced that treated karri sleepers are better in every respect than jarrah, and that the extra cost for the powellizing will more than, double the life of an untreated jarrah sleeper.

The right honorable member for Swan has put to me many questions relating to the railway, but no one knows better than he does that when things are at the experimental stage - when they are in a state of nebulosity - it is unwise to tell every one about them. If you do, the whole world is in your business, and, indeed, knows, your business better than you do yourself. No matter how successful a man may be in managing a business, he will find that there are some people who have failed in a great many undertakings, but who think nevertheless that they can manage that business, a great deal better than he can. I therefore keep these things to myself, not that I desire to give unkind or unsatisfactory answers to questions put to me- </para>

                        <para>. - Earlier in the afternoon the honorable member for Wentworth, under cover of a circular which he said he had received from the promoters of a newspaper in Brisbane, made a very serious attack upon the Independent Press Cable Association, and also upon the directors of the projected journal. Assuming that the honorable member was prompted by the highest of motives, namely, to protect the interests of the Commonwealth and inform the House of some wrongs-doing, he was quite right in bringing the matter forward. The new Cable Company is drawing a subsidy from the Commonwealth, and if the honorable member's statements were true, they were sufficiently serious to warrant a reply. I do not think that the honorable member ought to be ignorant of the position, in view of disclosures which, have been made in this House. There are two Press Cable Associations operating in the Commonwealth for the purpose of supplying news to journals published here; One is known as the </para>

                        Cable Syndicate enjoyed a very close monopoly up to a certain point, and had control of the whole of the cable news distributed throughout Australia and New Zealand. It exercised its monopolistic powers to the extent that the newspapers that came in at a later stage were charged very much higher rates than those which constituted the original syndicate. Further, any newspaper entering into the syndicate had to sign an agreement, carrying a penalty of £1,000, not to deal with any other cable association. Then, again, the syndicate claimed the right to determine what newspapers should participate in the service and the conditions under which they should enter. It was contended, and I think the evidence is fairly conclusive, that the promoters were animated by certain political bias ; so much so that the conditions .they laid down for newspapers that did not conform to their opinions were practically prohibitive. So that, under this arrangement, newspapers advocating strong or ultra-democratic views were practically excluded from the service.

                            <para>- That was one of the strong inducements which led this Parliament to subsidize a cable service that would be free from such monopolistic con'ditions. The outcome was the formation of the Independent Press Cable Company. This organization has had a very severe fight against the <inline font-style="italic">Argus-Herald</inline> combination, which had practically secured' all the large newspapers, and held them1 in the thrall of its agreement, which prevented them from publishing cable news that came to them from other sources. It is well known that a newspaper in New South Wales, when the new company was in the stage of formation, took an option upon its news. But, although it obtained the news, the journal was unable to publish it because of the existing agreement with the other syndicate. The newspaper only got the right to publish the news when it entered into liquidation and secured other and better conditions, relieving itself of the legal obligation to the older press cable syndicate. The articles of association of the Independent Press Cable Company have been published, and the honorable member for Wentworth could have informed himself concerning them. They stipulate that -the news obtained shall be available to alt newspapers desiring to purchase it, irrespective of their political opinions. The news can be published by Conservative newspapers or by ultra-democratic journals. </para>

                            <para>- That is true ; but surely the honorable member would not say that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is an ultra-democratic publication. The 'Independent Press Cable Company knows no political opinions. Its service is open to newspapers of all shades of political thought on equal terms. The company does not differentiate between one newspaper proprietor and another because one came in earlier than another. One of the conditions laid down in regard to the subsidy is that the news obtained shall be available to the whole press of Australia upon the same conditions, and irrespective' of the political views that obtain expression in thacolumns of the journals. It is, further, a condition that the news shall be transmitted' over the All-Red Cable line, a service which the Commonwealth of Australia has to subsidize, and for any deficiency in the working of which it is partly responsible. The subsidy is open to 'the <inline font-style="italic">Argus-Herald"</inline> combination, if that combination is prepared to conform to the conditions laid" down ; and the fact that it has not applied1 for the subsidy is a fair indication that it will not comply. I cannot understand' how it is that, in the face of these facts,, any honorable member can make the charge  of giving exclusive rights to a particular - newspaper. The Minister is quite right to say that he will have the matter investigated, but I venture to predict that such an investigation will only substantiate the position I have stated. This Cable Company is true to its articles of association, and to the undertaking it entered into with&gt;. the Commonwealth, namely, to make its service available to all newspapers, irrespective of their political opinions, and on the same terms. As regards the projected newspaper in Brisbane, I have not been favoured with a circular such as that claimed to have been received by the honorable member for Wentworth. All I know is that there is a project for a new daily paper which will be in strong contrast to the newspapers already published there, inasmuch as it will be thoroughly democratic. It may be that this newspaper will be the only one to use this cable service, but, if so, that will not be because the service is not open to other newspapers; it will be because those other newspapers are bound by agreement with the <inline font-style="italic">Argus-&gt;Herald</inline> Press Cable Syndicate, and cannot, except at very heavy loss, publish a cable coming through any other channel. This Parliament voted a subsidy for the purpose of establishing a company free of monopoly rights ; and it ought to be made known that the garbled statement of the honorable member for Wentworth is not in accordance with fact. </para>

                        (North Sydney [8.0].- lt is a very serious matter for the Government, in embarking on a big undertaking such as that of a transcontinental railway, to accept sleepers for practically 1,000 miles of line without being absolutely certain that the sleepers will be serviceable. Nothing that the Minister has told us would convince me, nor, I think, honorable members opposite, that karri sleepers will prove more durable simply because they have been powellized. In company with the Minister of External Affairs and other honorable members, I was shown blocks of karri and jarrah by the superintendent of the railway workshops at Port Darwin. Some of those blocks had been subjected to the powellizing treatment, while others had not; and I can say emphatically that, while the blocks which had been treated were not so badly infected as the others, they had been riddled through and through by the white ant.

                            <para>- That may be so. I know that the man in charge of the railway sheds at Darwin, who had long experience of conditions in the Northern Territory, assured us that, so far, no timber is known which will resist the ravages of the white ants, and no process has been discovered which will make timber proof against white ants. On these facts it is quite clear that the Government will not be safe in depending upon karri sleepers merely because they are to be powellized It has been admitted by the Minister of Home Affairs himself that, assuming both are untreated, the karri timber is inferior to the jarrah timber. It may be assumed from this that if the jarrah timber were powellized it would be superior to powellized karri. I have no personal knowledge of the matter, but listening to the debate I have come to the conclusion that karri timber is not procurable at a lower rate than jarrah. In all the circumstances, I ask why we should decide to use timber which is known to be inferior when we might use a superior timber? We have had no explanation from the Minister of Home Affairs as to whykarri sleepers are to be used in preference to jarrah. I am given to understand that there is a reason for the preference. We learn that it is in contemplation by the State Labour Government of Western Australia to erect State saw-mills, and the Commonwealth Government have decided to use karri sleepers for the transcontinental railway merely in order to put work into the hand's of this Socialistic concern. That, I believe) is the true reason- for the decision arrived at. </para>

                            <para>- It should not be forgotten that it is, the. people of the Commonwealth who must foot the big bill which will have to be paid for sleepers for that railway. I suppose that to secure and lay down the sleepers will cost about  £2, 000,000.  It is not fair that the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, including those who do not believe in these Socialistic enterprises, should be taxed merely for the benefit of a few  individuals  engaged in a Socialistic experiment. The Minister of Home Affairs in his reply dealt with nothing but reports from various, individuals as to the efficacy of the powellizing process to prevent dry rot. He quoted no report from a recognised authority asserting that powellized timber will resist the ravages of the white ants. Before we are committed to the use of karri sleepers for  1,000  miles of the trans- Western Australian railway we should be absolutely certain that they are the. best for the purpose. I do not think that the Minister of Home Affairs can be absolutely certain that karri sleepers will be a success on that railway. </para>

                            <para>- I speak of what I know. I cannot positively swear that the timber I saw at Darwin was powellized. I can only say that the superintendent, of the railway sheds there showed us the blocks of timber. He said, " This is powellized, and this is not. This is a piece of jarrah, and that is a piece of karri." The Minister of External Affairs was present at the time, and we examined the timber, and! shook it to remove from it the dust which was caused by the ravages of. the white ants. We found that: the whole of the timber shown us had, been more or less perforated by white ants. I wish now to briefly refer to another subject. I am glad that the Honorary Minister representing the Minister of Defence has corrected the statement he made yesterday in reference, to the cadets'.. I hope that the honorable gentleman will in future treat me as fairly as I have treated him in this matter. I might very easily have taken him at a disadvantage, because as he might have, gathered from my interjections, I knew when he was, speaking that he was making a mistake. To be quite certain I went down to the offices of the Defence Department, and ascertained that his statement was not correct. Instead of coming back, and charging the Minister with deliberately making an incorrect statement, I arranged practically with his officers that he should be informed that his statement was not correct. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to say a few words in regard to the order about which the Honorary Minister made a mistake. It was issued, by the Defence Department, and required cadets to do field-firing with ball ammunition. Yesterday the Honorary Minister said that if I had read that order I would have seen that only those cadets who had proved themselves efficient were to be selected to take part in these competitions. But I would point out that it is absolutely impossible for any cadet to become efficient with the rifle, because he has only a few hours in which to qualify himself. </para>

They must have it in their pouches. In carrying out this field - firing practice, the cadets will be in extended order, So that it is absolutely impossible to comply with the regulation. I now wish to say a word or two regarding the number of cadets who have used the rifle at all, and in this connexion I propose to quote from the report to Parliament of the Minister of Defence himself. Let us see how many cadets actually use a rifle. Appendix vi. of the Minister's report sets out that the annual musketry course for </para><para class="block">Senior Cadets is to comprise twenty rounds, which are to be fired at distances of 100, 200 and 300 yards. Part II. deals with instructional practice at 300 and 400 yards, at which distances twenty-five rounds are to be fired. In other words, forty-five rounds are allowed for the annual musketry course for Senior Cadets. Now, there are .92,276 cadets in the Commonwealth. How many of these have gone through this very simple course of musketry? How many have fired even the forty-five rounds of ammunition? The Minister states in his report that the number of partially exercised cadets is 2,077, and the number who have completed the course is 3,117- Only 3,117 of our cadets out of 92,276 have gone through this simple course of musketry. Yet this most inexplicable order has been issued that cadets are to engage in field-firing - a tactical exercise. The thing is simply grotesque. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Absolutely. Field-firing is the highest exercise which can be carried out by a soldier. After he has passed through a recruit's course, which occupies at least from seven weeks to three months of continuous training, he has to undergo the trained soldier's course, which occupies him for a further period of six months. Yet under this order boys who have never used a rifle are supposed to engage in the same exercise. The order will have a bad effect, because there are many military men whose sons are cadets, and they know the danger. </para>

                            <para>- I do not deny it. They were successful because the order was ignored, and the only teams competing were composed of State school or college boys, who had been trained with the rifle for years. The teams were not formed from the ordinary area cadets. The danger lay in the initial procedure in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> areas. </para>

                            <para>- Boys should not have field practice until they have been through their musketry course, and have become efficient with the rifle. It is a mistake to allow boys to go through field practice at all. There will be time enough for that when they enter the Citizen Forces. There is a serious danger in field practice even with adults, because the men have to act largely on their own initiative. They have to load, fire, and judge distances. </para>

                            <para>- The order made it incumbent on Area Officers to select teams by giving the cadets field practice. That was a blunder which the Department should see is not made again. The order is still in force, but its effects will not be so bad in the future, because next year there will be more boys who have gone through the musketry course, though there will always te recruits coming in. The danger was greater last year, because the boys only got their rifles in November. </para>

                            <para>- Because the order was ignored. It had to be ignored to prevent disaster, but it is against all traditions of military discipline to ignore an order from head-quarters. Another serious matter is that, although the universal training regulations say that the cadet officers shall wear uniforms, not a single garment has been supplied to any cadet officer, notwithstanding that , the scheme has been in working order for sixteen months. This is very discouraging to the officers. To military men it is incongruous to have officers -in plain clothes drilling boys or men in -uniform. You may occasionally see officers ; in uniform drilling ununiformed recruits, although that looks bad enough, but it is a horrible sight to see a man in mufti drilling boys or men in uniform. I would no more go out in front of a body of uniformed men in the suit that I now wear than I would try to fly to the moon, because I should look and feel out of place if I did so. There is a great deal in clothes. You can call it sentiment, but when a soldier dons his uniform he feels he is a different man. I know it from my own case. Uniform has an effect upon the men under you, and makes your position and theirs clear and distinct. </para>

                            <para>- I think that would be absolutely wrong. I have had brothers under me. Of course, when out of uniform we call each other by our Christian names, and act with perfect freedom, but when we are in uniform it is a different matter. If I noticed that certain lines were not clean I would ask, " Where is Captain Ryrie?" He would come, and I. would say, " Captain Ryrie, what is the matter? I see that there are certain things wrong in your lines." He would salute, and reply, " Yes, sir." I would say, " See that it does not occur again." A man cannot act in that way unless he is in uniform. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that you would call the Boers an army. A great many of them had uniforms ; whenever they could get a uniform they wore it. It has- been a cause of very great dissatisfaction to those who have volunteered to fill the position of commissioned officers in the Cadet Forces that they -Have not been given uniforms. I know a case where the .young wife of a man who had volunteered to be an officer went to the area office, and asked " What sort of a uniform is John going to have?" He told her that he would get a uniform. She was as pleased and proud as Punch, and John was waiting every day for the uniform, but it never came. He was always wondering, and she was always wondering, about the uniform, but it never came, and he resigned. So it is with a great number of these officers. </para>

                            <para>- It is disgraceful that the uniforms which it is laid down in the regulations shall be served to these men, and which have been promised over and over again, have never been given. A great many officers have resigned purely and solely because they have not been able to get uniforms, because they refuse to go out in plain clothes in front of the boys to be jeered at. Do honorable members know that there are parsons, chemists, drapers, and all <inline font-style="italic">sorts</inline> of men who have volunteered to become officers, and good officers they would be if provided with uniforms? Do they expect a parson who has to preach in the pulpit to go out in his clerical robe, and choker collar to drill boys; do they expect a draper who has to serve customers over the counter to go out in the suit he wears in the shop, to be laughed and. jeered at by the boys? That is altogether subversive of discipline. Honorable members may laugh as they like, but it is a serious drawback to the success of the cadet scheme that the Department has not yet supplied cadet officers with a single garment of uniform, although they have been promised it for so many months. In regard to the cadets generally, one of the greatest grievances that Area Officers have is that the work is not fairly apportioned. I find that there are good grounds for this complaint. In the metropolitan areas, an Area Officer can do the work in a few hours, and then attend to private business, and the remuneration or allowance of ^150 a year is sufficient if he has only one area to attend to. I think that in the metropolitan' centres we might put more than one area in the charge of one good man, and give him sufficient remuneration ito make it worth his while to give up his private business, and attend to that work only. But in the country areas, it is a" different matter altogether. I can assure the House that the officers in these areas have absolutely not one minute to spare, and that it is impossible for an Area Officer there to attend to any private business. Here the allowance of <inline font-style="italic">£150</inline> a year is not sufficient remuneration - at all events, it is not sufficient to attract the men whom we should have in the service. In my opinion, the Minister ought to consider whether he cannot more fairly apportion the work of the Area Officers, and knock two or three areas into one in the metropolitan centres. I am quite certain that one good Area Officer could attend to more than one area there because he has only one training centre or drill hall to go to, and has the cadets more under control. They do not live long distances away. He can get his parades over in a short time, return to his office, and attend to his work. The unfortunate fellow who has to put in the whole of his time gets only the same remuneration. There should be some alteration made in the arrangements. In looking over the Inspector-General's report, I was surprised to find that he does not mention any of the matters to which I have referred. He makes no reference to the failure of the Department to supply uniforms to cadet officers. The only reference which he makes, I think, to the uniforms of the cadets is in a statement that the hats supplied were too small. I think it is part of his duty to inquire into all these matters. When Major-General Kirkpatrick came out here, at the inception of Lord Kitchener's scheme, we took it that he would report all these matters through the Military Board "fo the Minister, and I am rather disappointed to find that such reports have not been made. With regard to the Pay Department, the delay which takes place in re-imbursing both Area Officers and sergeant-majors the sums which they have to pay in the carrying out of their duties is a source of very great dissatisfaction. I have come to the conclusion that the fault lies with the civilian member of the Military Board. I have had some knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Laing</inline> in the State of New South Wales. I have every reason to believe that he is an estimable man, and has no wish to retard the work of the Minister, or the carrying of this scheme to a successful issue, but he is steeped in conservatism and red-tapism. I do not think that he can help it. I really believe that he is honestly trying to carry out his duties properly, and there is no doubt that he is a capable man ; but, as I say, he is a Conservative through and through, and is steeped up to the very ears in red-tapism. </para>

No notice has been taken of resolutions carried and recommendations made at a Conference of Area Officers and the Instructional Staff at a big school held at Victoria Barracks, Sydney. At that Conference these delays were discussed, and it was recommended that the Area Officers, instead of receiving only£10 out of the contingent fund in each area at the commencement of the financial year, should receive  . £25,  and that there should be no delay in giving them this money. How they hoped to carry out the recommendation that there should be no delay I do not know, but, at all events, they thought that there should be no delay in reimbursing officers after the first payment had been made. No notice was taken of that recommendation.  </para>

Incidents of this kind cause dissatisfaction among, the cadets. I do not know on whose report the Minister based his letter, but there can be no doubt that -an effort is being, made to put all the blame on Cadet Roberts. The facts of the case are that a policeman, called, at CommanderRoberts' private house, and, entering it, served the toy with a summons. This lad, who had shown the greatest enthusiasm in his work, and had attended every parade, was served with a summons owing to the. blundering of an officer. There is only one remedy for this sort of thing. It is that the people themselves should take the matter in hand. Let them wake up, and return to this House men who have some knowledge of military matters. If they do that, we shall have a different! state of affairs. Is. there no man in Australia who is. able to put things right ? When the Inspector-General was appointed we thought that he would set everything right, and see that Lord Kitchener's scheme was carried out in its entirety. We have some ground,. I think, for a little disappointment in. this regard. I do not know what is the reason, but it. seems to me that things are drifting in connexion with, the great scheme of compulsory training. They appear to be drifting hopelessly,, and it will be. a. very sorry day for Australia if we allow them to drift to such an extent that it will be impossible to place the system on a sound footing. I hope that the Minister, and' his Department as a whole, will endeavour to see that these matters are rectified ; that there is no delay in making payments to the Area Officers, that cadet officers obtain their uniforms, and that the cadets themselves are not subjected to treatment which discourages them, damps their ardour, and does away with- their enthusiasm. If that be done, we may still hope for success; we may still hope to be able to create the great citizen army that we may require some day to defend our hearths and our homes; but, if not,, we can- look forward only to failure. </para></speech>

                            <para>- In the Boer war I think there were some 50,000 Boer soldiers - they were hardly called an army - who had not a uniform amongst them. I saw pictures of them in the newspapers, and if I remember rightly the only uniforms they had were those which they took off their opponents. It is not necessary, I think, and I hope it will not be necessary in Australia, for our soldiers to work up Dutch courage in that way. I can well imagine the. honorable member to be of. the man-milliner type. I understand that some of our officers belong to that class; but I should be very sorry to think that all the military officers in Australia were like the honorable member. He probably spends most of his- time discussing with his brother officers as to whether he should have four buttons or three on his coat. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. Possibly he does wear stays. Before long we may have him brought before the Courts for wearing hat-pins without shields, I could not help thinking, when the honorable member was speaking, of a story I heard about him. I am informed that when he goes abroad he travels with a set of boxing gloves and a German concertina. I do not know what he does with the boxing gloves; it may be that he makes his opponents giddy with punches from them, and then sends them mad with a tune on the German concertina. I leave it to other honorable members to explain how it is that one who holds such fiscal views as he does should travel around with a German concertina. But that is not the point with which I wish to deal now. </para>

                            <para>- Well, he is a Knight Commander of something. However, whatever he is, I object to his statement that I am not telling the truth. I appeal to honorable members as to whether we were not told that the Western Australian timber which is to be used in the construction of the railway is not suitable. Probably millions of money are at stake, and it is time that we took into consideration the warnings of these two honorable members. It is evident that if Western Australian timbers are used we are likely to lose a considerable amount of money. </para>

                            <para>- That remark only confirms me in the opinion I have already expressed, that before we powellizedd any timber, we should try to powellizedd the Fusion, to prevent the dry-rot which is, apparently setting in. I have read that there have been many inventions in the nature of concrete sleepers. I suppose that more than a dozen have been patented at the Commonwealth Patent Office. One man has invented a concrete sleeper, and another has improved upon it. In fact, I believe that many improvements have been made. The Minister ought to ask for a return from his officers as to the various inventions of concrete sleepers. In that way we might possibly avoid the expenditure of a tremendous amount of money, and save the lives of many of the people who use the railway. If we are going to use such rubbishy timbers as have been described this afternoon by the right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Fremantle, we may suffer a serious calamity. The matter is of very great importance, and the House is indebted to the two honorable members who have given us the benefit of the information which they possess. If there is any honorable member who ought to know the qualities of Western Australian timbers, it certainly is the right honorable member for Swan, because he has made many explorations in Western Australia, and no doubt he has become acquainted with these timbers. He certainly knows good timber from bad. </para>

                        <para>.- The discussion which has arisen in connexion with sleepers has introduced an exceedingly serious subject. Last session, on the nth November, this very question came up. There was an item in the Estimates for making provision for the storage and testing of certain timbers. Then the question of preserving timbers was mentioned, and I understood that the Minister informed the House that experiments would be made. But, apparently, we have waited until the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway is being commenced; and now the Minister tells us that experiments are being made with the powellizing system. We all know that that is a simple system. It consists either of steaming or boiling timber to remove the sap, and then dipping it in a solution of molasses and arsenic. The question is whether  if  is the steaming and the removing of the sap, or the ingredients used afterwards, that confer the benefit on the timber. The steaming of planks for boat-building has been done in my own State ever since I can remember ; and there is no doubt that the process does improve timber, and make it easier to handle. We ought to remember, however, that the Western Australian Government have never used karri sleepers for a mile of railway. I think that the honorable member for Capricornia was labouring under a mistake in regard to what was said by the right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Fremantle. I understood those honorable members to say that jarrah, which is admittedly one of the best timbers in the world, is exclusively used by the Western Australian Government as railway sleepers, though we find that, when there  is  a contract with the Federal Government, about 1,500,000 sleepers are " run in" which they would not put down themselves. The Minister said that the number was 600,000  or  700,000, but I find that in answer to a question in the House he said that the Western Australian Government were supplying 1,500,000 sleepers, consisting of 680,000 of powellized karri, 100,000 of jarrah, and 720,000 untreated karri. It has been said that powellizing will convert an inferior timber into a superior timber. It will  do  nothing of the kind; there is no system  in  use in Australia, America,  or  Great Britain which will do so. There is  no  doubt that powellizing will make a good timber better,  or an  inferior timber better ; but there is  no  process  on  earth that will make the inferior  Karri  equal to jarrah, much less equal to the bluegum  or  stringy bark of Tasmania. Has there been  a  fair deal ? Has every State been given the same opportunity to compete ? During the whole of the session I have been trying to ascertain the terms of the contract, but without success. </para>

                            <para>- No; but I have always thought that the position of Honorary Minister, if not unconstitutional, is very near it; and I never heard a better or stronger argument in condemnation of the office than that by the present Prime Minister in the case of the late Government. The public works now undertaken represent many millions of pounds. The railway to Western Australia will cost anything from £5,000,000 to , £8,000,000, and the railway from Port Darwin southward will, on the Minister's own estimate, cost£10,000 a mile, which means, for the  1,000  or  1,100  miles, from£10,000,000 to £11,000,000 for construction alone. Such stupendous works ought not to be the business of a mere branch of a Department ;, and it is time, as I say, that we had a Public Works Department, with a Minister at the head of it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish the Minister to take my remarks as personal. I am not making a personal matter of this at all. I am merely pointing out, what every honorable member knows, that during the last five years the work, of the Home Affairs Department has been multiplied three or four times. We are putting upon that Department responsibility for work which could be very much better carried out if it were separated from the Home Affairs Department. If my honorable friend the Minister of Home Affairs would prefer to look after the construction of public works, there is no reason why he should not become Minister of Public Works. It is unreasonable to expect a Minister charged with responsibility for the ordinary business of the Home Affairs office to properly supervize such enormous expenditure, approaching, perhaps,  £20,000,000,  as will, be involved in the public works which are to be carried out at the Federal Capital, the construction of the line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta, and the construction of this great Western Australian railway. It is time the House and the Government seriously considered the question of a re-allotment of Ministerial portfolios, and the creation of a Public Works Department. One mistake in connexion with the great public works which we have in hand may involve a loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds to the people of the Commonwealth. The mistake now being made by the Government in deciding to use karri sleepers for the Western Australian railway may involve us in enormous loss. These sleepers will 'probably cost  10s.  each, and we are being committed to an expenditure of about  £750,000  for sleepers of practically untried timber, which has, so far, been condemned by everybody who has tested it. It is not fair for the Government, the Parliament, or the people, to expect any one man to shoulder the enormous responsibility now placed on the Minister of Home Affairs. It does seem strange to me that the bluegum and stringybark sleepers of Tasmania should have been turned down as they have been. </para>

                            <para>- Why has not a test of them been made? Why has the Minister decided to use karri sleepers, when he must know that that timber has been condemned, that there has never been a. single karri sleeper exported from Australia, and that only a few of them have been put down as an experiment by the Western Australian Government? Tasmania is exporting millions of feet of timber every year in the shape of railway sleepers, which are sent to South Africa, America, China, and different other parts of the world. It does seem strange that when Tasmania can secure tenders for sleepers in competition with the timbers of the world, the Commonwealth Government should adopt an untried and an unknown timber. Honorable members are aware that the sleepers used in Tasmania are small sleepers, compared with those which will be used on the Western Australian railway.  1  have here an expert opinion on the life of a Tasmanian bluegum sleeper. I quote from a pamphlet by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> O. Green, which has been circulated by the Tasmanian Government, and for which they accept responsibility - </para>

                    <para>The Tasmanian bluegum sleepers, under the heaviest rainfall under which any railway sleepers are tested, are shown to have an average life of fourteen years. Yet the Minister of Home Affairs turns that timber down without a fair chance, and accepts a tender for 1,500,000 sleepers of a timber which has been condemned, and which the State Government of Western Australia have not used. The State Government have been able to secure an enormous order from the Federal Government for the use of these karri sleepers without any reasonable experiment. I think that the timbers to be used on the Western Australian line should have been subjected to careful experiment. Had it not been for the enormous amount of work in the Home Affairs Department, no doubt the promise made twelve months ago to have timbers tested would have been carried out. Powellizing is not a new thing. It has been known for some years at least. Before accepting a tender for sleepers for this tremendous work, the Minister should have carried out severe tests of the timbers to be Used. It is not fair that the people of Australia, who will have to find the money, should be committed to the use of this untried timber. It may not yet be too late to carry out some tests of the karri timber. The order for these sleepers has been given to the Western Australian Government, and we cannot believe that they would seek to take advantage of the Commonwealth in any way. I suggest that the Minister should even now have these karri sleepers subjected to a severe practical test. They have never been tested yet. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to take advantage of the statement which the Minister has just made. But I would" urge the Government to pause before committing this country to the expenditure of£750,000 without knowing where it will land us. I have spoken upon this subject, because I believe it demands the serious attention of the House, because I believe the Government have been rushed into the acceptance of this tender by the Government of Western Australia without giving the matter proper consideration, and because I think that in a desire to help along the newly-started socialistic industry in karri timber they are going to commit the Commonwealth to a costly experiment. Their action is not fair to the people of Australia, and I would appeal to the Minister to try our known and tested timbers, at least, in the construction of the first few miles of this railway. From the orders which have been given there does not seem to be very much in the nature of a monopoly in timber. About half-a-dozen different companies have supplied jarrah to the Government under contract, but the only contract for karri which has been accepted is that with the Western Australian Government. I admit that jarrah is a good timber, but I contend that every test which has been made shows that bluegum is a better. It stands at the head of the timbers of the world from the point of view of the breaking test. It has been tried in Tasmania for fifty years in connexion with various works, and today is as good as it was when it was laid down. The stringy bark is not far behind it. The Minister is simply looking for trouble when he turns down these known timbers in order to experiment with1 a timber which has never been used, even in the State in which it is grown. The chief claim which is made for the powellizing process is that it enables timber to resist white ants. But if it will add five years to the life of a karri sleeper it will also add five years to that of a bluegum : sleeper. I make bold to say that if a karri sleeper be subjected to the same  treatment as a bluegum or stringy bark sleeper the bluegum or the stringy bark will outlast it twice over. So, too, will the jarrah. From whatever stand-point we may .view this question the tried timber is superior to the karri. If the process of powellizing will add five years to the life of a five-years' sleeper, thereby making it last ten years, it will also add five years to the life of) a fourteen-years' sleeper, making it last nineteen years. Under all these circumstances, I urge the Minister not to court disaster to the Commonwealth. When we consider that many millions of sleepers are to be used in the construction <inline font-style="italic">of-</inline> this railway, is it not manifestly unfair -to the taxpayers that we should plunge into such an enormous experiment as that which "is contemplated? If the Minister adheres :. to. the position which he has taken up. he will merely cause the House and the country to demand the establishment of a permanent Commonwealth Public Works Department at the earliest possible date. </para>

                        <para>. - Having listened attentively to several honorable members who have spoken upon this question, I am afraid that we are up against a very tough proposition in the matter of the kind of sleepers which should be used in the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. It is very evident that there are no Western Australian timbers which white ants cannot digest. We have heard the right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Fremantle declare that karri is of no use. </para>

                            <para>- Then the Minister of Home Affairs read a number of testimonials to prove that jarrah cannot live alongside of powellized karri. Thus we have a general condemnation of the timbers of Western Australia, As we know, white ants are very bad in that portion of the Commonwealth, and as the dry-rot is worse we shall have to consider this matter very seriously in the near future. Both the right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Fremantle told us that karri sleepers will not last more than five or six years. The Minister of Home Affairs read a letter from a gentleman which showed that, after being down six years in a bed in which jarrah had rotted, powellized karri sleepers were still good. Thus we have most conflicting statements, and consequently we shall have to look round for some other kind of sleeper. I know that some time ago the Department of Home Affairs had submitted to it a combination, of ironstone and cement sleeper. It is very evident that the white ants cannot digest that. </para>

The honorable member for Franklin has put in a few words on behalf of the timbers of Tasmania. It was very good of him, from the point of view of his State. He did not, like the honorable members for Swan and Fremantle, dirty his own nest. He said nothing but what was flattering about Tasmanian timbers, and, in passing, praised those of Victoria, adding, of course, that they did not amount to much. </para>

                            <para>- I was correct when I said that neither of these timbers was any good, according to the evidence which has been placed before us to-night. If such be the fact, and the sleepers are to cost 8s. each, why not use reinforced concrete sleepers at a cost of less than 8s. each, and provide something which the white ants cannot digest? If honorable members do not consider the matter from that stand-point, they will give the people of the Commonwealth something which they will not digest. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened with a good deal of attention all the evening to this interesting debate on the system known as powellizing timber. I listened very attentively to the testimonials which the Minister of Home Affairs read, and the only thing I have to say about them is that they are quite inconclusive, being too old. There is an insufficient amount of data to make them of any use, I think, in estimating the final value of powellizing as a process. For instance, the Minister quoted some statements made so far back as  1905,  but in not one of them did I hear anything which would indicate how long this process had occupied. </para>

                            <para>- Any one who is acquainted with the matter knows that white ants will not eat arsenic without something happening. It is just possible that the lining of this bridge with a dose of arsenic, so to speak, did destroy all the white ants ; but that is not a conclusive test as to the value of the process in connexion with the laying down of a railway for, say, fifteen or twenty years. What I do not understand is the depth of the saturation. For instance, if it only stops the pores of the wood, that may be effective for a little while; that is, until one white ant after another has had his dose and died and another white ant comes up, finds a way in where there is no arsenic, and lives on, and then occur those things which we are told happened in the Northern Territory. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The whole question is, How long is the protection afforded by this process going to last? If it is only going to last for six or seven years, it simply means that after that time the karri timber will be practically useless on this railway. Even the Minister admits that the moment the powellizing is exhausted this timber is very inferior for sleeper purposes. Therefore, he has applied no test to show that by powellizing he will make the life of the karri longer than the ordinary life of a good sleeper which is untreated. That is the test, and there can be no other test which is satisfactory, it seems to me. I would suggest that the Minister ought to go very warily in connexion with this process, and ought not to commit himself to a huge expenditure of money when the whole way is untried, so far as the laying down of sleepers is concerned. Can he point to a railway anywhere where powellized sleepers are used? In connexion with the bridge matter, which has been made so much of, it is admitted, I believe, that karri is good for superstructures. That was mentioned in the report read by the honorable member for Fremantle to-day. That is the information supplied, I believe, where the matter has been under test in New Zealand. They say that it is good for anything above ground, but below ground nobody has yet undertaken to use it, and to trust to it for any permanent works of any kind. Although the Minister has supplied a lot of interesting material, and a lot of testimony to the value of powellizing from these gentlemen, it must only go for what it is worth. I submit that he can have no test which he can apply as showing that experience has proved the value of this timber, powellized or otherwise, except the test of practical experience in some part of the world or other. It has not been tried, so far, and I cannot understand why, if the powellizing of inferior timbers makes them into superior timbers, or into timbers which are usable and suitable for the purpose of railway construction, it has not been tried in other parts of the world where the timber problem is a very severe one so far as railways go. There are men to-day all over the world looking for something of this kind, and the fact that even in his own country, where men are specially keen in these matters, the Minister cannot point to a single line of railway laid down with sleepers made of inferior powellized wood shows that the process is by no means conclusive so far as the world's experience goes. I should think that in an undertaking like this, where there is so much at stake, and where every foot of the road has to be pioneered, the place where there is an abundance of good timber dose by is the very place where my honorable friend ought, above all others, not to make experiments. It is time to experiment when he must, but there is no need to do it here. We are told that a better kind of timber is infinitely more available, and is easier and cheaper to obtain. Why the Minister should select an inferior timber with superior timber all round must, I think, pass the comprehension of any ordinary human being. I could understand my honorable friend making experiments if he were hard put to get suitable timber for making .sleepers ; but, according' to all the information we have, it is easier to obtain superior timber. Although there is more of this superior timber close at hand, yet he deliberately selects inferior timber for the purpose of constructing this line. That is a point which has not been answered, and which, I think, requires an answer from this Government. They ought to explain why they are resorting to experiments where they are not needed; why they are taking an inferior timber in preference to a superior one, for use in a part of the country which, because of its peculiarities, requires to be dealt with in the light of experience. Moreover, the tests will not be complete until the two timbers have been tried side by side and it is shown that treated jarrah is inferior to treated karri, or at least that they are equal. I strongly urge the Government, in the interests of the work itself, in the. interests of their reputation as administrators, and of the taxpayers, not to make these experiments until further tests have been carried out. If they are inclined to be experimental in their mood, let them select some end of the railway on which a close watch can be kept, and try the experiment there on a small scale. Why they should commit themselves to this huge expense for an inferior article while a superior .article is more easily available requires an explanation that has not yet been furnished. I hope to hear the Government do more than quote statements - written six years ago- as to the value of the powellizing process. We may admit, for the purpose of our argument, that powellizing is good. If it is - if it will preserve the inferior timber, and make it last longer, it surely will have the same effect upon the superior timber.. It is, therefore, not in point at all to say that powellizing will improve timber. The only point that we have to consider, as guardians of the public purse, is whether this process will make the inferior timber better, while it will not have the same effect upon the superior timber. The life of a sleeper on this line, I dare say, will not be more than fifteen years.I do not quite know what is the average life of these sleepers. </para>

                            <para>- On the average, I should say it would be from fifteen to twenty years. To begin to renew 1,000 miles of railway is not an easy task, and the railway is not going to turn in a surplus of millions so as to enable us to deal with it in this way. </para>

                    <para>This, of all other railway projects, requires the strictest economy and the greatest care in its construction consistent with its efficiency. We are building this trans- Australian railway, not merely because we hope that it will be revenue-producing, but for a Federal purpose pure and simple, and it ought not to be the ground of experimentation for various processes which may or may not prove to be good. I am not going to say one word, good, bad, or indifferent, about the powellizing process. I take the Minister's statements for what they are worth. But let us regard the situation in the favorable light in which he tried to present it. Let us admit that powellizing will add to the life of the timber, and even then we shall .have <inline font-style="italic">vo</inline> reason for giving a preference to inferior timber. In the country yonder, where both these timbers grow - let us say where, in some instances, they are equally available - the jarrah has been preferred. The one has been taken, and the other left. That is what experience teaches the people over there. We are throwing that experience to the winds, setting it absolutely aside, and deliberately selecting a timber the superiority of which has never been proved. On the contrary, its inferiority has been proved wherever it has been tried. The. : is no case in point where the powellizing process has been adopted upon a large scale of this kind, and in connexion with works which have to stand the wear and tear of a railway line. Every one who has tried karri says that it is satisfactory for superstructures, but it has never yet commended itself to the railway experience of the world when used where water has to be faced. The Minister often tells us that he is fit to run the world. He told us upon one occasion, I think, in a burst of exultation, that he thought the world ought to pay him a million or two a year to run its big things. In this case, he is deliberately setting aside the experience of the world. I submit that he ought not to make these experiments when there is no need to. If he were forced to take this step, I should say, " Make a trial by all means." But he is not. This is a deliberate act of choice on h"is part, prompted by some motive which I do not attempt to fathom. It is the duty of the Minister and the Government to show why they are adopting this course, and why they insist upon applying the powellizing process to an inferior timber for use as sleepers on this railway. Unless an answer is forthcoming, it will be the duty of the House to try to learn something more about the matter. I should have thought that the Government would undertake at the earliest moment to make a complete statement of the motives that have induced them to enter upon this departure, and to endeavour to lead the world in connexion with a matter of this kind. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to call the attention of the Postmaster-General to the matter of overtime in connexion with the General Post Office, Sydney. I do not think he can be aware of what is going on there, or he would not tolerate it. </para>

They get no payment for their overtime, and no time off in lieu of payment. I say that this system should be stopped at once. It is nothing more nor less than  a  public scandal. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is what they call a " chaser." It is a schedule. The issue of this interesting schedule by the Home Affairs' Department began in a very small way, but it is developing. What I strongly object to is the political tone that it is taking. I do not want the Minister of Home Affairs to send me the latter part of this stuff. I do not object to the earlier part of the publication. If the Minister will confine himself to telling me how works are progressing in my electorate, I shall be glad, although I must confess that I have not gathered much comfort in that direction up to date. I do not mind that, however, as long as I am reminded that something is being attempted, something done. But when the Minister sends me political argument in this form, I say to him that I would rather make my own political arguments, if he pleases. I should like to inquire whether the section of " Census and Statistics" to which I allude has been inserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> without consultation with the Minister of Home Affairs, or whether the Minister has directed the Statistician to make the compilation in this particular way. For instance, here is an article under the heading " The alleged withdrawal of capital from Australia." It is stated - </para>

                            <para>- When we get this and the other set of figures with the heading, " Alleged withdrawal of capital from Australia," and it is sought to be shown by a reference to figures that there has been no withdrawal, it looks as if this would be a very handy political compilation for honorable members opposite a little later on. Then there is another table setting out the Commonwealth Acts passed, not since the beginning of Federation, but since the opening of Parliament on the 1st </para>

I wish to know whether the Minister directed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> to furnish all these particulars for two years only. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but there are tables now included which might very well be left out. When dealing with State matters, for instance, the Statist goes back for about eleven years, to the beginning of Federation, but when giving details of Federal matters he goes back for only two years, or since the present Government have been in office. </para>

If he is going to run a statement of the affairs of the country on his own, in addition to the publication which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> is getting out, it seems to me that we shall have a duplication of work which will involve unnecessary expense to the country. </para>

                            <para>- I do not object to them at all, but I would advise the honorable gentleman to give us full information upon Federal affairs, and not to make this invidious distinction between the affairs of the States and the affairs of the Federation. We should not have particulars of the affairs of the States since Federation began, and of affairs of the Federation only from the time the present Government took office. That concludes what I have to say at the present time. </para>

                        <para>.- With reference to the last few remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta, I may say that, so far as I am concerned, I am always thirsting for information. My complaint is that the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Book</inline> and various publications issued with a view to giving information do not contain all the information which honorable members and the people generally desire. One has only to make a comparison between the statistical records of the Commonwealth and of' the several States, and the statistical records and information supplied by the Statisticians of other countries of the world, to realize how deficient is the information which we receive from time to time. I admit that I have pleaded with the Minister of Home Affairs, as head of the Statistical Department, for certain information which does not at present appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Book</inline> or our other statistical publications. We only have to turn tq <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall</inline> or to <inline font-style="italic">Webb,</inline> who is continuing Mulhall's work, to discover information as to where the wealth of the community resides, which is very valuable. We know that elsewhere, as well as in Australia, people are calling for information in regard, for instance, to the cost of living. So far from curtailing the information given in the publication referred to by the honorable member for Parramatta, I hope the Minister will extend it considerably. </para>

I cannot say that I have read every page of the recent issue of the statistics, but I saw no political leaning in the references made by the honorable member for Parramatta. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Fremantle in raising the question in respect to the quantity of sleepers to be used in the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line opened up a subject for a debate which has proved extremely edifying. With his consent I have been turning up some of the documents from which he quoted, and I do not think they paint the karri in such black colours as it has been presented here to-day. We know that there were times when the Kings of England and those who were supposed to be quite novices in legislation, legislated in connexion with its forests in such a way that the timber taken from them was better than that which is obtained from our forests to-day. There are periods when timber contains a maximum of sap, and there are other times when it contains a minimum of sap. If we cut it when it contains a minimum of sap it will last longer than will timber which contains a maximum of sap. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly.We sometimes condemn timber as unsatisfactory, because it has been cut when it was full of sap. The same class of timber, whether jarrah, karri, or other timber, will last longer if cut with a minimum of sap than it will if cut with a maximum of sap. The Minister of Home Affairs showed that karri sleepers which had been down for six years in a certain length of railway in Western Australia were as good as the day upon which they were laid. </para>

                            <para>- It would be a magnificent thing for the Commonwealth and for Western Australia if this experiment proved to be a success. We know that jarrah is a magnificent timber. Unfortunately, in Victoria, through the negligence which has prevailed in respect of our hardwood timbers, more Australian redgum can be obtained in the Transvaal today than can be got here. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that Western Australia has noted what has taken place in some of the States, and that the Government of that State is endeavouring to preserve its forests. Future generations, instead of blessing us, will be more likely to curse us for our criminal negligence towards the forestry of Australia. We are a mere handful of people with a great territory, and yet we are complaining of the shortage of timber in certain lines. That is a disgrace to us. Should we not be following the example of Germany, Sweden, and other countries where whenever one of the kings of the forest is hewn down a seedling is planted to take its place? That is the only way to preserve our forests. Seeing that jarrah is extensively used in every State, it will not be many years before the supply will be giving out. </para>

I  have taken out the figures which he allots in his comparison of karri and redgum, about which  I  know more than  I  do of jarrah or karri. They show that karri tallies very much with redgum. </para>

                            <para>- When he made his report he was an officer in the service of the Western Australian Government, and, no doubt, gave the best information that he could supply. A man may be a public officer to-day, and in private business tomorrow. The Agricultural Department of Victoria has just lost one of its most valuable officers, who has joined a private company which intends to buy large estates in Victoria and elsewhere, and subdivide them for purposes of settlement. No man could make the full and complete analyses contained in the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> without understanding the subject with which he is dealing. The honorable members for Fremantle and Swan . are broad-minded enough to be Australians first and Western Australians afterwards, but, did  I  represent that State,  I  should rejoice in the fact that this experiment was going to be made, because of the effect it must have on the other transcontinental line. </para>

                            <para>- We have been told that so many jarrah sleepers are to be used and so many powellized karri sleepers, and about 700,000 untreated karri sleepers are to be obtained.  I  presume that they will not be used on the line itself, because, in the face of the official reports, it would be criminal to so use them. The powellizing process will give opportunities for the use of the new timber, and will benefit the taxpayers. Jarrah timber is mostly in private hands. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is talking about laying down a line solely with karri sleepers, and having to relay it after a little while. These same experts tried this timber after it had been in use for forty years, and found that it had become so hard that ordinary tools would scarcely touch it. Practically, it had become as hard as granite. I should say that this timber, especially when it is powellized, will be exceptionally valuable, but I do not wish to take undue risks. I hope that, after the evidence which has been placed before the House, further inquiry will be made into the matter. Surely the Department would not have moved so far unless they had been thoroughly convinced by expert evidence that powellized karri was a very good timber to use. I am very glad, however, that the matter has been ventilated to-night. I should think that the Minister is not above receiving advice. I presume that in the light of this debate he will go forth, and once more question his officers, and need to be reassured as to whether the step he is taking is justifiable or not. If he is convinced that he is taking a right step, well and good ; but if he is not so convinced, I, if I were in his place, would make further inquiries in order that I might be absolutely assured on the point.I hope that the further evidence which he will be able to collect will prove that karri, when treated, is, as this report says, one of the most valuable timbers in the world for sleepers. </para>
