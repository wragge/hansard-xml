W. H. Irvine, K.C., the member for (Flinders in the House of Representatives? Is the Attorney-General aware that the Postmaster- General stated in his filed affidavit that it would be prejudicial to the public interest and to the welfare of the Commonwealth to allow any inspection of the Wireless Station in the Commonwealth ? Would the Attorney- General be surprised to hear that it was solely in the interest of the public welfare and the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth that the inspection was not desired? Is the Attorney-General aware that the  Hon.  W. H. Irvine, member of this House, is opposing the Government who are taking action in the people&#39;s interests? </para>

                        <para>- I am informed that the Prime Minister has issued a memorandum - No. 591, I believe - to the effect that, during the holiday season, extra leave is to be allowed on the 27 th and 28th December, and on the 3rd and 4th January. I understand that in the General Division this leave is to be divided, half the men taking two days in December, and the other half two days in the New Year, but that in the Mechanical Branch no extra leave is to be given. I ask the Prime Minister if that is his intention? </para>

                        <para>- I have been informed that some medical men are charging, I think, IOS. 6d. for filling up certificates of registration for the maternity allowance, but I have not heard that nurses charge for doing this work. To dispense with certificates would be difficult, and, in some cases, very dangerous, though it may be possible to do without them in cases in which a child lives more than twelve hours, or a number of days after the birth. I regret that so high a charge as I have mentioned is made, and I have already expressed my opinion about it. It is a matter for medical men and nurses, but I do not think that it was intended that an extra burden should be placed on the recipients of the allowance by requiring them to pay so high a fee for so small a duty. </para>

                        <para>- I have given consideration to the representations made by the honorable member, his predecessor, and others. I think that the present position of the quarantine station in Sydney is the best that can be secured in the interests of all parties. If it were removed to a place 20 or 30 miles further north, I am afraid there would be a great outcry by the people who would be obliged to go there and be examined before they could return to the city. If it were possible to effect an alteration which would be in the public interest, I should be pleased to do it. ^ </para>

                        <para>- It is advisable that some document in the nature of a doctor&#39;s certificate should be in the possession of the Treasury officials in addition to the birth, certificate, for reasons that I need not discuss at present. But it should be possible, if the charge made for a medical certificate is excessive - and I think it is - to remove from, perhaps, nine-tenths of the children born the burden of the half -guinea fee. </para>

                        <para>- I stated some time ago that the High Commissioner had informed me that representatives of labour unions had met him, and requested that when we were calling for tenders for the London  offices  certain conditions should be embodied in the specifications, amongst others the granting of absolute preference to unionists. I cabled back, saying that the Government could not accede to that request, but that we were prepared to do what we were doing in Australia, namely, to insist upon preference being granted to unionists, other things being equal. The High Commissioner then cabled to me, intimating that he had met contractors in London, and that if we insisted upon that condition being observed there would be no chance of reputable contractors tendering. We then decided to send <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murdoch</inline> to England, with a view to ascertaining if the buildings could not be erected by day labour. Yesterday I received a cable from the High Commissioner informing me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murdoch</inline> has arrived in the Old Country, and intimating that he now has the assurance of five or six reputable contractors that they will be prepared to tender, even though the condition of preference to unionists, other things being equal, is embodied in the specifications. </para>

                        <para>- Before <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen</inline> went to the Northern Territory he drafted a mining Ordinance. It was, however, thought advisable before definitely dealing with it that he should be afforded an opportunity of visiting the Territory, and seeing whether it was necessary to make any additions to or alterations in it. By the last mail I received from him a complete draft of the mining Ordinance. I trust that I shall be able to issue it towards the end of the year or at the beginning of next year. As regards the suggestion that a copy of the Ordinance should be posted to every post-office in the Commonwealth, I will take that into consideration. </para>

We have done so, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> will be officially informed that the necessary Bills have been passed, and will become law. Those measures are to come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation, and one of the conditions is that Queensland at least shall pass laws preventing the employment of coloured labour in the production of sugar. Subject to that, the agreement will be carried in full detail. </para>

                        <para>- I have had no communication from the Canadian Minister of Trade and Customs for three or four months. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foster</inline> was recalled from London to Canada, but I understand that the Imperial Trade Commission, of which he is a member, will be in Melbourne in March or April of next year. It has been suggested that a Conference should then be held between the Ministers of Trade and Customs, of not only Canada, and the Commonwealth, but of South Africa and New Zealand, who may be here about the same time, with a view to considering reciprocal trade relations between the several countries. As to the resumption of the Vancouver mail service, I do not think that is a matter which comes within my Department. </para>

The honorable member says that I promised &#34;to allow a discussion to take place on the first of these motions relating to the Northern Territory Land Ordinance.

The matter is one of some importance involving an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds, and I desire to know whether the work will be undertaken by the ordinary constructing authorities or whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> is going to carry out his own building projects. </para>

He has asked the Home Affairs Department to exercise the Crown rights in the resumption of the property, and all that part of the business will be done by the Crown. Whether tenders will be called by the Governor of the Bank or by the Department of Home Affairs I am not in a position to say, but my confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> will not be shaken or affected in any way by any action he may take in this regard. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Postmaster-General when we may expect to receive the report of the officer who was appointed about two years ago to look into the accounts of the Postal Department. The officer in question - the Chief Accountant, I understand - was to make special business reports in regard to the telephone as well as other branches of the Department. </para>

                        <para>- In connexion with the report recently laid on the table of the House showing the number of telephone services dealt with by the Department during the last two years, I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has noticed that it shows that, in the division of Calare, for instance, four lines have been constructed, that one is under consideration, and that while no less than ten have been approved, no action has been taken in regard to them. At least one of those Tines was approved as far back as 1 910, and apparently no less than six have been held over. Will the Postmaster-General take these matters into consideration, and see that the construction of approved lines is expedited during the coming year? </para>

                            <para>- I have instructed the Deputy Postmasters- General in all the States to undertake the construction of all approved lines with the utmost expedition. I have also given them authority to appeal to local municipal councils, trade unions, and any other suitable local authority in order to obtain the labour necessary to permit of the speedy construction of approved works. I have instructed them further that men are to be appointed to inspect and supervise these works on behalf of the Department in order to insure that they are thoroughly carried out. I hope that by 30th June next a very considerable number of approved works on the list in question will have been transferred to the completed list. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I may say that the return under the Manufactures Encouragement Act was laid on the table of the House within three months of the close of the financial year. This work may, perhaps, account for some of the overtime in the Customs Department, about which the honorable member for Illawarra has asked a question. Of course, returns and statistics are practically useless if we have to wait twelve months or more for them. I have consulted the Attorney-General in order to insure that the amendment will cover the whole of the Bounties Act, and not merely that portion which we have amended. </para>

                    <para>- This is a very proper amendment, but I should like to know to what extent it goes. The advantage received from the return will depend upon the manner in which it is compiled. It has been promised in connexion with the wool-top industry that there shall be a searching inquiry, to ascertain whether the bounty is being used to assist the manufacture of wool tops, or to guarantee a dividend to an associated company. We are all glad to see industries established, but I think that in cases like that to which I refer, a public accountant should be asked to investigate the books, to ascertain what wages are paid, and that a full statement should be made of wages, bounty, and profits, so that Parliament may know whether the industry requires the bounty for its maintenance. </para>

                    <para>. - I welcome the statement that a return showing the operation of each bounty will be made public, but I am surprised at the request of the honorable member for Illawarra. No Court ever causes the profits of a company to be made public, because to do that might mean ruin to the company concerned. I can understand that those opposing the firm to which the honorable member alluded, some of whom assert that it will not last long, would be glad to have information regarding its profits, but the disclosure of profits would seriously injure those interested in the business. If we get a return showing wages, production, and bounty received, it will be sufficient to enable Parliament to deal wisely with future applications for bounties. </para>

                    <para>.- Strong statements have been made, and remain uncontradicted, to the effect that the firm which receives most of the bounty on wool tops uses it to guarantee a dividend to another company. Public money should not be used in that way. A bounty is given merely to establish an industry, and should not be continued after that industry is on a firm basis. Parliament should be in a position to know whether the continuance of bounties is needed, and how they are being used. I do not desire the exposure to the world of statements of profits which would ruin those concerned, but I think that Parliament should have every information necessary to guide it in dealing with applications for bounty. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable members will recollect that some time ago an Ordinance was submitted to this House by the Minister of External Affairs, and that that Ordinance was challenged by myself, with the result that ultimately it was withdrawn. Now, on the last day of the session, another Ordinance is presented to us in lieu thereof. I contend that an important matter like this, affecting as it does, the whole future of the Northern Territory, should have been dealt with in- a Bill embodying the whole policy of the Government in relation to the lands of that Territory. In endeavouring to develop that great area which has been transferred from South Australia to the Commonwealth, we should be particularly careful to see that our land legislation is based on absolutely sound lines. Neglect to take this healthy precaution has led to endless confusion in the land laws of trie different States. A glorious opportunity was thus presented to us to deal with the matter in an effective fashion by avoiding mistakes that have been made in other parts of the world, and at the same time giving to the people facilities to develop the Northern Territory. However, that opportunity has been denied us. On a previous occasion I dealt exhaustively with the question of leasehold <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> freehold, and I do not intend to again traverse the same ground. I pointed out that the leasehold system had been tried in other parts of the world and in various portions of Australia, and that it had absolutely failed. The climatic conditions which obtain in the Northern Territory will render the work of the pioneer in that country very difficult indeed, and if we are to induce people to settle there we must be prepared to offer them the very best possible conditions. But under the Ordinance which we are now considering the inducement offered is not of an adequate character. When the first Ordinance was under consideration in the Senate, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in discussing it, said - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">However, when it was submitted to this Chamber, the Minister of External Affairs saw clearly that human ingenuity could very easily devise something better, and accordingly he withdrew it. I wish to know in what respect the Ordinance which is now before us is an improvement upon that which preceded it? It is perfectly true that in some respects alterations have been made, particularly in connexion with pastoral leases. It has never been the desire of honorable members upon this side of the Chamber to make the freehold system applicable to large pastoral areas. They wish to apply it only to the small areas which will be taken up in the interests of closer settlement. If we are to secure the development of those small areas, we must give settlers the freehold. In clause 16 of this Ordinance the words &#34;pastoral and&#34; have been inserted so that pastoral leases will not be granted in perpetuity as they would have been under the first Ordinance. Then clause 28 provides - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Pastoral leases of lands in class 1 shall be for a term of twenty-one years, and pastoral leases in class 2 or class 3 shall be for a term of forty-two years. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In my opinion that clause constitutes a distinct improvement upon the original Ordinance. If honorable members will turn to page 3 of the Ordinance they will find that the maximum area of pastoral land which may be held under class 1 is 300 square miles, that the maximum area which may be held under class 2 is 600 square miles, and that the maximum area which may be held under class 3 is 1,500 square miles. It will be seen, therefore, that this provision is a distinct improvement upon the original provisions of the Ordinance. Clause 7 provides for the appointment of a Classification Board. That Board is to consist of the Director of Lands, the Director of Agriculture, and the Chief Surveyor. Statements have been made in connexion with one of these gentlemen, which I do not- desire to repeat, but into the truth of which the Minister ought to inquire, so that he may satisfy himself as to whether that officer possesses the knowledge which is requisite for the proper discharge of his duties. To my mind, it is a pity that the classification of the lands of the Northern Territory was riot undertaken a considerable time back. It would have been a good thing if small survey parties had been sent out into the Territory for the purpose of classifying lands before they are taken up. We all know that land classification has been a fruitful source of trouble in New South Wales. What I chiefly desire to insure is that land which is suitable for pastoral purposes shall be used for pastoral purposes only, and that wherever it may be required areas of agricultural land shall be available for settlement. It appears to me, however, that this Ordinance contemplates that the classification made by the Board which is to be appointed will be of rather a loose character. I think it is essential that this work should be properly done. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that the proposed reclassification will not become operative until a re-appraisement of the rental takes place. In such circumstances it cannot affect the rental. It further appears that the reclassification will not affect the area of the land. If a lessee took up an area under the original classification of the Board his rental could not be disturbed until the period for reappraisement came round. That would be a fair position in which to place him. But the system of reclassification which is provided for in this Ordinance will not place him in that position. What will be the effect of the reclassification? Let us suppose that a man takes up a block of pastoral land in country coming within classes  2  and  3,  which he will hold upon a forty-two years&#39; lease. When the Board comes along to reclassify it, they may take it out of the class in which it stood when leased, and- place it in </para>
                <para class="block">Class  1.  The result is that the lease instead of having a forty-two years&#39; currency at once falls to a currency of only twenty-one years. That is a very important point. Re-appraisement will not only increase the rental in such circumstances, but will take away from the lessee the most valuable portion of the term of his lease. I do not know whether the Minister intended that that should be done, but it will introduce a most undesirable element of uncertainty.. The whole matter should be further considered. We &#39;desire to have small settlers ail over the country, and if that desire is to be fulfilled, we must make the holdings secure so that lessees who wish to raise money for developmental purposes will be able to put forward a fair business proposition. This element of uncertainty, however,, will be most prejudicial to the development of the country. The reclassification affects not only pastoral leases, but the smaller holdings. If, for instance, a man requires an area for mixed farming, he can secure up to  38,400  acres.  His  chief industry in connexion with such a holding would be that of grazing, but a proportion of the land would be cultivated. Under these conditions, however, the land could be so reclassified that he might be called upon to cultivate a very large, if not the major portion of his holding. Thus a man who had taken up a mixed farming and grazing lease with the object of devoting his energy chiefly to grazing might be required to give practically the whole of his attention to agricultural pursuits, for which he was entirely unfitted, and in respect of which he could secure neither the necessary capital nor the labour that would be required. This is one of the most important features of the Ordinance, and it requires to be further considered. Part III., Division I., deals with leases generally. It relates not only to pastoral leases, but to leases of all kinds, and it provides that a covenant shall be entered into by a lessee that he shall use the land only for the purposes for which it is leased. The original Ordinance which the Minister withdrew contained a clause referring to this very matter. Clauses  23  and  24  of that Ordinance specifically prohibited a pastoral lessee from cultivating any portion of his land, except with the consent of the Administrator. Those two clauses having disappeared, in consequence, no doubt, of the criticism which was levelled at them when the original Ordinance was before the House, </para>
                <para class="block">I had hoped that the Government would now be prepared to permit a man to devote his pastoral holding not only to pastoral purposes but to a still more important object. If a pastoralist desires to go in for agriculture and farming generally, why should he be denied the right to do so, except with the permission of the Administrator. </para>

                        <para>- It does. If a man wants to put his land to a better use than that to which he is required to put it under his lease, he must first obtain the permission of the Administrator. I agree with the restrictions in regard to mining, but where a man proposes to devote a proportion of his land to agricultural purposes, we should encourage him to do so. </para>

                        <para>- There is too much of Government officialdom about this matter. There are too many of these demands that the Administrator, or some other official shall be appealed to as to what a settler may or may not do. We must be careful not to place too much power in the hands of Government officials, because their powers are not always exercised in a satisfactory manner. I come now to clause 17, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i,</inline> which provides that - </para>

                <para>I take it that there is no objection to that portion of the clause, but then we have the words -  or which are considered by the Classification Board to be necessary under the circumstances of any particular case. </para>
                <para>That means that a lessee is to be bound, not only by conditions laid in connexion with the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice that the lands are available for leasing, but by any other condition which the Classification Board may see fit to impose. It is surely essential that those who take up land under lease should have set forth in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,</inline> notifying that the land is available for leasing, and, in the lease itself, the actual terms and conditions imposed. Once a man has taken up land on lease it should not be possible to impose any conditions of a harassing character. </para>

As I said at the outset, I do not intend to occupy much time, for the reason that I know that several other honorable members desire to address themselves to this matter. In consequence of a communication that has just been made to me I shall still further curtail my remarks, and refrain from dealing with several other features of the Ordinance which I had intended to discuss.

It is desirable that people should know before they go to the Territory that they will be given land, and power is taken to ask an applicant for a medical certificate. </para>

                        <para>- The person making these confidential statements may be prejudiced or hostile, and, in view of the most undesirable results that may flow from such a system as this, all the business should be conducted with the greatest openness. We all know the great scandals that have occurred in connexion with land administration in Australia ; and dealings of the kind are always open to grave suspicion. I am sure that none of us care for secret and underhand communications, but rather prefer that every accused person shall have the fullest opportunity in open Court of submitting his accusers to cross-examination. I regret that, owing to the introduction of this business by the Government so late in the session, I have to scamp the discussion of one of the most important matters that has come before us this session. </para>

                    <para>.- I  second the motion, and express regret that it has not been found practicable to embody the first land legislation for the Northern Territory in a Bill instead of in an Ordinance. I do not like Ordinances covering so large an area, because they prevent members from making the suggestions tor improvement which can be made during the consideration of a Bill. To induce settlement in the Northern Territory, every reasonable encouragement must be offered to persons to go there, and I appeal to the Minister not to apply too rigidly any legislation that may be passed. I am glad that the new Ordinance does away with leasing in perpetuity, to which objection was taken. Fixity of tenure is better where pastoral leases are concerned than perpetual leasing. A friend who, though not immediately or directly interested in land in the Northern Territory, has a great knowledge of pastoral development, has been good enough to briefly state for my information his opinions upon this Ordinance. He says in reference to clause 8, which provides a limitation of  1,500  square miles for pastoral leases - </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member for Illawarra that the limitation requiring the lessee to use his land&#39; only for the purposes for which it is leased may, if rigidly insisted on, prevent the making of experiments, which is what we desire to encourage more than anything else. However, time does not permit me to say more on the present occasion upon this interesting subject. </para>

                    <para>. - I indorse much that has been said by the previous speakers, but I hope that a Land Act for the Northern Territory will be introduced next session, the Ordinance being merely experimental. It will, however, create obligations by which the administration will be bound/ and it is to be regretted that there is not time to give it more consideration. In New South Wales, free selection before survey was the old-time cry raised by those who wished to take up land without waiting for the -surveying of it. America was settled largely in that way by so-called squatters. - the word has a different signification nowadays in Australia - who pushed out into the wilderness, chose land, and squatted on it, building their homes and gathering their stock round them, until ultimately the surveyors came along, and they acquired titles. I think that in the Northern Territory it may retard settlement if no one is able to take up a piece of land until it has been classified and surveyed. </para>

                        <para>- If any person, pushed out into the Territory and discovered a fairly good piece of land on which it would suit him to settle, it would be a shame to retard his operations by requiring him to wait until the land had been classified and surveyed, though, of -course, in certain districts, such as the Minister refers to, such selection might :not be permissible. Even to-day in New South Wales the classification of land is not finished. In the Northern Territory there is only a limited number of surveyors, and the work of surveying will therefore be slow. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but that is unavoidable iri a new territory. Settlement should not be kept back for the want of surveyors. The Ordinance appears to make no provision for community settlement, but as, in the ordinary course, not many poor men are likely to go on the land of the Northern Territory, I hope that the Minister will provide for co-operative settlements of which a Government farm will be the nucleus. The settlers could get employment on the farm, and, having proved their worth, could be put on suitable areas in close touch with it. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the arrangement will prove an excellent one. We ought to encourage the settlement of men with little or no capital. In tending settlers might be given, employment in preparing blocks for settlement, a system which has proved most successful in New Zealand, and upon which I should like to enlarge were there the time. There will be a great many men employed in connexion with the construction of railways and roads, and they should be given opportunities for making homes on the land. Co-operative settlements would be splendid institutions in which men could be trained, and after they had proved their suitability to go upon the land, they could be allotted areas in close touch with the central farm. There is just one other matter that I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister. I wish to know what he intends to do in the way of helping to finance the settlers. Does he propose to assist them by establishing a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in the Northern Territory, or by introducing the Credit Foncier system there. In his reply I trust that he will give me the information which I seek. At the beginning of this Parliament I took up an attitude of strong optimism in relation to the Northern Territory. I expressed my great faith in its future possibilities. I declared that in that Territory there are tens of millions of acres of the best land imaginable, and that its potentialities were truly wonderful. To day I reaffirm that, statement. I hold that any assistance that we grant to settlement there will be abundantly justified. This question only requires proper handling. In the first place, we require to get men of the right type on the land. Having got them there, we need to assist them to distribute their produce. We require to open up the Territory by means of railways, and to devise a proper scheme for financing the settlers. When we have done these things we shall have no more to fear in the Northern Territory than we have in Queensland, or any other State. </para>

                    <para>. - This matter is far too important to enable it to be properly dealt with at this late hour of the session. In my judgment the leasing of small areas will prove a great mistake. In the old days, in New South Wales - under the Lands Act of  1884 -  people were permitted to select their own land, and surveyors were afterwards sent out to survey their blocks. By that means settlers became dotted throughout the country, and others soon followed. I am sure that the Northern Territory can be de- doped upon similar lines. But we shall never develop that country until a line of railway has been built from Oodnadatta to Fine Creek. People will not sink their money in the Territory until they have a means of getting their produce to market. Consequently, until a railway is built from north to south, the Commonwealth will not be able to deal with the Territory any better than did South Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- Time will not permit me to adequately discuss this motion. From my point of view the Ordinance which is now before us is just as objectionable as was the former Ordinance, because it provides for a leasehold, instead of a freehold, system in respect of cultivation areas. The issue of permanent leases in the case of pastoral areas with a provision for resumption at any time they might be required for Closer Settlement purposes, would, in my judgment, provide a sufficient safeguard to the Government, and might induce pastoralists to erect more permanent improvements upon their holdings than they would do - if the leases were for definite periods. That is one of the reasons why I did not agree with all the criticism which was directed against the Minister of External Affairs, on a prior occasion. Only one provision is necessary in the case of pastoral leases, namely, that the Crown shall have a right to resume any area it chooses, without being called upon to pay to the lessee compensation for the unexpired portion of his lease. After the leasehold system in respect of cultivation areas has been tried and found wanting I venture to say that we shall have to fall back upon a freehold system. I defy any honorable member to point to any country in the world in which a leasehold system has induced the permanent settlement of cultivation areas. Every such experiment has been associated with some sort of feudalism or slavery. I register my protest against a proposal to establish cultivation settlements on the leasehold system in the Northern Territory. I think, however, that it is quite possible to lay down a scheme which will induce permanent settlement in that Territory. With this end in view I hope that the Minister will take into serious consideration the &#34;expediency of securing the services of an eminent engineer from India, or some other country which has had a large experience . of irrigation, so that he may submit to us a comprehensive report on our rivers system in the Northern </para>

                <para class="block">Territory. We have a river system there which is a great deal better than most people imagine. It is a country in which rain falls during only three or four months in the year. The only way in which we can establish settlement in that country is by a scheme providing for water conservation for irrigation purposes If the Minister will engage the services of some eminent engineer to report fully on the rivers system; of the Territory, and upon its suitability for irrigation works, it will then be possible for surveyors to cut up the land into blocks, and I venture to think that the prices which will be realized for the freehold of that land will be sufficient to defray the cost of the works undertaken. If it costs the Commonwealth  ^20,000,  or  ^30,000,  to get such a report- - </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that honorable members are not under any delusion in so far as the uniforms of our Forces are concerned. There is no objection whatever on the part of the Minister of Defence to any uniform, particularly a uniform that has been worn with so much honour as has the kilt in different parts, and on behalf, of the Empire. The scheme of Lord Kitchener is based on location rather than on any other distinctive features, such as are recognised elsewhere, and in order to establish that scheme if is necessary to remove the distinctive dress, for otherwise we might have found a company of troops marching down the street, two or three in kilts, two or three in khaki, and two or three in other uniforms. It would be utterly impossible to carry out the present scheme with a distinctive uniform intermixed with the ordinary Australian khaki. The Minister of Defence has no objection to the kilt, but it cannot be sanctioned in the way proposed if the present scheme of defence is to be carried out. I think I ought to explain, in order to prevent honorable members being misled, that those members of the Forces who now have the right to wear kilts still retain that right until the period of their service ends. </para>

                        <para>- It is a great mistake to do away with the distinctive uniforms, not only Scottish or Irish, but all other. There was my own. uniform, for instance, as an officer of the Third Australian Regiment, which I had the honour to form, and of which I was very proud. In my opinion, the abolition of distinctive and attractive uniforms damps the enthusiasm of many young men who would otherwise join the Forces. For instance, the Lancers, a very old regiment, had an attractive uniform and many traditions of which they were proud, and the same may be said of the Mounted Rifles. Of course, in war time, khaki is all very well for use in the field, but in times of peace, when we wish to encourage our young men to take part in the defence movement, smart and distinctive uniforms, as compared with the dirty drab of the khaki are a great incentive. It may be said that all this is mere sentiment, but sentiment has given rise&#34; to some of the greatest deeds in the history of the world. It is a great mistake to put all the men into the miserable, dirty khaki uniform. </para>

I desire to emphasize the fact that, when a deputation waited on the Minister of Defence on this subject, he appeared to foresee that it would be possible to allow distinctive uniforms to remain, because he said that, if the majority of Parliament decided that these uniforms should be retained, he would endeavour to so organize the Forces as to retain them. </para>

                    <para>. - It is nonsense for the Honorary Minister to say that members of the Scottish Regiment may still wear the Scottish uniform, and it is equally ridiculous for him to contend that a regiment on the march would present several men in different uniforms. In England, a rifle company, with a distinctive uniform, may be attached to a regiment, and I can see no harm in our permitting Scottish or Irish companies to form part of some of our brigade. The point is, however, that our Scottish Regiment will come to look ridiculous if they are not allowed to recruit men with permission to wear the uniform. </para>

It is not suggested that in every little centre there should be a Scottish or other distinctive company, but it ought to toe quite possible in the larger cities. After all, we regard the British Islands as our motherland, and we need not fear the introduction into our Forces of uniforms representative of the emotions and feelings of those who first made Australia a British Possession. </para>

Are the Scotch and Irish alone to retain- the national garb, and we of old England, the home of the roast beef and plum pudding, to be confined to the unpretentious and commonplace garments of the modern tailor? If the Scotch think so much of their kilts, why do not Scottish members appear here in them? </para>

                    <para>That, in order to absorb and train the unemployed, and with a view to a&#39; better settlement of citizens on the land, it is desirable to establish co-operative village settlements in the Northern Territory, Papua, the Federal Capital area, and, with the co-operation of the States Governments, in the States of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para class="block">Whenever in Australia there is a big rush of men to a gold-field, or to big constructional works, there are always more than there are positions to be filled, and many of the overplus find themselves stranded, helpless and hopeless. It would be a serious matter for men to be so stranded without employment in the Northern Territory. To prevent this misery and loss to the workers, I suggest the establishment of farm colonies, where men without employment can use their energies in providing for their support while waiting for better occupation. I do not suggest any communistic or Paraguayan scheme. The men who went to these farms would be housed and fed, and would support themselves by their industry in attending to the cattle, sheep, vegetables, fruit, or doing other work on the settlement. It is not the wealthy that make the best settlers. Some of our finest pioneers came to the country without a penny in their pockets, and were forced by stress of circumstances to take up land and develop it. Strong, healthy men who go to the Northern Territory should be kept there, if possible ; and what I suggest would be a means of keeping them there. This is not to be regarded as a relief scheme. So long as men are self-supporting, their manhood remains strong within them, and they are able to face the world; but give them charity, and they lose their manhood. We must find employment for the surplus labour that goes to the Northern Territory, Papua, the Federal Territory, or the Western Australian railway works, and also temporary occupations for immigrants ; because, when immigrants come to this country in thousands, they cannot expect to get ordinary employment right away, and should not be able to get it at the expense of Australian workers. Any Government that do not wish to see men out of employment and suffering should be glad of a scheme that will make the unemployed self-supporting, and will give training in rural industries and the development of the land. At the Hawkesbury College, in New South Wales, young men, fresh from school, are put into moleskins and flannel shirts, and, although many of them have been spoonfed and brought up by indulgent mothers, hundreds turn out good workers, with a knowledge of dairying, fruit-growing, wheat-growing, and other rural occupations. </para>
                <para class="block">One of the causes of unemployment is want of training, and it is a grievance of employers in pastoral and agricultural pursuits that men who come to them seeking for work are not equipped by training for doing what is needed. Merely as a training school for settlers, my proposal should commend itself. It enables what is now waste material to be utilized. Men who have proved themselves capable, by the work they have done on the farms, could be used in preparing areas for settlement, and could be settled on the land themselves. My suggestion would be that the men on the farms should work half the day for their food and clothing, and the remaining half-day for wages, which should be kept back for them. At this stage of the session, however, it is impossible to state the scheme in detail.

                    <para>. - We are not prepared at the present moment to support the motion of the honorable member for Grey. I would, therefore, ask him to withdraw it, but, on behalf of the Government, I undertake to have a new survey made from Port Augusta right to the Macdonnell Ranges. We recognise that there is already a railway in existence from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, a distance of 479 miles. The distance from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges is 327 miles. There has been, as we know, a flying survey made from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges. That survey was carried out a good many years ago, and we feel that, before we ask this House to support a project of railway construction over that country, it is necessary that we should obtain fuller and later information than has already been furnished. Now, some honorable members may, perhaps, feel that, in view of the railway line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, it would be to some extent a waste of money and of time to obtain fuller information regarding the route between those places; but since that line was built a great deal of added information is obtainable, and we think that before we absolutely commit ourselves to supporting a line from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges - because we realize that it will be a portion of the main trunk line that is to go across the continent - we should obtain all information possible, even if it means that some of the railway line that is now in use is not to be utilized in the future. In view of the fact that the railway has been laid down, strong and sufficient reasons, of course, will have to be given why it is not all to be utilized; but, as I have stated, we feel that, before we can absolutely commit ourselves to Oodnadatta being the starting point for the larger railway, further information should be procured. I may say that, as far as the Government are concerned, realizing that the railway from Port Augusta right to the Katherine will be the main trunk line going through that great Territory, it is thought that, as far as practicable, the railway ought to go in a direct line; that is, that the distance between Port Augusta and the Katherine should be as near as possible the minimum distance between those two points. Of course, we do not purpose sacrificing everything to secure a straight line, as there may be strong, sufficient and cogent reasons why the railway should go either somewhat to the west or somewhat to the east; but those reasons, in our opinion, will have to be strong. Besides having that survey, we purpose having what is known as a preliminary location examination made between Alice Springs and the Katherine River. As honorable members are aware, it is necessary before a railway is built, first, to have what is called the preliminary location examination of the country. Then follows either a flying survey or a permanent survey, whichever is thought the best; but it is necessary before even a flying survey can be made that a preliminary examination of. the country should be made. From what I can gather, nothing of this kind has yet been done. That is, a distance of 672 miles has been so far unexamined. We purpose having, this country examined so as to enable us to follow up that examination with a survey. We also propose having a preliminary location examination along the Barclay tableland towards the Queensland border. No railway construction will proceed along any of these routes until Parliament has had a full and complete opportunity of dealing with the question; but in view of the fact that the permanent survey is being carried out from Pine Creek to the Katherine, we do propose carrying on at once railway construction between those points, following the permanent survey which is now being made. I have not been unmindful of endeavouring to have a Committee appointed which will advise the Government and Parliament as to what railway projects should be undertaken in connexion with the Territory. The reason that I have not yet been able to announce the names of the members of that Committee is that I have not been able, so far, to obtain three persons with all the necessary qualifications. The railways throughout the Commonwealth are extremely busy, and naturally it is very difficult to obtain the services of those who are in the employ of the State Governments. However, I would like to say that the State Governments, whenever we have asked for any of their officers, have always been very ready to place their services at our disposal. I am at the present moment in communication with a certain person, and if I can make suitable and adequate arrangements with him, I feel that it will not be many days before I shall be able to announce the names of the members of the Committee. In view of what I have outlined as to the intentions of the Government, I trust that the honorable member for Grey will withdraw his motion. </para>

                <para class="block">In the majority of the cases enumerated in this measure honorable members will find that at the time of their deaths the persons in question had due to them what is termed &#34;furlough,&#34; or six months&#39; leave of absence on full pay. But having died before that furlough was granted, the Government were unable to hand over to their relatives the equivalent in money of that leave of absence, and are obliged to submit their claims to this Parliament for its approval. In the case of Edward Young, the circumstances surrounding his death were of a particularly distressing character. </para>
                <para class="block">The death of Gunner Arthur Campbell, of the Naval Forces, Queensland, was very sudden. Had his illness been of long duration he would have been entitled to something like seven months&#39; sick leave on full pay. The circumstances surrounding his case are of a peculiarly painful character. The widow, who had been an invalid for years, died within one month of his demise, and thus one little girl is left absolutely without provision. J. A. Stewart, lineman in charge, Kyamba, New South Wales, met his death while in the execution of his duty, and a strong recommendation came through his Department that the sum of .&#163;100 should be granted to his widow. It was stated that the accident which resulted in his death was partly due to his own negligence, but the papers disclose clearly that it was his desire to finish the work on which he was engaged at the earliest possible moment that caused him to neglect those precautions which are laid down in the regulations. The nature of the circumstances surrounding his case justify the Government in asking the House to agree to the proposed grant. There is only one other case to which special attention needs to be directed - that of S. E. Rowe, engineman on the Oodnadatta railway. This officer met his death whilst on duty. He was an engine-driver on one of the trains on the Oodnadatta line. A washaway occurred on the line, and though the deceased saw the danger he did not see it in time to avert an accident. But, notwithstanding that death stared him in the face, he heroically stuck to his duty, and by his courageous conduct prevented serious damage to Government property, and possibly injury, or even death, to some of the passengers. We ask the House to recognise behaviour of that description, particularly as his widow and several children are left in necessitous circumstances. </para>

Has any guiding principle been laid down for their determination, or are they arrived at in just a haphazard fashion ? For my own part, whenever I have brought similar cases to those set out in this Bill under notice - and particularly under the notice of the Defence Department - they have received generous treatment. At the same time, no method has existed for regulating the payments, s </para>

I am glad to see that some measure of compensation is to be granted to his widow. . There are other cases, no doubt, equally meritorious, but, of course, one can speak only of those persons whom he knows, and with whom he has had close relations.

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Government upon having brought forward this Bill. It contains a list of claims which have been before them for a considerable time. It seems to me that there ought to be some principle governing these allowances, and that it should not be necessary for Ministers to await the decision of Parliament in such cases, especially &#39; as the compensation granted would be of much more service to its recipients if it could be made available immediately after the death of the breadwinner. I notice in the Bill a proposal to grant an allowance to the widow of E. V. Gosbell, formerly a letter-carrier at Parkes, New South Wales. I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gosbell,</inline> in this Bill will prove very acceptable to and I know that the gratuity provided for his widow. At the same time, it seems to me that the amount is altogether inadequate. A larger sum might very well be voted. </para>

                        <para>-r-Then I suppose the Committee had some reason for limiting the payment in this case to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6g.</inline> I think that there ought to be some governing principle in matters of this kind, and I am glad the Government have established a scheme in that connexion. So far as workmen are concerned, their cases will come under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, while the widow or next of kin of any departmental officer who could have retired and have drawn a retiring allowance is entitled, under an Act brought in by this Government, to receive that allowance. I have had some correspondence with the Postal Department regarding the claim of the widow df the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wakley,</inline> who was for eleven years postmaster at Edgecliffe, and who spent forty years in the Service. He died in harness, but the allowance to which he would ,have been entitled had he retired was denied to his widow. Investigations were made, and because it was found that the widow had benefited to some extent by an assurance policy that the officer had effected on his own life, and because some of the members of the family were helping to support her, the case was not&#39; favorably reported on. That claim ought to be formally considered. It is quite as legitimate as is any that has been recognised. The fact that this officer had insured his life, and that his family have since denied themselves to some extent to support his widow, should not be set up as a reason why the allowance to which he was entitled should not be paid to her. I regret that no provision is made for that case in this schedule, but I hope that it will not escape the favorable notice of the Government. I have very much pleasure in supporting the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to ask the Honorary Minister if any action has been taken in regard to the case of Staff Sergeant-Major Coleman, who died whilst on duty in Western Australia. I called attention to it some twelve months ago, and I now desire to know why no provision has been made for it in this Bill. Another case which I brought under the notice of the Department relates to an officer of the Postal Department named Sexton, who was employed in the Hindmarsh electorate, and at the time of his death was entitled to long leave. I desire to know whether some equivalent to the pay which he would have received while on leave is to be paid to the widow. The case is a very hard one. The man left a large family, and I understand that the practice, which I claim should be followed in this case, is adopted in connexion with the Department of Trade and Customs. As to Staff Sergeant-Major Coleman, I believe that he died as the result of a cold contracted while travelling in the discharge of his duty, and I think that some relief should be granted to those whom he left behind. </para>

                        <para>- Then this Bill provides for the payment of ^130 to his widow. That amount is equal to six months&#39; pay. Furlough was due to him at the time of his death, and this amount is granted to his widow as representing the salary which he would have received had he taken that leave. As to the case of Staff Sergeant Coleman, who was on the Instructional Staff, Western Australia, there was no basis on which to approve of a grant being made. I have not the papers here, but my recollection is that he contracted a cold whilst travelling on duty, from one part of Western Australia to another. But the mere fact that a man while travelling on duty, say, between Adelaide and Melbourne, contracts a cold which ultimately results in his death, does not constitute a claim for compensation. This case was submitted for the production of medical certificates, and it was pointed out that the fact that the officer caught cold while travelling did not constitute a complaint that, within the meaning of the Defence Act, he had suffered any injury peculiar to his vocation as a member of the Military Forces. If, for instance, a clerk employed in any Department, whilst travelling from Melbourne to Mornington, caught cold owing to an open carriage window, no one would say that, in the event of complications setting in and resulting in his death his relatives were entitled to compensation. I wish now to refer to the remarks made by the honorable member for Calare. In the majority of cases the basis on which these claims were submitted for consideration was that the officer concerned was entitled to furlough at the time of his death. We have now on the statute-book an Act which permits the Government, without further consideration, to grant the amount due in respect of such furlough to the relatives of any officer who dies without taking leave. The case to which the honorable member has referred, however, occurred before that Act came into operation. In future a number of cases will come under the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, and compensation will be granted in certain circumstances as an act of administration. The basis on which the majority of these claims is allowed is that leave was actually due to the deceased officer at the time of his death. As to other cases, I have explained the special circumstances relating to them, and am confident that they would appeal to honorable members. The honorable member for Capricornia has asked me why a claim made on behalf of John Pile, locker in the Department of Trade and Customs at Rockhampton, Queensland, was rejected. The answer is that there was no foundation on which to grant an allowance. </para>

I am not sure whether the State Government gave him any compensation, but I do know that they gave him a position in the Service, which he could fill in- spite of his disability. He continued for twenty years to perform the light duties of that situation until he was retired by reason of his age. </para>

The scheme prejudicially affects several Labour seats, and for this reason was not popular with the party. But how could it be rejected without giving rise to the suspicion that the Government had taken a purely party view of the question? That apparently was the problem that troubled the caucus mind. The solution was seen when the House divided. The division came earlier than expected, and there were few Opposition members in the Chamber. The principle of &#34; solidarity of the Cabinet &#34; necessitated that Ministers should vote for the Government motion. But not a single Ministerialist voted with them. The result was that by two votes the formal motion was defeated, as desired by the caucus, and the scheme goes back to the commissioners for further report. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that time does not permit of our dealing with this motion as it deserves. The editor of a large daily newspaper is an autocrat, and no Czar of all the Russias has more power. If, by any means, a reflection on a member of Parliament, or other public man, appears, the newspaper may print his explanation or contradiction of the offensive remarks, but very often a footnote by the editor holds him up to ridicule and contempt. The editor very often aggravates his offence. On one occasion when the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Telegraph</inline> had made some observations concerning me as a public man, to which I wished to reply, I sent to the office for insertion as an advertisement the following notification - </para>

                <para class="block">They would not accept that advertisement, and the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier,</inline> the opposition journal, would not take it either, the newspapers being members of a close corporation, so that when an editor has an objection to a public man the latter gets a bad time. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> on one occasion, pursued a public man to the bitter end. The proprietors of newspapers get certain privileges from the Postal Department, and in other ways, which ordinary members of the public do not enjoy, and if they cast reflections on, or libel, individuals, or make remarks which are deemed offensive, those injured should have the right to reply on the same page, in the same column, and in the same type as the offending passage. No doubt it is very wrong of the honorable member for Herbert and myself to speak thus of editors of newspapers, because these men are  so sensitive to criticism that they cannot stand anything but complimentary remarks. I know that that is so, because I spent a few years in the editorial chair, armed with a large pair of scissors, a pot of paste, and a blue pencil. The editor can criticise until further orders, but suffers pangs of unholy torment if criticised himself. Those editors who spend their leisure in reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of our speeches will be of the opinion that we should be guillotined, but in calmer moments will agree that we are right. I am satisfied that the members of their staffs will say that it is fair and proper that the public should be allowed to explain or contradict in the newspapers any statements published therein that reflect on them. Unfortunately, we are so near the end of the session that it is doubtful if the Ministry will act on this motion when carried. The honorable member for Herbert asks that immediate action be taken to protect members, but I do not see how that can be done. The Minister of External Affairs might wait on the editors, but I do not think that he would be well received, because of the views that he has expressed regarding the newspapers. </para>

                <para class="block">It takes the wind out of one&#39;s sails to have to speak in the dying hours of the session, but this proposal appeals to me, and to many whom I have consulted, as of such great importance that I hope that I may not weary honorable members by asking for their attention to it for a few moments. Notice has been taken of the motion by some of the greatest newspapers in Great Britain. Only this week I received from the <inline font-style="italic">Iron and Steel Trades Journal,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Engineering and Metallurgical Review,</inline> one of the largest newspapers in the iron trade, an article that is complimentary to the ideas that. I am putting forward. The <inline font-style="italic">Skipping List and Lloyds</inline> has published a similar article, and the publication, which announces the views of the Australian Natives&#39; Association, thinks so much of my proposals that it has devoted no fewer than seven columns chiefly to them. Abroad there is the stirring of war in the Balkans, known in Europe as the East ; and in Japan, known there as the Further East, we have what we term the &#34; yellow peril.&#34; I have no word of derogation for a great nation that has proved itself in art, science, and literature, and has beaten in war that European nation which, on paper, looked the strongest. But as an Australian who loves his country, which, I hope, its present people will leave as a splendid heritage to the white race, I regard the existence of that nation within a few days&#39; steam of our shores as a menace, and I regret that our preparations for defence are so small. If war broke out between Germany and England, and the first line of defence - the Navy - failed, it would, take only six weeks, according to experts, to bring Great Britain to the verge of starvation. But trouble, want, and privation would be known there within three days. With all the love I have for the Homeland, with my heart pulsing blood given to me by an English mother, I feel that it is the duty of her children to protect her. That coterie of nations - England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales - if we can help it, should not be starved, but, with proper food supplies, should face the world four-square. The protection of the pathways of the Empire will assure the interests of the farmers of Australia. If our surplus produce could not be sold in Great Britain, of what use would it be to grow it? Prior to Federation the right honorable member for Swan estimated the savings on the conversion of the State debts at ^20,000,000, but I put it now at ^25,000,000 ox even  ^30,000,000.  It may be suggested that this is not an opportune time for borrowing. I admit it. But the object of the motion is to gain the sympathy of the money changers of the Empire. During the Boer War money was worth 6 per cent., but, by reason of a wave of patriotism, the money Icings allowed the new debt to be over-subscribed fourteen times at <inline font-style="italic">2^</inline> percent. I do not suggest that immediate effect should be given to my proposal. Those wise men who understand the lending and borrowing of money could be left to choose a suitable time. Euclid&#39;s axiom that &#34; the whole* is greater than its part &#34; applies in this case. Australia is greater than any State forming part of it, and Commonwealth stock would be a gilt-edged security. When the money lenders ask, &#34;To what are the profits to be made by the conversion to be devoted ?&#34; the answer will be, &#34;A large part will be spent in the ship-yards of Great Britain.&#34; On what? On the building of iron-clads, and in the purchase of munitions of war. For what purpose? To defend the trade routes of the Empire, and thus prevent the Homeland from being starved in the event of the defeat of her first line of defence, and also to protect the exported produce of the Australian farmers. I have here a vast number of letters received from persons of all professions, trades, and callings. The Marquis of Salisbury has written- thanking me for having brought the matter under his notice, and I should like to make a quotation from one whose legal knowledge is recognised wherever the Australian flag is flown - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. Wise, K.C. He writes- </para>

                    <para>. - An appeal from the honorable member that this proposal should be permitted to pass as an abstract motion, and one not binding upon the Government, would influence me more than would an appeal by most honorable members. But I doubt whether any Government could accept it as an abstract motion without feeling themselves bound to give effect to it. I do not think it would be possible to agree to the motion, which is of a five-barrelled character, and loaded in every barrel, because its adoption would become a decision of the House, and it is a proposal which requires a good deal of propaganda. Whatever opinions one may entertain on matters of finance, the present time, as the honorable member has himself admitted, is not an opportune one for the conversion of stock. The proposal to appoint a Commission consisting of representatives of the Commonwealth and of the States is not a bad one. But it is not sufficiently matured to be adopted by Parliament as a scheme. To appoint a , Commission to deal with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States is a serious business. The honorable member has sounded an original note, and will always be associated with this project as the pioneer of it, but having ventilated the subject, I would counsel him to withdraw the motion, and to bring it forward again in the new Parliament. I congratulate him upon his devotion to the protection of the trade and commerce of the Mother Country. There are many in the Commonwealth who will welcome him as an advocate of the protection of all that is good, and especially of the protection of our trade routes, which means the protection of our primary producers. As I interpret his wish, he would like to see the Mother Country and the oversea Dominions so equipped with engines of defence that no Power, however desirous it might be of stealing our territory, would dare to attempt it. I do not commit myself to the scheme of the honorable member so far as regards any profits which might be made by the conversion of State loans into Commonwealth stock. I congratulate him upon having brought this matter before the House. If I followed the wish of my heart, I would consent to the motion being passed, but as the Leader of the Government I must ask him to withdraw it. </para>

                        <para>-  1  am very much obliged to the Prime Minister for his offer to assist me in securing the passage of this motion. But  1  wish briefly to state one or two reasons why I have brought it forward. Queensland, as honorable members have discovered, since the establishment of Federation, is a very rich State. I do not mean to say that we have a large number of millionaires there, although there are a few of them. But I do mean that the natural resources of that State are very large and varied, so that in time to come Queensland is bound to possess a larger population than is any other State. But something is required to develop the great northern State. What is required is that it shall be split up into three divisions. Queensland embraces an area of 668,497 square miles. My proposal is that, instead of consisting of one State, three States shall be formed out of it, namely, Northern Queensland, comprising, say, 250,237 square miles, Central Queensland, containing 208,980 square miles, and Southern Queensland embracing 209,278 square miles. Queensland, unlike some of the other States, possesses numerous ports. He ports extend along the whole of her coast from the New South Wales border. There are, for example, the ports of Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, and Gladstone. Gladstone possesses an especially fine harbor, and one which in time will be spoken of with as much enthusiasm as the people <inline font-style="italic">01</inline> Sydney speak of Port Jackson. Further north, we have the ports of Bowen, Townsville, Port Douglas, and Cairns. There are quite a number of ports on the Queensland coast which can accommodate the largest ships engaged in oversea commerce. But the government of Queensland is carried on from the capital city of Brisbane, which is situated in the southern portion of that State. In these circumstances the requirements of the people of Central and Northern Queensland, who are so far removed from the Seat of Government, are frequently overlooked. It is not that the State Government in Brisbane wilfully neglects the interests of the north, but rather that South Queensland is so rich in natural resources - that there is such a very large area of good soil yet to be cultivated, and so much to be done to carry on the government of even the southern portion of the State, that time will not permit of their giving the attention necessary to the requirements of Central and Northern Queensland. It may be urged that the people of the centre and the north do not each require a separate State Government, but those who are acquainted with what is happening in the United Kingdom, and who know that the House of Commons is unable to cope with the business of the country, will recognise the justice of my claim. Those, too, who are acquainted with the history of Australia - those who know the fight that Queensland itself had to make to secure local government, who know of the agitations that were necessary before Victoria could secure separation from New South Wales, and who are aware of the advance that has taken place in the development of those States since they have obtained separation - will, I am sure, come to the conclusion that it would be a good thing for the northern part of Australia, and for the Commonwealth as a whole, if Queensland were cut up into three, instead of two, divisions, as it is at present.

                <para class="block">Honorable  member for Herbert. My honorable friend suggests Unification, whereas  1 am  not in favour of a unified form of government in Australia. . I favour, in short, the creation  of  more Governments. I do not suggest that we require two Houses of Parliament for Central Queensland and two more for North Queensland. My own view is that a. Legislative Council is unnecessary. When people talk of Australia having fourteen Houses of Parliament, they forget or at least some of them do that of that number seven are Legislative Councils, with, which, we might very well do without, and that we should be able to  conduct  our business in the  various  States as do the Provinces in Canada - with a single legislative chamber.I regret, that, owing to the pressure of public business the Government, have not  been  able to allow private members an  opportunity  to discuss to the extent that their  merits  deserve the proposals standing in their names on the notice-paper. </para>

Although  ,  the Prime- Minister has  just  indicated that we have now a good opportunity to deal with , motions standing in, the names of private members we cannot lose sight  of the fact that many honorable members are making arrangements  to  leave  at once  this busy scene . That being  so,  I   do  not feel justified in further occupying the attention  of  the House save  to  appeal  to  honorable members  to  carry the motion. I would remind them that  it is  simply a declaration that subject  to  the con-  sent of  the Parliament  of  Queensland  being  obtained, this House  is prepared to  agree  to  the formation  of  two new States comprising  the  northern and central parts  of  the  rich  and powerful State  of  Queensland. </para>

The National Bank of Australasia, and several other banking companies, refuse to allow their clerks to marry if they are receiving less than ^200 per annum. The honorable member for Parkes will agree that it is right that every young man and woman in Australia should get married, and that it is monstrous that the banks, in whose interests the honorable member for Richmond is taking up this measure, should have rules providing that the clerks in their employ shall not marry until they get ^200 a year. Some bank employes, even after twenty or thirty years&#39; service, do not get &#163;200 per annum. </para>

                    <para>- I would. Honorable members of the Opposition speak of their reverence of the marriage tie, but do not show much reverence for it. With few exceptions the banking institutions whose interests they represent have rules which really tend to prevent marriage in Australia. Do those rules show any regard for the sanctity of the marriage tie? Doubtless the honorable member for Parkes, in the course of the coining months, will quote to the electors extracts from, say, <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> articles written by one man, and endeavour to fasten on the Labour party the stigma that we desire to destroy the marriage tie, although, at the same time, the institutions which he is defending, are doing their best to destroy that tie every day of the year. I hope the honorable member for Richmond will endeavour to give us some explanation why such regulations are adopted. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member would advise the Great Architect of the Universe if he had a chance. What is troubling the honorable member is that the Commonwealth Bank, by charging reasonable interest, will reduce the profits of the private banks, which are under his care for this afternoon. As a rule, of course, when a bank clerk gets married, children follow as a happy result; and what the banks are afraid of is that, with 15s. to pay for rent, 15s. for food, 10s. for clothing, and <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;i</inline> every week for other expenses, married clerks would ask for increases in their salaries. Therefore, the stipulation is made that no clerk shall marry until he is paid &#163;200 a year, a salary which the banks take good care he never gets. When the honorable member for Richmond endeavours to assist in erecting, as it were, a political marble monument to a very admirable gentleman in another place, he ought to be prepared, as I suppose he is, to defend this practice of the banks. I received an anonymous letter the other day from a lady who described herself as an &#34;anxious female,&#34; pointing out that she was engaged to be married to a bank clerk, and that, while she believed such a regulation was necessary to some extent, if it were carried out strictly it would be fifteen years before her marriage could take place. This is a monstrous state of affairs in a so-called Christian country. I hope that the honorable member for Richmond proposes- to introduce a clause into this Bill providing that banks which make such an unjust regulation shall not be able to take advantage of the measure. </para>

                    <para>.- The definition of &#34;profits&#34; opens up the whole question of the receipts and expenditure of banks ; and the honorable member for Capricornia has detailed in very graphic language the sufferings of a section of the community. It is most awful that, when people reach a marriageable age, they, should be prevented by arbitrary regulations of this kind from living as we expect every man and woman to live. Some of these financial cormorants are so busy devouring profits that they have little time to pay regard to the sufferings of the men in their employ, and their dependents. I suppose we all have had instances brought under our notice, of bank clerks being prevented from marrying by the conditions of their employment. A gentleman of my acquaintance, who was employed in a bank, defied the regulation and got married ; and he was fortunate enough to obtain a lucrative situation in another branch of business. He is now the father of one of the finest families in the community ; and his . case presents a much, pleasanter picture than that of a man and a woman kept apart by the cruel conditions imposed by the banks. In one case, a poor unfortunate liftman employed in a bank signed the regulations, without really knowing what they were, and when it was found out that he had been married, he was called in before the manager, or &#39;some other responsible person, and discharged, although he was then the father of a child. Can we conceive a more cruel act in a civilized and Christian community ? I understand that, in the coming session we are to have some general banking legislation, and this would be a good opportunity to consider proposals of the kind now before us. I do not care to grant any further privileges or legislative concessions to financial institutions unless there are conditions imposed compelling the proper treatment of the employes. Last session the Attorney-General told us, as we have been told this session by the Prime Minister, that this Bill is an innocent little bantling j but I am not quite satisfied to take an assurance of that kind. A number of the clauses are lengthy, and in most involved language which may, without the effect being properly understood by the lay mind, prove harmful to some sections of the community. Banks have many ways of adding to their profits. In most banks there <inline font-style="italic">are.</inline> of course, young men who are on the look-out for means of bettering themselves by taking positions in other branches of business. Nearly every banking company has a provident fund, to which its employes ate compelled to subscribe, the contributions being in proportion to their salaries ; but if a man, after being in the service of a bank for a number of years, and having had to submit to deductions from his salary during the whole period, leaves to better his condition, and perhaps to be free to marry, he forfeits his right to participate in any dis&#34;tribution of the fund. That is very unfair. Bank profits are swelled in this and a thousand other ways. In my opinion, the clauses of the Bill should be amended for the simplification of their language, so that their meaning may be apparent to the layman. I intend to vote against all of them, but I appeal to the honorable member for Richmond now, as I did at the end of last session, to withdraw the Bill, so that the subject may be dealt with in a general banking measure. </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst I agree with what has been said by the honorable members for Maribyrnong and Capricornia about the marriage regulations of the banks, I do not think that this is the place to deal with them; they should be considered in connexion with some other measure. The Bill seems to me a harmless one, and I see no reason why it should not pass. There is certainly no reason for &#34; stone-walling &#34; it. It enables a bank, if it so desires, to use its profits, or part of them, in building up a fund for the payment of its reserve liability. The honorable member for Richmond claims that this will protect the public, but it would do so only in the event of a bank going into liquidation and its reserve liability not being there for the creditors who had  2  claim against it. A principal advantage is that the Bill may protect persons buying bank shares. Many persons now buy bank shares without being aware of the reserve liability attaching to them. All they know is that the shares are quoted at so much on the market. Should anything happen to the bank, they find themselves saddled with liabilities of which they knew nothing. It would be much better for these persons to receive  2  per cent, or  3  per cent, less in dividends, and for the bank to build up a fund to meet its reserve liabilities, which: would make them secure. This is not a Bill for the securing of reforms generally relating to banking. That, I hope, will be done by one of the first measures introduced next Parliament. But this Parliament has done a lot of useful work, and the Government cannot be criticised for not having attended to the important business, of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- This amendment embodies my whole objection to the Bill. It provides that the bank directors may take from profits and place to the credit of a reserve fund not less than <inline font-style="italic">i\</inline> per cent, nor more than 10 per cent. That leaves them a margin of 7 J per cent, upon which to work. My objection to the measure is that it will afford bank directors an opportunity to manipulate the share market. For example, one year they may take 2 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, from profits and place it to the credit of the reserve fund, and another year they may take 10 per cent. If they took 10 per cent, from the profits and placed it in the reserve fund the value of the shares would necessarily fall. </para>

                        <para>- But it must be remembered that this Bill is not compulsory. If the directors of a bank do not feel disposed to set apart a portion of its profits to the credit of the reserve fund they need not do so. If they have an ulterior object in view they may say, &#34;We will take 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, of the profits this year and pay it into the, reserve.&#34; That means that there would not be so much available to pay a dividend to the shareholders. The dividend might be reduced to 3J per cent, on the value of the shares. If the shares were <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> each, and the dividend was 3J per cent., the value of the shares would probably fall to the extent of 30s: If the directors were dishonest they could keep down the value of the shares for a year or two for the purpose of buying them up, and then they could inflate their value for selling purposes. I do not believe the Bill will be availed of by any respectable bank. It will merely afford an opportunity to dishonest persons to &#34;rig&#34; the share market. </para>

                    <para>.- As we are on the eve of a general election, and the unexpected sometimes happens, I would like to embody in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a few remarks for the benefit of future generations of aldermen. I served for a time in the capacity of alderman for the North Ward in the Brisbane City Council. I never worked harder in my life, and after a long course of study and consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the payment of  aldermen is a very desirable thing. </para>

                <para>Aldermen should be elected on a proper franchise. My amendment embodies a principle to which the Australian Labour party ought to direct its attention, because, by means of municipalities and other local bodies much good work can be done for the benefit of the citizens of Australia.. Why should municipal councils be made a close corporation for contractors, landlords, and those who want to secure election to them as a hall-mark of respectability? In order to illustrate the mean way in which some ratepayers treat their representatives, let me state an experience of my own. After I had served the city of Brisbane for two years, I sought re-election as an. alderman, and asked a ratepayer for the use of a front room of an empty shop as a&#62; committee-room on polling day. He replied, &#34;Very well,&#34; and when I asked what I should have to pay, he remarked, &#34;That will be all right.&#34; Although I pressed him,  1  could obtain from him no more definite statement, and I naturally concluded that he was a man of generous instincts, and intended to give me the free use of the room. I was. in due course, re-elected, and I thought I would walk round the Terrace and thank those who had helped me. Before expressing my thanks to this gentleman, however, I thought that I had better make sure whether I had to pay anything for the room. When I inquired, &#34; What do I owe you?&#34; he replied, &#34; I will leave it to you. I do not want to make anything out of it, but if you give me &#163;I, I will give 10s. to the hospital in your namer and the remaining 10s. in my name.&#34;&#39; Finally, as I was leaving his shop, his wife said, &#34; Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs,</inline> I hope you will see that our footpaths are kept in good order.&#34; I had given to the city two years of arduous service, and at the end of that period, one of the ratepayers, a wealthy man, was so mean that he would not grant me the free use of a committee-room for one day. People ought to get rid of the idea of trying to get something for nothing. They think they are getting something for nothing in returning men to the municipal councils, but some councillors, if they do not receive payment by way of allowance as we do, secure the expenditure of public money by improving their own properties. In that way they take it out of the general public just as informer days, before the principle of payment of members was adopted, some members of Parliament took advantage of the knowledge they gained as parliamentarians to line their pockets with the riches that could be obtained in various ways. I place on record my view, as an ex-alderman, that the people would be better served by their local governing bodies if they paid their aldermen. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like the honorable member to amend his amendment by adding the words &#34; and whose aldermen and councillors are elected.&#34; The aldermen of the cities of Melbourne and Geelong are not elected by the people, but are appointed for life, and those municipalities were base enough at one time to refuse women the right to vote, although they compelled them to pay rates. The franchise for the city councils of Melbourne and Geelong is an absurd one. By providing for the election of aldermen and councillors on the basis of adult suffrage, we should bring those councils into line with the Sydney City Council, in connexion with which, I understand, there is an adult franchise plus one vote granted to every absentee owner. With such a franchise, we should soon get rid of the dust fiend in Melbourne, and the whole position would be improved. I would vote against any grant being made to the Melbourne City Council in lieu of rates on Commonwealth buildings unless that council was prepared to enfranchise its real citizens - those who actually reside within its boundaries. Most of the electors of the city of Melbourne live in the suburbs, and many of them have three votes each. The Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company Limited has the right to cast nine votes in each subdivision of Melbourne and suburbs, whilst the Metropolitan Gas Company, which, thanks to the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> has recently received a slight check, has a vote in every ward of the city and suburban municipalities. Have the Government decided to accept the motion ? </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely correct. No report from the Auditor-General has been presented to Parliament during this session, and therefore I say that the Auditor-General is of no use to this Parliament in relation to the consideration of the finances of the country. This late presentation of the report emphasizes the fact. It comes to us when all the financial measures of the session have been finished, and done with. It has, therefore, been of not the slightest use in the consideration of proposals for the expenditure of sums aggregating something like  ?22,250,000.  According to the newspapers, the Auditor-General again refers to this kind of thing, though I do not know exactly what he says, not having had an opportunity to read the report. </para>

                    <para>. - The statement of the honorable member for Parramatta is so far from what  I  should call a judicial criticism regarding the presentation of the Auditor-General&#39;s report as to be of no value whatever. To say that there is no control over the finances because the Auditor-General&#39;s report has only just , been presented is not within measurable distance of fact or truth. The Auditor-General&#39;s report is in the hands of honorable members, and the position of the Government can be tested, if not in this House, elsewhere. </para>

The Auditor-General acquits the Treasury of any intention to do other than facilitate the presentation of accounts. He says that the Treasury officials showed every desire to bring matters before him. If there is one thing that I should like more than another, it is the presentation to the public of the results of a full investigation of Commonwealth affairs since we took office, and such a statement will be presented to the public. </para>

                    <para>. - Here again we have the same dodge repeated. On the last day of the session, when the consideration of the Estimates is over, and no use can be made of it, this report is presented. Honorable members cannot deny&#39; that fact. I find too, that the Auditor-General&#39;s report is not even dated. The policy of the Government throughout has been that this House shall not have information concerning its financial administration, and the presentation of these two reports on the last day of the session is evidence of that. When the business of Parliament is finished, and done with, reports which should be presented for the guidance of honorable members are laid upon the table. </para>

                    <para>. - The circumstances connected with the presentation of this report seem to emphasize the opinion of the Minister of Home Affairs that there is an absence of business principle in some of the Departments. The Post Office accounts, I suppose, close on 30th June, and it seems extraordinary that the departmental report should be presented only &#34;to-day. Any large financial company can <inline font-style="italic">get</inline> out its report within a month after the books close, and there ought not to be the slightest difficulty in doing the same thing in connexion with a Government Department. It is scarcely fair that we should have to wait until the last day of this session for departmental reports of the kind. It has been remarked outside for a long time that the system of purchasing horses is- </para>

The honorable member&#39;s remarks are perfectly justified, because the people ought to know that the affairs of this Government, backed up by every member of the party who has not the independence to say what he really thinks on the subject, are conducted in a way that could not for one moment meet the approval of any common-sense business person. The reports, which purport to tell Parliament and the public how certain Departments have been carried on during the financial year, are placed on the table at the very moment of adjournment, six months after the period with which they deal.

Although we may have documents such as the Postal report before us, it is not obligatory on those who criticise it to keep to a calm form of criticism.

We have a sufficient number of honorable members upon this side of the Chamber to assert our rights, even if we have to remain here till after Christmas. I submit that an honorable member cannot under any standing, order or practice of the House be deprived&#39; of his rights by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> or the  Chairman  of Committees, or any other authority when he rises to make a personal explanation, consequent upon misrepresentation by another honorable member of something he has said or done in the House. I would point out that the honorable member for Richmond cannot make an explanation without referring to what has already taken place, and out of which the misrepresentation arose. I submit that you, sir, cannot anticipate what he is going to say simply because he mentions the Auditor-General&#39;s report. He has a right to refer to the incident connected&#39; with the motion to adopt that report in order to correct the misrepresentation which* has been made concerning him, so long as he does not discuss the report itself. The honorable member has a right to vindicate himself before his constituents and the country. </para>

I understand that you, sir, have just ruled that an honorable member has not the right to make a personal explanation at any time other than between different items of business. I submit that it has always been the custom in this House - and it is the practice of the House of Commons which governs our procedure to a large extent - to permit any honorable member who has been either misunderstood or misrepresented, to make a personal explanation at any time. I do urge yOU, sir&#39; as the custodian of the rights of individual members of this House, to reconsider the ruling which you have just given. </para>

                    (Wimmera) &#91;11.5 a.m/}. - I desire to register my protest against the late hour at which this report is presented. It relates to a Department, the expenditure of which amounts to something &#34;like ^5,000,000 per annum, and of that amount about ,&#163;1,500,000 is expended on new works and buildings. The report dealing with the accounts of the Department is presented so late that we have no opportunity to review it. There has been a delay of two years in its preparation. It has been complained again and again that it is impossible to gather from the Budget-papers anything like a clear idea of the the  and classification of the various Departments, and this report by the Accountant should have been presented at a time when we should have been able to study it in detail. As it is, we have merely put before us on the last day of the session a motion to obtain authority to print the report. Only one copy of that report is presented, and it seems to be held by the Postmaster-General, so that we cannot see it to ascertain whether or not it ought to be printed.

                    <para>.- I join in protesting against the request made to the House to vote for  the  printing of a document that we have not had an opportunity of perusing. I understand that the report is one by the Postmaster-General on his Department. I should like to see a report by the Department on the Postmaster-General. The Government should ;give us an opportunity to see what is in the document before we vote on the question of whether it be printed or not. </para>

I may point out that the report&#39;  deals with the difficulties in regard to the employes, and shows, among other things, that 40,000 miles of telephone lines have been constructed. </para>

                    <para>- I have received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> who is unable to be present to-day, the following valedictory letter: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>I regret very much that illness has prevented me from attending the House to-day and personally addressing a few words to honorable members at the closing of the last session of the present Parliament. I take this opportunity, however, of making some remarks through my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline></para>
                    <para>I think the House is to be congratulated on having satisfactorily completed the labours of a session which has proved to be one of the longest and most trying that have been held since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Measures of very far-reaching importance have been dealt with and passed into law, and some, of perhaps even greater moment, now await the decision of the people of the Commonwealth. The work has entailed a large number of sittings and very long hours. Our duties in this Parliament make demands upon the time and energies of honorable members to an extent they could never have anticipated, and for which, in some quarters at least, members do not get the credit they deserve. We feel naturally glad and relieved when the session terminates. </para>
                    <para>I would like to say, and I feel sure that the House will heartily agree with me, that we are all extremely pleased to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy</inline> once more among us after his recent severe illness, and we trust that the recess will enable him to gain that perfect vigour of body which we all wish him to enjoy. I desire to express my personal obligation to him for the great zeal and ability with which he always assists me in the performance of my duties. </para>
                    <para>I would likewise express my warm appreciation of the very efficient services rendered to the House by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale,</inline> who discharged so worthily the duties of Acting  Clerk. </para>
                    <para>I desire also to thank the other officers of the House, especially for the way in which they worked during <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy&#39;s</inline> absence. During times of great strain and stress all the members of the staff- the clerks at the table, in the offices, and messengers and cleaners alike - have worked right loyally and well, and their services have contributed in no small degree to make my path an easy one so far as the Department is concerned. </para>
                    <para>Like the officers of the House, the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Friend,</inline> have had  their powers of endurance tested to the utmost. Incidents (notably cases of illness among the staff) have occurred during this and previous sessions, which have demonstrated the absolute necessity of increasing the numerical strength of the reporting staff, and the  President  and myself intend to request the Treasurer to provide the necessary funds for that purpose. I take this opportunity of acknowledging our indebtedness to the  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for his kindness in placing at our disposal the services of two reporters from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff of that State to meet the exigencies of our work. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>In regard to the Library, I have much pleasure in testifying to the excellent manner in which the Committee have performed their duties. The staff, too, have done their work well. </para>
                <para>The Library is now being steadily built upon the foundation originally laid for it - namely, that of a national, rather than of a merely Parliamentary, institution. It is becoming wider and wider in its scope, and consequently its utility is daily increasing. The labour involved in managing it is necessarily greater also. In the Australian section we are laying deep and broad the foundations of a truly Australian National Library, which will, I trust, greatly redound to the credit of the Commonwealth. The chief difficulty standing in the way of the satisfactory development of our Library is the ever-growing want of accommodation, not only in respect of the storage of books, but also in regard to their accessibility. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, I desire to thank honorable members for the many kindnesses which I have personally received at their hands, and for their assistance in satisfactorily conducting the business of a session which has been so full of strenuous work for us all. </para>
                <para>To every honorable member and to every officer I sincerely wish a very &#34; Happy Christmas and a Most Prosperous New Year.&#34; </para>

                                    - Of the increase of  &#163;2,000,000,  an increase of about  &#163;600,000  is to be accounted for under the head of New Works. It has long been recognised that larger expenditure was necessary to place telephones and other works of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department on a satisfactory footing. Then it must be remembered that in the later year we have to pay interest to the States on transferred properties. The amount is nearly  , &#163;300,000.  In the earlier year we made no such payment There remains an increase of, roughly,  &#163;1,100,000  to be accounted for. In this connexion it may be pointed out that the revenue has increased by something like&#163;500,000, notwithstanding that penny postage, involving a loss of over &#163;400,000 a year, has been adopted. The increase of business, the greater cost of labour and materials, the increased prices demanded for mail contracts, and the recognition of the just claims of the employes, may be set down as explaining the increase of &#163;1,100,000.

                                    The increase of invalid and old-age sions is partly due to the fact that in the earlier year invalid pensions were not in force. In that year large numbers of qualified persons still hesitated to claim pensions. Added to this, amendments welcomed by both parties in Parliament have recently been made. It is thought that the increase in the cost is well justified.

                                    - The whole expenditure in 191 3 appears to be an increase. This is due to the fact that in 1910 the Northern Territory and Port Augusta Railway were, still under the control of the State of South Australia.

                                    There is a reduction of nearly &#163;2,500,000 under this head, due to the fact that 1910 was the last full year in which the States were entitled to three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. Now the States receive 25s. per head of the population, Western Australia and Tasmania receiving, in addition, special payments.

                                    - There is an increase of roughly, &#163;750,000. This is due to the extension of Commonwealth activities in various directions. For instance - Federal Capital, High Commissioner, land tax, bounties, &#38;c. The whole of the increase can be well justified, but it is not thought necessary to enter into the details here.

                        <para>Included in the estimated expenditure of 1913, amounting to &#163;22,683,541, there is an amount of . &#163;3,985,921 for new works, including construction of Fleet Unit. The new works expenditure of 1910 was &#163;903,494. It will be seen that the increase under this head alone amounts to over &#163;3,000,000. The whole of this money has been found out of revenue, and the purposes for which it is being expended are similar to those which other Governments have usually provided for out of loan. Since the present Government took office an amount of about &#163;10,000,000 has been provided out of revenue for new works.

                        <para>The Commonwealth Treasurer has a large amount of money under his control which is not available for general purposes of the Government. These moneys are known as Trust Funds. They are not Trust Funds in the ordinary sense of the term. Usually Trust Funds are moneys held by a person on behalf of some other person, but Commonwealth Trust Funds are, to a large extent, moneys belonging to the Commonwealth itself. On the  30th  of September last the Trust Funds amounted to  &#163;13,127,340.  Deducting the Australian notes account, amounting to  &#163;9,633,924,  we find that the other trust moneys amounted to  &#163;3,493,416.  A small portion of the last-mentioned amount certainly belongs to private individuals, being moneys lodged as security for the performance of contracts. Another comparatively small portion represents Customs duties paid under protest and on deposit. Some of these will ultimately have to be repaid, but almost the whole of the &#163;3,493,416 represents Commonwealth moneys earmarked for particular purposes. That is to say, Commonwealth revenues have been appropriated by the Parliament for various purposes and the Treasurer holds them in trust for expenditure on those purposes. </para>

It places in the hands of honorable members the facts and figures as we know them, so that all may have an equal opportunity to draw their own inferences from the position of the finances of the Commonwealth. Whatever may be our individual opinions - whatever may be our party views - I am sure :that honorable members generally have at heart the welfare of the Commonwealth, and while its finances are in a sound state there is little else that can tend to do it any injury. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot even  Congratulate  the country without being interrupted by a party  interjection.  We are under an  obligation  to be  grateful  to Providence for  all  the good times that have come to us  in  recent years, and we hope they will continue. It is easy to govern Bie country in rolling seasons, and the difficulties commence only when the seasons change and the revenues are depleted. This Government have been singularly fortunate in connexion with the finances.  A comparison has been made between the term of office of this Government and the term of three years preceding. Might I point out that there was a great contrast between the conditions which prevailed during the two periods. The present Government have had the advantage of revenue which was previously enjoyed by the States. The Prime Minister has himself stated that, whereas in 1909-10 the States received from the Commonwealth &#163;8,500,000, they now receive only about  &#163;6,000,000.  The revenue available for Commonwealth purposes has been further increased owing to the imposition of the land tax and prosperous seasons. During the three years they have been in office the Government have received nearly &#163;14,000,000 of extra revenue as compared with that received by their predecessors. In addition to that, the land tax has yielded ever &#163;4,000,000, so that the Government have had the advantage of &#163;18,000,000 additional revenue. When we have startling figures like these, due not to anything that has been done by the Government or Parliament, but to the fact that the advent to office of the present Ministry synchronizes with the new financial arrangements under the Constitution, it must be admitted that this Government have been extremely lucky in respect to the finances, as well as in regard to other things. All the money spent on defence, which has been tabulated to-day, was the subject of statements which we have already read over the signature of the Attorney-General, and only the other day I read most of them in the Ballarat newspapers. </para>

                <para>All these revenues come out of the pockets of the people. This is the first, thing that requires to be clearly impressed upon our minds. It is as well for us to recognise that since this Federal Parliament has been in existence there has been a steady increase in taxation.  </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true. But I should point out that taxation alone during the last ten years has increased by &#163;8 15s. per ordinary family. The increase since this Government took office amounts to 19s. per head, or 95s. per family. The Prime Minister said that &#34;this year the revenue had been estimated at slightly over &#163;20,000,000, and the expenditure at &#163;22,683,000, and but for the fact that the revenue has been more buoyant than the Treasurer estimated our out-goings would have exceeded our income by no less than &#163;2,500,000. All this is going on in rolling seasons. But for the fact that we had a stocking with some savings in it we should have been in a very serious financial position. Next year &#34;when, according to the Estimates, these savings will be mopped, up, we shall probably have an expenditure of 14 per cent, more than that for the present year. I say that, for the reason that the estimated spendings of the past three years have shown an annual increase of 14 per cent. If there is a 14 per cent, increase next year - aria1 that would not seem to be above the average - it is quite clear that there is a very serious outlook facing the Commonwealth of Australia.. There is only one feature that&#39; relieves the situation, namely, that the condition of the country is usually better than our Estimates lead us to expect. That is the invariable experience, and it is a fact that is entitled to be mentioned in a criticism of this sort. </para>

                <para>A&#39; great deal has been said about the expenditure on the Post Office. I do not want to weary honorable members, but I must refer to the statement of the Treasurer on this point. He pointed out the increased expenditure on the Post Office this year. He did not tell us that &#163;1,592,000 more than the income of the Post Office would be spent ; whilst last year the expenditure was ;&#163; 1, 8 2 4, 000 more than the income. This year, the excess of expenditure over revenue is 37 J per cent. </para>

                        <para>- There is no party significance attaching to the matter, since we all voted , for penny postage. But it is a fact that the people who will have to pay for it are chiefly the working men of the country. I say so for the reason that tSe&#34; deficit on account of penny postage will amount to 6s. 9d. per head of the people of the country. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member voted for it for purely political reasons - to make the people of the country believe that he and his party were making them some dole derived from a mysterious source quite apart from the people&#39;s own pockets. The loss on penny postage alone will mean an average of 30s. per annum in the family of an ordinary taxpayer; and &#39;I have yet to learn that an ordinary working man and his family spend that amount a year ora postage, though I have no doubt that some do. My honorable friends opposite are always saying that the workers pay the bulk of the indirect taxation. Therefore, they must be paying the bulk of this money. </para>

                <para>Another matter referred to by the Prime Minister was the fact that we are spending this year nearly &#163;4,000,000 on public works. We are; and there is no Government in Australia, except the Federal Government, which is spending money like this, or spending it In such an unbusinesslike way. We have no plans or specifications for any of the whole &#163;4,000,000 which we are spending this year. We have to put our blind trust in the Minister of Home Affairs. If he were a perfect angel, this criticism would be quite as much in point. As we know him to be an ordinary man of the world, and not even a financial genius, in spite of what he says about himself, our position is that we are spending nearly &#163;4,000,000- on public works without so much as a single independent inquiry to show us where any of the money is going. The sooner we have an inquiry of some, kind, aided by expert advice, the better for this Parliament, and all concerned. </para>
                <para>I had made notes on other points, but I know that honorable members are anxious to get away. The Ministerial party have got in their own statement for the information of the country. I should not have said anything except for this political statement containing a comparison between the administration of this Government and that of preceding Governments. </para>

                        <para>- If the people of this country like to &#34;pay up and look pleasant,&#34; and believe that the more money we take out of their pockets the better off they will be, I have only to point to the fact, and leave them to make the best of the situation. It is necessary that the working men should know that all these benefits which have been conferred by this and past Governments have had to be paid for, and that the bill has had to be footed by the people. As regards these Trust Funds, I shall not say a word, except to put one other fact alongside the fact stated by the Treasurer - that this year we are earning in interest &#163;290,000. The Prime Minister did not state the additional fact that this year there is &#163;750,060 on the Estimates for payment of interest. </para>

                <para>We have every reason to be gratified that Providence has been kind to this country during the past three years, and many a year before. We have had a succession of seasons that would enable any Government to finance under any circumstances. But honorable members must not suppose that the extraordinarily flourishing state of affairs mentioned by the Treasurer is in any way due to the efforts of this </para>
                <para>Government. It is due rather to good seasons and the lucky circumstance that the Government inherited an additional &#163;14,000,000 of revenue when they came into office. All I have to say is, long may the good seasons prevail. </para>

                    <para>. - Before moving the adjournment of the House, I congratulate you, sir, first of all, on presiding over this Assembly, and at the same time express my regret at the cause of it. Honorable members will be with me when I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has done his very best to maintain the dignity of this Parliament as the National Parliament of Australia, and I regret that just towards the end of a most strenuous session he has been so unwell as to be unable to carry on his duties. I thank you, sir, for the services which you have rendered to the House in acting for him. I should like to refer to a matter which was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in a letter which he was good enough to address to the House, and which was read by you, in which he specially mentioned <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The chief of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff and the members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff generally must be pleased, not only with the way in which their reports are received, but with the credit given to them for fairness and thoroughness. It is seldom that we hear anything but praise regarding <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and, speaking generally, there is a violent contrast between the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports and the reports of members&#39; speeches which appear in other places. As regards the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.,</inline> that the time has arrived when there ought to be an increase in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, I desire to say on behalf of the Government that I quite concur in that statement, because there should always be trained men in reserve, so that inferior work may be avoided. A great deal of the legislation that has been passed is on basic principles that will be built upon in the future. I believe that during the last three years the legislation which we have passed has helped to build up a national life in Australia. Any one who has had the opportunity to look into matters will have observed the feeling arising amongst the citizens of this great country. They feel that they are part of one great whole, whilst many of them are strenuously maintaining what I should call subordinate patriotism in their particular areas. I believe that that development and growth will make this country what it ought to be - great not only in its laws, but in its national energy, wisdom, and thought. It is for that reason that I think we ought in some small way to congratulate ourselves upon the fact that we are helping to develop national ideals. We as a National Parliament have to look further afield. We are becoming more and more closely allied with the Mother Country and other British Dominions than we have ever been before, and that is due to the fact that there has been a larger measure of freedom granted to us. The effort of the Mother Country during the last three or four years has been to give absolute freedom to her children, and there has been a development of what I might call a national feeling in the British&#39; Dominions that is commendable and patriotic, and has, I believe, been helpful to the peace of the world. I am sure that it is the desire of every honorable member that that attachment should never be less than it is at present, and that we and the Homeland should become nearer and dearer as time passes. I do not know that I can add anything more to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has said regarding the work of other officers of Parliament. They have contributed to our peace of mind and enjoyment. As regards the little controversies and acrimonies that are inseparable from militant political bodies, I do not think that they have been excessive during this Parliament. We feel that we can meet each other in social intercourse, cordially wishing that Heaven may have the best in store for us. I extend to my friends on the Opposition benches, and to you, sir, and the officers of Parliament the heartiest compliments of the season. If honorable members have to meet each other in Philippi, and say a few words later on that may not be as congratulatory as these are, I hope that those words will be uttered without malice and vindictiveness, and in such a manner as  will do credit to ourselves and the people of the country. I desire to wish the whole of the members of the Federal  Parliament, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and other officers of Parliament, and the newspaper press, that has been good enough to give us their aid at times and at other times to administer a rebuke, the very heartiest compliments of the season, and to express the hope that many of them may return and enjoy themselves as best they may in future Parliaments of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I want, on behalf of the Opposition, to subscribe to every word of the Prime Minister in making appreciative acknowledgment of the service rendered by all the officers of the House. We are under many obligations to these gentlemen, from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> down to the humblest messenger in the corridors. We are, perhaps, sometimes inclined to overlook <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> great services rendered to us by the patient, silent men in the corridors, who administer to the efficiency of this Parliament in a thousand ways every day we meet. I deeply regret the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and the cause of it. I express the hope that his health will be speedily restored, and that he will soon be able to serve the country as he has done in the past. To you, sir, as his  Deputy,  and as  Chairman  of Committees, I tender thanks for many courtesies. I tender thanks also to the officers placed at our disposal, who give willing help in ministering to the efficiency of our labours, and always assist to maintain the status and dignity of this National Parliament, as well as to the recording angels, who, week in and week out, do their duty under circumstances which would make anybody else rise in violent protest. We are under many obligations to them, and I am glad to hear that relief is promised in the way indicated It cannot come too soon in my judgment, and it will be well for this House and the country if our <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff is always maintained in its present efficiency. With regard to the work of Parliament, of course there must always be differences of opinion, but I want to say that I believe every member of this Parliament has been actuated by the best of motives. While we see things through different lenses, sometimes we all, I am sure, try to look for the same goal, to see what is best for the interests of the country. As for the animosities and acerbities that develop now and again, I say that life to me would not be worth living if they remained to linger. When I go out of Parliament I leave everything of that kind behind me. I believe that this Parliament has done a great deal of good work. I make that acknowledgment freely. I hope that some of it has been done in such a way as will lead to the future prosperity of this country. That is a desire which should animate every patriotic man with regard to the Parliament in . which he is privileged to serve and the country in which all his interests are. Later .on there is to come a struggle, a friendly struggle I hope, regarding the question of the future powers and privileges of this Parliament. &#39; We shall be ranged very sharply in opposition on these issues, and, therefore, it is well that we should make acknowledgment of each other&#39;s good intentions before entering the field for that great struggle. I should like to emphasize what the Prime Minister has said as to the development of our Imperial relations. It is quite evident that we are on the eve of changes, vital in their character, which will affect the future progress of our Empire. With the Prime Minister, I hope and believe that in all that we do we shall minister to the strength of the whole, while we preserve the self-governing powers of the parts. Indeed, I believe that our Empire has hit upon a plan which has in this respect &#39; better succeeded than the course followed by all the Empires that have previously existed. I again express our feelings of great obligation to all concerned in the maintenance of this House and its privileges. I wish honorable members on the other side a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and I hope that everything that nature can give us in the way of personal betterment may come to &#171;very one of us during this festive season. </para>

                    SALMON (Laanecoorie) &#163;12.41&#93;. - Perhaps honorable members will allow me a couple of minutes of their time while I most regretfully take my leave of them. Circumstances over which they, as well as I, have had absolutely no control have made it necessary that I should not return to this House. I recognise that with a great deal of sincere regret. It was any privilege to be associated with the Federal movement many years before it assumed definite shape. I have always regarded that as one of the highest privileges that have fallen to my lot. To be intimately associated with the birth, as well as the growth and development, of a nation is surely one of the highest aspirations which any one could have, and must be a source of satisfaction to those who have enjoyed the privilege. During the time I have been a member of this House, which dates from its inception, I have made many friendships. These have not been confined to gentlemen of my own political way of thinking. I have always been glad to recognise and acknowledge the honesty of purpose which has actuated the members of this Federal Parliament in their desire to secure the greatest good for the people of Australia. Although there have been times when, in the heat of debate and the stress of combat, one may have said or done things which might bear a different construction, I wish to assure honorable members that if at any time I have wounded their feelings or hurt their sensibilities, no one regrets it more than I do myself. Something has been said with regard to the future, and perhaps, in- my &#34; last dying speech and confession,&#34; I might be permitted to join sincerely in the hope that, no matter how strenuous the fight may be, or how earnestly we may urge the people to adopt the principles which we advocate, the struggle will be an &#39;impersonal one. I hope that it will not afford opportunities to that section of the public, which, unfortunately, exists in this as in every community - though I would not suggest for a moment that it exists here in larger proportion than in other countries - to indulge in sensationalism at the expense of truth or of the good fellowship which should exist between those who are striving only for the welfare of the country. Finally, I thank honorable members of this and of previous Parliaments for the many courtesies and kindnesses that I have received at their hands. Many things have happened which have been, I recognise, in quite a natural way the result of political action, but I assure honorable members that, no matter what my future may be, even if it may happen that I shall have no more part or lot in the political history of this country - and it is now over nineteen years since I first entered this Chamber as a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly - I shall always remember with satisfaction, and treasure with the deepest satisfaction and most complete appreciation, the great and many kindnesses that I have received at their hands.

                    <para>. - I have been a member of a number of Parliaments, but the impulse has -never before come to me to take part on occasions like these by making a speech. This session, however, concludes what I hope will be my first term in the Federal Parliament, and r I cannot permit it to pass without expressing the pleasure that I feel in having been a member of this assembly. Even if it should not be my good fortune to return again after the prorogation, I shall always cherish pleasant recollections of my association with honorable members. The honorable member for Parramatta is a man whose opinions are anathema to many of the members of the party to which I belong. In the forthcoming campaign we shall do most assiduous battle with him, and with his followers, and shall endeavour to exterminate them as they will endeavour to exterminate us. But while I have never been in agreement with the views expressed by him, he has won my admiration by the manner in which he has led and fought for the party with which he is associated. I like a man who has the courage of his convictions, and is ever ready to go out and do battle for them. It is a hard thing to have a leader whose followers have to push in front, and it is a fine thing to have one who will lead to battle. There is. an old saying that the memory of a man passes away and is forgotten, and that even his monument crumbles into dust, but it will always be pleasant to us to recollect the manly attributes of our opponents, and I could not permit the opportunity to pass without expressing my admiration&#39; of the fighting qualities of the honorable member for Parramatta. He has said that we look at the truth through different lenses, and I have, read a Persian proverb to the effect that truth is a mirror direct from Heaven, broken&#39; into a myriad of. fragments which no man has a hand large enough to gather up and hold together. No one of us, and no party, has such a hand, but each party thinks that it represents the truth. This party will go to the country to demonstrate that the honorable member for Parramatta and his cohorts are entirely in the wrong, and M we convince the people of that, and the truth prevails, we shall be returned. The honorable member for Parramatta sees facts in another light, and he will endeavour to do, in regard to us, what we shall try to do in regard to him. We shall say strong things of one another, and why not ? On the field of conflict there is no room for half measures. You have to win if possible. It is said that in politics there are no principles, only interests; and that is so. But underlying every conflict of opposing parties there are always the powers of good and evil, of right and wrong, of progress and stagnation. In ail the ages these are the primary forces which have been beneath the conflicts for supremacy in every human society. We * have made, and shall continue to make mistakes, but we hope that out of this conflict of parties the truth will emerge, and that the country will be the greater and the better as the result. Some of us will fall on the field ; because there are no fights without victims ; .but while I hope that the party with which I am associated will be triumphant, I repeat that it is a great pleasure to me to have been associated with men like the honorable member for Parramatta, and his party, who have had the courage to fight for the truth as they see it </para>

                    <para>.- I take this to be the psychological moment for planting some seeds of progress. While indorsing every remark made on both sides of the House as to the splendid work of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, I hope that the Prime Minister, during the recess, will take into consideration the need for having extra men to be called on when all-night sittings occur, such as we have had of late. Those members of the fourth estate who attend, day after day, and night after night, should be able to fill the places of the official reporters when necessary, and&#62; speaking with some knowledge, I say that I think that the proprietors of the big newspapers, no matter what side they may take in politics, would gladly lend the services of their officers in a time of stress and need; because there are many others to fill the posts that would then be left vacant. I take this opportunity to say that I started my life with ideals, and no Parliament of which I have had the privilege of being a member has ever carried so many of them to fruition as this has done. One alone remains of those with which I started over a score of years ago, and that is the child pension. If the revenue of the Commonwealth continues to come in as it has been doing, according to the- statement made by the Prime Minister this morning, and the God-given gift of splendid seasons remains to this beloved Australia of ours, I hope, should I be permitted to enter the next Parliament - and I shall make a pretty good fight to get in - that it will be my privilege and pleasure to see the right honorable gentleman moving a measure under which every mother in the Commonwealth will be able to claim, as a right, not as a charity - for that word is accursed to my idea wherever justice holds sway - a pension for her Australian babe, should her income not be sufficient to feed, clothe, and properly house the child; that she will be able to say, &#34; I claim from the Government of the country this right for the best immigrant that ever came to the shores of Australia.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to add very much to the sentiments so admirably expressed by the Prime Minister, the Leader&#39; of the Opposition, and succeeding speakers, but to express my gratification at the way in which the House has passed through a very severe session. Honorable members have, I believe, endeavoured to give expression to conscientious convictions, and what, I think, is more remarkable than anything else is, that in spite of the fierce differences of opinion on various principles which have been enunciated, fraternal feeling has prevailed between members of the Opposition and members on the Government side. Although our minds may be cast in different moulds, yet as regards the heart, we still evidence the oneness of the great human family. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the women of Great Britain and Ireland are asking for the suffrage on equal terms with men, he does not think that the experience of Australia, which led the way in this reform, warrants the adoption of the principle of equal suffrage by the British Parliament? And regarding the maternity allowance, if any instance is brought under the notice of his Department where an agreement between a woman about to become a mother, and an institution, that, for the payment of a certain sum, she shall have the benefit of the institution, has been broken - if an institution, after being paid the amount agreed upon, has deducted further sums up to  60  per cent, of the maternity allowance, will he institute inquiries and endeavour to make the institution restore the money to the unfortunate mother? Also, I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether in the coming session he will consider the necessity of carrying into law certain resolutions which were unanimously arrived at by the House. Further, I desire to know if the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs has been drawn to the fact that the National railway line of Canada for  2,000  miles, from Quebec to the coast, is run more cheaply as regards the fares for passengers than is any line in the United States of America, and that it is wholly controlled and worked by unionists, with the result that it is better built, operated, and charges lower fares than is the case with other railways? </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to allude to the matter to which the honorable member for Wimmera has referred. The point I understand is that the Commissioner decided that the assistant clerks were to get three weeks&#39; leave for the fourteen months work which they put in. Those who put in fourteen months&#39; work, and left on the 28th November, got three weeks&#39; money in lieu of three weeks&#39; holiday; in other words, they received . &#163;9. But those who left before the 28th November, although they had put in fourteen months&#39; work, the same as the others, have been refused any payment. They are twenty-three in number. It does not seem equitable that some should receive nothing while others who put in the fourteen months terminating at a slightly later date should get the three weeks to which the Commissioner has decided they are entitled. </para>

                <para>Mr.FISHER (Wide Bay- Prime Minister and Treasurer) &#91;1.3&#93;. - In reply to the honorable member for Melbourne, who asked me whether I think it would be in the interests of good government in civilized countries generally if women were enfranchised, I can only say, as he knows, that we in Australia have every reason to believe that the government both in the States and in the Commonwealth, has been distinctly improved by the granting of the franchise to women, and I feel sure that I express the feeling of honorable members when I say that they will be gratified indeed if the Imperial Parliament think it advisable to extend that privilege to the womenfolk of the United Kingdom. Beyond that we have no right to go. Regarding the payment of the maternity allowance, if women are called upon to give up their rights by duress, or by improper behaviour on the part of any per&#34; son or persons, it will be our duty to inquire into the matter, and we shall do so. Regarding the questions to the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Home Affairs, I can promise on their behalf that they will be dealt with. Concerning the inquiry of the honorable member for Wimmera about the census officers, my recollection is that I . stated that those who are entitled by law - reasonably within the law - will get paid. That is what I have stated again and again. They will not be put off by any technical objection ;  but it is clear that they must have put in over a year&#39;s service to be entitled to consideration. I cannot go behind that. I cannot commit myself to a general statement without knowing the facts, but, wherever I have the power as Treasurer, I shall certainly deal with such cases leniently. I do not wish it to be understood from that remark that I am committing myself and the Parliament to make payments to persons where otherwise they are not entitled to them. Favorable consideration will be given to every case where the person has a reasonable claim. The honorable member for Capricornia asked a question as to the position of the Government in regard to Naval defence generally. In reply, I have to say that the Commonwealth is, in my opinion, the only Dominion that has carried out the decision arrived at by the Imperial Conference of 1909. We have built our fleet unit so far as our finances allow, and we intend to continue to do our duty in that regard. I am glad to say that the development of thought at Home and elsewhere is on the lines of the policy originally adopted by the Commonwealth. Canada has followed suit in a way that brings her into line with the Commonwealth. The Pacific Fleet ought, I think, to be provided by Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and it would be desirable in the highest degree if there were more frequent Imperial Conferences, and if those Conferences could take place away from the Mother Country. I hope the time is not far distant when such Conferences, especially subsidiary Conferences, will be perambulatory. The leading statesmen of the United Kingdom are less informed about the Dominions than are the people of the Dominions about the United Kingdom. If my words can have any effect on the advisers of  His  Majesty the King, I nope they will take into consideration the advisability of sending .out here Ministers of De first class to confer on matters that concern the Empire) as a whole. </para>
