                        <para>- Is it a fact that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank has recommended the resumption of certain property in Sydney as a site for a branch of the Commonwealth Bank? If so, will the Prime Minister take into consideration the advisability of declining to act on the recommendation, and of resuming the whole of the General Post Office block, as in that way a more profitable bargain can be made by the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- It is correct that when Lord Denman accepted the high office that he holds it was understood that both Government House, Melbourne, and Government House, Sydney, would be available as residences for him and Lady Denman. The position was put before the State Government when the controversy arose respecting Government House, Sydney, and was repeatedly urged as a reason that should weigh with them, but without avail. The conflict is not one of money, but one of principle, and the Federal Government feel that they are not called upon to pay interest or rent under the circumstances I have detailed. </para>

In answer to the first question, I may say that the Government are responsible for any actions of the Governor-General. The facts as set out in the reported words are not admitted. As regards the second question, the Government agreed to accept terms for Government House. Sydney, with a lesser area of land. Every one knows that, for the fact has been made public. </para>

                            <para>- The cause of the failure must be obvious. The Commonwealth Government declined to pay rent or interest on the value of the property. They did not propose to alter the conditions. If the State Government desired to alter the conditions during the term of  His  Excellency's residence the Commonwealth Government saw no necessity, and, indeed, thought it would be a wrong policy, either to pay interest on the capital value or to pay rent during the period of  His  Excellency's residence in Sydney. As to the loyalty or disloyalty of State Ministers that is a matter which does not affect the Commonwealth Government. We shall see that the Governor-General will be properly housed in every State alike, when he is not at the Seat of Government. </para>

The honorable member will see that when I ruled him out of order the other day he was trying to deal with something which he could not properly deal with at that time. I may inform the House that the honorable member was good enough to write a letter to me saying that he proposed to take this action. With the consent of the House I should much prefer that the honorable member, instead of dealing with the matter to-morrow, should deal with it at once. If he is prepared to go on with it now I am ready and willing that he should do so in order that the matter may be done with. </para>

From time immemorial freedom of speech has been one of the privileges of members of the House of Commons, and, so far as our history goes, of members of the State Legislatures. This ancient privilege of freedom' of speech was some centuries ago interfered with by members of the House of Commons, when a member named Haxey introduced a Bill referring to the excessive charges of the Royal Household, that displeased the King. The member brought in his Bill, just as I, for example, might introduce a motion dealing with what I might consider to be excessive charges in connexion with the Governor-General's establishment. However, the House of Commons, by a majority, condemned Haxey as a traitor. That was in the reign of Richard II. - 1377 to 1399. I find, however, that in the next reign - that of Henry IV. - the decision was reversed by the Lords and Commons, as against the law and custom of Parliament. </para><interjection>

                        <para>Certain matters cannot be debated save upon  a substantive  motion which can be dealt with by amendment, or by the distinct vote of the House, such as the conduct of the Sovereign, the heir to the Throne, the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, the  Speaker,  the  Chairman  of Ways and Means, members of either House of Parliament, and Judges of the Superior Courts of the United Kingdom, including persons holding the position of a Judge, such as a  Judge in  a  Court of Bankruptcy, and of a County Court.  These matters, therefore, cannot be questioned by way of amendment. Now a substantive motion, I take it, is a motion which can be dealt with by way of amendment, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Erskine May, the authority to whom we chiefly refer on matters of parliamentary procedure, there outlined a sample of the questions which must be dealt with by a substantive motion. He lays it down that no motion concerning honorable members, the  Speaker,  or the  Chairman  of Committees can be dealt with by a substantive motion.  I  could not tack my motion to a Bill dealing with the land tax, or the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank or the maternity allowance. I had to submit a substantive motion. </para>

I would appeal to honorable members opposite to dismiss from their minds the words of the motion of which I desired to give notice. These questions of procedure are questions which ought to be dealt with on a non-party basis. The rules of parliamentary procedure concern us all, because there is no knowing at what lime we may be in a minority, and the Standing Orders which we have adopted, as well as the practice of the House of Commons, have been created in the interests of the minority - in the interests of the single individual - because the majority can always get their own way. </para><para>The brilliant minds of past members of the House of Commons have laid down this practice for us.

They have permitted freedom of speech in the House of Commons, and that has been the true safety valve.

                        however, interrupted me, and I resented his action because it was not the first time that he had done so when I had believed myself to be thoroughly in order. The Leader of the Opposition gave notice of his motion of censure on the Government, and the Prime Minister accepted that notice the night before the motion itself was debated. Next morning, I endeavoured to ask a question in regard to it, but was not allowed to read it. I resented that action on the part of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                        and was " named," with the result that I had to apologize.

                        refused to allow me to read this motion, and some honorable members endeavoured to shout me down. They cried out so loudly that my voice could be heard only within a few feet of me. That shows a distinct breach of the privileges of honorable members. I consider that I was only technically wrong on this occasion; but
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                        made me apologize for disobeying him, and then made me withdraw the words and apologize for having uttered them.

When I framed that motion, I thought that it was clever; I thought it "a hit - a palpable hit!" A gentleman who indulges his wit, very often at my expense, and who can hardly be deemed to be a friend of mine, considered the motion a well -merited gibe, quite worth launching at the proper time. </para><interjection>

                        does not decide how long a member may speak. Surely, if he can decide whether or not a motion is frivolous, he can decide how long an honorable member who is making a frivolous speech can take ? But any honorable member who joins with another in moving the adjournment of the House, can speak as long as the Standing Orders permit. However frivolous and unimportant, and even silly, his remarks may be,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                        has no right to interfere with him. Take the case of the adjournment of the House. At one time, in Some of the Legislative Assemblies of Australia, it was the practice that

He has nothing to do with the finality of the business of the House. The House adjourns on its own resolution. With the majority of the House lies the decision as to when the business of the House shall be determined - when the finality of the business shall take place. That is a matter for the Government, with the "consent of the majority of the House, to determine.

All the weapons of humour, satire, ridicule, mockery, derision, contempt, burlesque, and farce can be used by honorable members, if they so desire, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> prove that the Ministerialists have no right to occupy the Treasury bench, or to prove that the members of the Opposition are the proper persons to take their place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para><para class="block">

                        should hold the balance evenly between the parties. What would be thought on the cricket field if, when a player was making a run which he hoped would be to the advantage of his own side, the umpire stopped the game on the ground that the run was a frivolous one? What would be said in the football field if, when a player was about, in his opinion, to score for his side, the umpire stopped the game on the ground that the kick was frivolous? We are not in the football or the cricket field, however j we are in Parliament. I sincerely hope that honorable members will dismiss from their minds any irritation that may have been caused either by the terms of my notice of motion or its intention, and that they will decide this question on the merits of the case. I trust they will recognise that where the Standing Orders do not in black and white provide what shall be done,

                        <para>.- I intend to approach this question without any party feeling, and I trust that every other honorable member will do the same. The honorable member for Capricornia has dealt with the question calmly, judicially, and without any heat, though when his notice of motion was ruled out of order he, no doubt, felt very sore. The whole question before the House is whether a member of this House, occupying the position of  Speaker,  has power to prevent a motion being tabled. I have some little parliamentary experience myself, and I have looked through the Standing Orders very carefully indeed. It is laid down in the Standing Orders that notice of a motion may be given ; but as far as I can see - and I have looked up the parliamentary authorities, <inline font-style="italic">May, Bourinot,</inline> and others- nothing can be quoted which appears to give to an honorable member occupying the position of Leader of the Opposition any more privileges than those enjoyed by any other member of the House. I do not' think that that proposition can be denied for a moment. By usage, however - and parliamentary practice has grown by usage more than under Standing Orders- the Leader of the Opposition has certain privileges extended to him. When he rises in his place, and gives -notice of a motion, it rests, not with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but with the Prime Minister to treat it either as an ordinary motion or as an extraordinary one. The Prime Minister may choose to regard the motion as one attacking the policy of the occupants of the .Treasury bench. But it is only by courtesy and' usage that a motion from the Leader of the Opposition is treated in that fashion.. Under the Standing Orders no precedence is given to him over any other member of the House. As to the motion of which the honorable member for Capricornia desired to give notice last week, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> himself will see that it would be exceedingly dangerous to the privileges of this Chamber if the sole power were vested in him to say whether a motion was frivolous or not. The Standing Orders make provision that a matter of the kind shall not be left in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> but should be determined by the whole House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is there to preside over us and keep good order. He must do so in accordance with Standing. Orders that we ourselves have adopted. The Standing Orders provide that wherever there is any deficiency in them a Committee appointed for the purpose shall make a recommendation, or the practice of the British House of Commons may be resorted to. This is not a party question, and I do not approach it out of any feeling of antagonism to the present occupant of the chair. I shall be glad to know whether any  Speaker  of the House of Commons has ever prevented notice of a motion being given when that motion has been couched in proper and respectful terms. My own opinion is that such a precedent cannot be produced. Therefore, our  Speaker  should not attempt to claim more- under our written Constitution and Standing Orders than is claimed by the  Speaker  of the British House of Commons under its unwritten Constitution. The formula is laid down so clearly that honorable members can see for themselves what is the notice of motion. Whether the notice of motion read by the honorable member for Capricornia was in good taste or not, I am not going to argue. The honorable member himself has not argued that point, but he has argued, and, in my opinion, rightly argued - and I think that honorable members should agree with him - that it is the undoubted privilege of any member of this House to give notice of a motion dealing with a matter affecting what he might consider interests of the country about to foe disturbed, so far as he can judge, by the action of any individual, or any section of the House. Having taken that course, the notice of motion would appear upon the business-paper, and without the actual assistance of the Prime Minister in allowing the notice to be taken out of the ordinary course, it might be months before it could be reached, indeed, the session might close without it being reached. There is quite a number of safeguards provided in matters of this kind. I assert that our Standing Orders do not vest in the occupant of the Chair the right to reject a. notice of motion. I believe, sir, that I am correct in saying that you declined to allow the honorable member for Capricornia to continue to read his notice of motion because, in your opinion, it was frivolous. If that was so, the power of deciding the question of frivolity is, by the Standing Orders, and the usage of the Parliaments in Australia, vested, not in the  Speaker,  but in the members of the House. Some of my <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> from New South Wales may, perhaps, remember that some years ago the right of rejecting a motion was vested in the  Speaker  by a standing order of the Legislative Assembly; and so dangerous did the standing order become, and so ill-used was it, in some cases, I regret to say to the memory of those who have now passed away, that the members of the House saw their privileges being taken away from them, and, therefore, by a considerable majority, they deliberately altered the standing order depriving the  Speaker  of the right to say whether a motion was frivolous or otherwise, and placed that power in the House itself. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, he did. I do not wish to mention his name, but my colleagues will remember the gentleman whose action brought about the alteration. To a considerable extent, the Standing Orders of this House were framed on the lines of the Standing Orders of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. These matters were discussed - I was a member of the first Standing Orders Committee - and it was considered advisable that only what are termed temporary Standing Orders should be adopted in order that more time might be devoted to producing a complete set of rules in the future for the guidance of the House. It was stated then, that the first standing order - the one providing that where our own rules do not make provision ford any cases, the practice of the House of Commons must be resorted to -  covered all detects in the code. But we have gone on to this day in the eleventh year of our existence with temporary Standing Orders. Every honorable member has, I repeat, the absolute right to place on the business-paper a notice of motion to be afterwards proposed by him. When the notice appears on the business-paper, is it the property of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker?</inline> No, it is the property of the whole House to be dealt with in accordance with its own procedure, and at its own time. Another abuse crept in in the past. Experience, we are told, teaches wisdom, and, so, in order to get rid of abuse, through the  Speaker  being invested with the power of declining to accept a motion, or to say whether it was frivolous, or would be non-effective, the power was deliberately vested in the House. I need only refer honorable members to the standing order to which the honorable member for Capricornia has alluded. If I desire to intercept the business of this country by intimating to the  Speaker  that I propose to discuss a matter of very great public importance, though it may not be a matter of the slightest importance in the world, public or otherwise, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is not vested with the power to say so. The House is invested with that authority. If five of my fellow members rise with me, although the  Speaker  may incline to the view that the matter is of no public importance, he cannot refuse to receive the motion. The motion is launched to be dealt with. The House may allow the motion to be discussed in the ordinary way,' and a vote to be taken, or it may not. It is the judge. If it should be considered that' the matter is frivolous, or of no public importance, any honorable member may appeal to the others to stop the debate at a moment's notice, and the House can close the debate at once. So far as the practice of the House of Commons is concerned, and certainly so far as our own Standing Orders are concerned, the power of decision is vested in the House, and not in the  Speaker.  I recognise, sir, that you would be the last person to willingly attempt to deprive any member of the House of his privilege of faithfully, honestly, and honorably representing those who sent him here, but with all due respect I would point out that none of us is immaculate or perfect. We are all liable to err. If honorable members, after calmly considering this matter, decide that the honorable member for Capricornia was wrongly interfered with, and was prevented from exercising a right which he possesses, it will be no reflection on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The honorable member did not claim privilege for his notice of motion, asking that it be given precedence of all other business. He merely read it, with a view to having it set down on the business-paper for discussion in the ordinary way. You, sir, interfered when he was reading it, and asked him to discontinue. Is there anything in any of our Standing Orders which allowed you to do that? It is expected of a member who is giving notice of motion that he shall read it so that the House may know what his proposal is. It is time that we had a complete set of Standing Orders to define exactly our procedure, and the rights and privileges of members, and to determine whether the guardianship of those rights and privileges is vested in you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> or in the House. I contend that it is vested in the House at present. This discussion will do good in giving an occasion for thought on this subject, and I hope the incident will induce the Government to provide for the adoption of permanent Standing Orders. Under the temporary Standing Orders, the Leader of the Opposition has no more rights and privileges than another honorable member. The Prime Minister, and his colleagues, have certain rights. They have the right to sit on a particular bench ; they can obtain messages from the Crown and produce them here ; they can arrange their order of business, and do other things which private members may not do. When the Leader of the Opposition gives notice of a motion censuring the </para>

                    <para class="block">Government, the Prime Minister may accept it as a challenge, and give opportunity for its immediate discussion, or he may refuse to do so; in which case, it takes its place on the notice-paper in the ordinary way. I understand that the honorable member for Capricornia thinks that, although the Leader of the Opposition made certain charges against the Government, those charges would be more properly brought against the Opposition ; and he desired to bring them against the Opposition. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> ruled that such motions as that of which he gave notice would lead to endless discussion and interference with the business of Parliament. Without reflecting on you, personally, I think that your ruling deprived the honorable member of a right which -he possesses, and left him with no other course to pursue than to bring forward the matter as a question of privilege, to be determined immediately by the House. </para>

                        <para>.- Like other private members, I have so few privileges, that I am always ready and willing to guard jealously those I have. No feeling has been engendered by the action of the honorable member for Capricornia, who has taken a manly and honorable course to get this question debated and put out of the way. He thinks that he has a grievance against the House for being pulled up by you when reading a notice of motion on Thursday last. </para>

A great deal has been said about the powers of the  Speaker,  but, in my opinion, the  Speaker  possesses no powers except those vested in him by the Standing Orders, or the practices of this House, and of the British House of Commons; the  Speaker  can do nothing on his own initiative outside those Standing Orders. There is no member but has far greater powers than those possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> According to the honorable member for Capricornia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> must put a motion in the words submitted by an honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member for Bourke. Even if a motion were respectfully worded - a motion raising a point such as that raised by the honorable member for Capricornia - referring to members of the Opposition, or certain members of the Opposition, or members on either side of the House, it would, undoubtedly, lead to abuse in this or any other Parliament, and, moreover, would be futile and demoralizing. When I have said that I have said all I can against this kind of motion. In my opinion, the broadest possible latitude should be given to every member who enters this House. A man does not come here as John, James, or Bill Sykes, but he comes as the honorable member for a constituency ; none of us are here in our own names, but simply in the names of constituencies outside, and for these only can we speak, and on their behalf. It is for that reason I desire there should be the widest possible latitude for honorable members to declare themselves in this House, where a record is made of their statements and actions, so that they may be judged by their constituents. Subject to decorum, and to the best known methods of carrying on business, the greatest latitude gives the best results in a representative House such as this. The strength of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> position lies in the fact that, if motions such as that before us were permitted they would fill the notice-paper, and some of them, though respectfully worded - and it would require no great ingenuity to so word them - would, doubtless, prove most disagreeable and offensive. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. The honorable member is not such a youth in parliamentary business, and in the framing of motions, that he could not, in perfectly innocuous language, make insinuations that would have the effect of a dagger thrust. What I mean is that honorable members would be quite capable of drawing up motions of that kind ; and it is just as well that the privilege should not be so widened as to enable the most frail of us at some time to do an irreparable injury to another quite as honest as himself. The weakest point I think in the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is that, before the honorable member for Capricornia had read his notice of motion in the first instance, he was stopped and named. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is anticipating what 1 was going to say. The practice has grown up in this Parliament that an honorable member, on giving notice of motion may give the substance of the motion, or read the whole of it, while he may afterwards alter it. If that be so, I submit that it would be wise for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to hear motions stated in their entirety, even though they should seem to involve a breach of the Standing Orders. An honorable member might see fit to alter a motion objected to, so as to bring it into conformity with the Standing Orders or the ruling of the Chair. It is inadvisable to anticipate that an honorable member by a notice of motion desires deliberately to flout the Standing Orders. He should be allowed to read it, and, if objection be taken to it, and the honorable* member will not modify it in order to meet the objection, it can be ruled out of order.. Such a practice would strengthen the position of the Chair. The honorable member for Capricornia has given a very fair historical review of the privileges, powers, and' immunities enjoyed by members of Parliament when they attack persons who are not members of the House. He will agree that it is a different matter to attack other honorable members in their representative capacity. They are the butt of public criticism here and elsewhere, just as he is himself. In dealing with subjects which are not politically personal, we may at times go too far, but it is much more likely that members will go too far when attacking the Opposition, who are not clothed with the responsibilities, powers, and duties devolving upon members of the Executive. The members of the Executive are subject to attack to a greater degree than are any private members of the House. </para>

                            <para>- No, none whatever. Noone is more able than is the honorable member for Capricornia to look up the strongest arguments in support of any position he may assume, and the strongest point he was able to make was in his reference to a motion of censure which was launched by the Leader of the Opposition against the Executive, who are responsible for the government of the country. The honorable member's motion is launched against the Opposition, who are charged with no such duty as the management of the affairs of the country. The members of the Opposition do not require protection from me or from any one else.. They are quite able to look after themselves, but I feel bound to say that I do not think the illustration given by the honorable member for Capricornia was a good one, because the cases he sought to compare are not analogous. The honorable member's references to the conduct of an umpire in controlling a game of cricket were beside the question. The question really is whether the game of Parliament can be carried on at all if motions of the kind under consideration are to be constantly moved or read out in this House If every member of the House exercised the privilege of reading out such motions referring to other honorable members, the time of </para>

I say that the more complete the opportunity given to honorable members to display themselves in any way they think fit, as representatives of their respective constituencies, the better.

His  powers and privileges have been placed in his keeping by the House. He cannot enter the chamber or leave it but by the authority of the House. He cannot put a motion except in accordance with our rules, and in the words in which it is submitted. He must act in every way in accordance with the rules and Standing Orders, and, while he does so, he is entitled to the greatest respect from honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Riverina has had a distinguished career in the Chair, and he must know that circumstances may arise, in this or in any other Parliament, which have never previously arisen. In such cases, common sense must rule, and the gentleman we appoint -to the most distinguished position in this House must decide, to the best of his ability, what is in order and what is not, and what action should in the circumstances be taken. Taking it all in all, the privileges of private members will not, I think, be seriously invaded by upholding the ruling of the Chair in this case. </para>

                        <para>.- My desire always has been, and I hope always will be, to uphold the authority of the  Speaker  or  Chairman  of Committees. I believe that should we cease to uphold the authority of our presiding officers, very serious difficulties must arise. My desire to uphold the authority of the  Speaker  or  Chairman  of Committees would not influence me if I believed that on any occasion they flagrantly exceeded their powers. Although my parliamentary experience has been very lengthy, I have had very little experience indeed of differing from the authority of the Chair. I have always been very anxious, even though  I  felt that I was being rather badly treated, to bow to the authority of the Chair.  I  am not aware of any precedent for such  a  motion as that which the honorable member for Capricornia desires to give notice of.  I  have never previously known a private member propose a motion of censure upon members opposed to him, and questioning the way in which they think it well to perform their public duties. I cannot see what object there is in such a motion, or what would happen if it were carried. I do not know what the Governor-General could do with the members of the Opposi-tion if such an address were presented to him. </para>

                            <para>- I  think it bears upon the question as to whether the motion which the honorable member for  Capricornia desires to give notice of is  frivolous or not. When would such a motion be discussed or be replied to? I think it is quite without precedent in parliamentary procedure. In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> was quite right in considering it a frivolous motion. It was frivolous, not only because it could have no effect, but because it reflected upon the conduct of " members of this House in an unnecessary, and, I think, a frivolous and unbecoming manner. T have no sympathy whatever with the present motion. All I need say in regard to it is that I am opposed to it, and I think that the honorable member for Capricornia has unnecessarily taken up the time of the House in bringing it forward. </para>

                        <para>.- I should not have risen to address myself to the question, but for some remarks which were made by the Prime Minister. In the first place, it seems to me that neither the merits nor demerits of the motion which the honorable member for Capricornia sought to move a few days ago are in question. oWe are bound by our Standing Orders, which lay down that, if I desire to bring forward a motion, so long as I can secure the support of five honorable members to that motion, I am entitled to move it. It is this House, and this House alone, which has the right to say whether or not a motion is of a frivolous nature. </para>

                            <para>- The fact that an honorable member is at liberty to move the adjournment of the House to call attention to any matter, so long as he can secure the support of five honorable members, clearly shows that there are no rules which vest <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> with power to decide that a motion is frivolous. It is this Chamber, and this Chamber alone, which has that power. If we are going to vest <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> with such a power, he may prevent any honorable member from submitting any motion. Is he to be the absolute judge of whether or not a motion is of public importance? If so, he may tomorrow prohibit any honorable member, who is in the minority, from moving a particular motion. It is idle to discuss the character of the proposal which the honorable member for Capricornia desired to bring forward. I recollect that, when the Gaming Act was under consideration in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, the Government of the day desired to exclude race-courses from the designation of public "place" ; and thereupon I attempted to move what was regarded as a farcical amendment to the effect that public " place " should be held to include " any place, anywhere, and at any time." The  Speaker,  on that occasion, held that my proposal would reduce the position to a farce ; but, after discussion, he decided that I was perfectly within my rights, and the amendment was allowed to be put. Since I have been a member of this Chamber, I have seen proposals which commanded the support of only three honorable members. What is the logical deduction to be drawn from that circumstance? Is it not that, in the opinion of the majority of honorable members, the proposal was absolutely farcical ? Upon that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> might just as well have decided that the motion was; farcical. But, if we are to discuss the merits or demerits of the motion which the honorable member for Capricornia desired to bring forward, I ask what was there in that, motion which was mere farcical or frivolous- - so far as its terms were concerned - than, there was in the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition? The honorable member for Ballarat has no more rights or privileges here than has the honorable member for Capricornia. What-: ever position he may occupy as Leader of the Opposition, so far as our StandingOrders are concerned, he possesses no more rights or privileges than does any other honorable member. </para>

I am dis- . cussing the merits of the motion which the honorable member for Capricornia sought to submit, which is almost identical in its; terms with that actually moved by the honorable member for Ballarat. What was it which made the motion of the Leader of the Opposition so reasonable, and that of the honorable member for Capricornia so absurd? I, at least, enter my protest against the exercise by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> of any power, until he has been armed with that power by this House. For that reason, I am in agreement with the motion of the honorable member for Capricornia. </para>

                        <para>.- Everybody will agree with the honorable member for Bourke that, so far as freedom of speech is concerned, honorable members of this House are exactly upon  the same footing. Indeed, a number of honorable members will go further and say that freedom of speech is permitted us to facilitate the transaction of public business. If the honorable member for Ballarat, on behalf of a united party, submits a motion of no-confidence in the Government, and that motion be carried, it is interpreted as an intimation by Parliament to  His Excellency  the Governor-General that Ministers have forfeited the confidence of the Democracy of Australia. On the other hand, if any honorable member chooses to submit a motion of no-confidence in a non-official member of the House, even if that motion be carried, it can lead to nothing, except to a petty gratification. It cannot in any way change the conduct of the affairs of the' Government ; and, consequently, must lead to a considerable waste of time, whilst being productive of no good. For instance, I might rise immediately after the honorable member for Capricornia had carried his motion, and move - </para>

                        <para>That an address be presented to  His Excellency  the Governor-General informing him that the honorable member known as the honorable member for Capricornia merits the censure of this House for his failure to realize his national and constitutional obligations, for flagrant neglect of his duty, and for unduly taking up the time of the House in moving amendments of a frivolous character. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Such a motion would promptly lead to recrimination on the part of the honorable member against myself- Thus, the time of the country would be taken up in the voicing of frivolous differences, without any possibility of reaching finality. Those differences would have nothing whatever to do with the public business which we are sent here to transact, and for doing which we are handsomely reimbursed. </para>
                    <para>There is, however, one difficulty which was mentioned by the honorable member for Bourke, and which is worthy of attention. I have searched the Standing Orders, and I have also given a little passing attention to <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> but I cannot find that any power is vested in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to deal with matters of this character. In order to absolve him from any charge of arrogating to himself a power which is not vested in him by the Standing Orders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should be given this power expressly. Where he thinks that the conduct of public business will be seriously interfered with if certain matters are brought forward, he should be empowered to prevent them being brought forward. 1 cannot agree with the Prime Minister that the easiest course to pursue is for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to hear motions read in their entirety before deciding whether he shall rule that they are in or out of order. That would be an unfortunate procedure to adopt, because every honorable member would then be afforded an opportunity to insult every other honorable member and to turn this Chamber into a place which would not reflect credit upon us. </para>
                    <para>I must say that my sympathies in this matter - and I have been to considerable trouble to arrive at a just decision - are with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is right in endeavouring to curb frivolity in the chamber. As an earnest student of public affairs, I like to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> adopting this procedure, and I should certainly hardly be doing justice to my humanitarian instincts if, on the occasion that I thought he was right, I did not support his ruling. I am sorry that the honorable member for Capricornia did not frame his motion on a somewhat broader scale. There are other matters to which 1 do not think I should be in order in referring in this debate, and therefore I shall not allude to them; but it seems to me that as the House has apparently given <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> power, by default, to alter the actual wording of questions on notice, without consulting the member who places those questions upon the business-paper </para>

It has been exercised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and it is a very serious power, as contrasted with that now objected to- the power to say that frivolous business shall not be placed before the House to the detriment of the conduct of ordinary business. No one, however, has objected to its exercise by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> There are other decisions by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> which have been indorsed in their entirety by honorable  members opposite, but which, like the decision to which I have just referred, seem to have absolutely no precedent in <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> and no justification under our Standing Orders. My honorable friends opposite, however, have  indorsed tthem,  and it is not in order for me, at this juncture, to refer to them. I regret that I am forced into the position of indorsing the general attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in this matter. I do not indorse it because the motion was moved against honorable members nf the Opposition. As a matter of fact, we are delighted to have any public criticism . upon our public actions in this House. We are ready to stand fire upon any of them, but we do think that, as we have come here to conduct public business, we might be permitted to do so without the time of the House and the country being taken up by the discussion of frivolous motions against us. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members perhaps have not quite realized the reasons for the action which you took last week, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> against the honorable member for Capricornia. The honorable member was in the middle of his notice of motion, when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> called him to order, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> at page 3621, and the following pages, shows conclusively that the honorable member took absolutely no notice of you when you called him to order. That proves conclusively, to my mind, that the offence of which the honorable member was primarily guilty, and which resulted in his being named, was not the frivolous framing of his motion, so much as his repeated disregard of the orders of the Chair when the Chair was seeking to interpose. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If it does not lie with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the House can only exercise it, and arrive at a verdict, after a long and useless debate, and much waste of public time. But so far as the question of finality to business is concerned, where a question is moved in order, and conducted in order, I take it that the House ought to be the only arbiter of such a matter. That being so, while I desire, in this, as in all other cases, to uphold the Chair as far as I can, it seems to me that, in his ruling in that matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> gave a bad reason for a good action. I do not wish to take up the time of honorable members further on that point. I can imagine the indignation of my honorable friend in being curbed in the middle of a most excellent joke. I realize that it is an excellent joke that can be turned upon any honorable member no matter on what side of the House he sits. </para>

I think that there must naturally be inherent in the Chair some power to deal with the regularity or irregularity of notices of motion. The honorable member for Capricornia, despite his seriousness today, must admit that when he gave notice' of his motion, he thought he was making, as he said, a hit, or doing something clever. It certainly was not seriously intended to be a notice of motion having anything to do with the transaction of public business in this House. </para>

The honorable member for Capricornia himself has said that he looked upon his notice of motion as a clever hit at the Opposition. He was seeking to aim at the Opposition a motion which he never intended to be regarded as part of the public business of this House.

                            <para>- The honorable member did not wait for me to finish my sentence. I was about, to say that the  Speaker,  from the attitude of the honorable member for Capricornia in the House on that occasion when he rose, and the way in which he- gave the notice of motion, was able to gather from what he did hear of the motion that it was unbecoming to submit such a motion to the House. When you see the motion, what  was it ? It was  a  mock motion of censure, obviously intended to be a travesty upon a motion that had been moved seriously in this House against the Government. The  Speaker,  as far as he heard it, could gather distinctly from the notice that the honorable member gave that his intention was simply to perpetrate a burlesque upon the ordinary parliamentary procedure.. There is a proper way of attacking a Government on a motion of want of confidence. This was only a burlesque on a want of confidence motion. The honorable member was trying to turn it round and point it at the Opposition in a way that he knew could only be futile. As the honorable member said, he thought it was clever, and possibly it was a clever point to make, but that is not the issue. It was for the  Speaker  to decide from what he had already heard whether the honorable member was starting on a course which was intended to lower the dignity of the House by introducing a practice unbecoming to the proceedings of the House, and by  giving notice of a. motion which might in itself be offensive to the House. In the circumstances the  Speaker  had the right to rule that the notice of motion was out of order, although, of course, this House has always the right afterwards, on proper notice being given, to object to the Speaker's ruling, and override it. So that, ultimately, as the honorable member says, the supreme power does rest with the House. But, for the time being, for the proper and orderly conduct of business, there must be somebody in the House to preside over, and, if necessary, to correct the irregularity of our proceedings. That power  we have vested in you, sir, for the time being, as the custodian of the procedure of the House, and I contend that the practice you have adopted, which seems to be in conformity with the quotation I have made from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> was in order, and that you did your duty in declining to accept the notice of motion. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire very briefly, but most cordially, to support the motion of the honorable member for Capricornia. The speeches we have heard from honorable members opposite go to show, if not conclusively, at any rate to some extent; that the motion is well justified. The right honorable member for Swan, going into the merits, referred to the obvious absurdity of the motion, and the honorable member for Darling Downs, by some psychological power which I do not possess, read the mind of the honorable member for Capricornia, for he was able to say, not only that what the honorable member had said, but also that what he intended to say, was an absurdity. The very fact of honorable members opposite rising in their places, and showing that they have been touched and hurt by the criticism of their policy, constitutes one of the strongest reasons why this House should be no party to " gagging " itself. As one who has taken the platform, and hopes to take it again- </para>

                            <para>- That is a limitation which the House imposed upon itself in the interests of the expeditious discharge of public business, and is by no means a limitation imposed by the  Speaker  upon the rights, powers, and privileges of the House. It is a limitation imposed by ourselves upon ourselves, which we can remove or modify at our own free will from time to time. We are told that the motion of the honorable member for Capricornia was obviously absurd and frivolous, and that this could be seen before it was heard. I did not see anything very facetious or wildly ridiculous in the attitude of the honorable member as he gave the notice of motion, and I do not think that honorable members opposite saw the fun of it either. They saw that it was a criticism directed at their policy, and at their attitude towards public business in this House recently. At any rate, on the broad and general principle that the onus lies upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and upon those who are assisting him in this matter, to show by reference to authority in what way an honorable member is limited, except by the rule which demands that any motion shall be couched in decent and proper language, I say that we, as guardians of our own privileges, and as representatives of the Australian people, are bound to see that our rights are' not invaded. For these reasons, I am in accord with the motion submitted by the honorable member for Capricornia. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that this discussion will do no harm, because it may help to clear the atmosphere and enable honorable members to know where they stand in regard to their rights and privileges with some approximation to exactitude. The members of the Opposition have frequently felt a great deal of resentment at certain decisions which have been given from the Chair, and which seemed to them to encroach unduly upon their rights. .Of course, it may be said - and quite correctly - that if the Opposition feel aggrieved they  have the right of moving dissent from the Speaker's ruling. But that is an extreme step, which very few honorable members feel inclined to take, and which will not be resorted to unless it is considered that some exceptionally harsh or unjust ruling has been given from the Chair. There is also the obvious disadvantage that very often a motion for dissent from the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is decided rather on party lines than on the actual merits of the question. The tendency of the House in a case of that kind would naturally be for the majority - that is the Government - to uphold the ruling, especially if it were to the disadvantage of the minority. May I refer, by way of illustration, to a case in which a ruling was given to the effect that members of the Opposition had no right to discuss either a motion or an amendment before the House, but were confined to discussing a blank ? That ruling made discussion absolutely impossible. There was a strong disposition on the part of a number of members of the Opposition to resent the ruling given. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to go beyond that, but the question of the privilege of members is the basis of the motion, and I thought that I might be allowed to refer to an incident that occurred as illustrating what may happen when, as a result of a ruling, discussion is rendered a practical impossibility. I am glad that the honorable member for Capricornia and the honorable member for Batman have shown a desire to resist any encroachments upon the rights and privileges of honorable members I have more than once expressed my view that we should not permit any such encroachment, except upon very extreme provocation, and should even then be extremely chary about doing so. I have already said that the Opposition have sometimes felt inclined to take exception to the rulings given from the Chair. We have not had recourse to the method of moving dissent from' a ruling, because we have felt that it would be futile to do so. There were also other reasons - perhaps personal regard for </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                        himself, as well as a natural disinclination to call his authority in question. Consequently, we have sometimes put up with what we deemed to be an injustice and an infringement of our rights rather than take the step' permitted by the Standing Orders. But when the honorable member for Batman talks about resenting encroachments upon the right of free speech, I should like to ask him how long he has been of that opinion? It is not long since he voted for a limitation upon the speeches of honorable members. In that way, certainly, an encroachment was made upon the right of free speech. It may be that the honorable member would reply that the House itself imposed a limitation upon its own powers. But that is not quite the correct view, because what happened was that the majority who did not want its measures examined and criticised imposed its will upon the minority. I cannot help thinking it is a pity that we in this House have not yet' a proper set of Standing Orders. We have not yet had an opportunity of deciding for ourselves what shall be the rules of the House. We are still working under temporary Standing Orders, and much has to be left to the discretion of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline>
                        Where the Standing Orders do not make specific provision, resort has to be had, as far as possible, to rules laid down in May's
                        <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice.</inline>
                        I have not always been able to reconcile rules contained in
                        <inline font-style="italic">May</inline>
                        with some of the conflicting rulings that have been given here, nor to reconcile rulings on the same point given from the Chair in this House. As to who should be the authority on matters of order, I take it that, unquestionably,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                        should be. He is the authority who is called upon at the moment to give a ruling on any question of order that may be raised, but, of course, the House itself never parts with its own power, and can always decide for itself in respect to the decisions of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline>
                        The House itself is the final authority. I agree with the honorable member for Wentworth in what he said concerning the statement of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                        that if a motion like that of the honorable member for Capricornia were permitted to be submitted, there would be no finality to the discussions that would be raised. I do not know of any practice recorded in
                        <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline>
                        or any rule in our Standing Orders, which gives authority to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                        to determine the conduct of business or the finality of discussion. The persons ultimately responsible for the conduct of the business of the House are the Government of the day, and any one, whether he be a member of the Opposition or
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                        himself, who takes the conduct of business out of the hands of the Government practically carries a motion of censure upon them. In that case, it is for the Government to hand in their resignations to  His Excellency  the Governor-General. It is not for
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                        but for the Government, to determine upon the conduct and duration of business in this House. It is not for
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                        to determine upon the matter of finality in any discussion. The House has already decided upon that matter by the inclusion in the Standing Orders of what is known as the " gag " and by the limitation of the duration of speeches.

This Parliament has been in existence over eleven years, and we are still working under temporary Standing Orders I think it would be a good thing, even in this session, seeing that the business is proceeding so rapidly, if the Government would afford an opportunity for a review of the Standing Orders, and let the House decide upon what procedure is to govern its actions. </para>

That is the point. The honorable member foi Wentworth said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> ought to be invested with some authority to prevent honorable members from moving motions of a frivolous character and taking up the time of the House. He also said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> ought to have it in his power to decide whether he would admit motions which could not lead to anything. The Leader of the Opposition submitted a motion which could not lead to anything, except something to which I shall refer afterwards. That motion occupied the time of this House for no less than twenty-eight days. </para>

The ordinary practice, sir, as you will admit, if it be desired to censure a Government, is to give notice of a motion that the Government no longer possesses the confidence of this House. That is all that was; in any of the motions which have ever had any business in them. That is the simple form which they have taken. In my opinion, the Leader of the Opposition had in his mind the same thing as I had in my mind when he submitted his motion. When he thought that the House had no longer any confidence in the Ministry, what did he do? He prepared a placard, a long list of charges- </para>

I am only discussing the terms of his motion to show the House that what he was aiming at I was aiming at. He was desirous of putting this party before the country and holding them up to ridicule and contempt. I was desirous of doing the same thing in regard to honorable members opposite. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to say a few words before the question is put. The motion moved by the honorable member for Capricornia this afternoon" has relation to action taken by me last week when the honorable member was reading a notice of motion. I intervened when the honorable member had read about half of his notice of motion, and thereupon he deliberately turned his back upon me, and refused to obey my call to order, thus committing one of the greatest offences that a member can commit. That matter, however, has been dealt with. As to whether the honorable member was in order in giving the notice of motion which he was reading, I wish to say, first, that my intervention was due solely to a desire to guard the privileges of honorable members, and I have been pleased to hear those who have spoken in favour of the motion now under discussion say that they did not support it because of. any personal feeling in regard to me. I appreciate the consideration that prompted that assurance. It is the duty of every honorable member who thinks that a ruling from the Chair is not in accordance with the Standing </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Orders, nor likely to conduce to the proper conduct of debate, to take an opportunity to have it discussed, so that the point at issue may be settled definitely by the House itself. Questions of relevancy, however, are entirely for the  Speaker  to determine, even though nine times out of ten he might be wrong. The determination of such questions by the House would be impracticable. It must be remembered, moreover, that any one making a speech has many ways of evading a ruling in regard to relevancy - I may have been guilty myself of doing so in the past: - but it is the duty of the presiding officer to see that the Standing Order on the subject is obeyed. The point involved in my action of last week is not dealt with by any standing order, nor has it arisen in the practice of the House of Commons,  nor of the Parliament of any other English-speaking community, so that it was left for me to deal with it by the application of common sense. The House is now asked to say whether in its opinion J did right or wrong. In my view, were I to permit of notice being given of a motion of the character of that which the honorable member for Capricornia wished to place on the business-paper, it would be impossible for me to prevent notice being given of a similar motion next day, and on subsequent sittings, until there would ' be so many notices of motion of the kind on the business-paper that the ordinary notices of motion would be lost sight of. The Standing Orders being silent on the subject, and there being no precedent in <inline font-style="italic">May, Bourinot,</inline> or other parliamentary authorities, it was my duty to decide the question as I thought proper. Every Speaker and every Chairman of Committees must from time to time give such a ruling on his own responsibility. Had a member of the Opposition risen in his place, and asked if the motion were in order, I should have had to give a ruling on the point, and the position then created would have been similar to that which came about as the result of my independent intervention. I saw clearly that if I allowed the notice of motion to be read, I could not prevent another honorable member from reading a similar notice of motion, censuring, perhaps, some member of the House other than the Leader of the Opposition. It is immaterial that the notice of motion was levelled against the Leader of the Opposition ; I should have taken the same  course  had it been levelled against the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government, a Minister, or any individual member. When the Leader "of the Opposition gives notice of a motion of censure he takes an action very different from that which the honorable member for Capricornia wished to take, because if his motion is carried the Government, as a consequence, must leave office. The carrying of a motion like that of the honorable member for Capricornia would have no such effect. Indeed, the carrying of the motion of the honorable member for Capricornia would have had no effect whatever. Therefore, there is no similarity between his motion and that of an ordinary motion of censure. Were I to prevent the Leader of the Opposition from giving notice of a motion of censure I should exceed my powers. ,In this connexion I would remind the House of the standing order which says that an  honorable member may not put questions to other honorable members who are not Ministers, except as to business of which they have charge. The reason for this standing order is that were one honorable member allowed to put questions of a personal or controversial nature to any other honorable member, the time of  Parliament might be entirely taken up with such questions. There is a connexion Bet ween that rule and the action which I took last week, but I do not lay stress upon it. What honorable members have now to consider is what is the best rule to follow in this matter for the proper conduct of our proceedings. I think that my action was the right one in the interest of the orderly conduct of debate, but, of course, I am in the hands of the House, and must do what it orders. It is true, as the honorable member for Capricornia has pointed out, that we are guided not only by the Standing Orders, but also by precedent and custom, and that when I give  a  ruling, establishing a new precedent, the House iaaf liberty to dissent from it, in which case I must follow another course. It is no reflection upon me should the House in its wisdom desire me to alter my ruling; I am not so egotistical as to think that my individual wisdom is greater than the collective wisdom of honorable members. But in this case I warn the House that should the motion of the honorable member for Capricornia be carried, I shall be compelled to permit every honorable member who desires to do so to place on the notice-paper motions similar to that which, he desired to" read. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret the absence, through indisposition, of the Leader of the Opposition. I hope that the honorable gentleman will soon be in his place again. We have to avail ourselves of this Supply motion to speak generally in regard to matters we consider of importance which it would not have been necessary to refer to on this occasion if private members' business had not been superseded. I am sure that the Leader of the House will recognise that we are entitled to take advantage of this opportunity to discuss, not merely matters included in the Bill, but other matters which we consider of public importance. In asking for Supply to be granted for three months, I think that the Government are asking for more than is warranted, under the circumstances. Of course, the Treasurer always finds it convenient to obtain Supply for as long" a time as possible, but it must be remembered that the Opposition naturally desire the House to retain control of the finances. There is no reason why the Government should ask for a grant of three months' Supply, seeing that, when they were in Opposition, they always objected to granting Supply for a longer period than one month. I recollect that the Treasurer, on one occasion, when the Government of which I was Treasurer asked the House to authorize the grant of two months' Supply, characterized the request as an extraordinary, if not an unprecedented one. I think the Prime Minister will recognise that, if Supply be granted for three months, he will deprive honorable members of some of their opportunities for criticism. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think we have much chance of going to the country for a little while yet. I wish now to touch upon a few questions of public importance. The first has reference to the extraordinary delay which is occurring in the work of constructing the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. J have no desire to be captious - in fact, I wish to assist the Government all I can in pushing forward that great undertaking. But, seeing that the Bill authorizing the construction of the line was passed nearly a year ago, it does seem strange that no provision has yet been made for the delivery of rails or sleepers on the ground. At Kalgoorlie,, no work is being done, apart from that, which is being accomplished by a few surveyors. I venture to say that there are not more than twenty men employed there. We have not yet been told whether the rails have been even ordered. Certainly, there are none upon the water. I believe that an arrangement is in progress under which some locally-rolled rails will be obtained at Lithgow  and, although the prices which, will, have to be paid for them will probably be greater than those at which we could purchase them elsewhere, the additional' payment of what will practically amount to a bonus upon their local production will be amply justified. My complaint is that the Government are not making sufficient progress. There are no sleepers, no rails., and no plant upon the ground. </para>

                        <para>- There are no sleepers on the ground, although there area good many hewers of sleepers in Western' Australia. The Government have given- themselves an immense amount of trouble by endeavouring to carry out this work, themselves. There is not very much difference between day labour and contract labour, because, after all, the contractor has to employ day labour. My chief objection to the day-labour system is that it throws too much detailed work upon the Government. I undertook great public works in Western Australia by day labour, notably the Fremantle harbor works and' the Coolgardie water works, so that I have had experience of the day-labour system on&gt; works that can easily be supervised. I believe that great delay will result from the Government endeavouring to do all this work themselves instead of distributing it under a system which would relieve them of attention to details. Then a most extraordinary decision has been arrived at in regard to the use of karri timber. I hope that the powellizing system will prove eminently successful ; but I fail to see the wisdom of preferring karri sleepers to jarrah for this important undertaking. In saying this, I am advocating also the interests of the manual labourers - of the men who hew these sleepers. In Western Australia there is a powerful association known as the Hewers'" Association - a co-operative enterprise - which supplies these sleepers.- My' desire is to obtain the best wood suitable for the purpose at the cheapest possible price. In advocating the use of jarrah in preference to karri, I am acting in the interests of the stability of the work, and also in the interests of the sleeper hewers of Western Australia, many of whom are to be found in my own constituency. I have no hesitation in saying that jarrah sleepers can be supplied as cheaply, if not more cheaply, than can karri. They have a more solidly established reputation- </para>

                        <para>- In preferring karri to jarrah we are taking an unnecessary risk. We know very well that jarrah untreated is vastly superior to karri untreated. If powellized karri is better than unpowellized, then jarrah, if powellized, would be very much better than powellized karri. The only reason I can give for this action on the part of the Government is that it is anxious to assist the Labour party in Western Australia to establish State sawmills. It seems to me that there must be some idea of the kind in view, but I fail to see how it can be of any advantage to the country. I desire now to refer to a matter to which reference has already been made this afternoon, and which has become a question of public importance. I refer to the position in regard to the Governor-General's residence in Sydney. A good many questions have been asked, and there has been a good deal of discussion in the press in regard to it; but it is to be regretted that the difficulty ever arose, as it ought to have been very easy for the Government to have satisfactorily arranged the matter. I fail to see why it should have been left to the Governor-General to say that he was advised before he came here, and also by Ministers after his arrival, that, when in Sydney, he should try to effect an amicable arrangement with the State Government in regard to the matter. lt is not a matter on which the Governor-General should have been called upon to intervene, save to inform the Prime Minister of his desires in regard to his public duties or personal comfort. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to discuss it solely as it affects the Government, as I hold that the right honorable member's Government are wholly to blame in this matter. Instead of shielding the Governor-General, as they are bound to do, they have humiliated him. What right have we to expect the State of New South Wales to provide free of rent a residence for the Governor-General? Do we provide the State Governments with any service free of charge ? I do not know that we do. I do know, however, that we impose duty on goods imported by the States - upon the very rails imported by them for the development of the Commonwealth. There is a case in point in my own State. The Government of Western Aus-" tralia will have to expend nearly a million in order to continue the Trans-Australian railway on a  4  ft.  8j-in.  gauge from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, and will have to pay an enormous sum by way of duty on the rails required for what is really a great national work - the work of connecting Western Australia with Eastern Australia by means of a broad gauge railway. Then, again, we charge the State Governments postage on all their postal matter, and for their telegraphs and telephones. It seems to me that the time has arrived when the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the States, working in the closest amity, should pay each other for services rendered. I fail to understand why the Commonwealth Government should refuse to pay rental for the use of Government House, Sydney, if they really desire the Governor-General to have a residence in that city. It looks very much as if " the Caucus " did not desire the Governor-General to retain a residence there. If they were at all anxious in the matter, do honorable members think that they would not be prepared to pay .£3,500 per annum for' the use of the State Government House ? </para>

Under the present arrangement the States have been impoverished, while the Commonwealth has been placed in an affluent position. During the last three years, owing to the alteration, consequent on the termination of the Braddon section, the Commonwealth has received £14,000,000 which would, if the alteration had not been made, have gone to the States. It seems to me to be the height of meanness for the Commonwealth Government to try to make excuses for not paying a rental of £3,500 a year for such a magnificent residence as is the State Government House, Sydney.

                        <para>- It is an incitement to the Government to do their duty ; to pay what they ought to pay, and not to expect the States, whose revenues have been depleted by£14,000,000 during the last three years to give us, free of rent, a residence for the Governor-General or the use of any public building. If there is any one to blame for the situation that has arisen in this regard, it is the Government themselves. I repeat that the only inference I can draw is that "the Caucus" does not wish the Governor-General to have a residence in Sydney. The New South Wales Government are only acting reasonably in demanding a moderate rental for the use of Government House  by  the Governor-General, and are justified in asking the Commonwealth to pay for any service rendered by them. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. The usual period has been two months. It means that for three months we are practically putting it out of the power of the House to have redress of any grievances. That is an unprecedented demand to make of any House, especially when it is remembered that the House is now practically having a continuous sitting from  3  o'clock on Tuesday afternoon until  4  o'clock on Friday afternoon without a break of any description, except a little for sleep. An unfortunate delay is taking place in putting before the House the land policy for the development of the Northern Territory. That is one of the most pressing matters with which we can deal. The land policy which was developed previously was put before the House and fully discussed, and now is put aside. There are only about ten weeks of time during which the House can sit this session, yet we have no indication of any land policy being likely to be placed before us. This is unfortunate also because we see, from a statement made by the Minister this afternoon, that for the time being it is necessary to hang up the whole policy of land settlement in the Territory, and applications cannot be dealt with. The granting of leases has of necessity had to be suspended, because had leases been granted contractual rights would have been conferred which we should have had to recognise. I realize that it was essential to suspend the policy for the time being, but there has been a long delay in getting going again. It means that the regulations have to be reframed and be sent out before people will be able to take advantage, of them, and a delay of several months must take place in land settlement. </para>

                        <para>- First, regulations must be made, so that people may know the rights they are going to obtain in the Territory. The whole of that time has been lost, but I hope the Minister will realize the position in which he is putting the Territory, and press matters forward in order to get the land policy of the Government before the House as soon as possible. There is another unsatisfactory feature in connexion with the administration of the Territory. About March last the Minister announced that it was his policy to appoint a number of experts to inquire into the question of the railway policy for that part of Australia. The matter came before the House again the other day", and again the same policy was promised. Yet here we are in October, without even an announcement having been made as to who are to constitute the Commission. All this valuable time is being lost to the development of the Territory. We are continuing to run it under its heavy obligations, with a large staff of officials, who, by virtue of the delay in its development and settlement, are not being given the opportunity of working to their fullest capacity. </para>

                        <para>- They cannot possibly have had opportunities for doing so. We hear of a State school inspector about to be appointed at a salary of <inline font-style="italic">£500</inline> or£600 a year, for a few schools. How is it possible to say that men in such positions will be working to their fullest capacity? I urge the Minister not to delay any longer, but to press forward the Commission, and as soon as possible to let us have some developmental policy for the whole of the Northern Territory. I hope he will understand that I am not raising these points in a spirit of mere captious criticism. </para>

                        <para>- When the Minister gives us such an opportunity to say something, we should be guilty of a breach of duty if we did not bring these matters under notice. Although we are sitting in Opposition, we are not without our duty to the country. We have still this large Territory in our possession, and we have not had evidence from the Government of any strong forward policy for its development.  It  is a fair thing for the Minister to indicate why these two great matters of land settlement, and the appointment of a Royal Commission to push this forward policy along, have been so much delayed. We must all admit that, without a railway policy, we cannot expect those regions towards the interior, that are capable of carrying large quantities of stock,  to  be properly settled, or worked to their full extent. The announcement of the Prime Minister this afternoon must cause a good deal of disappointment to the sugar growers. When asked as to the Government's policy, with regard to the sugar industry, the Prime Minister mentioned the desirableness of having the Constitution altered so that the Industrial Court might have power to fix other matters than the question of wages. I take that to mean the power to fix the price of cane or other commodities. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing, not  with  the retailing of sugar, but with the cane grown by the grower. I <inline font-style="italic">am</inline> not discussing the fairness or unfairness of the wages. But  there are  several factors to consider in connexion with the sugar problem. There is first the grower, without whom the industry could not be carried on. Secondly, there  is the  worker, who is also necessary. Then you must have the sugar miller, the refiner, and, last of all, the consumer. The interests of all those five factors must be considered. At present, we are dealing with one factor, the worker. His remuneration has been' increased, and the grower has no possibility of improving his position. </para>

                        <para>- How can twelve months' notice enable a man who gets only a certain, price for his cane to improve his position, when you increase the wages which he has to pay? The cost of production has been increased, and if there are any means by which you can give some compensation to the grower, they should be adopted. The Prime Minister need not wait for an alteration of the Constitution to do this. I should not like to take it from what the right honorable gentleman said to-day that he has made a final pronouncement of policy for this Parliament. </para>

                    -  I have the honour to inform you that my colleague, the Treasurer, on his return to Brisbane, communicated to me (1) your expressed opinion that it would make for the welfare of the sugar industry if both Excise and bounty were abolished, (2) that you would do your best to influence your colleagues to take the same view; and, if successful, would, next session, introduce Bills for the repeal of so much of the Excise and bounty sections as applied to the sugar industry. While thanking you for this attitude on the question, I must say I was not unprepared for the information, as I was aware you had on former occasions expressed yourself similarly thereon. Whatever co-operation I can give you in the matter will be cheerfully rendered, for I am fully satisfied that along such lines as you suggest lies the only solution of the difficulties which have to be met. I hope, therefore, you will be able to prevail on your colleagues to take action in the direction mentioned, and to take it during the current session of Parliament, for delaying it until next year would entail very serious consequences on the industry, and, among other evils, the intensifying of the present feeling of uncertainty and unrest in those connected with it.
                </para>
                <para>If you can give me your assurance on this point I shall undertake to introduce legislation prohibiting Asiatic aliens from engaging or working in the industry, and compensating, such aliens as may be <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> owners or leaseholders of land now under sugar-cane. The people of Australia desire the sugar industry to be a white-labour one, and I gladly give my support to any arrangement which will insure the realization of that desire. It is also their wish that this industry should pay the white labourer the highest wage consistent with its prosperity, and the better to achieve that end, I shall so enlarge the Industrial Peace Bill as to bring sugar-workers (both field and mill hands) under Industrial Boards. I think that will be the most effective means of protecting their interests. </para>
                <para>I am informed that you have expressed some doubt as to whether the cane-grower would reap any benefit under the altered conditions. On this point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White,</inline> M.L.A., assures me he raised the matter at a meeting of the Sugar Manufacturers' Association, held in Bundaberg on the 2nd September, when it was resolved that, in the event of the Excise and bounty being abolished, the millers will pay the growers of cane 8s. 8d. per ton in place of the 6s. 6d. now paid by the Customs. The Treasurer will also give the growers the full benefit of the difference between Excise and bounty. </para>
                <para>You are aware of the intention of the Government to erect mills under the Sugar Works Act ign, three of which have been approved, and will involve a total expenditure of ^350,000. Other mills are likely to be pressed upon our attention, but I fear that, in the present unsettled state of the sugar industry, the House will not vote the necessary funds. </para>

The Premier of Queensland is quite willing  to insert the prohibition suggested, although it is considered that, as a matter of constitutional right, the Commonwealth has power, under section 51 of the Constitution, to pass laws dealing with alien races. That is the offer that was distinctly made to the Prime Minister, and I am sorry that, so far, no reply has been sent to it. </para>

                        <para>- The Queensland Parliament has carried out the first part of the undertaking, and is willing to pass a prohibition in regard to the employment of coloured labour. But it is quite proper to ask whether the Commonwealth Parliament intends to take action. Surely that is a fair inquiry to address to the Prime Minister, seeing that the power of legislating in connexion with the sugar industry rests with this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is a fair thing for us to ask those intrusted with power what action they propose to take. The honorable member for Capricornia evidently realized that it was the duty of this Parliament to take action, otherwise he would not have received the communication I am about to read from his constituents. I applaud him for the interest which he showed in this matter. He received the following letter from the Secretary to the Bundaberg Chamber of Commerce - </para>

                <para>I am directed by the <inline font-weight="bold">president (Mr. E. T. Amos)</inline> to acknowledge your wire of the 18th inst. reading as per copy enclosed. Arrangements were immediately made to hold a public meeting this afternoon, and which is just over, and I was desired to send you a copy of a motion and amendment which were brought forward, which I now have much pleasure in doing. </para>
                <para>The motion reads as follows :  - " That this meeting is of the opinion that it is urgent for the preservation of the sugar industry to Australia that the Excise and bounty be abolished at the earliest possible date." </para>
                <para>The amendment :  - " That this meeting is of opinion that the bounty and Excise should be equalized, and that 8s. 8d. should be given back to the grower instead of the 6s. 6d." </para>
                <para>On the latter being put to the meeting, at which there were over eighty present, only seventeen voted in favour. The original motion was then put, for which fifty-three voted ; it therefore was carried by a very large majority. I am also to mention that, in addition to those present, a written document was handed in at the meeting, signed by fourteen cane-growers in the Yandaran district, and who were unable to attend the meeting, signifying their desire to see the Excise and bounty abolished. </para>
                <para>The meeting was hurriedly called, as it was desired to reply to your telegram as soon as possible, and many of the growers who live at a distance from Bundaberg, and who only get their mails two or three times a week, could not be communicated with, otherwise we are sure the attendance would have been much larger; and we venture to say the majority in favour of the abolition of the Excise and bounty would have been considerably greater. </para>
                <para>I should like to point out that in a large meeting of any description it is a particularly hard matter to get any resolution carried unanimously, and would respectfully submit that it this instance, with such a large majority in favour of the abolition of the Excise and bounty, we may legitimately claim your support as our member in the House of Representatives, and ask you to vote in the way indicated. </para>
                <para>The Honorable the Premier of Queensland having guaranteed the passing of a measure through the State Parliament to prevent the growing of cane by coloured labour, and having also guaranteed to purchase the leases of any alien at present in the industry, there should thus be nothing to prevent the immediate abolition of the Excise and bounty. </para>

The resolutions, I repeat, do not refer to any question of lowering wages, but simply put the case of men who, by reason of the increased wages, have been subjected to an increased cost of production. They are simply appealing to their representatives in this Parliament, which alone has the power to remedy the grievance, to put them in a position to meet the additional expenses which they have to bear. </para>

                        <para>-r-By repealing the Excise and the bounty, the growers would be in a position to get a higher price for the cane. Further, if honorable members do not want to do that, they can equalize the Excise and the bounty, and retain the existing machinery. That would be doing something for the growers, and that is the line of action suggested by the honorable member for Herbert. If honorable members will equalize the Excise and the bounty, they . will put the growers in the position of having so much per ton bounty in excess of what they get to-day, and, to that extent, give them considerable relief without increasing by a penny the cost of sugar to the consumers. That can easily be done. I ask honorable members to accede to the request of those who are engaged in the industry, and to abolish the Excise and bounty. I have given two or three instances of this feeling. The failure to give relief is having a varying effect. The reports which have been given to the press by the Minister of Trade and Customs show the effect which it is having upon the industry. For instance, referring to Bundaberg, we" read - </para>

We are dealing with the present problem, and we can discuss that, quite apart from party considerations. Here are certain telegrams stating that the small growers have had this increased burden put upon them, and all that they ask is, not that the burden shall be removed, but that when we have the power and the means., we shall put them in a position whereby they can get a fair living in the industry. </para>

                    <para>.- In this Supply Bill provision is made for the maintenance of the Parliamentary Library. There is filed in that Library a newspaper known as the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> owned by Messrs. Davies Brothers, Limited, cf Hobart, and having a circulation of 10,000 or thereabouts. On Saturday last there was published in its columns a letter criticising the action of this' Government in regard to the Maternity Allowance Bill. The statements made in that letter, and the suggestions it contained, were, in my opinion, scandalous, degrading, and low, and I ask the Prime Minister to have the matter brought before the Library Committee, with a view to the removal of the file of the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> from the Library until an apology has been made to the Government, to this Parliament, and to the women of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I have risen to draw attention to the matter. The writer goes so far as to say that this Government is deliberately and maliciously introducing legislation to cause degeneration and debauchery. The letter is signed by G. L. A. Field, a fairly large landowner. In justice to the proprietors of the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> 1  should state that they may not have seen the letter, but the editor must take responsibility for its publication, and the proprietors are well-known opponents of the Labour party, one of them being Speaker of the House of Assembly, and the other a member of the Legislative Council of Tasmania. Of all the statements I have read about the Maternity Allowance Bill, this is the most contemptible. 'As there are ladies present I shall not read the letter. It speaks of some of the poor unfortunate women of Australia as beasts of the field. I should not like to use a word that it applies to them It is too deplorable, low, and contemptible to appear in print. The Prime Minister has seen the letter, and knows its contents, and, therefore, I ask him to bring the whole matter under the notice of the Library Committee, so that that body may consider the advisability of having the file removed from the building until an apology has been made by the proprietors of the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> for the statements they have published about the Government. An apology should also be made to the women of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I have read the letter referred to by the honorable member for Bass, and think that it is of such a character that the whole matter should be referred to the Library Committee. It is one that need hardly be discussed in this Committee. I suggest that the honorable member should forward a copy of the newspaper to the Library Committee, with a request that it should consider whether an apology should not be demanded from the proprietors. It must be remembered that the letter may have slipped into the newspaper inadvertently, but if it represents the policy of the newspaper, that paper, in my opinion, ought not to be here. </para>

However, I suppose the Bill will be passed; practically all the Opposition can do is to enter its protest against it. </para>

                        <para>- -The honorable member for Capricornia must excuse me if I did not regard his motion as seriously as he meant it to be taken. I have risen chiefly to address myself to a subject about which there is a great deal of agitation in New South Wales. To bring it more prominently before the Chamber, I asked the . Prime Minister some questions about it this afternoon. Honorable members are aware that for some time past communications have been passing between this Government and the Government of New South Wales regarding the removal of the Governor-General from Government House, Sydney, with the result that yesterday he was compelled to leave Sydney, an occasion which was used by the people of the State to give him one of the grandest farewells that any Governor-General or Governor has ever received. The people of New South Wales have been greatly moved by what has taken place. The Prime Minister informed me, in effect, that it was' understood when Lord Denman accepted the position of Governor-General that he would have a residence in Sydney, and the right honorable gentleman said that the circumstance was one which should have weighed with the Government of New South Wales. Speaking at Sydney last night, the Governor-General said that there was an understanding when he accepted office that he should have a residence in Melbourne, so that he might be here when Parliament was sitting, and another in Sydney. That statement was indorsed by the Prime Minister this afternoon ; but now the right honorable gentleman airily says that that was a circumstance which might have influenced the Government of New South Wales. What the Government of New South Wales have done will, I have no doubt,  be  dealt with in the proper quarter; all I wish to say about them is that they have been extremely short-sighted in not taking every possible opportunity to keep the Governor-General in residence there. Time after time, the State Government, instead of endeavouring to keep up the prestige of the old State, have done things that are fast bringing it down to a secondary position; and this is one act added to others. Let the Prime Minister distinctly understand that, while this is a matter affecting the Government of New South Wales, it is one which, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many others, affects himself and his Government. </para>

                        <para>- We have both had a long journey; and if I become rather short and sharp,  1  hope he will forgive me, as I forgive him. The Commonwealth Government is primarily responsible for the Governor-General, and it is the duty of the Prime Minister and his colleagues to see that all the arrangements entered into with His Excellency are carried out. As I have said, the State Government are shortsighted in refusing to allow the Governor-General to remain in the State Government House ; and it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to see that His Excellency is afforded facilities to reside in New South Wales when he thinks fit. I have heard it said that the Governor-General and his lady were looking forward with the greatest pleasure to their residence in the Government House of the Mother State, because of its historic associations. That, however, is at an end. The Prime Minister says that the Government will see that, when the Governor-General goes to New South Wales, he is properly housed ; but there is no place where that can be done except in Government House, on the shores of Port Jackson. If Lord Denman be practically evicted from the State Government House, it will reflect no great credit on the State Government, and certainly . none on the Federal Government. What is all this about? The Prime Minister has told us that it is not a matter of money, but a matter of principle. Where is the principle? It appears to lie in breaking the agreement entered into with the King's representative before he left London. The sum involved is a paltry  £3,500  a year. Why should that expenditure be stopped at the end of twelve years? Since the expiration of the Braddon section, millions of pounds, which previously went to New South Wales and the other States, have been pouring into the Commonwealth coffers. </para>

                        <para>- Until the present position arose. My contention is that it is the duty of the Government and this Parliament to see that the agreement made with the Governor-General is kept. If the report of the Governor-General's speech be correct, he was advised, not only by the Imperial authorities, but by his Ministers here, to go to New South Wales to see if he could amicably settle the difference. Surely the Commonwealth Government is not so puerile, puny, or pusillanimous that it cannot arrange a simple matter of administration without appealing to the Governor-General ? </para>

Although  His Excellency  saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman, Mr. Griffith,</inline> and others, the pleadings he put before them were absolutely in vain. The Prime Minister and his colleagues should not have allowed the Governor-General to be placed in the undignified and humiliating position of practically crawling on his knees to the Ministers of New South Wales and saying, " Please give me this house while I am in Sydney." The Commonwealth Government ought to have a keener sense of their position, and more feeling towards the Governor-General, than to place him in such a position. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dragging the Governor-General into party political warfare. I am charging the Prime Minister and his colleagues, including the Honorary Minister, who is so ready with his tongue, with forgetting their duty to the Governor-General, and with being so paltry and pusillanimous as to be unable to carry out a simple administrative act. They have had to get behind the Governor-General, and send him along to plead with State Ministers and say, " Please, gentlemen, will you allow me to remain here, if I agree to do so and so?" </para>

If the honorable gentleman wants platform stuff, I can give him enough of that sort of thing. I could say that the whole business is part and parcel of a feeling of disloyalty to the Crown of England. The honorable gentleman can have that for the platform. </para>

                        <para>- I wish now to refer to another matter, I hope in a calmer fashion, as I was led to speak rather strongly just now in consequence of interruptions. We are voting a considerable sum of money every year for the payment of bonuses established at the instance of this Parliament. We have what is known as a bonus for wool- tops. We are given to understand that, as the result of the payment of that bonus, an industry has been established in Botany, near Sydney, which gives a certain amount of employment. If the reports we read are correct, those concerned in that industry not only carry on their own business for the manufacture of wool-tops, but in an indirect fashion subsidize what is known as the Colonial Meat Export Company, and so enable it to pay good dividends, and, at the same time, to go into the Flemington sale-yards, in Sydney, as a big buyer, to the very great prejudice indeed of small buyers of sheep in those yards. I put a series of questions to the Minister on the subject to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I wish the Minister to find out all about this matter. I have a considerable amount of information on the subject, but I do not wish to put it before the House until I am absolutely certain that it is reliable. The Minister of Trade and Customs is in a position to have inquiries made by his expert officers, and that is an advantage denied to a private member of this House. I presume that many honorable members have received a circular cn the subject similar to that which has been sent to me. I have noticed statements concerning the matter in the leading daily newspapers of Sydney, and one cannot go into the Stock Exchange there without hearing comments on it. I understand that the bonus ran out on the  30th  June last. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the Minis.ter will give Parliament the fullest information in connexion with the matter before honorable members are asked to extend the bonus. I am sure that honorable members on both sides, while they may be prepared to grant bonuses for the encouragement of our industries, desire that the money voted shall be used for the purpose intended. We have the statement made that a company receiving a bonus is working in conjunction with another company, and enabling that company to pay dividends, and to outbid competitors in the sheep market. We should know whether that information is reliable before we are asked to extend this bonus. One very serious statement made in. this matter is that, whilst over £30,000 has been paid in the shape of this bonus, the effect has been three-fold. First of all, it has provided cheap wool-tops for the Japanese ; secondly, it has enabled dividends of 10 and 6 per cent, to be paid to the shareholders of the Colonial Meat Export Company; and, thirdly, it has been the means of finding employment for girl labour, with a few odd overseers in one or two combine mills. </para>

                        <para>- There is one company manufacturing wool-tops, and, with one exception, the shareholders of the Colonial Meat Export Company are also shareholders of that company. It is said that the Colonial Meat Export Company is being subsidized by the company manufacturing wool-tops, and is so enabled to pay dividends, and to out-bid their competitors in the markets at Flemington. The company I am speaking of was, I understand, brought into existence by the decision of this Parliament to pay the bonus. The factory is in the constituency of the honorable member for South Sydney, and, possibly, the honorable member knows more about it than does any other member of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- Not so far as I know. The bonus is given only on wool-tops for export. I wish now to express my disappointment that the Minister of External Affairs has not been more expeditious in submitting a statement of his land policy for the Northern Territory. Whether the honorable gentleman proposes to introduce a Bill, or a fresh Land Ordinance, I do not know, but it is some time now since be withdrew the Ordinance he first submitted. We are all most anxious to have the Northern Territory settled at the earliest possible moment. Its unoccupied condition is recognised as a menace to- the safety of Australia. Instead of taking action to people the Territory in order to preserve Australia to the white races of the world, we find the Minister of External Affairs wasting week after week, and making no effort to submit a new Land Ordinance which will lead to the settlement of the Territory. All land settlement is practically suspended. I do hope that the Prime Minister will impress upon his colleagues the: necessity, in the interests of defence alone, of submitting the Government policy in this connexion at the earliest' possible moment. The next matter to which I desire to refer is that of the supply of telephonic facilities in the country. I do not know how other honorable, members fare ; but, during the past two, years, I have been able to get practically nothing done in the matter of telephonic extension in my constituency. </para>

More than two years have elapsed since the telephonic extension, from Nowra to Wollongong was approved, and: yet nothing has been done towards carrying out the work. The excuse which is- offered is. that no wire is available. If that be so, there has been gross mismanagement in the Postal Department. No big concern could carry on business with any, hope of success if it permitted things to get into such a backward state. One of the matters on which this House has been keenest for some years has been that of providing the fullest telephonic facilities to residents in our back-blocks. For that reason, forward orders should have been despatched for telephones which are required immediately, and for those which will be required in the near future. Only to-day I received another letter from the Department in reference to what are known as guarantee lines. The communication sets out the different amounts which it will be necessary for the people to contribute, and at the bottom of it is the following addendum - t  may add that even if these terms arc accepted, the erection of the line could not be undertaken at present, owing to the number of works already approved and awaiting attention as opportunity offers. </para>

                        <para>- This afternoon, I gave very full and fair replies to questions put by the honorable member. I stated that I was unable to accept the accuracy of the reports of  His  Excellency's utterances yesterday in regard to Sydney Government House. _ This Government have never asked  His Excellency  to undertake any of mel r duties, and have no intention of doing so. That is how they stand. But a Government which would not allow a little latitude to  His Excellency  the Governor-General in the circumstances in which he was placed, and which would not be very grateful for any action that he might take in a friendly way, would be wanting in that courtesy and sane view of their duties which they ought to exhibit. I do not think I need trespass on the time of the Committee further than to say that I hope honorable members on this side of the Chamber - whatever may be said by honorable members opposite - will refrain from discussing the Governor-General, as he has no right of reply. Regarding the charge which has been made against the Government, I welcome it. I hope that criticism in connexion with this matter will be confined to an attack on the Government for what they have done, or for what they have not done. Their position may be thus stated : When the last Governor-General, Lord Dudley, resigned, there was evidently ari understanding that Government House, Sydney, would be available to his successor in the same manner, and to the same degree, that it was available to his predecessors. That is to say, the Government of New South Wales placed that residence at his disposal, if he chose to occupy it, for a portion of the year - during recess. Those conditions were withdrawn, I think, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, and myself, were absent in London. That withdrawal having been notified to us by the owners of the Vice-Regal residence there, we had to recognise it as a fact. Negotiations were therefore begun between the Commonwealth Government and! the Government of New South Wales, with a view to extending the time during which it should be available to the Governor-General for the full term of  His Excellency  Lord Denman's appointment. Those negotiations failed, upon two grounds. The Government of New South Wales asked that the Commonwealth should pay rent for the premises from a certain date. We declined. They asked that we should pay interest on the capital value of the building as a transferred property from a certain date. We declined. We proposed to restore the building, to keep it in good order, and to return it to the New South Wales authorities iri the same condition as we had received it, conditionally upon the old arrangement being allowed to continue. They declined to agree to that proposal, and all negotiations which have since taken place - delicate and difficult though they have been - have been conducted with far more circumspection than has been exhibited here to-night. Nevertheless, they have failed. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the Victorian State Government acted gracefully and well. It cost them from  £70,000  to  £100,000  to provide a Parliament House for the State Legislature, but although I am living here, I have never heard an official grumble regarding our use of these buildings. Does this cry emanate again from the idea that there are only two States in the Commonwealth ? Ten years ago, we heard in this House nothing but wrangling between the representatives of two States. Surely the Commonwealth ought to be above that sort of thing. If we are to pay for the use of Government House, Sydney, by the Governor-General, while the Seat of Government is not in New South Wales, we ought to provide a residence for the Governor-General in far distant Queensland, which has a population approaching  700,000  ; we ought for the same reason to provide one in South Australia, and a residence should also be provided for the Governor-General in the great State of Western Australia, which is cut off from the people of the East. Likewise, in the delightful island State of Tasmania a residence for the Governor-General should be provided. The logical position is that if a residence for the Governor-General is to be provided in any State other than that in which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth exists, a residence ought to be provided for the Governor-General in every State. Indeed, I doubt very much whether in every State where the population is large, and settlement widespread, there ought not to be more than one residence provided for the Governor-General if this theory is to be developed. I do hope we have heard the last of this, the worst of all parochialism in the two great centres of Australia. We hear it in no other part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- No arrangement wa"s entered into. We had the offer of the free use of the building just as this building was offered to us. When the Government of this State say that they desire us to pay rent for this building, we shall have to accept their decision. The position in that case, however, would be very different, because we have the uninterrupted use of this building without any interference whatever. Coming now to the matter referred to by the honorable member for Darling Downs in regard to the sugar industry, honorable members who were in the first Parliament will find it interesting to make comparisons between the discussions then and now. It was then held, although not by the honorable member for Darling Downs, or his father before him; that white labour could not carry on the sugar industry. A very large proportion of this Parliament declared that the sugar industry could not and would not be carried on successfully by white labour. It was said that it was neither a matter of money nor of economics, but that it was a physical impossibility for white men to do such work in the tropical areas. Those who took the opposite view have proved that white men can do the work. They have shown that they can do that which has never been done before by white men in any tropical country. </para>

                        <para>- This House decided by a majority to adopt the white labour policy, and I should like to ask what party pushed forward that policy. The honorable member for East Sydney at that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, who was then Leader of the Opposition - said that his justification for supporting that policy was that the majority of the representatives of Queensland were members of the Labour party, who had been returned pledged to support it. It was for that reason, and not because he entirely admitted that the work could be done by white labour that he supported the policy. The honorable member for Parkes, to his credit be it said, has stood to his guns from that day to this. Some people denounce him, but I admire him for his consistency. He says to-day, as he said in the first Parliament, that .the policy is an impossible one. As to the official records, to which reference has been made, I could point to an official record showing a resolution passed by the Mackay Association to the effect that this question of white labour on the cane-fields was not an economic one - that it was a physical impossibility for white men to do the work. Could a stronger statement be imagined? What has caused the trouble about which we are now hearing so much? It is all a question of wages. There was no trouble until that question arose. The honorable member for Darling Downs tried to fence the question when he was thundering away- </para>

                        <para>- It is not a new question with me. I stated publicly in the sugar districts and other parts of my electorate that the superstructure of Excise and bounty is a mere expedient to accomplish two things. One is the transformation of the industry from a coloured to a white-labour industry, and the settlement by white labour of the great north-east of Australia, 500 miles in extent, which otherwise would have been under coloured labour and useless to us. This it has done. The second is to assure that the small sugar-grower will get a greater return for his raw product than he would otherwise get. By this means his return is separated into a payment by the raw sugar miller to whom he sells his cane, and a payment by the Government, in the shape of a return of three- fourths of the Excise. That, in my opinion, assures a greater amount being paid directly to the grower of sugar-cane than he would otherwise receive. It was, however, never in the mind of any one that that superstructure should continue for ever, and the first amendment made in the law was to lead to the reduction and ultimately the elimination of both the bounty and Excise on a graduated scale. I was not in favour of that. I told my constituents I was not favorable to the elimination of both the Excise and bounty until there was some power or authority which would protect the white grower against the unfair competition of coloured labour for the same product. The proposal now is that the State Government, which has sovereign powers, and has the right to exclude any class of labour from any portion of the State, should take action. The same Parliament which declared that coloured labour could not be dispensed with now seems to be prepared to pass a law preventing coloured labour being employed in any circumstances on sugar land. When that is done, we shall have white areas where only white people can be employed. That, I admit, lays down a fair basis for considering whether the Excise and bounty should not be eliminated altogether, and provision made by agreement or law - preferably by a Court through the law - to assure that the producer of raw sugar-cane will be protected, and also that the small mill-owner will be protected in selling his product to the refiner. </para>

                        <para>- This must be done in one act." The sugar industry is the only one dealt with in this way. I am sure that this Parliament does not desire to continue superstructural legislation of this sort any longer than is necessary. The industry should be placed on the same basis as every other industry as soon as that can be done. </para>

                        <para>- There are at least 40,000 coloured aliens in Australia. The labour in connexion with the sugar-growing industry is more manual than in any other industry I know of, and those people would undoubtedly soon be found to do that work, ousting the white men in consequence. They would be brought from north, south, east, and west, wherever they could be obtained, and that must be prevented. The big issue, however, is that, if an agreement or understanding can be come to by Commonwealth and State legislation, it will be an advantage to the industry, and no disadvantage to Australia. It will leave the sugar industry on the same basis as other protected industries, and I think the majority of honorable members will not hesitate to say that it is an industry worth protecting and possessing. Some honorable members think lightly of it ; but, calculating its value and the amount of employment it gives, and the settlement it causes, I presume it ranks practically with the great coal industry of Australia. It is, therefore, no small industry, and it also helps to develop the tropical parts of the continent. If the Commonwealth Parliament had power to pass a law to enable the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to hear causes between the employé and the grower as regards wages and conditions of labour, and between the grower and the small mill-owner, and also between the small mill-owner and the refiner, a solution of the difficulty would be arrived at that would settle the matter for a time. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am repeating now only what I said publicly when I was previously Prime Minister, and also as a candidate. I still hope that some rearrangement will be arrived at that will satisfactorily safeguard all interests. We must first make sure that it is an absolutely white industry. Secondly, we must assure fair remuneration to the workers, and we must see to it that the grower, who, after all, is, as a rule, as small a man as the smallest struggling farmer in other States, and much in need of assistance and sympathy, has also a due measure of protection in his industry from those above and below him. On those grounds a perfectly safe way out can be found by this Parliament co-operating with any other authority that offers to assist in settling the problem. </para>

                    <para>. - The question which I put to the Prime Minister was an honest one. I asked where, the coloured labour would come from if the bounty and Excise on sugar were abolished?. It is impossible under our existing law to import coloured labour. Therefore, if coloured labour were to flood the cane-fields, it would have to be that already in Australia. But I say very distinctly and clearly that there ought to be no difference in this respect between the sugar industry and any other industry. For instance, what logic is there in preventing a Chinaman from working in the cane-fields, whilst you allow him to work in the market gardens of the suburbs of Melbourne, Sydney, and Hobart? What difference is there between preventing a Chinaman from working in the cane-fields, and preventing him from working in the banana plantations? The whole trouble in connexion with the sugar industry is that we are always placing around it artificial barriers which we do not place around any other industry. On the day when the kanaka was taken away from Australia the sugar industry ought to have been placed upon the same footing as any other primary industry. There is no more reason to-day for the bounty and Excise on sugar than there would be for treating it in the same manner as the wheat industry, the fruit industry, the dairying industry, or any other Australian primary industry. Does the Prime Minister think that the Chinese laundrymen of, for instance, Melbourne and Sydney would leave their comfortable livings here to work in the cane-fields of Queensland? I am quite certain that they would not. But even if they did, is there any more reason why a Chinaman should be allowed to compete in the laundries of our cities, or in our market gardens, than in the sugar industry? Why should you attempt to make one branch of industry sacred? Why should you drive coloured men out of that industry and compel them to compete with white labour in other centres of Australia ? There is no logic, justice, or reason in such a policy. </para>

                        <para>- We do not grow beet in Tasmania, because' we find that it pays us better to grow something else. The argument that is always urged in connexion with the sugar industry is that, in the greater portion of tropical Queensland, the whole place would return to a state of nature if sugar went out of cultivation, and that nothing else could be grown to take its place. It is because we want to see the northern portions of Australia settled that Parliament has given -the sugar industry certain assistance, but I think that the time has arrived when we should remove the bounty and Excise, and place upon sugar whatever duty the House in its wisdom may think fit. At the same time, legislative interference, which has been hampering and harassing the industry, should cease. There is one point which the House ought to take into very serious consideration, and that is in connexion with the Northern Territory. We took over the Northern Territory in 1910 ; we passed the Administration Act in the same year, but up-to-date we have done actually nothing in the way of settling the Territory. We have appointed, it is true, a huge army of very highly -paid officials; but we have not even passed a land law for the Territory. It is not possible for a man to take up a lease or purchase a piece of land there. If the policy of the House is to be a leasehold tenure, let it be so, but to-day it is not possible for the Government to lease an acre of land to a settler. A Lands Ordinance was brought down here, which was laughed at and ridiculed, practically, by every honorable member who spoke, no matter on which side he sat. I think, sir, that it received no severer criticism from any one than it did from yourself, whose constituency included the Territory before it was taken over by the Commonwealth. The Lands Ordinance was admitted by every  speaker,  I think, to be useless. It was generally recognised that it would not effect the purpose for which it was framed. It was taken back, but, up to the present time, we have heard no more of it. For three years the Government have been in office ; for nearly that period we have held the Territory, and to-day it is in exactly the same position as it was when it was taken over, with the exception that we have appointed a huge army of officials. What their duties are is an enigma to the House. There is another very serious question to which I think the House ought to turn its attention at once. Honorable members have seen in the press that, as regards two of the States, there is a very serious discrepancy between the number of adults and the number of persons enrolled. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> in his corrected statement up to 31st March, puts down the adult population of New South Wales at 909,000. Estimating for the arrivals between then and the 30th June, the adult population is put down by him at 915,000. These are the figures which this Parliament and this Government accept, and upon which is based the capitation grant of 25s. per head to the State. We accept 915,000 as the figures, but there are 935,744 adults enrolled. In other words, there are 20,744 more persons on the electoral rolls for New South Wales than there are adults in the State. That is an exceedingly serious thing. </para>

                        <para>- That may be a general regulation, but these figures are based on the census returns. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline> own words are, " The census figures corrected up to March 31st." He took the figures for the last census and corrected them up to 31st March by adding the number of adults who came into the State and those in the State who had reached the age of twenty-one years, and thus he added 6,000 to his March return, bringing the total up to 915,000 as at the end of June. The point to be remembered is that the enrolment for the Commonwealth took place precisely at that time, and that' the number of persons enrolled in New South Wales is 20,744 more than the entire adult population. But it is admitted that there is always a deficiency, variously estimated at from 4½ to7½ per cent., of persons who do not get on the rolls. Every honorable 'member is aware that there is always a certain proportion of adults who are not enrolled. </para>

                        <para>- It is the matter of duplication which I wish to point out. In reply to the honorable member for Maribyrnong, I would say that we are not getting a better enrolment when we have 20,000 more persons on the rolls for New South Wales than the number of adults in the State; and if we allow the 5 per cent, for those who are not on the rolls - it runs from 4½ to6½ per cent., but I take 5 percent. - we shall get another 45,750 persons,, or 66,494 persons on the rolls who are not entitled to be there. </para>

The number of adults in Tasmania - taking the same dates - was given at 101,000. But there are 103,527 persons on the rolls, or 2,527 more than the number of adults in the State. If we add the deficiency of 5 per cent., we get7,577.In plain English, there are about 7 per cent, more people on the rolls of New South Wales and Tasmania than there are adults in the States. </para>

                        <para>- There being this enormous discrepancy in the enrolment of two States, it is the duty of the Government to see that the rolls are purged, so that the next election can be fairly contested. The basis of honest parliamentary government is good rolls. In the past the rolls have not been good. Hundreds of persons who thought that they were enrolled for East Melbourne last week found at the last moment that they were not, and they were therefore disfranchised. That has been a common experience of the past. Some of the States - Tasmania, for example - use the Commonwealth roll for both Commonwealth and State elections; only one roll is compiled. That arrangement should have been made universal years ago. "To have two rolls in a State means a waste of money and of time. The reform could be secured by the use of a little common sense. The last Tasmanian election was fought on the roll that had previously been used in the State for the Commonwealth election, with the omissions and additions necessary to bring it up to date. The franchise is practically the same in all the States. </para>

                        <para>- A little tact would secure the desired end. I am sorry that reference has been made to the removal of the Governor-General from Sydney. The wrangle between this Government and the Government of New South Wales was undignified, and the less said about it the better. With regard to the supply of sleepers for the Western Australian railway, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the Government of Western Australia has "taken down" the Commonwealth over the deal. This Government has purchased 1,500,000 karri sleepers, untried and untested, at 10s. each - an outlay of £750,000 - although the Government of Western Australia, from whom we are buying, has not a mile of railway laid on karri sleepers. Every report and experiment has proved that karri is not a suitable timber for railway sleepers. </para>

                    <para>. -  I desire to draw the attention of the Prime Minister and the Government to a question that I raised the other day in regard to the establishment of a testing station for explosives. This is a matter that should not be delayed, because such an establishment is necessary, not only for the safety of life and property, but for the encouragement of the manufacture of explosives within the Commonwealth. To-day no explosive can be used in the Newcastle district unless it is on what is known as the permitted list, and no explosive can be placed on the list unless it passes the test imposed by the Board established for that purpose in the Old Country. There are coal mines in four of the States; and as these mines go to the dip, gas will, in all probability, be given off. Every precaution will be necessary ; and any explosives used under such circumstances ought to be free from fire. Only a fortnight ago there was a narrow escape from serious disaster owing to the use of a permitted explosive. In the Pelaw  Main mine a shot was fired by an experienced man, and it is stated that the permitted explosive gave off fire to such an extent as to cause an explosion and ignite the mine. This ought to be sufficient warning to take action before we are face to face with some mining disaster equal to those of which we have heard in the Old Country, and which we have seen in Australia. It cannot for a moment be contended that an explosive tested in the Old Country can be stored for months and months without deterioration. An explosive may be stocked in the Old Country, then brought to Australia, and stocked here; and my contention is that we ought to have a test on the spot. Then there is the question of testing all explosives used in Australia, including those used in gold mines. At present we do not know that the explosives used are of the proper standard, and we have to be guided entirely by the analytical chemist. Under the circumstances, a testing station should be established for explosives for all purposes; and, if this were done, we should, without a Tariff, bring about the manufacture of explosives in Australia. No one at the other end of the world would run the risk of sending explosives to be tested here before use, but would manufacture them within the Commonwealth. One factory was established, in the Maitland district, with the expenditure of a good deal of capita Here there were some fifty or sixty hands employed, and the belief was that there was nothing in the way of the factory at once beginning to supply the mine-owners. The fact was, however, that unless the explosive was on the permitted list it could not be used ; and the only course was to send it to England to be tested. This was done, and the Mines Department of New South Wales rendered every assistance. The explosive was considerably over twelve months in the Old Country, and when it was tested it was barred. I had the privilege of being present with two Government inspectors, a mine manager, and two or three practical men, when this explosive was tried ; and we fired six or eight shots in deep holings, and in no case was any flame given off. Yet this explosive, under the present conditions, cannot 'be used. Even supposing the explosives did not deteriorate on the way Home, and passed the test there, can we suppose that the Board would permit the use of an explosive which they could not test from time to time? I can only say that if I were on the Board I would not put an explosive on the list that I was not in a position to test, in view of the risk of an inferior article being manufactured and disaster caused. As I said before, immediate action should be taken; and if the Commonwealth do not intend to move we ought to know the fact. The Minister of Mines in New South Wales, in a letter to his Government, has urged the necessity of establishing a testing station. He believes this to be a Commonwealth matter,, affecting, as it does, more than one State ; and he goes so far as to advise his Government to bear a portion of the cost of establishing a Commonwealth station. If, however, the Prime Minister does not intend to go on with the work, he urges that the. State Government should, as early as possible, provide an establishment of the kind. So far as I can ascertain, the cost would not exceed ,£6,000 or .£7,000 for coal-mining alone, though, of course, the expenditure would be a little more in connexion with explosives generally. However, if an establishment of the kind would encourage the local manufacture of explosives, it would be money well spent. We ought to be self-contained so far as explosives are concerned, because, as things are at present, I doubt whether, in the case of Australia being isolated during war, we should"find sufficient ammunition to defend ourselves. </para>

                        <para>- I should suppose that New South Wales uses three-fourths or more of the permitted explosives, though I do not mind where the station is, so long as we have one. I admit that explosives cannot be manufactured . that do not emit some fire ; but, in gaseous mines, our object should be to reduce the danger to the minimum. Whatever action the Government intend to take ought to be taken at once. They should come to a decision and let the authorities of New South Wales know whether they are going on with the matter. If they are, the sooner they set about the work the better, and if they are not, the sooner the New South Wales Government set about it the better. I do not wish an accident to occur which may lead to the destruction of life and property in the mining industry in New South Wales, or in any other State. I wish to say a word in connexion with the delay in the construction of telephone lines referred to by the honorable member for Illawarra. The honorable member made it appear that he is unable to get anything done in this direction in his electorate. I wish to inform him that he is being given about as fair a deal as any other member of the House in this matter. The trouble is that all the big works in connexion with telephone construction are held up for the reason the honorable member gave, that we have not a sufficient stock of materials to carry them out. </para>

                        <para>- Even if we did that, we should have a stock in each of the States to meet our requirements. I know, for a fact, that to-day we are short of necessary supplies for the extension of telephone lines. Many lines agreed to in my district, and possibly also in every other district, cannot be carried out because of the lack of material. I believe that the Government should get in a good stock of the materials required in order that the money voted for the purpose may be expended. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, I find that every year votes passed for the purpose remain unexpended. There is something in what the honorable member for Illawarra has said, and I hope that the Postmaster-General will secure sufficient supplies as speedily as possible, and give instructions to utilize the money voted for the purpose in carrying out the various extensions agreed to in every part of Australia. If that is done, the country districts will greatly benefit from the expenditure. Efforts have been made to meet the requirements of country districts for telephone extensions, and the delay in carrying out the extensions, agreed upon is solely due to the fact that we have not the necessary material at hand. I hope that the Government will take some notice of what has been said by the honorable member for Illawarra, and other honorable members, and have those very necessary works carried out as speedily as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to support the protest of the honorable member for Darling Downs against the delay on the part of the Government in submitting their land policy for the Northern Territory. That great Territory, which has been too long neglected, is apparently still to suffer by this delay. When the Lands Ordinance was before the House, the Minister of External Affairs was treated rather cavilierly, and certainly very unfairly, by a number of his own supporters. The party opposite, apparently, had decreed that there should be leasehold tenure in the Northern Territory ; and when the Minister of External Affairs brought down an Ordinance which embodied the leasehold tenure, a lot of the criticism directed against it from his own side was, in my opinion, quite unmerited. I have certain objections to urge to provisions of that Ordinance, which will lie stated at the proper time, but I think we have now reason to protest against the long delay in having the land policy for the Territory fully discussed and settled by this House. I listened to what was said this evening on the sugar industry in Queensland, and was surprised at the protest made against the action of the Queensland Government in proposing to introduce a Bill in the State Parliament to prevent the employment of coloured labour in the industry. It seems to me that if the Queensland Government had passed such a Bill, honorable members opposite would probably have charged them with interfering with Commonwealth affairs. If the Federal Government propose to direct the policy adopted in connexion with the sugar industry, it is their place to communicate with the Government of Queensland, intimating that if they pass certain legislation the Federal policy with respect to bounty and Excise will be given effect.   1  have to protest once more against the inaction of the Government in respect to our immigration policy. We have appointed a High Commissioner who, I believe, is doing splendid work on behalf of the Commonwealth, and is adequately representing its great interests in London. We are paying, for the High Commissioner and his office in London, from £15,000 to  , £20,000  per annum. We are about to erect offices for the Commonwealth in London which will cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, and yet I understand that a paltry  , £20,000  a year is spent in promoting immigration by advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, the Government have been guilty of flagrant neglect of duty in connexion with immigration. </para>

                        <para>- If a number of unhealthy immigrants are being admitted, it is due to the failure of the Government to properly administer the Immigration Restriction Act. It is their duty to see that those who are not fit to. mix with our Australian people on the ground of health, should not be admitted. I should be sorry to think that any. more than a very small percentage of those who are coming here from the Old Country are disqualified from admission on the score of ill-health. There are thousands and tens of thousands of people willing to come to Australia, but there are no ships available to bring them here. One of the most anti-Imperial policies ever adopted is that of a stolid opposition to any form of immigration such as is presented by the various trade unions throughout the Commonwealth. We know that it is only by building up the strength of the Empire that we can hope to preserve it. </para>

                        <para>- As a Parliament we are specially charged with the work of directly controlling immigration to . Australia. The present Government are constantly complaining that this Parliament has not sufficient powers under the Constitution, and that we require extended powers in order that we may be able to legislate within the boundaries of Australia. But the most important duty of this Parliament is to shoulder its responsibility in connexion with immigration. That is the one great obligation under the Constitution which the Government have steadfastly and flagrantly neglected. There is no excuse for their inaction. It is only possible to consider this great question from an Imperial stand-point. We have, merely to take an Imperial view of it to realize the gross neglect which can be laid at the door of the Government for their failure to discharge their responsible duty of attracting immigrants to Australia. Some time ago I quoted figures with a view to showing our position as compared with that of other parts of the Empire. In Great Britain there is a congested population of our own race. The inhabitants of that country number 45,000,000. There are other parts of the Empire which are crying out for population. We require population more than does any other country in the world. We have a smaller population per square mile than has any other portion of the British Empire. Great Britain has the largest population per square mile of any European country, European countries contain only n6 persons per square mile, whereas Great Britain contains 375. Russian Asia, where there are large areas fit for wheat-growing and dairying, contains only twenty-five persons per square mile. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister of External Affairs considers this question a frivolous one, I do not. It is a question on which the future of the Empire depends. There is one outlet for the congested population of Great Britain. It needs to be transferred to the outer Dominions, whose resources require development. That is the only way in which the Empire can be saved. If our population continues to increase at the same rate as it has increased since the establishment of Federation, we shall have very little more than doubled it in 1950. Something like thirty-eight years hence we shall have scarcely more than double our present population if the same ratio of increase is preserved. If we believe in this country as we ought to believe in it, we should push it ahead, and it is capable of eventually carrying as great a population as the United States. I do not think that; in the variety and wealth of our resources, we can place ourselves second to the United States, which at the present time has a population of 90,000.000. It is stated, on the authority of persons who have considered this question, that those States will eventually carry something like 600,000,000 inhabitants, and that they will be able to produce sufficient to support that huge population. If we in Australia value our resources and do what we can to develop them, we can find room here for tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of people. There is only one way in which our resources can be opened up, namely, by the transfer of population from the Old Country. Our natural rate of increase is far too slow. At the present time we are spending from £15.000 to £20,000 a year to keep open the High Commissioner's office in London, and, in addition, it is intended to erect Commonwealth offices in that centre, at a cost of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. Yet, during the past two or three years, only the small sum of £20,000 annually has been placed upon the Estimates for advertising the resources of Australia. </para>

But they are generally disappointed. The rush to Australia is enormous. There are not nearly enough British ships to carry the passengers. Berths can be found more easily in German ships, and the North German Lloyd Company will pay an emigrant's fare to Antwerp so that he can embark there; but an Englishman prefers to travel in British boats. He cannot afford to wait four months. He has got to pay half-fare as deposit on his berth. Often that means a forced sale of his belongings, and while he is waiting he cannot get work. Meanwhile, berths are always ready in the Argentine boats, and hundreds and hundreds of Englishmen are going there rather than wait. The Peruvian Government, too, is trying to attract our men." </para>

His  attitude is a reflection on the Parliament. It is deplorable that the Minister of External Affairs, who should have charge of the immigration policy, who knows the importance of bringing to Australia some of the surplus population of Great Britain, and who should do his test to encourage immigration, and so build up the strength of the Empire, should jeer in this way.

The responsibility for that situation rests with this Parliament, which has specifically delegated to it the power to deal with immigration. We are spending £5,000,000 a year to build up a Defence Force. We have in this continent enormous reserves to open up, and we must have people to open them up. We have to develop them in order to provide a foundation for the great defence policy that we are seeking to build up, yet we are flagrantly neglecting the very means by which these great aims and objects can be achieved. We are neglecting this opportunity to transfer to Australia 'some of- the brain, bone, and muscle of Great Britain, the transfer of which would help the Old Land,- and we find the Minister charged with this important duty treating it as a laughing matter, and regarding the future safety and maintenance of this continent for ^ a European people with a flippancy that is unworthy of Ministerial office, and is indeed an insult to the Empire. We, in Australia, need population more than any other country in the world, not only because we have vast resources to open up, and because as part of a great Empire we offer a natural outlet for the surplus population of Great Britain, but also be- * cause geographically we stand in a more parlous position than any other country.

                        <para>- In the last two years the States have done splendid work, but no thanks are due to the Commonwealth Government for it. The danger is that, if the Government neglect the present splendid opportunity of bringing people to Australia, now that the tide of immigration has turned in our favour, we may lose the opportunity in the. course of a year or two, and when we seriously require people of our own kith and kin we shall perhaps find it impossible to get them. We are spending £20,000,000 per annum in the Commonwealth, one-fourth of it to establish naval and military defence. We know the parlous position in which we are likely to stand, owing to our proximity to the over-populated countries in the East; we know that Great Britain may be menaced by an enemy at any .time, and we know also that the only way in which the strength of the Empire can be maintained is to distribute over the various Dominions the population in the overpopulated centre. This Parliament, therefore, with its financial resources, should not delay one day longer in providing the ships that are necessary to bring people of the right class to our shores. I should like to support the remarks that have been made by several speakers with regard to our telephone system. I know there has been some difficulty in getting material, but we might reasonably have expected before this that material would be obtained. As my time has expired, I hope to have another opportunity of dealing with that question. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Illawarra expressed a hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs would inquire into the question of the bounty for wool-tops, and made certain allegations which I think the facts will not bear out. The wool-top industry was established in the district of Botany through the action of a previous Parliament in granting a bounty for the article if exported. That Parliament thought that this country was not always going to produce only raw material. We are a great producing country, and we desire to see here a more complete system of producing woollen goods. For that purpose a bonus of £10,000 has been given each year for the manufacture of wool-tops. . Two firms have already availed themselves of the bounty, and have put down very large machinery plants in big factories. Any part of the Commonwealth that likes to manufacture wool-tops can receive the bounty. It is not confined to any one State or factory. The industry which has grown up in the district of Botany since the passing of the Bounty Act employs 700 hands. While the raw wool they treat is worth 9 1/2 d. to 10d. a lb., the finished article they produce is worth about 2 s. 9d. per lb. The industry, therefore, adds to the value of the raw product of this country, which is much to be desired. I am sure that all members are desirous of seeing Australia manufacture its raw materials into more finished articles. </para>

                        <para>- No. The tweed mills in my own State have, in connexion with their own establishments, a plant that makes the tops for their own use. Consequently these people have had to look for foreign markets. They are handicapped when they go on to the market to buy their raw wool, because being small buyers they are always allotted a seat further back. The big buyers of the previous year, such as those from Germany, France and Great Britain, always get the front seats, with the consequence that any local woolbuyer is right at the back. He is therefore in a Less favorable position than foreign buyers, and has to pay more for his wool. Messrs. Hughes and Company have to pay, perhaps, £d. a lb. more for their wool, which is a great handicap to them. They, therefore, decided to go on the market, buy live sheep, and utilize the wool from the skins. Having done that, they were compelled to go into the market as suppliers of mutton. When they did so they were brought into direct competition with what is known in New South Wales as the Sydney Meat Company. That company has a large canning place at Auburn, and all the sheep and cattle they buy they drive to the abattoirs and slaughter and export. Immediately the wool-top company went into the live stock market to get their sheep, they became a competitor with the Meat Company at Auburn, who resented the appearance of any other local buyer. The honorable member for Illawarra said that another buyer coming in put the small buyer at a disadvantage, but surely another buyer coming into the market should make the price of sheep go up. The very fact that these people bought sheep to get their wool, caused them to become sellers of mutton. The day after the Colonial Meat Export Company was formed, they were compelled to sell cheaper than. they did before. A large amount of correspondence has been printed in the Sydney newspapers, and some f the newspapers have been subsidized to write articles in the interest of the meat companies, with the object of getting the competing company out of the way. The mere fact that this company has come into the market has caused the price of meat to come down in Sydney, much to the disadvantage of those interested in the meat trade. I was a member of a deputation to the Minister of Trade and Customs, at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gee,</inline> manager of the meatworks at Auburn, said that his company had been the means of keeping up the price of meat in New South Wales, and he said that because these new people had come into the market, the effect had been to reduce the price of mutton considerably. This new company pays good wages, has no trouble with its employes, and is adding to the value of our wool. This industry is quite as much entitled to protection as the steel industry. It is quite right that the Federal Government should pay a bonus to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> for the production of steel, because we want Australia to be a self-contained country ; but we have also a right to our own market in the matter of wool. We can produce the best of cloth and blankets, because we have the raw material at our door. </para>

                        <para>- No; because coal is a gift of nature. No encouragement is required to produce it. But these people have to compete in the open market. They have already captured the Japanese market. Japanese manufacturers say that they produce the best wool-tops that have ever been sent to their country. It has been an excellent advertisement for New South Wales. The company has gone to great expense in erecting an up-to-date plant. It would be a scandal for this Parliament to allow itself to be guided by interested parties who have been writing to the press with the object of trying to close up the industry. Any honorable member who chooses to go and see the works for himself will be surprised. He will also be satisfied that they are conducted on right lines, and that the industry is worthy of consideration. The employes are receiving 30 per cent, more wages to-day than before the industry was established. It is likely to grow. I believe that a branch will probably be established in another State, for the company is very progressive. With regard to the remarks of the honorable member for Wimmera concerning immigration, I should like to impress upon the Committee the fact that the Government have spent '^20,000 a year on advertising the resources and attractions of Australia. Indeed, this is the only Government that has ever expended that amount. </para>

                        <para>- As the Government are spending the full amount voted by Parliament, they must be more sincere in their efforts than previous Governments were. I have obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> a return giving the number of people who came to the Commonwealth during the first seven months of this year.  1  find that 154,000 people landed, and that before the end of the year over 250,000 people will have arrived in the Commonwealth. That is a greater number in proportion to population than the number of immigrants who are going to the United States or Canada. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the point. I want to see this country grow, and I am pointing out that it is growing more rapidly in proportion to population than the United States of- America. If factories were being closed up for want of labour, I could understand the anxiety of honorable members opposite in regard to immigration. But what is the result of immigration to-day ? It is that the people of the Commonwealth have to pay 20 and 30 per cent, more for house accommodation, because immigrants are arriving more quickly than houses can be built for them. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that I am expressing the opinion of the people whom I represent. Those who want more immigrants are the landlords and the shopkeepers. Those who brew beer want more people to come and drink it. It is not a question of developing the country, but of self-interest.  1  maintain that people are coming to this country quite as rapidly as we can absorb them, or provide for them. Therefore the Government are to be congratulated on maintaining a policy based on sound lines. That policy is already attracting people to this country. The honorable member for Flinders laughs. </para>

The Government have passed measures which have attracted people from all parts of the civilized world. If they had not done so, people would not have been coming here so rapidly.

                    <para>.- I think that one of the most humorous episodes we have had here since the inception of Federation has been the claim made on the other side that the present Government has been of material assistance in developing a policy of immigration to Australia. I do not think that a statement of that kind needs very serious traversing, because it is well known that the attitude of most of those  who sit on the other side is that of entire opposition to immigration, and that, therefore, they, even although in their hearts they realize the urgent necessity of immigration, dare not say anything to the contrary after their masters have given an indication of the policy which they desire should be adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I did not rise to discuss the question of immigration, because that requires more time, and, I think, a more seriously-minded Government than we have at present, but to bring under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs, in particular, and of the Government in general, a matter affecting my own State, which is, I think, worthy of a few minutes consideration. This Government poses as being pre-eminently a national one. It tries hard to ignore State boundaries, and it claims that, above all other Governments, it will deal out even-handed justice to all sections of the community, and equally to all parts of Australia. Of course, we know that the Government with these high pretensions has failed very egregiously in many respects. I am going to indicate one way in which it has failed, and shown a most remarkable disregard for at least a section of the people by no means unimportant, and its action in this respect is bitterly resented in Western Australia. In a previous discussion here I pointed out that a very important appointment had been made without being advertised, and I showed very conclusively that, of necessity, the Minister responsible for the appointment had really no other course open to him than to evade the rules and regulations laid down in connexion with all appointments in order to make the one I refer to. But since then there have been several cases of a similar character, each one being more objectionable than the other, and affecting a greater number of persons, until the thing has reached the dimensions of a public scandal. A little time ago - after the episode to which I have just referred - an advertisement appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> calling for tenders for the supply of certain machinery required in connexion with the transcontinental railway. This matter was referred by myself to the Minister. I pointed out to him that it was quite impossible for persons in Western Australia to have an opportunity of putting in tenders, as the time limit advertised in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> was too short to allow them to do so. </para>

                        <para>- The tenders were returnable at Melbourne by a certain date, and it was obviously quite impossible that persons in Western Australia could see the specifications and deal with them, and send in their offers, in time. I pointed out the position to the Minister, and, of course, he had to concede a certain amount of time. He had to alter the terms of the advertisement to some extent. But even with that alteration tenderers in Western Australia were still at a grave disadvantage, and I doubt very much whether any of them had a genuine opportunity of doing any of that work within their, own State, in respect of which, surely, they had an equal, if not a- prior, claim, for consideration. Again, in August applications were invited in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> for persons for the following positions at Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta in connexion with the transcontinental railway : - Assistant engineer, surveyor-in-charge, junior assistant engineer, assistant surveyor, draftsman, senior clerk, clerk for records and posts and statistics, stenographer, typist, and timekeeper. The advertisement calling for applications for these positions appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> on the 2nd August ; it invited applications up to the 9th August, but the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> did not reach Western Australia until the 13th August, so that, in connexion with these appointments, the majority of them being required for Western Australia, there was no chance given to persons in that State to apply in time, and many of those who would have sent in an application had the conditions permitted them to do so, lost, perhaps, the opportunity of their lives to get promoted to positions which they were thus prevented from applying for. On each occasion, 1 believe an assurance was given that that kind of thing would cease. But, in the course of a few minutes, I have given three cases of that kind of treatment being meted out to Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Western Australia is a part of the Commonwealth, and these officers must know that there are persons in that State equally entitled to an opportunity to apply for all positions throughout the Commonwealth. When the positions are to be filled in Western Australia itself, surely it is almost past understanding that those whose duty it is to issue the advertisements fail to realize that an opportunity should be given in that State for persons to post their applications so as to arrive in time. I bring this matter forward because I think that, although it concerns, perhaps, only a limited number of persons, still there is a very important principle involved, and one' to which, I feel sure, any Government can fairly well be asked to give attention, and, in particular, this Government, which professes to deal out even-handed justice to all parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That when the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> cannot be distributed in Western Australia soon enough to give persons there a proper opportunity to apply for positions that may be vacant, the particulars should be advertised in the leading newspapers of the State. The <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> does not circulate with great rapidity, and, as a matter of fact, is sometimes not published until several days after the date which it bears. In view of that fact, important information regarding appointments should be published in the remote parts of the Commonwealth by advertising in the leading newspapers circulating there. This would not mean a big expense, but it would remove a grievance that causes no small amount of irritation, and is one of those pin-pricks which do great harm to the Federal sentiment, in my own State, at any rate. I hope that a definite instruction will be issued in all the Departments to prevent the recurrence of what I have complained of. </para>

                    <para>. - Confusion seems to exist in the minds of a number of persons who were naturalized under State Acts prior to Federation as to their present standing. Whenever I have met such persons, I have assured them that naturalization papers issued by any State prior to Federation are acknowledged by the Commonwealth. On the authority of an Attorney-General or the legal advisers of the Electoral Department, it was held until recently that an Australian woman marrying a man who was not naturalized would be regarded as naturalized and able to vote ; but I understand that the latest decision is that such a woman is regarded as not naturalized, and is disfranchised. Electors who have exercised the franchise for forty years past are disturbed in mind by a doubt as to their real position, and fear that the women they have married, as well as themselves, may be disfranchised. If the Home Affairs Department would give publicity to a statement of the true position, considerable uneasiness would be removed from the minds of many of the electors. The honorable member for Wimmera waxed eloquent in complaining of the lack of an immigration policy by this Government, but recently I received from the head of a family lately settled on the land in Victoria a copy of a newspaper published in Great Britain - the <inline font-style="italic">John Bull</inline> - from which I intend to read an extract which will show that everything regarding immigration is not satisfactory. This newspaper has a considerable circulation among the working and middle classes of Great Britain, and is sent out from the Old Country to immigrants who settle here on the land, or make their homes in our cities. According to the honorable member for Wimmera, now is the golden opportunity for inducing people to come here. To those who ardently desire immigration, the present inflow of population should be satisfactory.. </para>

                <para class="block">Personally, I am prepared to welcome with open arms immigrants of our own race who are willing to fill the waste spaces of Australia, providing that land is made available for our farmers' sons and our own people, which is not the case in Victoria, Victorians having to migrate to Queensland and New South Wales to get land. But one of the worst things for the immigration movement is for intending immigrants to read or be given certain official information prior to their departure from the Old Country, and to find, on their arrival here, that the conditions were not properly described. That is the complaint made by many of those who have settled on our irrigation areas. The honorable member for Wimmera said that there was space for thousands of settlers on the Murray. I know as well as he does, if not better, the land that is being purchased by the Government and subdivided for irrigation areas. Many of those who have settled on that land are not fitted, for the work which they have undertaken, but they were all told by the Department that its officers would be only too pleased to instruct them in the management of irrigated farms, and would make practical farmers of mere novices within a few months, a thing that no Department can do. A man must be blessed with considerable initiative, and have some experience, before he can become a first-class farmer. The promises made by the Department have not been kept. My chief complaint is that people are arriving here expecting to settle on the land, and finding no land to settle on. This newspaper, <inline font-style="italic">John Bull,</inline> circulates amongst millions, and it has been sent to me. by an elector of the honorable member for Wimmera. This paper is accompanied by a letter, and my correspondent is the head of a family who has fought a good fight on an irrigation block, and intends to remain there. He tells me in this letter that the information contained in the newspaper is perfectly true, and can be borne out by a number of other immigrants. The newspaper is dated  24th  August,  1912,  and contains the following - </para>

One of the worst advertisements Australia can receive is for men and women to come here and be disappointed in the conditions, and then write home, informing their friends that they have been stranded. The day may come when we shall be pleading for people, but such advertisements as these will, more than anything, keep people away. </para>

The article proceeds - " Everything has gone wrong since we landed in this cursed country," is the burden of his text. When they landed they were worth about £200 ; now their capital amounts to about <inline font-style="italic">£70.</inline> First of all, they went up-country to gain farming experience, and although they tried to obtain a married couple's job for miles and miles around the place, there was not one going. The wife, therefore, took over the management of a cottage and four children for a publican.; the husband went out fruit-picking and navvying. Farmers would not employ him because he was inexperienced, and, because, like employers in this country, they wanted value for their money. In five months the husband was able to secure only five weeks' work, and he and his wife had to eat their capital. </para>

                        <para>-i-I can refer the honorable member to a statement made by the Victorian Minister having charge of the matter of immigration. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hagelthorn,</inline> Honorary Minister of the Victorian Government in the Upper House of the State Parliament. He was asked how many immigrants he expected to come to Victoria during the current financial year. He said he expected 30,000, and when an interviewer asked him how many of those people would go upon the land, and whether he thought that  5  per cent, of them would do so, he said, " No, not 2^. per cent." I wish to ask the honorable member for Darling Downs, and every true Australian, whether that is the kind of immigration policy which will send Australia ahead. We know that It is not. It means that only a few hundreds of those who are brought out to Australia will go upon the land, and the rest will be dumped into the already overcrowded cities. I know that, in my own electorate, there are to-day hundreds of men who cannot find work. The honorable member for Swan had some experience " as a member of a State Government, and I ask him if he considers it a fair thing, when there are hundreds of men out of work in the metropolis of a State, to bring men from the other side of the world to make the condition of unemployment still more acute.. It is a wrong, and a dastardly tiling to do. It is unjust to the men who are being brought here, and a cruel wrong to those who are here and out of employment. </para>

The husband was advised to swear a declaration to this purport, and the result would be that the stuff would be carted from the dock and stored free of charge for three months. They had a different 'tale for him when he returned to Melbourne.  His  things were still in the King's warehouse, held up by the Customs, they said, though during the whole of the time they had not written a line to him, a stranger in a strange land, to inform him of the fact, and so give him the chance of returning to Melbourne and arranging matters without having to face the accumulation of heavy storage rates. . In the end he had to pay£15 odd for duty, storage and incidentals. </para>

                    <para>In the ordinary course of things, it is not those who are successful in their own country who emigrate to another. From various causes they are beaten, or all but beaten, when they leave it. Australia, Canada, America, is the last throw of a dice - the last gamble for . the means of subsistence. If a man must emigrate, let him ; but not under any less pressing circumstances whatever. If he goes, let him go with his eyes open for the harshest conditions, with his heart brave to bear them, with his hands ready to grapple with them. Do not let him be lured by what the Government emigration officials of Australia and Canada, and the Home shipping agents, tell him by mouth and by pamphlet, of the new golden dawn which is gleaming for him-all for him - over the great waters. Let him discount everything ; disbelieve almost everything ; calculate everything by discount and disbelief. Then it may well be, when he does reach the promised land, that the conditions will be a little brighter than he thought, and he may be heartened to struggle through for life and prosperity. </para>

                <para class="block">An honorable member asked me from what I was quoting, and I may inform the Committee that I have quoted from a newspaper called <inline font-style="italic">John Bull</inline> which has a considerable circulation amongst the masses of the people in Great Britain. It is sent out regularly to some of those who have come from the other side of the world. I have been in conversation with many immigrants, and they have shown me this newspaper, and various items published in it. I am pointing out that the publication of such letters as I have quoted in newspapers circulating in the Old Country must do a very great deal of harm to Australia. I speak particularly with reference to the action of the State Government of Victoria. I believe that the day will come when our State Governments will have land ready for those who are induced to come here. The honorable member for Perth referred to the practice in Western Australia. I do not say that the system followed there is to be credited to the Scaddan Government, because previous Governments of that State also adopted something like business methods for the settlement of people upon the land. Victorians who have gone to Western Australia have informed me that as soon as a man lands in that State he is taken in hand by an official of the Lands Department and is shown where he can get land. Within comparatively a few hours after his arrival in Western Australia a man from the other States, or from the other side of the world is taken to the spot where land is available for him. Unfortunately, in Victoria, immigrants are not treated in that fashion. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but if immigration is conducted by the other States, as it is in Victoria, it can only result in Australia getting a very bad name on the other side of the world. I do not wish to say anything derogatory of those who are coming here, but I have it from their employers that if they are put side by side with Australian workmen and workwomen they cannot keep the pace. As soon as dull times come the men and women who cannot keep the pace will be turned on to the street, and what is to become of people from the other side of the world who will be homeless in a land where they have few friends? I say that the immigration policy of the States and particularly of Victoria is a failure, and personally I am against that kind of immigration. I repeat that there are hundreds of men in my own constituency out of work, and it is heartless of the Victorian Government to bring men here to take the bread out of the mouths of those who are the breadwinners of wives and bairns in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - It is certainly most extraordinary that the Treasurer should ask for a grant of three months' Supply at this stage of the session. I do not recollect an occasion upon which, under similar circumstances, such a course of action has been followed. Still more extraordinary is his expressed determination to push this Bill through in one sitting. By so doing, he is taking a most unfair advantage of the Opposition, especially in view of the fact that its Leader is absent through illness; and that its  Deputy  Leader, as the result of an accident, missed the train from Sydney to Melbourne last evening. Ordinary courtesy should have prompted him to extend some consideration to those who are absent. However, the Government intend to push the Bill through to-night; and, therefore, it is impossible for us to give it proper consideration. Only the other day we were reminded! by an honorable member opposite that the Opposition were allowed to have a voice in legislation merely as a matter of grace. Although the remark was made jocularly, it accurately represents the present situation. Why cannot the Government proceed in a regular way with their Estimates, instead of adopting these unbusiness-like and slipshod methods of dealing with the finances? The honorable member for South' Sydney took credit for the fact that the Government have expended the whole amount placed upon the Estimates for advertising the resources of Australia, whereas previous Governments had not done so. As a result, he claimed that the present Government were responsible for <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> great influx of immigrants to this country. Immediately afterwards he stated that immigration was a very bad thing for the workers of Australia. In other words, he declared that the Government are responsible for having expended the largest sum of money in doing something to the injury of the workers. This debate, so far as the question of immigration is concerned, has had one good result, in that it has shown us where some honorable members opposite really stand. Despite all their lip professions of a desire to attract people to this country, we have their own declaration that they do not favour bringing immigrants here. Some of them affirm that they favour immigration, whilst others condemn an immigration policy. In this connexion, it is interesting to recall what took place at the Labour Congress which was held in Sydney, on 10th June last. That Congress met in the Trades Hall, Goulburn-street, and, amongst other things, the question of immigration was discussed. The honorable member for Cook was in the chair, when a resolution was carried - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That the trades unions of New South Wales, as represented by the Congress, request the State Government to discontinue its immigration policy. </para>
                <para class="block">This occurred in New South Wales, where a Labour Government is in power. Thus we have outside labour organizations calling upon a Labour Government to discontinue its immigration policy, whilst leaders of the party express full concurrence in it, and claim credit for it. It is about time that we had some unanimity in the Labour party on this question, so that the public may understand the position. Is it the desire of the party that Australia should be made a close reserve for those who are already here, or do they desire to populate this country in order to develop its resources, and to secure an effective defence from foreign aggression? It is clear that honorable members opposite speak with two voices, and that they have no real desire to encourage immigration. I have always held that it is not desirable to encourage some classes of immigration. Discretion must be exercised. It is certainly not advisable to encourage the wholesale immigration of persons who can find occupation only in our cities. The land tax policy of the Government was adopted avowedly to open up country lands for settlement, to encourage immigrants to take up those lands, and thus to develop our primary resources. But that is not what is being done. Only the other day, I read in the newspapers a description of certain immigrants who have been brought here, and who, presumably, passed our immigration agents in the Old Country. These men, who described themselves as agricultural labourers and rural workers, knew absolutely nothing about rural occupations. According to statements which were published, some of these so-called farm labourers weighed only between 5 and 6 stone. </para>

                        <para>- Weeds may have something of a rural character, but they are not the kind of cultivation that we want. If we are going to develop this country, we will not do so by importing "weeds" either vegetable or physical. According to these newspaper reports, the money expended by the Commonwealth in advertising the resources of Australia has merely had the effect of encouraging to come here an undesirable class of people, who would do no good in any country. Their departure from the country where they have hitherto lived would be very satisfactory to the people there, but they are not the class to develop Australia, or to settle down even in our cities; and not a few. of the criminal class appear to have been included in the batches of oversea arrivals. As a matter of fact, our cities are gradually becoming very congested. Their population is largely increasing at the expense of th': rural districts, and even the natural increase of population is being affected in that way. We find that, from many causes, chief amongst which, in my opinion, is the policy of the Labour Government, men who should be settling and developing the lands of Australia are being attracted to the cities by the prospect of obtaining plenty of Government work, at high rates of pay, on day-labour jobs. The country districts, in this way, are being gradually denuded of their population, and the natural outcome of this movement of population is an increased demand for accommodation in our cities on the one hand and the forcing up of rents on the other. The high rents and the lack of accommodation of which workers in the cities are complaining are, therefore, directly due to the' mistaken policy of the Labour Government. I think we ought to have from the Government a responsible pronouncement of their actual policy in regard <inline font-style="italic">0</inline> to immigration. We are asked to grant Supply for three months, and we have no explanation for this unusual demand. </para>

                        <para>- No; the honorable member cannot have read the Bill. It covers much more than what he thinks. The Treasurer, in submitting a motion of this kind, should have given some reason for resorting to the extraordinary procedure that has been adopted. It is becoming the fashion, however, for the Ministry to treat the House  with scant courtesy. The Prime Minister, or some  member  of his Government, in introducing a Bill, makes a few inconsequential remarks, conveying no information, and these are supposed to be sufficient to satisfy all purposes. The Government seem to fake up the attitude, "We have discussed this matter upstairs ; we recognise that you have been sent here by some obscure people in whom we are not interested, but we are the only men to be considered, and you must take what we offer you or leave it." Such an attitude is not conducive to the dignity of Parliament or of the deliberations of men who are returned to represent different sections of the people, who have a right to have their opinions voiced in the House. I for one shall always resent such treatment, no matter what Government is in office, because I think the amenities of life should be observed here as elsewhere._ The rights of the minority should not be trampled upon as they are By the methods adopted by the present Government. I think that, at this hour of the night, we ought to have a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                        <para>- I shall do so if the Prime Minister will cease his frivolity. The right honorable member cannot get rid of his responsibility, in the matter of the negotiations concerning Government House, Sydney, in the way that he has attempted to do. In -the first place, Government House, Sydney, was erected by the Imperial Government for the King's representative in New South Wales, and with that generosity that has always characterized the Old Country's treatment of us it was presented to the people of New South Wales, with the intention, evidently, that it should be used only for that purpose. I do not suppose that it ever entered the heads of the Imperial authorities that the representative of the King would be turned out of the house which the British Government had built specially for his use. It remained for a Labour Government in New South Wales to turn the King's representative out of his house, and for the Labour Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to actually refuse to pay a sum by way of rental for those premises. It is a most undignified attitude for the Prime Minister to take up, and a most humiliating position for him, in conjunction with the Labour Government in New South Wales, to have placed Australia in. That is the kind of advertisement we are getting now in the Old Country, gaining for us there a reputation for disloyalty, because a slight offered to the King's representative is a slight offered to the King himself.' This is the King's house, and when he is not here his representative stands in his shoes. Any indignity placed upon his representative is placed upon him. We, therefore, cannot wonder that our actions are misconstrued. We are all supposed to be tarred with the one brush, and the whole of Australia gets the discredit which rightly attaches to this action. I protest against this matter having been carried through in this way. It was bad enough <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> the Labour Government in New South Wales practically to give the Governor-General notice to quit, but it was equally bad for the Prime Minister to be so lacking in dignity as to begin to haggle and huckster and bargain about a mere question of paying rent. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe another State in the Commonwealth would have taken such action, unless it was governed by a similar party. I am sure that if any other Government had been in office in New South Wales this <inline font-style="italic">contretemps,</inline> this humiliating spectacle, would never have occurred. For a Government of a country, enjoying all the advantages of the protection of the British Flag and British Navy, as we have enjoyed them in Australia since the country was handed over to us as a people, to give notice to the King's representative to quit in those circumstances, is to commit' an act which would be almost unbelievable by any body of people of British origin. It has been done, to our shame, disgrace, and humiliation, and our chief regret is the share which the Government of the Commonwealth have had in that most deplorable transaction. </para>

                        <para>- I wish it could be forgotten now, but, unfortunately, this is the kind of thing that will stick in the minds of the people of the Old Country, and will not do Australia any good. It is not the kind of advertisement that is calculated to raise us in the estimation of British people or of other civilized communities in the world. We have not been getting Sydney Government House altogether "for nothing. It has been costing us £3,000 a year for maintenance and upkeep, so that the Government of New South Wales were really losing nothing through its occupancy by the King's representative. What has happened has had a very serious effect in a number of other ways, not the least important of which is that it has deprived large numbers of people of employment. The residence of the Governor- General in Sydney, during the few months that he was accustomed to stay there, meant, I am informed, the distribution of between £10,000 and £15,000- in wages in various employments. This sum is now withheld from the workers of Sydney. I therefore take this opportunity of entering my emphatic protest against what has been done in the eviction of the King's representative from the King'shouse. </para>

                        <para>-" Eviction " is the proper word to use, and no other will meet the case. It was built by the Imperial Government as the official residence of  His  Majesty's representative. When the Prime Minister was unwilling to pay the rent asked for these premises, he should, at least, have cast about at once for some other residence for the King's representative. I, as a resident of New South Wales, feel humiliated. What has been done is a shame and a disgrace, undeservedly put upon the people of my State by the combined action of twoLabourSocialist Governments. The opinion of the people of New South Wales has been most sadly misrepresented in the attitude taken up by the State Labour Government. The feelings of the people of Australia generally have been outraged by the failure of the Prime Minister and his Government to rise to the occasion, and see that suitable provision was made for a residence for the King's representative when he elected to pay New South Wales a visit. I' come now to the decision of the Minister of Home Affairs to open Government stores in connexion with the building of the transcontinental railway. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffith,</inline> the Minister of Works in New South Wales, recently referred to the risks and penalties of Socialism in practice, as the following published statement will show : - </para>

                        stated that the difficulties and annoyances consequent on undertaking this work would have interfered with the effective administration in other branches. " In the first place," he said, " there would be the question of credit. If the trust stores refused credit probably one-half of the employes would deal with the Narrandera storekeepers, and the Government store would then be unprofitable. If the trust gave credit then every attempt to recover accounts would be regarded as persecution. The adjournment of the House would be moved, and ferocious attacks would be made -upon me personally by the union officials in the columns of the press, and I would be held up to the public as a grasping Shylock seeking my pound of flesh from a poor working man. "This sort of thing is all right if consequent on carrying out functions that are actually necessary ; but as it is not necessary in this case we have decided not to voluntarily go and look for it. Consequently  there will not be any Government stores on the area."

                    <para>.- ] t seems to me to be rather absurd that the Committee should be asked to pass three months' Supply so late in the session in three or four hours. When all is said and done, the. passing of Supply is the only recognition which the Australian Democracy has of the supremacy of the people regarding the expenditure of public funds. Here we are asked to expend the money of the people of Australia for a long term in two or three hours. But it is only the people's money, and it does not matter how we deal with it ! That seems to describe the present situation. I do not think that it reflects credit upon the Government, or will reflect credit upon Parliament, if this method of conducting public business is persisted in. </para>

                <para>With respect to the remarks of the honorable member for Lang as to Government House, Sydney, I wish to say that, in my humble judgment, the Governor-General occupies a dual position. In the first place, he is the representative of the King. In the second place, he is the representative of the sovereignty of the Australian people. I regret his eviction from Sydney on both counts. Enough has been said of  His Excellency  as the representative of the King to justify me in not deeming it necessary to make further reference to that aspect of the question. But I do wish to put it to honorable members that it is advisable that the sovereign majesty of the Australian people should be represented amongst the densest population and in the biggest city of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- There is this argument - that we want to keep constantly before the largest population in Australia the ideal of Australian union, in order that we may not suffer from the absence of reminders in that direction. No doubt the Honorary Minister is of opinion that he himself could fill the bill. He believes that he could represent the dignity and majesty of the Australian people. Let him try. Could any man in party politics represent the abstract dignity of the Australian Commonwealth in the way that the King's representative does ? Honorable members opposite cheered the Prime Minister when he made a very proper announcement as to the duty of the Commonwealth Government with respect to the Governor-General. But look at the sneers upon the faces of the Prime Minister's colleagues when this question is brought up here. There are sneers upon every one of them - sneers from the Minister of External Affairs, sneers from the Honorary Minister, and sneers from all their colleagues - showing the amount of lip-loyalty that is behind the cheers they gave to the Prime Minister when the press representatives were present. I want to say in connexion with this Government House trouble that I think the Government of New South Wales are primarily responsible for the unfortunate business. But I also think that the Federal Government, if it had been alive to its duties, would not have allowed two men  in the New South Wales Ministry to engineer this business - men who have been against the British connexion since the start of things; who have been against the Mother Country in every crisis that she has faced since they have been in Parliament. These men have engineered this thing, and any Federal Government worth its salt would never have permitted the mere matter of rent to stand between the ambition of these men and the realization of what we all desire.. It seems to me that there is absolutely no excuse for the action that has been taken. What are the New South Wales Government going to do with that historic building formerly occupied by the Governor-General? They may take the grounds if they please, but what are they going to do with the building itself? Is it going to be used as an official residence for the Premier of New South Wales; or as a private residence for the Minister of Works ? Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis</inline> is going to have Parliament meeting there, in order to be a shade nearer to the Police Court. What can result from this business, except to dishonour the King's representative, and cast a slur upon ±he Australian Commonwealth? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; and that is all the honorable member wanted. But the bar still stands on the upper story, and what is the honorable member doing to abolish it? I think we all realize that the language used by the honorable member must be taken with a certain amount of discount. But this business about Government House, Sydney, is a very unfortunate one, and I hope that some way will still lie found to get out of the difficulty. It is eminently desirable that Australia and the King shall be represented in our largest city, which is rapidly increasing in size proportionately to the other cities of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>When I came into the chamber tonight, I was rather interested to hear the honorable member for Maribyrnong entering upon a somewhat savage indictment of the Victorian Premier and Government for persisting in introducing immigrants into this unfortunate country, lt was an outrage; the thing was done clumsily and wickedly ; it was against the public interest; it was something that ought to be stopped. Now, I have been looking through the very first pronouncement of policy submitted by the Government to Parliament this session. I find there that the real malefactors in this matter are my honorable friends opposite. When it was a question of the popularity of immigration - when immigration was a thing that every one regarded as beneficent and essential - my honorable friends opposite, with that extraordinary modesty that always characterizes their public attitude, put the following statement into the mouth of the Governor-General - </para>

                <para class="block">Yet, how long was it that I had to listen to the honorable member's savage indictment of the Victorian Premier for doing exactly the thing to which the policy of honorable members opposite, as declared by themselves, has "largely contributed"? Let us have done with this hypocrisy and humbug ! Honorable members opposite cannot go on playing the thimble-and-pea racket with regard to immigration. When it is unpopular they attack the State Governments; when it is popular, they say that their own policy has contributed to it. My suggestion is that they adopt the attitude of the honorable member for Maribyrnong, and so help us to get over there to run the country. </para>

                <para>With regard to immigration, there is one thing which I cannot overlook. Honorable members opposite are inclined to say, " Let us do this thing in a year. Let us take time to do it." I quite believe in systematic immigration. I quite believe in the Canadian method of organizing immigration, so that upon their arrival immigrants may immediately find work which they are fitted to do. But I would remind honorable members that this country is in an extraordinarily difficult position. Time is the essence of the contract, so far as Australia is concerned. Time will decide everything. If we have time, Australia will live; but if we have not time, and leave Australia empty, it will be taken by an alien people, and men speaking another language will be occupying our places in this House. I cannot overlook the fact that a great country in the Northern Pacific has waged two successful wars for the purpose of getting land suitable for racial expansion. First, Japan defeated China; and, afterwards, Russia for the possession of Manchuria and Korea. Having won those two wars, and possessed themselves of the countries, the Japanese found that they were faced with a cheap-labour difficulty. The Manchurian and the Korean can subsist on worse conditions than can the Japanese labourer, and will work for lower pay. The result is that the Japanese Government, despite their best efforts, have been unable to settle Manchuria and. Korea with Japanese people. In other words, two wars have been waged for nothing, and Japan is still looking for a country for racial expansion. The only countries which are unoccupied at present are two British Dominions in the southern seas, and I put it to my honorable friends on both sides that if they have any instinct of racial patriotism in them, they will do what they can to fill up this land now that we have time to do it, so that, eventually, it may not cease to be white because of the apathy and the want of public spirit of the politicians who are leading Australian affairs. These are matters of small moment to some honorable members ; but I think they are matters of the utmost importance to the Australian people as a whole. I believe that men who refuse to regard these matters seriously will shortly be asked to leave the public life of this country. The public are sick and tired of a policy of election bribes. They want their public men to seriously regard the interests of Australia, and it is about time that men on both sides of politics began to wake up to this biggest issue of all. By all manner of means if you like - and I believe that it is necessary to do it - .try to organize your immigration ; try to carry out here, by Government methods and means, the great work being carried out in Canada by the land-grant railways.' Get people and set them to the work for which they are suited ; but do not forget that time is the very essence of the contract if the Commonwealth is to continue to exist as a White Dominion of the Empire. </para>

                    <para>. - Earlier in the evening the honorable member for Bass said that a letter was published in a recent issue of the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> reflecting upon the action of_ the Government in introducing certain legislation which has passed through this House, and is now before the Senate. He said that that letter was of such a character that the newspaper should be removed from the files of this House. Its language must have been extremely bad, because the honorable gentleman, on seeing that ladies were present in the gallery, would not read it. He handed it to the Prime Minister, who apparently recognised the seriousness of the statements, and undertook at his request to submit the matter to the Library Committee. I am of the opinion that publications containing matter unfit to be read should not be kept on our newspaper files, but I hope that all newspapers will be treated alike. Newspapers containing, articles dealing improperly with the most sacred subjects connected with our social life should not be received by the Library Committee. I am sorry that the Prime Minister is not here now, because I wish to read some newspaper statements of which T think it is as necessary for the Library Committee to take notice as it is that it should notice that which he read and put into his pocket. The article which I am about to read appeared in the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> of the 18th April last. That is a newspaper which is received by the Library Committee, and1 filed, and I should like the Committee to-  consider whether it is fit for members to read. Honorable members opposite must know exactly what the article contains, because they must read everything that appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call,</inline> and the other organs which advocate their policy throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>Sanctity of the Marriage Tie. </para>
                <para>The sanctity of the marriage tie has been the shibboleth of the "ant is" during recent years, and although it is becoming a little threadbare with excessive use, it still rouses itself occasionally and takes the air on special occasions. The daring of the " ant is " is truly appalling, but they usually rely  on  the silence of their press  to  smother up any inconvenient detail, and so many hoary old institutions are allowed to persist which have long outlived their usefulness, and many a shining aphorism does duty as a battle cry, which, if only examined in a little more daylight, would be relegated to the limbo of forgetfulness. </para>
                <para>Fool's Paradise. </para>
                <para>The sanctity of the marriage tie is one of those pretences which really ought to be exposed in the interests of public morality, for the sooner we cease to live in a fool's paradise the better it will be for all concerned, and the sooner we recognise that the preaching of the churches and the prosing of the purists is scornfully ignored by the mass of the people who simply follow the impulses of their natures regardless of the awful warnings of the pious pretenders, the better it will be for all concerned. From time immemorial attempts have been made "in the interests of morality" to restrict intercourse between the sexes and to force upon humanity some arbitrary man-made social customs which, of necessity, has failed, simply because it has flown in the face of a primary law of nature. The sooner legislators and preachers and purists recognise that social customs must conform to natural laws and not to artificial regulations, however well conceived, the better will be our chance of securing wholesome and cleanly social and marital relations among the people. </para>
                <para class="block">Sexual Laxity. </para>
                <para>The most cursory examination of the figures bearing upon this question reveals a most startling state of sexual laxity in our midst, and we learn that the so-called sacrament of marriage is based upon flagrant immorality and loose sexual relations which the church and clergy sanctify and indorse. Perhaps they are doing the best possible under the circumstances, but the circumstances themselves reveal an almost inconceivable state of moral delinquency from which the teachers cannot escape all the responsibility. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The "Busted Lie." </para>
                    <para>Now this is a serious social problem, and one which requires the most serious examination and investigation ; and any attempt to suppress information of this character should be promptly resented. In the public interests the fiercest light should be turned upon this question, and every effort should be made to discover the facts in connexion therewith if illegitimacy is on the increase or pre-nuptial conception is prevalent. The public have a right to know, and if a remedy can be obtained let us discover it, or else let us abandon the " busted lie " about the advantages of religious instruction in our schools and the lovely lonely tarra-diddle about the "sanctity" of the marriage ties and the purity of the shopkeepers' home. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The Church Forestalled. </para>
                <para>Now, no amount of sophistry can argue away these facts. Allowing for a slight overstating due to the' fact that a small percentage of first births are premature the figures are substantially correct, and we have to face the truth that this sacrament of holy matrimony is a sacrament to only one-half of the men and women of  all. ages throughout Australia, and that every other couple who have been blessed by the church, and had the sanction of the clergy, having previously found sufficient sanction in themselves, and have only thought of the rights of the clergy as a concession to a conventional code of morality which they have already violated. The proportion who have violated the convention during their most impressionable years of innocence is anywhere between nine to one at seventeen years, to an average at twenty of a little over two to one, tending to even up at about twenty-four and twenty-five. </para>
                <para>Primal Instincts. </para>
                <para>It is not much avail to attempt to draw inferences from these figures. It should be sufficient to state them to show to the world the rottenness of the pretence upon which our matrimonial system is based, and the total inadequacy of the churches and extra moral teachers to war against the primal instincts. Nor can any comfort be derived from the fact that there is a lack of moral teaching in the schools, because these figures include New South Wales and Queensland, where the Bible has played a prominent part in the school curriculum for some time. We have simply to recognise the failure, and admit that the attempt of the  19th  and 20th century to regulate sex relations has been a complete and egregious failure. The figures do not reveal the true inwards of the case, as they take cognisance only of those cases in which conception has followed on intercourse ; but this aspect of the case is one about which of necessity there can be no satisfactory data. However, such as they are, they stand as a cenotaph of the failure of civilization to regulate or control the vital relations of men and women, and it behoves us to give up canting about our morality and social purity, and the sanctity of the  marriage  tie, and give the truth a chance in the interests of public decency. </para>
                <para class="block">These extracts are from the accredited organ of the Labour party in Victoria ; and I say that the letter read by the honorable member for Bass, as worthy of banishment from this House, bears no comparison to the article I have read. In that article there is decried a great social institution which makes for the probity and advantage of any nation - marriage, and the sanctity of the marriage tie. From either the honorable member for Brisbane, or the honorable member for Barrier, I heard just now a sort of "'Hear, hear." I do not know whether the honorable member for Barrier approves of the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call;</inline> but I should say that, in his heart, he believes that a newspaper of that sort should not be allowed to be filed in the Library. I ask the honorable member whether he approves of such an article? </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to refer to the matter of the testing of permitted explosives which was discussed by the honorable member for Hunter. The honorable member said that permitted explosives are most extensively used in the Newcastle district, but that may not be always the case. No doubt they will be largely used at some future date in all of the States. In the district I represent coal-mining is carried on at Lithgow, Cullen Bullen and Portland. In many mines the explosives are used in crossing faults. Without a testing station in the Commonwealth the inspection of permitted explosives is very largely a farce. I have some experience of this matter, because I worked in gassy mines in the Old Country before coming to Australia. A mining' inspector in the Old Country is at liberty at any time to take a sample from a canister of explosives that are being used, take it away and test it. In the Old Country the testing is carried out under conditions such as would exist in a gassy mine, or in a mine in which there was a great deal of coal-dust. Without such a. test Government inspection of permitted explosives must be more or less farcical. Many people labour under a delusion in regard to the testing of explosives. They are under the impression that the test is as- to the explosive power, whereas the test, as a matter of fact, is to discover the amount of fire that would be given off by an explosive when it explodes. It has been said that this is a State matter, and I am inclined to believe that this is more of a State matter than a Commonwealth matter. However, it would be a very expensive business for the New South Wales Government to erect a testing station for the purpose of testing explosives used in the western, northern, and southern mining' districts. The whole matter requires to be gone into very fully, and as constitutional difficulties might arise it would be a good plan if the Prime Minister would consult with the State Governments and see whether they could not come to an honorable understanding in regard to this matter. </para>

                        <para>- This is not a matter to joke about as it may affect life and limb. The lives of 800 or 900 men may be dependent upon the use of these explosives. I do not see why the Commonwealth and State Governments should not come to some mutual understanding before a testing station is established. If the Commonwealth Government were to establish a testing station and explosives could be imported ' without having to go through that station we should have achieved nothing. Already many accidents have occurred in this country from the use of inferior explosives. Quite recently an accident occurred in the Pelaw-Main mine, and referring to it <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edden,</inline> the New South Wales Minister for Mines, wrote the following letter which explains the matter very fully : - </para>

                    <para>The recent occurrence at Pelaw-Main Colliery, when the firing of a shot with the permitted explosive,  "Arkite,"  caused the ignition of gas, and subsequently of the coal, and a serious calamity was narrowly averted, raised once more the question of the necessity for establishing an Australian testing station for explosives. </para>
                    <para>In England all explosives for use in coal mines are tested in such an establishment, under  conditions  Jas to the presence of explosive gas, coal-dust, sc.), similar to those that would be met with in dangerous mines, and as a result of their capacity for withstanding these tests there are a number of so-called permitted explosives, which are supposed to be safe when fired in the presence of fire-damp, coal-dust, ftc. However, although these permitted explosives are popularly supposed to be incapable of igniting mixtures of fire-damp - air or coal-dust, as a matter of fact, none of them can be regarded as absolutely safe in that respect, and the most that can be said is that by their use the danger of explosion is reduced to a minimum. </para>
                    <para>There is a possibility of some of these permitted explosives deteriorating, and becoming unsafe if stored for long periods, and it would therefore be an advantage if they could be tested at intervals. Moreover, there is a possibility of explosives being manufactured in the State; the manufacture of one. known as " Westonite." was, in fact, started by a company near Maitland, but owing to there being no testing station in Australia, it became necessary to forward a parcel of it, at considerable expense, to England, in order that it might be tested by the British authorities. </para>
                    <para>If an Australian testing station were established. New South Wales would be the most suitable location for it, because in this State not only are the coal-fields of much greater extent than in any of the others, but the dangers of working them are more pronounced, by reason of the occurrence of fire-damp. However, as all the States would be more or less interested in it, the establishment of a testing station would seem to properly come within the province of the Federal Government, and I observe that the Prime Minister has stated that he will favorably consider the advisability of undertaking it. In the event, however, of his deciding not to carry cut the proposal, it is my intention to ask the Premier to provide the necessary funds for the establishment of a testing station  under  the auspices oi the State Government. </para>

                <para class="block">That letter puts the matter very clearly. The question is one, the importance of which is not confined to the working of coal mines, because many accidents have occurred in quarries and railway cuttings in New South Wales from the use of explosives. Only a very short time ago three or four men lost their lives by a premature explosion in a big quarry in the electorate of the honorable member for Illawarra. The reason for that accident was never satisfactorily solved. If a testing station were established, these explosives could be submitted to other than an analytical test. At the present time our mining inspectors who are able men can take samples of any explosive found in a mine to the laboratory and test them there. But they cannot tell their explosive force or the effect they will have when used for mining purposes, nor can they determine whether or not they will emit fire. All these things it is necessary to know. In my own electorate there is a large number of railway workers, amongst whom there have been fatal accidents from time to time - a satisfactory explanation for which has not been forthcoming. Sometimes they have been attributed to faulty fuse, and on other occasions to faulty detonators. But nobody has been able to say definitely whether or not the explosive used was satisfactory. If a testing station is established, it should be located at our Cordite Works at Maribyrnong. Our own cordite could then be tested. Unless an honorable understanding, however, be arrived at with the States, a most contradictory situation will be created. If a testing station be established by the Commonwealth, all explosives should be subjected to a test, irrespective of whether they be locally manufactured or imported from abroad. </para>

                        <para>- Probably. I remember being in the Cessnock district, at Weston, some twelve months ago. Large works have been established there, and two or three samples of explosives have been despatched to the Old Country for the purpose of being tested. These tests have not proved quite satisfactory. But, seeing that sometimes twelve months have elapsed before the explosives were tested in England, the result is not surprising. It is possible that they may have deteriorated in the interim. If explosives could be manufactured at Weston, I believe their price would be reduced by2½d. per lb. That is a big item to a working miner. The Government should look into this matter carefully, as the establishment of a testing station within the Commonwealth would result in great benefit by reason of the explosives being manufactured locally. I think it is to the interests of every State that proper explosives should be used, even in metalliferous mines. </para>

The position which we have reached in connexion with our system of compulsory training is surely a very peculiar one. To the accompaniment of the plaudits of this House, and the approval of the country, we passed a Universal Compulsory Training Bill. Before the system has become really operative, it has broken down by reason of a decision of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Can we have a greater break-down of the system than is reported in the newspapers of this morning? They record the fact that a boy was brought before the Court for not putting in the necessary number of drills. The magistrate inquired of the officer, " What am I to do with him ? '" The officer replied, " Fine him, " and asked for the imposition of a penalty of £5. Thereupon the magistrate asked, " What is the use of doing that, seeing that we cannot enforce it ? " The officer replied, " Fine him <inline font-style="italic">£5,</inline> anyhow." It will be seen, therefore, that military officers are haling lads before the Court, and asking magistrates to fine them, knowing full well that the proceeding is an absolute farce, because the penalty cannot be enforced. </para>

Before our defence system has got thoroughly into operation we have hauled down the flag of compulsory training so that to-day the whole thing is regarded as a farce. I do not. say that the training is a farce, but when a magistrate tells a military officer that it is idle to fine a cadet who has failed to put in the statutory number of drills it must be recognised that the system has utterly broken down. There is not a cadet who does not know that we cannot enforce any penalty which may be inflicted. </para>

                        <para>- The lads should not be dragged into the Police Court, and the farce of a trial and fining gone through, when all concerned know that the whole of the proceedings are farcical. It is wrong to fine a parent, who really cannot afford to pay, because his boy refuses to attend drills. The system, however, is provided for on our statute-book. We have in force a compulsory training system in connexion with which officers from day to day bring boys before the Court for failing to attend the requisite number of drills. The boys stand outside the Court joking at the whole procedure, and when they are called before the magistrate, the absurdity of the whole arrangement is pointed out. The officer, however, says, " Impose a fine of <inline font-style="italic">£5"</inline> The defence of Australia is costing £5,000,000, so that one-fourth of the entire expenditure of the Commonwealth is really on its trial. </para>

                        <para>- I think I am correct in saying that not one-half of it is on the Navy. Our defence expenditure per head of the population is, with the exception of that of Great Britain, the heaviest in the world. We are depending almost entirely on our system of compulsory training, and that system is ridiculed from one end of Australia to the other, and, indeed, wherever it is considered outside. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government are going to have a compulsory system, let them be honest and say so. Do not repeat the farce of dragging boys before the Police Court day after day, of  having their names recorded on the charge sheet as defaulters, and of imposing penalties, when the boys themselves know that the penalties cannot be recovered. I do not think it is possible to find, in the history of any compulsory system, whether it be of defence or education, a case in which, whilst the pretence of compulsion is retained, the power to enforce is either abolished or withheld. I ask the Committee, in all seriousness, to consider the ' position of our compulsory training system. It cannot be allowed to continue as it is. </para>

The Government are doing more to destroy discipline, and to take away the credit of the defence system, by the utter absurdity of the procedure they have adopted, than by. anything else that is obtaining in connexion with the Defence Act to-day. Whilst we have this pretence of compulsory training, we find that the boy who attends drill is in exactly the same position as the boy who does not. From a return that I obtained a few days ago, I learned that, of the many, hundreds or thousands who had been fined, only eleven parents had actually paid the fines imposed. </para>

                        <para>- It is, if the remaining thousands are to be allowed to escape. Cannot honorable members recognise the absurdity of asking the magistrates to impose fines, when every one knows that there is no power to enforce the punishment? The practice is really bringing the whole military system of Australia into disrepute; and if it were not for the enormous cost that our defence system involves, the people might be inclined to regard it as a joke. But when we know that we are spending over , £5,000,000 a year on our defence system, and that our land defences are based on this compulsory training system, we ought not to allow the contemptible position of affairs that has arisen to remain a minute longer than we can possibly help. </para>
