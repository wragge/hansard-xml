          <para>- A little while ago, when the Prime Minister moved to take for the discussion of Government measures the time formerly allotted to private member&#39;s business, I opposed the motion for reasons that I then stated, and said that I should vote against it; but, as the debate lasted through the afternoon and into the evening, the division was taken whenI was absent. I. have since discovered that, although I did not vote, and intended to vote against the motion, I was paired as voting for it. I have seen the Whips on both sides, and learn that it was the Opposition Whip who recorded my vote in the pair-book. No doubt the mistake was made inadvertently, but I feel it my duty to- draw attention to the error. </para>

          <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. When I came to read my <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs, I found that I had somewhat tangled my speech, and had not been as clear and definite as I should have liked. Under the circumstances, I can quite understand the honorable member attaching a wrong meaning to my words, and he does not appear to yet have got the  Tight  impression. I thought the Commissioners ought to take notice of the objections made by the majority of New South Wales, members in this Chamber - not by the majority of the members, but only the majority of the New South Wales members who voted against the distribution. </para>

It was pointed out that there had been neglect to consider community of interest and so forth in the distribution of the electorates, and I expected to see, not a new distribution, but an amended one.

              <para>- I take it that the honorable member refers to the case where an Area Officer acted as solicitor and secured costs. The honorable member for Cook has also asked some questions in relation to this matter, and his inquiries and replies are amongst the papers. The Minister of Defence has made inquiries, and, as the report of the officer responsible was not considered satisfactory, he has been requested to refund the costs to the paymaster in New South Wales. Recently, several honorable members have asked questions in relation to pensions for the Naval and Military Forces, and some slight exception was taken to my suggestion that they should look up the Act for themselves. I have now the desired information to the effect that no pensions are provided for any service under the Commonwealth. &#34;Active service&#34; is defined by the Defence Act as &#34; service in or with a force which is engaged in operations against the enemy, and includes any naval or military service in time of war.&#34; Section 57 of the Defence Act reads - </para>

The Premier of Queensland sent a telegram on Friday, but it was not replied to until last evening. If honorable members will look at the printed correspondence which has been laid before Parliament, they will see that the negotiations between this Government and that of Queensland were practically completed by the Premier&#39;s telegram of the 5th instant. On the 6th instant, he wired raising new issues. That telegram has been replied to. I shall have pleasure in laying a copy of it, and the reply, on the table, so that they may be printed. According to the reported interview, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> has shifted his ground altogether ; but the original agreement will be carried out. </para>

            <para>- The question that the honorable member has put to me is partly one of law and partly one relating to trade and commerce, particularly that branch of trade and commerce that concerns itself with the business side of newspapers. With the business side of newspapers I regret I am entirely unfamiliar. I understand, however, that it is the practice of the. press to know no party so far as advertisements are concerned, but to insist on its pound of flesh with all that enthusiasm and. vigour which characterizes its business policy. On the question of law I may venture to speak with some greater assurance. I know of no law passed&#39; by this Parliament that in any way limits the freedom of the press to say  what  it pleases. So. far as I know, a newspaper, according to the law, may do exactly as any citizen may do - it may say what it pleases, but must put&#39; up with the consequences of what it. says. A printer, publisher, editor, or writer, unless his liability is restricted by Statute, is, and always has been, liable for anything he may publish of a libellous nature-. All that this Parliament has done is to provide that the person who writes an article in relation to an election after the issue of the writ shall put his name to it. That does not increase the liability of a newspaper, but merely enables  people  to know who writes an article. </para>

I should like the Minister to make inquiries as to why a final reply to my letter has not been, sent, in view of the fact that this matter has been delayed so long. </para>

          <para>- 1 desire to ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General a further question relating to the electrical engineering staff. On a previous occasion I asked whether thetemporary employes in New South Wales, who were subsequently placed on the permanent list, would have the period of their temporary employment considered iri connexion with their annual leave, and theannual leave reckoned upon that basis. I was informed that that would be done, but have since learned that it is not being carried out at present. Will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General request his colleague to look into the matter and ascertain  why  the promise has not been fulfilled. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member was good enough to inform me yesterday that he intended to ask this question. I had the Government Statist and the Chief Electoral Officer in my office this morning, and, as the result of their deliberate and special consultation,I have obtained the following reply :  - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is now alleged by the Government of New South Wales that the figures supplied by their officers to the Commonwealth Statistician as migration out of the State, and at first stated to be correct after the question of their accuracy had been raised, are really incorrect. </para>
          <para>It is understood that this alleged inaccuracy is accepted by the Victorian Statistician, and the basis of the conclusion of the State Statisticians is expected to be submitted to &#39;the Commonwealth Statistician for his consideration. Pending the receipt of this a definite answer cannot be given ; but it is understood that </para>
          <para class="block">Victoria is prepared to admit a very considerable reduction in the estimate of its population, and New South Wales will receive a correspondingly large increase. Inasmuch as a large proportion of the border migration is adult, this will materially affect the voting numbers. </para>

            <para>- It will be remembered that the honorable member for Capricornia a little while ago adopted a course similar to that just followed by the honorable member for Richmond when, in asking a question, he refused to obey the call of the Chair to order. He persisted in putting his question whilst I was on my feet calling him to order. The honorable member for Richmond deliberately followed the same course. He saw me on my feet, turned from me and, instead of obeying my repeated call to order, went on with the statement that he wished to make.  His  action constitutes one of the gravest offences, for if an honorable member is to be permitted to disregard the Chair, all authority in the House must cease. In the circumstances, therefore, I ask the Prime Minister to take the necessary step, as he did in the case of the honorable member for Capricornia. </para>

Order must be maintained, and, so far as I am concerned, it will be maintained. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the explanation of the honorable member for Richmond. </para>

But, as when you rose you did not ask me to resume my seat, I assumed that your appeal for order had nothing whatever to do with myself. I had not the slightest intention of disobeying you, or disregarding your authority, in any way. If you had asked me to resume my seat, I would have immediately obeyed you. </para>

            <para>- I assure the honorable member that if I could conscientiously accept his statement I would willingly do so. But the remark to which he called attention was made alongside me. It is impossible for me to maintain order and to uphold the dignity of the Chamber, and my own self-respect, if I am to sit here and allow such statements concerning myself to pass unchallenged. I am in the hands of the House. If I do wrong, the House can deal with me. Indeed, it can, on a specific motion, go so far as to remove me from the Chair. I thought that the incident of yesterday was closed.  I  regret very much that  I  have had to take the course which I have taken, but, in the circumstances, I cannot possibly withdraw the statement which I have made. The statement was made that an attempt was being made to muzzle the House. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Franklin was not here, and knows nothing at all about it. He must not interject. I regret very much that I have to take such an undignified course. There seems to be a desire on the part of some honorable members to make a disturbance in this matter. I regret very much the disturbance that occurred yesterday, but I must protect myself. Under the circumstances the whole matter must drop. </para>

              <para>-  Or of Estimates, a member may not refer to any matter which is directly or indirectly the subject of a motion on the notice-paper? If that be the rule of Parliament, it is possible for a Government supporter, or for any member, to prevent the discussion of Government appointments, or of any act of administration, by putting on the notice-paper a motion having reference to it. Surely no standing order can go so far as that. Because notice has been given of a motion asking for a Select Committee to inquire into a certain matter, are we now precluded from dealing with a subject only indirectly referred to? </para>

              <para>- Other honorable members have raised distinct points. I have ruled that the honorable member for Perth cannot anticipate the discussion of notice of motion No. 14. He said that he wished to discuss the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> and that motion proposes an inquiry into the appointment. I feel, therefore, that what the honorable member for Perth wishes to say would be in anticipation of the discussion of the motion on the notice-paper.

            <para>. - Some time ago, when the Prime Minister was representing the PostmasterGeneral, who was indisposed at the time, I inquired whether the temporary employes in the Sydney Post Office, and particularly those engaged in the Mechanical Branch, would have their temporary service reckoned when arrangements for annual leave were being made. I was assured that that service would be reckoned, but I am informed now that that has not been done, and that advantage is being taken of an award concerning the employes of this branch of the Department to deprive them of holidays which, I understand from the Prime Minister, they would receive. Many of the temporary employes have, as a matter of fact, been appointed to the permanent staff ; but, because they have not been in the latter position for twelve months, they are not allowed any holidays. This is held to be very unjust; and, after the definite promise of the Minister, these men feel that they are suffering under a distinct breach of faith. I do not know whether the Minister himself is responsible, or whether officers of the Department have taken upon themselves to disregard his recommendation ; but it is of the highest importance that all promises of this nature should be respected. It may be, perhaps, that the Minister has not power to regulate matters of the kind ; but he ought to have ascertained that before he gave the definite reply, for which he must take all responsibility. A Minister ought not to endeavour to hide himself behind officers who are under his instructions ; and this, so far as I can learn, appears to be the fact in this case. However, there is no doubt that these public servants have a legitimate grievance, and their case ought to be looked into and adjusted. We ought to promote, by every legitimate means in our power, good feelirig amongst the officers of the various Departments, and encourage them in every way to perform their duties efficiently and loyally. When little matters of the kind to which I have referred are neglected or overlooked - when promises are disregarded or deliberately broken - the elements of discontent are introduced. These matters may appear small to Ministers and heads, but they are of considerable importance to the employes themselves; and it is not surprising that, under such circumstances, there should spring up feelings of resentment, which develop to such an extent as to interfere with the effectiveness of the services rendered. I am loth to occupy the time of the House, but this is the only opportunity now presented, and I make no apology for bringing this matter forward. I do not know who is representing the Postmaster-General, and my previous inquiries were directed to the Prime Minister. It was to the latter gentleman that I was addressing myself a few moments ago, but he has disappeared. I can only hope that the Honorary Minister will make a note of what I have said, and that some attempt will be made to do justice to those men, who have, as a matter of fact, given over twelve months&#39; continuous service, and whose annual leave should be calculated accordingly. </para>

            <para>. - This is the only occasion now afforded to bring under the notice of the House and the country important questions which need ventilation. Under our present system, the Estimates are rushed through in an allnight sitting, which practically prevents all discussion ; and, as private members&#39; day has disappeared, the present, and certainly the least desirable, opportunity has to be seized. Honorable members on the mainland, with means of communication by rail and splendid lines of steamers on the coast, cannot realize the position of the people in Tasmania, who are altogether dependent on anything- but efficient seacarriage. The Government had a splendid opportunity to remove existing difficulties when arranging the mail contract; but that business was very sadly bungled. This did not arise from want of proper representation, because Tasmanian members on both sides of this House, and also of the Senate, interviewed the Minister and urged&#39; the desirability of not doing exactly what the Government have done; Under a mail contract there are ways in which, not only a State, but Australia as a whole, can be very materially assisted. Oh previous occasions I have pointed out the serious deficiencies in the means of communication between Queensland and Tasmania. Queensland, as the most northern State, is the best market in Australia for Tasmania, while Tasmania, to the extent of its population, is the largest consumer of Queensland produce; and there is every reason why there should be a direct service between the two States. Quite recently, one firm alone in Tasmania guaranteed to ship 30,000 cases of fruit and jam every fortnight if a direct service were provided. At present all cargo has to be transhipped at Sydney, with the attendant risks and cost. As a matter of fact, this transhipment means, I believe, doubling the freight; and there is no doubt that direct communication would enormously increase the mutual exchange of commodities. As to the mail contract, the conditions in the winter, so far as the <inline font-style="italic">Rotoma- hana</inline> is concerned, are no better than they were twenty-five years ago. That steamer is unsuited for the Tamar River, and has to transfer her passengers to the deck of a small boat ; and the plight of the women and children, especially in the winter, may be imagined. At present the Government are paying a subsidy of , &#163;13,000, and the shipping companies offered, for an additional , &#163;2,000, to place a second <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> in commission. </para>

            <para>-There were no unreasonable conditions. The north-west coast of Tasmania is now one of the most prosperous and important portions of the Commonwealth, and the shipping companies offered, in consideration of the increased subsidy, to run a second <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> to Burnie and Launceston, by varied routes, five days a week. This, of course, would prove an enormous advantage to the north west coast, and greatly increase the traffic between the mainland and Tasmania. However, the Government, for the sake of a paltry &#163;2,000, rejected the shipping company&#39;s offer. I have always maintained that there is a disastrous shipping combine on the coast of Australia. The Union Steam-ship Company and the Huddart Parker Company both run vessels to Tasmania, but they charge the same fares and freights, and act practically as one combination. A deputation of the representatives of Tasmania, sitting on both sides of the House, waited on the Minister and urged that a joint contract should not be accepted. The Government, however, refused our representations, and have accepted a joint tender from the two companies. If there is anything that iscalculated to bolster up a combine, and prevent fair competition, it is the acceptance of such a tender. </para>

              <para>- Would the Commonwealth Government allow a shipping company to dictate to them in a matter of this sort? Had the Government shown a little more backbone we should have secured&#39; a better service. But so long as the shipping companies knew that&#39; the Government were not in earnest in the matter, and that they had only to present a joint tender to secure its acceptance, what else could be expected from them? The Government should have said that they would not allow any private company to dictate to the Commonwealth the terms of such a contract. There is absolutely no justification for the extension of the existing contract for a further period of two years. The Government were warned by all the representatives of Tasmania that the present service was unsatisfactory, and that, beyond the provision of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana,</inline> no attempt had been made to meet the growing requirements of the passenger and goods traffic between the mainland and Tasmania. We pointed out that so far as the <inline font-style="italic">Rotomahana</inline> is concerned no improvements had been made for the last twenty-five years, and that there was existing, in connexion with the whole service, a state of affairs that should not be tolerated in connexion with a Government contract. The offer made by the Union Steam-ship Company was an exceedingly fair one. It undertook for an increased subsidy of &#163;2,000 a a year to place on the line a second vessel of the type of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana;</inline> to give a five days a week service each way between Launceston and Melbourne; a two days a week service direct between Burnie and this port, and an alternate service <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Launceston, which would have been of enormous advantage to the people of Tasmania. That improved service could have been secured by increasing the subsidy from&#163;13,000 to &#163;15,000 a year. The Government, however, refused the offer, and allowed things to drift until, at last, they had to accept a joint tender. </para>

              <para>- The Minister can see my facts in the correspondence tabled, as I did. The offer made by the company is in the file of papers laid on the table, and the production of which it took us some months to secure. I perused the offer only yesterday, and I repeat that the Government allowed every opportunity to pass. The only reason I can give for their stupendous blunder is that they desired to make the service as unpopular as possible, so that they would be able to come along later with a proposal for a line of State-owned steamers. If that is the object they have in view they are going the right way to achieve it because one section of the existing service is very unsatisfactory. Rather than expend an additional sum of  &#163;2,000  a year they turned down one of the most liberal offers ever made in connexion with a Commonwealth mail service. The <inline font-style="italic">Loongana.</inline> with her three boilers going, does  17  knots an hour, and under four boilers she can do  21  knots an hour. She is fast, clean, well officered, well-manned, and well managed, and the Government could have secured for the service a second vessel of that type by increasing the subsidy from  , &#163;13,000  to  &#163;15,000  a year. I regret that they did not act upon the advice given by the representatives of Tasmania in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Surely this is not a party question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who was acting for the Postmaster-General, appeared tobe quite in sympathy with the views expressed by the deputation of repre sentatives of Tasmania which waited upon him; but, for some unexplained reason, the Government have deliberately accepted a joint tender for the continuation of the contract on the existing terms for another two years. During the winter season we have often to travel between Melbourne and Tasmania by a steamer that was running twenty-five years ago. and which cannot go up to the Launceston wharf. As a matter of fact, passengers travelling by her have to be transhipped into a small river boat some distance down the Tamar. When that steamer is running the mail service is delayed week after week. All these facts were put before the Government. In the winter season this steamer often arrives in the Tamar too late to catch the Hobart express, and the mails for the whole of Tasmania are consequently hung; up. Another request made by us was that instead of letters being carried between Hobart and Sydney under the poundage system a small mail contract should be entered into for a- direct service. The tradein certain produce between Tasmania and* Sydney is as large as that between any other Australian port. When I speak of Sydney I include Tasmania&#39;s trade in Queensland. Every ton of potatoes, jam, timber, and other commodities from Tasmania intended for delivery in Queensland has to be transhipped at Sydney. We asked that a small mail contract should be entered into for. a direct service between Hobart and Sydney, so that the Government could determine the time of arrival and departure and do something to accelerate the speed of the service. That request was also turned down, although it was made in ample time to permit of the Government securing the conditions for which we asked. We were much surprised to find that, although the disabilities under which Tasmania has suffered in this regard had been fully explained, the Government had renewed the existing contract for a further term of two years. We shall have to wait for another two years, or until there comes into office another Government that will deal justly with Tasmania. </para>

              <para>- I repeat that the Government have not dealt justly with us The people of the north-west coast and particularly theresidents of Burme have suffered a very grave injustice owing to the rejection of the Union Steam-ship Com- pany&#39;s  offer. Burnie is the nearest port to the mainland, and if the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah,</inline> the old boat now trading between Melbourne and Burnie, were replaced, as was proposed, bv a vessel of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> type the passenger traffic would enormously increase. These maritime matters are not of much concern to the people of the mainland, where, with one exception, the State capitals are connected by rail, but they are of vital importance to Tasmania. As an island State, its communication with the remaining States of the Union must be by water, and the offer to provide a vastly improved service for an additional &#163;2,000 should have been accepted without the slightest hesitation. The Government by rejecting it have done an incalculable injustice to the people of Tasmania, and it is one that will be resented by them at the first opportunity. </para>

              <para>- It was suggested that there .was a Jarrah Combine. The mills which are held by the Millar Brothers are not mentioned in the list which I have read at all. The former are established on old leases, such as the Jarrahdale, Canning, and Mornington mills, the M. C. Davis&#39; concessions at the Leeuwin, and the Kirrup concessions and leases. The mills mentioned in the list I have given are being worked upon permits. It is quite clear, therefore, that there cannot be a Jarrah Combine, and it was grossly unfair of the Minister to attempt to mislead the House in- the way that he did, especially in view of the fact that this information was available to him in a Government document. His statements are calculated to do great injury to the jarrah industry. For example, he said that the industry was dying owing to the fact that white ants preferred jarrah to any other timber. That was a most damaging statement to make. In  1909  the value of the jarrah exported was  &#163;833,710;  in  1910,  it was  &#163;918,311;  in 1911,  &#163;913&#62;84i;  and in  1912, ,&#163;997,994-  Taking the year  1909  as the standard, the total increase in the three years following was  &#163;328,916;  and yet, by way of explanation for the use of karri, we are told that the jarrah timber trade is dying out. I always look for a motive when extraordinary statements of this kind are made, and I want to know why an absolutely inaccurate representation has been put forward in connexion with this matter? </para>

              <para>- Yes. The Minister stated that  9-ft.  sleepers were used on the Pennsylvania line; but when I travelled over that railway I took photographs and measured the sleepers, which are only  8  ft.  6  in. long on those portions of the line over which the fastest traffic passes. On the Canadian Pacific railway line the sleepers are of all lengths, ranging from  8  feet to  8  ft. <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> in., but there are no  9-ft.  sleepers. The railway authorities have more sense than to use longer sleepers, because when a sleeper is too long it becomes hollow, and is the worst you can put into a road. </para>

              <para>- Then the engineer ought to be dealt with. In Victoria, on railways constructed on the 5 -ft. 3-in. gauge, 8-ft. sleepers are being used by the thousand, and they are quite long enough. In South Australia, on the 5-f.t. 3-in . gauge lines, the standard length of sleeper has been 8 ft. 6 in. Thus, it will be seen that if 8-ft. 6-in. sleepers are sufficiently long for use in connexion with lines carrying very heavy traffic in South Australia, they should be long enough on a 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. line. I have here a very valuable report dealing with the different methods of treatment of timber throughout the world. The different sizes of sleepers treated by different processes are mentioned ; but in no case is a 9-ft. sleeper referred to, and the longest sleeper used on a 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge railway is 8 ft. 6 in. </para>

              <para>- I say it is not. For many years the standard length of sleepers in Western Australia on railways of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge was 7 feet. The South Australian Government adopted sleepers of 6-ft. 6-in. lengths on their railways of similar gauge; and Western Australia altered her standard length to 6 ft. 6 in. That is in the country where the timber grows. If a sleeper is too long, it becomes hollow, and tightens the gauge. Honorable members may see thousands of discarded sleepers lying alongside the Victorian railways, and they will find that nearly all of them are hollow. </para>

              <para>- The only places where 9 feet sleepers are used is on railways of 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, where they have put in brackets round the curves. In these cases they require a longer sleeper. It has been stated that it is not intended to ballast the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line, but it will have to be ballasted. I do not say that where the line passes through sandy country bottom ballast will be required, but unless top ballast is put down so much sand will be thrown up that the gear of the engines and rolling stock will be cut to pieces. In gravelly country, perhaps, trains may be run through without ballast on the line for years, but the rest of the line will have to be ballasted. If 8 feet sleepers are used instead of 9 feet sleepers, the cost of the line will be reduced by from &#163;170,000 to &#163;200,000, and I claim that what has proved good enough in other parts of the world should be good enough for us. I cannot understand why we should use longer lengths than are employed elsewhere, seeing that we have the best of all timber for sleepers and use a bigger sleeper so far as width is concerned. There is no comparison between jarrah and pine for sleeper purposes. Another element of expense has not been mentioned, namely, the cost of handling. The 9 feet sleepers will weigh 2 cwt. each, and we are told that plate-laying machines are to be employed. I contend that it will not be practicable to work such machines, seeing that they are made to handle only very light pine sleepers, which may be thrown about anyhow. </para>

          <para>We have heard a great deal about these treatment processes, and the time they occupy. I find that in the case of green timber the boiling in hot preservative occupies from eight to ten hours, and the bathing in cold preservative eight to sixteen hours, the total time occupied being from sixteen to twenty hours. We shall have to use green timber, because no appreciable quantity of seasoned timber will be available, and honorable members may calculate how long it will take to treat 200,000 tons of timber. In , the case of seasoned timber the boiling in hot preservative occupies from three to six hours, and the bathing in cold preservative four to eight hours, or a total of fourteen hours. With this process, it is possible to impregnate only certain classes of wood even under pressure. It isnot proposed totreat our sleepers under pressure, and it is questionable whether these.  processes will be applicable to the hardest timber in the world such as we shall have to deal with.

The first is the statement contained in a publication which is put before us by the Minister of Home Affairs every two months, that he has purchased four locomotives from the New South Wales Government for this job at  &#163;1,000  each. Reverting to the locomotives purchased from the New South Wales Government for  &#163;1,000  each, I would remind the House that that Government is at its wits&#39; end to obtain locomotives for the traffic of its own railways, and, I believe, is importing engines as well as making all it can. What are we likely to do with four old engines that the New South Wales Government is willing to get rid of? If I had an enemy who was going to build a railway, I would like to make him a present of these locomotives, and compel him to use them ; it would be the worst turn I could do him. </para>

It would be impossible to purchase secondhand an engine good enough for the work that has to be done in the construction of the trans-Australian railway for less than 50 per cent, more than I gave, because the gauge is to be 4 ft. in., and very heavy loads will have to be drawn. </para>

          <para>Some time ago, the Minister for Home Affairs promised that he would adopt the centre safety coupling for the rolling-stock to be used on this line ; but tenders have been cai led for waggons framed for outside buffers. If these waggons are built in accordance with the drawings, it will be impossible to equip them with centre buffers. Only yesterday, or the day before, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> mentioned that a man was injured in passing between the buffers of some vehicles he was coupling, and many accidents occur in that way. But on the thousands of miles of railway in Canada, there is not one vehicle with outside buffers, and there is, therefore, no dangerous dodging between buffers, to couple and uncouple. We are starting with a clean sheet, and are in a position to adopt the best style of construction. I would not hesitate about adopting centre buffers. I saw vehicles, equipped with centre buffers and couplings, being coupled and uncoupled when trains were being put on to pontoons, and it was evident that the process is quite a simple one. Every railway in the States was required to adopt this coupling by a certain date. </para>

              <para>- I thought so, too; but I have seen the design, and it provides for outside buffers. In the- interests of the men who will have to handle our trains, I ask honorable members opposite, who have more influence with the Minister than we have, to get him to carry out his promise.  1  have also seen the plans of some hopper waggons. I believe that some of these waggons have been delivered Their design is a very funny one, though the arrangement will be a costly one for the Commonwealth. A small boy drawing a picture on a slate might show a waggon with a hook sticking out at the end, but that is an absurd design to follow for real waggons. In this case, however, the coupling hook is bolted to the outside. There is no through gear, and no cradle; the draw comes on the outside buffer. </para>

              <para>- They are not strong enough for a perambulator. With the best gear obtainable, I have had seven headstocks out in one day on a grade. What would be the result when reliance was placed on an outside coupling? Any one in my employment who adopted such an arrangement would not be there long. A number of muck waggons, side-tip and end-tip, are being built in Sydney to be sent to Port Augusta; but usually, when a contractor has finished work in one State, and wishes to remove his plant to another, he burns the woodwork of his waggons, and carries only the ironwork and frames with him. </para>

The strangest part of the business is that hitherto Australian hardwood has been found good enough for tip- work waggons, but these were built of  Oregon;  and when the first broke down, they were never tried again. Further, these waggons have been built 7 ft. 9 in. high. </para>

              <para>- I do not know&#39;. We must not blame the contractor, who has no  power to design, but only to construct. Of the platelayers&#39; trolleys, the first one smashed up, and the platelayers&#39; tools that were sent round could not be used, and. with the other gear, are in the store yet. I am told that the purchase of this obsolete plant was a Godsend to those who had it to dispose of. Then the points and crossings are of the oldest type in existence; and it would be interesting to know who fathered them on the Commonwealth. We are starting with a clean slate, and from the first I have contended that the best machinery and appliances are not too good for us, and must always prove the cheapest in the long run. A Government can surely always afford to buy new gear of the best ; and, in any case, when we have done, it could be sold, half-worn out, to the poor contractors. The most astonishing piece of plant is, perhaps, that which is known by the name of the steam navvy, and I am informed that it is commonly spoken of in the West as &#34; Deane&#39;s Folly.&#34; This machine has been constructed to run on rollers instead of on rails, and as there is no power strong enough to move it through the sand, it is lying there, half buried, as a roost for cormorants and seagulls. I do not know what to say of an engineer who would purchase a supposed steam shovel that does not run on rails, and then try to pull it, with its 9-in. wheels, through the sand. In America, a company called for competitive ideas for navigating a canal; and, at a Board meeting, they received a suggestion that, as nearly all the freight came into the town* and only empty barges returned, the best idea would be to raise the canal by 17 feet at the other end. The directors were just about to adopt this amazing suggestion when a little red-headed director, who, as a rule, was taken little notice of, pointed out in a small voice that there was great likelihood, if the canal were raised as suggested, of the water, as well as the barges, coming to town. It would appear as though there were some equally eminent engineers in the employ of the Commonwealth. A steam navvy should be constructed to run on rails of the same gauge as the railway, and not, as in the present case, on the natural surface of the ground, especially in view of the fact that the natural surface is sand. It has been said that there are a number of people who, had they been brought up as farmers, would plant their seed with a gimlet; and a representative of New South Wales hassuggested that, in view of our experience, the Commonwealth will require a whole shipload of &#34;gimlets&#34; before this work is finished. This steam navvy has 9-in. wheels and 12 -in. wheels. </para>

              <para>- As I have said, as a roost for cormorants and seagulls; so that the Minister of Home Affairs has &#39;now several more &#34; roosters* &#34; in his Department, though slightly differing from the usual breed. It is said that this steam navvy cost the Government about ,&#163;1,500. 1 wish to see this railway pushed to completion; and I hope that the Government will secure the best possible appliances. Instead of a steam navvy, as in this instance, with a J-yard dipper, there should be one with dippers of not less than- 2 yards. When I started railway works I commenced with 2-yard plant and finished up with 4-yard plant; and if I started again I should secure a plant of still larger capacity. </para>

            <para>.- I listened with pleasure to the speech delivered this morning by the honorable member for Fremantle, and feel that unless the statements made by the honorable member in regard to the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway can be refuted by the Minister of Home Affairs, an immediate and thorough inquiry should be held. It is well-known that the honorable member for Fremantle is a man of wide experience in railway construction, and in view of the big railway undertakings before the Commonwealth, it is well that we should have such a man in the House. I do not think that the Minister of Home Affairs is to blame for what has occurred. He has to depend upon his officers, and I am convinced that if he found, on inquiry, that the statements made this morning by the honorable member for Fremantle could be substantiated, he would not allow trie officer responsible to remain in the Service another day. The Minister has no axe to grind. He is acting in what he believes to be the best interests of the people, and  the position is the same in regard to the honorable member for Fremantle. It can never be said of this Parliament that any of its members have made money out of it. </para>

              <para>- They certainly were not rich men. We are indebted to the honorable member for Fremantle for the information he has given us regarding the powellising process - information which must convince the House that the system is altogether too costly for us to adopt. No better timber for sleepers can be found than that which is. available in Australia. We have large supplies of jarrah in Western Australia, and millions of good red-gum sleepers can still be obtained at very small cost in South Australia. If the Minister thinks that an  8  ft.  6  in. sleeper is sufficient for the purposes of the transcontinental railway, I am sure that he will not use a 9 feet sleeper, because he desires to avoid waste. No country has better timber supplies than has Australia, and no country has abused its timber resources more than we have done. I agree with the honorable member for Fremantle that only the best locomotives should be used in connexion with this railway. We have been told, however, that the Government have purchased four locomotives at a cost of about &#163;4,700. I should imagine that one thoroughly good up-to-date locomotive would be worth that amount, and the honorable member for Fremantle has told us that he paid as much as &#163;4,000 for one delivered in Western Australia. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member has told us that the steam shovel which has been ordered will weigh 20 tons, and such a shovel could not be taken through sand, or used in any part of the district of Port Augusta. The waggons built to suit that shovel will, I believe, remain idle. The Minister of Home Affairs issues every month a very valuable digest of the works that his Department has in hand. The publication is a most useful one, and the honorable gentleman&#39;s name will always be associated with it. It shows that he is not ashamed of the work that his Department is doing. I find by reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Digest</inline> that the steam shovel cost &#163;1,219,and that an order was given for it some months ago. </para>

I shall be pleased if the Minister early next week places before the House a full statement in reply to the charges made by the honorable member for Fremantle in the able speech that he delivered this morning. The building of this transcontinental railway is one of the most important undertakings that the Commonwealth has ever entered upon, and I hope that this matter will not be allowed to rest where it is. We have in the House experts in nearly every branch of industry, and if the Government would only be guided bytheir advice, they would save many thousands of pounds. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to certain matters relating to the Naval Board. We are endeavouring to build up a Navy which we hope will be able to hold its own against the navies of the world, and, in doing so, we should consider our men just as much as, if not more than, the men of other navies are considered. Our Naval Forces have been strengthened by the importation of a number of men, and rightly so, I believe, because Australia has not that experience of naval matte&#39;s which other countries have had. The Minister has imported a number of non-commissioned officers, and I should have been glad had he gone further, and had imported other officers. The Naval Board have just dealt with the question of allowances, which is a matter of importance to the men of all ranks. The pay of a soldier or sailor is made up of, not only wages, but allowances. For instance, men who have perfected themselves in certain branches receive a special allowance, whilst a lodging allowance and other special payments are also made. The consolidated pay thus obtained represents the actual wages of the men. I find, however, that the Naval Board have issued a regulation under which certain men will receive a. lodging allowance, while others will not. Inquiries I have made show that the imported men, and also some of the men on the Australian coast, are receiving this allowance.  1  understand that men appointed to the <inline font-style="italic">Tingara</inline> receive a lodging allowance, whereas those who are appointed to other vessels do not. Is it any wonder that the men complain of this unequal treatment? I have always maintained that the Minister of Defence should hold a seat in this House. </para>

              <para>- I admit that, and the Honorary Minister knows that I am not making any attack upon him. When we ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a question to any matter, we cannot obtain a direct reply. I do not upbraid him for that, because he is not responsible for the administration of the Department. It is, perhaps, unfortunate that so many of my constituents are interested in the working of that Department, because I confess that, in season and out of season, I am obliged to harass it, with a view to securing redress of their wrongs. At the same time, I am free to confess that 50 per cent. of the complaints which I receive are not in the nature of legitimate grievances, and, consequently, I do not bring them under the notice of the Minister. If I cannot get a satisfactory reply from the Minister of Defence, I shall have to ask the Prime Minister whether he thinks it is fair that the Naval Board should be permitted to select men to whom extra emoluments in the way of lodging allowances are granted. Under the existing practice, some petty officers are granted a lodging allowance of 2s. per day, while other men of the same rank are denied it. I know that it is difficult to draw a line between commissioned and non-commissioned officers; but if a warrant officer is to receive different treatment from a petty officer, some reason should be assigned for it. My trouble is that I cannot get the Defence Department to assign any reason why these fine distinctions are drawn. I think that these men have a grievance which is worthy of our consideration. When the new regulations were framed a short time ago, the men who could not avail themselves of certain conditions were granted a clothing allowance, which they received for a period of two months. At the end of that time the Naval Board pretended to discover that certain warrant officers who had received the allowance ought not to have done so, because they were commissioned officers. I have no hesitation in saying that they were not commissioned officers. All my life I have been associated with, military affairs, and it is idle to tell me that a warrant officer is a commissioned officer, and no order or regulation framed by the Naval Board can make him one. If I knew why these distinctions are drawn possibly I might be satisfied ; but the Department refuses to assign any reason for them, and, naturally, there is a bit of a turmoil amongst the men who are affected. Representing them, as I do, I am abundantly justified in ventilating these two grievances. On my list I have another 107 complaints, but I do not intend to discuss them now, because I have no desire to occupy too much time. What I would really like is the appointment of&#34; a Board to inquire into these complaints. There is nothing so confusing to a service, and nothing which makes so much for inefficiency, as for its members to feel that the Department is making fish of one and flesh of another. If something be not done to improve the existing condition of affairs, I shall avail myself of afurther opportunity of ventilating this matter in the House. </para>

              <para>- I shall be glad to allow the Minister an opportunity to make these statements. Charges have been made, and until they are disproved they must be accepted as true. So far, the only denial of those charges has come by way of interjection from certain honorable members opposite. If the accusations are not refuted they will have a very serious effect on the Labour party at the forthcoming elections. </para>

              <para>- Some time ago a promise was made by the Government that the trucks required in the construction of this transcontinental line should be built with centre automatic couplings, because that is the most approved system, and the one which is least dangerous to the workmen. The honorable member for Fremantle has charged the Government with ignoring that promise, and with having had plans drafted for the construction of those trucks - plans which provide for the double system. The Minister of Home Affairs appears to know nothing whatever about it. Still another charge by the honorable member for Fremantle is that the design of the truckswhich are to be used for carrying the material for earthworks provides for such high trucks that it will be practically impossible for the workmen to shovel the material intothem. Until a satisfactory reply is forthcoming, we must consider that those charges are well founded. I wish now to ventilate another matter of an entirely different character. It has reference to a gentleman who has to pay taxation under our Land Tax Assessment Act. I have the whole of the correspondence here, and it discloses that the Department has taken up an eminently unfair position towards this individual, whose case is typical of many others. The first intimation which he received from the Department was on the 1st May, when he was: informed that his assessment had been increased from &#163;8,189 to &#163;9,35 I.

            <para>I have yours of 8th inst., stating that if I consider the assessment excessive I can lodge an objection, and that my representations will be fully investigated. Unless I know how the assessment is arrived at, it is obvious that I am unable to represent where I consider it inaccurate. What I desire is some means of checking the departmental valuations. It is possible that an error has been made on either side, and without lodging an official objection I should like some means of ascertaining the accuracy of the assessment. </para>

          <para class="block">This was a case in which quite a number of different properties were involved.If there had been only one property, it would have been a different matter, because the owner would then know where the increased assessment applied. But where a number of properties are involved, and the owner does not know of the cases in which the assessment has been increased, he cannot possibly deal with them.  I  find that property owners are not entitled, to information by means of which they can check departmental valuations. The plans referred to were brought up by the officer from the Department, and later on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stribling</inline> had thrown upon him the responsibility for any errors that might appear in them.

          <para class="block">There is the refutation of the charge made by the Department, and yet nothing in the nature of an apology was forthcoming, and I consider that throughout the attitude of the departmental officers was so unfair that they should be called to account. Altogether the case wears an ugly complexion. I maintain that property owners who make returns, and disclose all particulars so far as they know them, should be treated with fairness and consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stribling</inline> fulfilled his part of the contract as required by law ; but, for some reasons best known to themselves, the departmental officers materially increased the assessment, and then refused to give the taxpayer the information necessary to enable him to check their assessments. They said that they would consider any representations that might be made, but there is nothing to indicate that they ever fulfilled this promise. I desire, in the strongest way, to protest against what I conceive to be a grievous wrong. I have to make another complaint of a totally different character. This has reference to a postal contract which was&#39; cancelled, and in connexion with which the contractor complains that the Department have involved him in a loss of &#163;200. I do not know anything of the merits of the case, but I can vouch for some of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson,</inline> who was the contractor for the construction of the line of railway between Wallan and Seymour, which will probably be in my electorate after the next election. For a number of years <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson</inline> has been doing the class of work in respect to which his contract was cancelled, and he states that he has never previously had any complaint made against him. The contract was cancelled before any opportunity was afforded to him to make an explanation in regard to his position. I am not prepared to say whether he is right or wrong ; but I submit that, in all cases where there are disputes, the whole position should be inquired into before extreme action is taken. The correspondence seems to indicate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson</inline> is justified in <inline font-style="italic">asking</inline> for an opportunity to put his case fairly and squarely before the Department, in order that justice may be done. All we ask is that every individual shall have fair play. His complaint is that the delays which led to the cancellation of his contract arose through the failure of the Department to supply materials within a reasonable time. He states that he has been put to the loss of&#163;200. That is the gravamen of the charge, which I consider sufficiently important to ventilate here, especially as it is stated in writing that, so far as the Department is concerned, the matter is closed. I bring it before the House in order that the mistake made may be corrected by the Minister. </para>

              <para>- In New South Wales we looked upon Mr: McKay as one of the best public servants we had. Although I have had a lot of bother in connexion with the tax, the officials of the Department have been most courteous, and I recognise that the trouble is due largely to the Act. They are doing all they can to minimize difficulties, and I should be wanting in fair play if I did not acknowledge that, especially as I have known so long the gentleman who presides over the Department. He is one of the best public servants in the Commonwealth. I have a word or two to say regarding the administration of the Post Office. My complaint is that the country mails are carried too slowly. Why cannot they be carried by motor car, instead of by coach, and horses? We are told that the expense would be too heavy; but if expense is to be the only consideration, the mails will be carried by bullock dray, because that would be a cheaper conveyance than the coach. The mails should go at least as fast as ordinary travellers; but now a commercial travel ler may arrive in a town in my district at midday, and have to wait until midnight for his invoices and advices. In districts like Eden-Monaro, where there are not many railways, some effort should be made to improve the mail service, and I urge the Postmaster- General  to do something in this direction. My main grievance concerns the administration of the Federal Capital Territory. I shall not go back to the manoeuvring which occurred in connexion with the choosing of the site, because that is ancient history, and the matter is now settled ; my complaint regards the present administration. The men who live in the Territory are without representation in Parliament, being in the unique position of having to pay taxation without being allowed a voice in the expenditure of the money raised. </para>

              <para>- They are voteless, and the honorable member would be one of the first to stand up for them, as he did for his own people the other day when he thought that he would have to represent Echuca. Those to whom 1 refer are not getting fair play. The Minister wishes to be a czar, and to do everything himself ; but, in my opinion, we need a different system of administration. At present no one seems responsible for anything. There is an Administrator, but no salary has been provided for the office, and it is filled by the Secretary to the Department, who has no real power. We need Home Rule there. Everything should not be governed from Melbourne. What is being done is not for a week or a month, but for all time, and the expenditure of hundreds now will affect the expenditure of millions later. According to the Department, a railway from Canberra to Jervis Bay will cost about , &#163;1,200,000, but no one seems to be responsible for determining the direct route that should be followed. There are good officers in the Federal Capital Territory - the Administrator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener, Mr. Hill, Colonel Owen,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oakeshott,</inline> men whose names stand high, and in whom the public have confidence; but they are shackled, and have no real power. What is the Minister going to do in the matter of administration, and in regard to the resumption of land? Quite a number of persons have received notice that after a certain date they will be called upon to pay rent for their land. They have been asked to furnish valuations of it, but when they ask the Minister what valuation he puts on it, they cannot get any information. They are to be charged rent on an unknown valuation. I understand that the owner of Acton was offered about half what he asked, but, being a man of money, he was able to fight, and brought a case in Court at Sydney. Barristers were employed, and about twenty witnesses were summoned from Queanbeyan, when the Minister settled the case. The settlement should have been effected before the case went to the Court. How could an unfortunate selector or small landowner holding 200 or 300 acres fight the Government in regard to its resumption? It is all very well to say, &#34; Go to the High Court,&#34; but the honorable member for Riverina knows what the expense is. 1 would find it cheaper to give my coat to the man who tried to claim it from me than defend my possession at law, and many cannot afford to fight on principle. Why does not the Minister say what he proposes to pay for these properties? I know that there is an Act requiring him to give the value of the land in 1908. That Act was passed so that land-owners in the Territory could not compel the payment of unearned increment created by the expenditure of the Commonwealth. But since then there has been a great increase in values all over Australia, and it is questionable if it was intended that the land-holders in the Federal Territory should be deprived of that increase. I think that that view will be generally admitted as a reasonable one. These persons have no right to be penalized. Does not the Minister think that they should receive same of the increase which has come about in the general advance in values, not, of course, any increase due to the expenditure of the Department? Furthermore, it is customary when resuming property to add 10 per cent. to the valuation as compensation for dispossession. These persons are entitled to some such consideration,, and the people of Australia can afford to treat them fairly. We can afford to give them a square deal. Although the Minister wishes to be a czar, I believe that he is a fair man, and if he settled this matter himself would treat these persons fairly. He should either create a tribunal for the settlement of their claims, or deal with them himself, and not leave it to the High Court, which is too expensive. It is complained that he has even resumed the church and surrounding graveyard. Does he propose to pull down the building and tear up the graves? If is an old historic church, on the old-fashioned plan, and with God&#39;s acre surrounding it, and it would be an act of desecration to disturb the graves of persons whose relatives live close by. Why has the Minister permitted this act of sacrilege? He could have, easily said that the holders of the church property would have to accept the same title as all other land-holders in the Territory. The other day I was asked by residents in the Territory to move the adjournment of the House to discuss their grievances, but when I told the Minister what I thought of doing, he protested that a day could not be spared at this stage of the session, and 1 courteously gave way. I hope that the honorable gentleman will show these people some consideration in return for the consideration that I have shown him. Will he inform me why  Colonel Miller  has not been properly  appointed as Administrator, and given real power? Will he tell me, also, whether the Capital is to be administered from Melbourne, or on the spot. Then, is the tenure to be freehold or leasehold, and what is to be the name of the Capital ? </para>

              <para>- No; 1 think it should be leasehold, but the matter should be settled without doubt by Parliament, and those holding land there should know whether they are to have perpetual leases, ninety-nine-year leases, cr twenty-one-year leas.es. Is there to be a periodical valuation of the land? The people living in the Territory should know. Then what name is to be given to the Capital? I understand that the Minister proposes to call it Shakspeare or Captain Cook. If he does, Parliament and the people will censure him. </para>

              <para>- I do nob think the Minister is correct. It has been &#39; announced that the Government are going to take a certain area at once and the balance later on; and it is only fair that the occupiers both inside and outside that area should be informed what value the Government place on their land. As it is, the Minister is promoting a sort of lottery or gamble, &#39;because the man who can find out the Government value is placed in a position of advantage. The occupiers have no security of tenure, and, as a matter of fact, I think it would pay the Minister to take the whole lot of the Territory, as men in temporary possession are not likely to make much improvement, and their position is a very unsatisfactory one. </para>

              <para>- Only at the good-will of the Minister, who, apparently, as in the case of the Northern Territory, is going to administer the lands by means of Ordinances, and not under law. The Minister, I believe, will act fairly and reasonably, but the people in the Territory do not know him as well as I do, and as their homes and their all are at stake they naturally, prefer to have some guarantee in black and white; besides, the Minister is not permanent, and another Minister may come along with very different views. I should like to draw attention to the case of an unfortunate mailman who runs into the Territory, and  who has asked permission to put up a tent in which to shelter during a few hours wait that he has. </para>

              <para>- Quite so; and, I thought that the mailman&#39;s request was sure to be granted ; but the Minister has replied that he cannot allow any temporary occupation. At present, the Minister has only&#163;100,000 at his disposal, but the expenditure now means the expenditure of millions hereafter; and I think the House ought to be able to exercise some check or control. We have been promised a direct railway <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Bungendore and Braidwood from the Capital Site to Jervis Bay, but nothing has as yet been done in this direction. No doubt, as I say, the Minister means well ; but I am not prepared to give him full liberty during recess, unless he takes us into his confidence, and makes some statement now. </para>

              <para>- Apparently the Minister wishes to arrogate the whole power to himself, and be a regular, blooming czar. A church and ground have been resumed ; andI think that was a mistake without fair notification of the intention of the Government. I know that the Minister has tried to do his best, and I do not wish to move the adjournment of the House, but if he does not take us into his confidence now, I shall feel myself compelled to take that step. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Fremantle has simply repeated the old worn-out story about karri and jarrah. About a week ago the engineers in Western Australia sent me over several specimens of karri, which are now on the table, and some of which have been treated for six years. We never claimed anything beyond the six years&#39; test, and the best engineers in Western Australia lay it down that there is no wood that contains such magnetic power to hold a dogspike as treated karri. It is remarkable that in the twentieth century we should have it contended that it is impossible to do anything that our great grandfathers did notdo; but it is that retrograde spirit that has stood in the way of all Governments and business in Australasia. George Washington never rode in a railway carriage, and nobody dreamt of the electric light until Edison&#39;s marvellous discovery a few years ago. The phrases of to-day are the platitudes of tomorrow ; and it requites some man of courage to make a move. In my opinion, this treated karri will outlive every man in this House, and, perhaps, his children, too.- </para>

              <para>- It is a wonderful test. If a man can stay under water for six years he will stay there for ever. The Government bought four locomotives from New South Wales; and the trouble is that the honorable member for Fremantle, like the flying apostle in ancient Egyptian history, has only a superficial grip of the question. In New South Wales the grade is 1 in 30 to1 in 50, whereas in Western Australia it is only 1 in 80, or practically level ; and when we have a level road we can hitch the engine on, and pull to Hades or Purgatory unless the couplings break. </para>

              <para>- These engines are not old, and are quite perfect for the work in Western Australia; indeed, they were good for heavy work in New South Wales, even on the mountains. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> under my direction, had them thoroughly tested, and to have bought similar engines new, and equally adapted to the work, would have cost us from three to four thousand each. I have always been a very successful man in the management of my  own  affairs. Though I found the Home Affairs Department in a state of business chaos, and immediately introduced a modern system of Digests which enabled the supplying of bimonthly schedules to all the members of Parliament, and contained all the information relating to works, &#38;c, yet I seem not to be able to satisfy any one in this House. My successor will find the Department in a high state of economic efficiency. </para>

The honorable member for Fremantle had a lot to say in regard to a steam shovel ordered for use in connexion with the transcontinental railway, and which he declared we had put aside, because it would not work.  His  statement rather surprised me, because the machine is one of the best that could be obtained.

Before I appointed him as Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth Railways, I made inquiries all over Australasia, and found that he was generally admitted to be one of the ablest and most up-to-date engineers in Australia. He visited America in 1904; and has made two trips all over the world in the study of his profession. As Engineer-in-Chief, he  has a free hand in regard to all these matters, save where I think that I am more up-to-date than he is. I am an experienced organizer. </para>

Leaving the question of the transcontinental railway, I wish now to reply to some statements made by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, for whose business sagacity and judgment I have the keenest admiration. No one could be more careful than he was as a Minister in safeguarding the public funds and conserving the interests of the people. A Minister, whether he be a Liberal, a Labour man, or a Conservative, is, after all, a responsible public trustee, and cannot play with other people&#39;s money as he would with his own. I take no chances with the money of the people, but in days gone by I did not hesitate at a financial &#34;flyer&#34; when I was handling my own money. </para>

I hope, on the 15th March, or perhaps before that date, to have the opening ceremony.

              <para>- I have no hesitation. There is in the Territory a Vigilance Committee which has practically decided to take this business out of the hands of the Minister. It decides what is to be asked for these properties, and wishes to tell the Minister what he must pay for them&#39;. These people seem to have got it into their heads that we ought to pay abnormal prices - that the Government is a sort of philanthropic institution, and should pay whatever they ask. I would not do that even for my own father. </para>

              <para>- Yes. But we are not going to pay for the increased value of the land since 1908. I would remind honorable membersthat we have constructed in the Territory the finest system of roads in the world, and this has materially assisted towards indirectly creating the increment. </para>

              <para>- The taxpayers of Australia have created it. The honorable member will recollect that in 1901 I submitted a motion to this House which affirmed that the fee-simple of the lands of the Territory should be preserved to the Commonwealth for ever, and that we should resume those lands, and let them on perpetual lease. As a matter of fact, the honorable member assisted me to  draft the motion, and he also voted for it. It would be a terrible thing for him, eleven years later, to fall from grace, and to advocate, the freehold system. </para>

              <para>- We are going to have a system of level-land premiums. We intend to have the city laid out like a chess board- As soon as the design has been accepted a start will be made to survey the Capital Site, and we shall devise a system under which the blocks of land there will be let. The compensation to be paid will be based on what those blocks would realize at public auction, and there will be a reappraisement probably at the end of twenty-one years, or some other fixed date-. At the end of that period, if the proprietor of that property and the Government cannot agree,, the Government will have to pay compensation for the improvements, and take the properties over. I trust that this explanation will be satisfactory to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, and that he will go back to the people of the Territory, and tell&#34; them that they are absolutely safe. If he looks at today&#39;s newspapers he will see that a manager has been appointed to the Commonwealth Bank at Yass-Canberra. </para>

            <para>.- I would like the Prime Minister to bring under the attention of the Minister of Defence complaints which have reached me from the parents of cadets to the effect that the boys have to travel long distances to attend drill. I asked the Minister some questions on this point, and he said boys were required under the present regulations to travel any distance up to 5 miles to attend the parade grounds or rifle ranges. Several fathers have represented to me that, whilst they have no objection to compulsory military training, they consider it very hard that the boys should&#39; have to travel 5 miles, or, if they are conveyed to the parade grounds or rifle ranges, pay their own expenses. One father told me that he had to pay is. per week in this direction. If we desire to secure, the hearty support of parents in connexion with our compulsory system of military training, we ought to make their obligations as light as possible. Many fathers approve of the system of military training, because they think it does the boys good, but they consider they are subjected to unnecessary hardship under present conditions. We shall have to deal with a sufficient number of problems in connexion with compulsory military training at the next election, and any objections that may be fairly removed! by administration should be disposed of. With reference to compensation to members of the Citizen Forces who may meet with accidents in the execution of their duty, I desire to point out that the present position is unsatisfactory. &#39;When the Bill dealing with compensation to Commonwealth workmen was before us, I suggested that provision should be made for members of our Citizen Forces as well as for members of the Commonwealth Public Service, and the Minister then said that the matter was otherwise dealt with. Of course, it is otherwise dealt with by regulation. </para>

              <para>- Yes. But he was a medical officer, and the compensation he received was very small. He had to employ a <inline font-style="italic">locum tenens</inline> at a cost of &#163;110, and lost his practice for three months, and yet he received only &#163;30 by way of compensation. Thus he has been subjected to serious loss, and I would ask the Minister to look upon this as a typical case of hardship and make liberal provision for compensation. </para>

          <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. As honorable members will see, this Bill is intended to amend the Act of 1908-9. When we initiated the Old-age Pensions Act, we began in a comparatively small way, but we have since advanced in a satisfactory manner, so far as the accomplishment of the wishes of the advocates of the principle are concerned. In the Act of 1908-9, we made important amendments in the way of liberalizing the law, and the amendments now proposed are in the same direction. If honorable members will look at clause 2, they will see that it deals with a difficulty that has arisen in administration in regard to contributions by relatives to recipients of old-age pensions. As a rule, these contributions are very spasmodic, and sometimes they are embarrassing to persons of tender conscience, especially to widows, who consider that if they are receiving contributions from members of their&#39; families, they are not entitled to the old-age pensions. </para>

              <para>- As the law stands, if a contribution is made to a widow by the eldest member of the family, no matter how greatly in need a family may be, she cannot obtain a pension. It is not expected that this provision will materially add to the amount of money paid away in the form of pensions, but it is anticipated that it will afford relief to a very deserving class of persons. It is proposed to add to the list of exemptions provided for in the principal Act anything received &#34; by way of gift 01 allowance from a son, daughter, step-son, stepdaughter, grandson or grand-daughter.&#34; </para>

              <para>- That can be considered in Committee. Another point dealt with in clause 3 is the omission of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> and the proviso from sub-section 1 of section 16. This relates to the payment of pensions to persons who are naturalized. We have from time to time broadened the provisions of the law relating to aliens who have been good citizens, and who, apart from the question of naturalization, ha.ve been fully qualified to receive pensions. We propose with regard to aliens, who would otherwise be qualified by residence to receive the pension, to recognise their claims to the pension immediately upon their taking out naturalization papers. At present a naturalized citizen cannot receive a pension until three years after naturalization, and we consider that aliens who become naturalized should not be subjected to the bar now imposed. We have communicated with the consuls of foreign countries, and have asked them to inform their people who were likely to become eligible for pensions as to the provisions of the law in regard to naturalization, but very few persons have availed themselves qf the opportunities offered, and although fully qualified in every other respect have been unable to claim the pension because of their failure to take out naturalization papers. We propose to get over this difficulty by widening the provisions of the law as I have indicated. No doubt arguments may be used against this proposal, and it may be said that if a person comes here and accepts the protection of our laws, he or she should become naturalized, and assume the full responsibilities of citizenship ; but I think it is preferable to take the more generous view we are now adopting. In regard to the amendment proposed in clause 4, I would point out that for nearly three years the Treasurer has been taking the responsibility of paying pensions to blind persons without the direct authority of Parliament. The money has been paid out of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance Account, and the appropriations have been certified to by the Auditor-General. Although this action has not been&#39; in conflict with the law, because Parliament has voted the money with a full knowledge of the purposes to which it has been devoted, it is deemed desirable to make provision for the payment of pensions to persons who are blind, although they may not be invalids under the law as it now stands. I doubt very much whether it would be wise to bring blind people within the category of invalids.  1  certainly would not advocate it, becauseI hold that it is better for the community and for the blind persons themselves that they should be trained to work at some occupation, and earn something towards their support. But it is proposed to make statutory provision under which pensions may be paid to them in order to supplement the wages they receive. We propose to insert the following provision -  &#34; 20A. Subject to this Act, every permanently blind persun above the age of sixteen years who is not qualified under section twenty to receive an invalid pension and who is not receiving an old-age pension shall, whilst in Australia, be qualified to receive an invalid pension.&#34; </para>

              <para>- The degree of blindness will be determined by experts. If persons have to associate with blind people, or to be trained as blind people are trained, they will be eligible for the pension. That is the way in which the law is now being administered. The point I wish to emphasize is chat it is not to be assumed that blind per sons are to receive pensions if they are capable of doing work.

          <para class="block">It may he suggested that this provision is unnecessary because the Commonwealth intends to examine medically and otherwise all persons intending to emigrate from other countries to Australia; but, on consideration, honorable members will see that a family may desire to come here, most of whose members are sound in constitution, one alone being weakly, and we may prefer to have that. family, notwithstanding that one of its members would be, for some reason, an undesirable citizen. Under this provision a child who is under the age of three years when brought to Australia, and is afflicted with a congenital defect rendering him permanently incapacitated or blind, will be eligible, on reaching the age of sixteen, to an invalid pension; but a child so afflicted brought here over the age of three years will not be eligible in later life to a pension, the responsibility for his support remaining with his parents. The term of three years has been fixed because it should be possible, when a child has reached that age, to determine easily whether he will or will not be invalided. for life. Section 23 of the principal Act is to be amended so that if a claimant resides at a place remote from any duly qualified medical practitioner the Commissioner may dispense with the medical certificate. That is necessary in a vast country like Australia, where medical men are not always procurable, and is merely an administrative amendment. </para>

The majority of the members of the medical profession give their best attention to the examination of persons claiming pensions, but errors have been made, some doctors being too strict and others too lax.

              <para>- Quite so. Blindness is not a physical infirmity in the ordinary sense of the term. A blind person, like a deaf person, is usually able to do something for himself j and the desire is to see that the blind make a reasonable effort to earn their living, and to assist them in every possible way to that end. </para>

              <para>- Of course, there may be a difference of opinion as to the proposed amendment. By an amendment of section 27 it is proposed to remove the word &#34; indictable,&#34; and also the provision for five years&#39; imprisonment, and to provide instead that offences may be tried summarily, and that the penalty shall be a maximum fine of &#163;too, or imprisonment for one year. This is rather an important amendment. As the law stands at present any one charged with fraud under this Act has to be charged with an indictable offence ; but there is no desire, I am sure, to send aged people or invalids to prison for a number of years. There have been many fraudulent applications by people possessed of private means-; and my opinion is that a substantial fine would meet such cases. </para>

              <para>- Yes.. In one case an old lady between seventy and eighty years of age was practically convicted of having applied for a pension when she had money hidden away. It was only because ot a family quarrel that the fraud was discovered, a pension having been granted and received in the meantime; and this is the sort of case which I think would be met by a substantial fine. Nobody would have the heart to send an aged lady to gaol for a number of years; and, therefore, it is now proposed to vindicate the law by summary process with a penalty of  &#163;100,  or, as an alternative, imprisonment for a maximum term of one year.: </para>

          <para class="block">At present the Commissioner has some difficulty in this connexion, and the amendment is intended to give him wider power. Many pensioners du not draw the allowance within the prescribed period, and, at present, the forfeiture can only be waived so far as every second fortnightly instalment is concerned. The amendment will permit the Commissioner to waive the forfeiture of all the instalments. The next amendment deals with penalties, and it is proposed to provide that a maximum fine of &#163;100, or a maximum term of imprisonment of six months, shall be inflicted on any person who wilfully makes any false statement or representation to obtain a pension certificate, or pension, or any instalment of a pension, or to deceive any officer, or to affect the rate of any pension. At present it appears that it is possible, under the law, to deal only with a person who wilfully makes a false statement about a pension for which he is . a claimant, and not with any person who makes a fraudulent statement to increase a pension already granted ; and the object of the amendment is to remove this anomaly. The last amendment is in section 50, and provides that all offences against the Act shall be punishable on summary conviction. The amendments cover a very wide range, and will have farreaching effects. It is estimated that the cost thereby incurred will be from &#163;.150,000 to &#163;170,000 a year. </para>

              <para>- I presume that if the finances permitted &#39; we would gladly give a pension to every one, or, at any rate, increase the present amount, and provide for widows. That, however, is not proposed by the Bill. It is a sound principle, I submit, to leave the home entirely free, irrespective of its value; and the soundness is proved by the fact that one home does not compete with another. Those who have built up a home, and have been overtaken by misfortune, are entitled to keep that home, and live in it if they can find the means. A home is a home, whether it be a hovel or a palace, and it may be dearer </para>

          <para class="block">than life to those who have built it for themselves. Doubtless much will be said about &#34;extravagant &#34; expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions ; but I am of opinion that this money is not only well spent, but has helped to promote the prosperity of the country. Hitherto the best members of families have been called upon to contribute a most unequal proportion towards the support of aged or invalid parents and other relatives, and have thus been prevented from directing their means into productive channels. On the other hand, the ne&#39;er-do-weels of families, who take no practical interest in the welfare of those who have most claims upon them, have contributed practically nothing, leaving all to voluntary effort. Under the national scheme, each and every person Kas to contribute his portion through the general taxation. By that means we are able to make the recipients of these pensions practically independent of their relatives, and to do so more economically than is possible under any other system. It is a noteworthy fact that the money expended on these social schemes is being collected at a cost of less than 3 per cent., whilst the cost of distribution is less than 2 per cent. That being so, over 95 per cent, of the money contributed by the people of Australia for such purposes is conveyed direct to the recipients. On the other hand, the cost of management in the case of ordinary charitable institutions runs up to something like 40 per cent. Another point worthy of consideration is that the administration of the old-age pension system, as well as the payment of the maternity allowance, practically does not call upon the withdrawal of any individuals from productive industrial occupations. The number of officers in the Public Service has been increased to only a very small extent in connexion with the administration of the system, whereas many people are withdrawn from productive occupations to carry on the work of charitable societies. This extension of the system of invalid and old-age pensions will mean relief to a great number of our fellow citizens. It will me&#39;an relief for the blind and the maimed, and a larger measure of assistance to our aged poor, who will be able to retain their little homes without having any deduction made from their pensions. I commend this Bill to the House, feeling sure that it will enable many people to enjoy the closing days of their lives to a greater extent than would otherwise be possible. </para>

            <para>-- This is one of those measures which raise no general principle to be considered on the motion for the second reading. It is essentially a Committee Bill, and, speaking generally, I think that the Prime Minister was well justified in commending it to the House. Any defect in legislation such as that with which we are now dealing is bound to be discovered as the outcome of practical experience. Sometimes a clause inserted in a Bill with a view to safeguarding the public funds is found in practice to press unduly on the people, and to need amendment. That has been our experience in connexion with the invalid and oldage pensions law. One or two sections in the principal Act which are being amended by this measure were taken from State Acts, but when applied to the whole Commonwealth have been found to give rise to difficulties and to need revision. The principle of the first amendment for which this Bill provides may be briefly described. The principal Act provides for the payment of a pension under specified conditions, but declares that a deduction shall be made in respect of certain incomes received by the recipients. It is now proposed so to amend the definition of &#34; income &#34; in the original Act that a deduction shall not be made in respect of &#39;a gift or allowance received from a son, a daughter, a step-son, step-daughter, grandson, or granddaughter. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. It is intended only to cover gifts that we ought to encourage rather than discourage. Let me give an illustration of the need for such a provision as this. I know of a particularly conscientious widow who has had an exceedingly hard struggle. She took a little home for herself, paying part of the rental herself, whilst the balance was paid by a daughter who boarded with her, and whose income amounted only to a little more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per week. Other sons and daughters occasionally gave her a present of a few shillings, and all these facts she conscientiously set out in the return that she made to the pension officer. On looking at the return, the officer said, &#34;I am- sorry, madam, but I cannot grant you a full pension.&#39;.&#39; That officer properly administered the Act ; but, no doubt, if this woman&#39;s family had abstained for a week or two from giving her any money, in order that  she might claim the pension, he would have looked favorably upon her application. </para>

              <para>- I think it is well that we should legislate in this way, otherwise the door might be opened to what may well be termed a &#34; pious fraud.&#34; The children of an aged man or woman might say, &#34; We shall stop for a week or two the allowance we usually give you, so chat you will thus be entitled to receive a pension. Once you have obtained it, we will renew our allowance.&#34; I confess that when the case of this poor woman was put before me. I felt that I was in great difficulty. I could see that there was an easy way of getting behind the law. but I could not conscientiously advise the woman to adopt it. I may say that this lady, to her credit, is not drawing the full pension today. It is well that we should legislate to render it unnecessary for any one to get behind the law in the way to which I have referred, for little tricks of the kind may grow, and lead to wholesale fraud. This measure is therefore in the interests of honest administration. The second important principle with which this Bill deals relates to the question of who shall receive the benefits of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Are they to be <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> citizens of Australia, and, if so, how are they to prove that they are ? In dealing with this question in the original Act we adopted a principle that had been embodied in State legislation, although I must confess that even at the time I did not view it with much favour. The principle of the State legislation appeared to be that if a man came to Australia, and sought to obtain the benefit of the old-age pension system, he should become a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> subject of the country. Our desire was to pay these pensions to those who have resided in Australia for not Jess than twenty years, and it seems to me that any one who has lived here for twenty years, and has done solid work in the building up of the nation, has given practical proof of his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> as a citizen, and of his good-will towards Australia. I think it right hard to require that claimants shall be naturalized three years before they can receive the pension. We desire, as far as possible, to encourage those who come here to become part and parcel of our community. Under the original Act, it is provided that an applicant for a pension must be a naturalized  subject of the King, who has been naturalized for three years preceding the date of the pension claim. Under this Bill, that provision will be repealed, and a claimant who can produce his certificate of naturalization will be entitled to the full benefits enjoyed by British subjects. In this connexion I should like&#39; to refer to a difficulty, arising under section 4 of the Naturalization Act, to which I have already drawn the attention of the Minister of External Affairs. That section pro-&#39; vides that - </para>

The late Government drafted a small Bill to get over the difficulty, and I should be glad if it could be passed at an early date. </para>

              <para>- I hope that the Prime Minister will give the matter his consideration. I am sure that the House will unanimously approve of the provisions of this Bill in regard to blind persons, and also to the proposal to dispense with the necessity for producing a medical certificate where the claimant is living in a remote district. The provision in the principal Act requiring a medical examination is fraught with difficulty in such cases, &#39;because it means that a medical man has to make a long journey specially to examine an intended applicant, while the amount of remuneration given to him is purely nominal. The Government should either provide reasonable compensation for the medical man examining an applicant in such circumstances, or to dispense with the medical examination altogether. I understand that the clause dealing with this matter will be brought into operation only in extreme cases, and that where a medical certificate is not produced, strong evidence will be required from persons residing in the district as to the condition of the applicant.- </para>

              <para>- I come now to the provision relating to the homes of pensioners.At the present time a deduction is made from&#39; the pensions paid to any individual living in a home exceeding in value <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> I think that the Government is right in broadening that provision. We should encourage the home-loving and home-making instincts of the people, whereas the law at present penalizes those who have made little homes for themselves. The Act really penalizes persons who are endeavouring to build up homes of their own. Most people who acquire homes through building societies and other agencies have to make up their contributions out of their small savings. Consequently the acquisition of a home is very often the work of a lifetime. From that stand-point the proposal in this Bill is&#39; to be commended. But I would suggest to the Prime Minister that the term &#34; home &#34; - which he thinks should include household furniture - should be so defined as to make our meaning perfectly clear. Of course, nobody expects that persons living in mansions will receive the old-age pension. But, strictly speaking, the term &#34; home &#34; means the land on which a person resides, and the building in which he lives, and does not include furniture. I ask the Prime Minister to consult the draftsman of the Bill on that point. </para>

I wish now to put a case to the Prime Minister to illustrate a position which I have in my mind. Suppose a man living in the city has a villa residence and furniture which are worth &#163;800 or &#163;900. Under the Act that property would be exempt. But what is the position of a man in the country who owns 30 or 40 acres of land worth perhaps &#163;10 or &#163;12 per acre, upon which he has his home? If he is using his land for farming purposes there will be a small income from it, and a deduction will be made on that account. Will the Prime Minister exclude the whole value of his property because he happens to be in receipt of an income of 10s. per week? </para>

His pension is only a few shillings a week, and because of the deduction which has been made he has been saying hard words of Australia, and declaring that it gives him an allowance which only keeps him in tobacco. </para>

              <para>- I would suggest that the Prime Minister should work out a guiding principle as to what allowance should be made. If a man has 50 acres of land, and a portion is being used for purposes of profit, that circumstance ought not to deprive him of the right to call that part of his land on which he resides his home. </para>

              <para>- The income which this man might receive is perhaps, merely a nominal one. My contention is that persons who endeavour to build up homes in the country should be placed in as good a position as that occupied by persons who endeavour to build up homes in the city. If a man possesses property in excess of a certain value a deduction is made from his pension to the. extent of &#163;1 for every &#163;10 of value, but if he has a home it is altogether excluded from the calculation. </para>

              <para>- I know that if he hasan income of &#163;52 a year, he is excluded&#39; from obtaining a pension; but I amdealing with cases covered by the Act. I now come to another matter.  I  think it would be rather a serious matter to send old persons who havebeen guilty of making fraudulent statements to gaol. But I do not think, that we ought to allow others who may aid them to perpetuate a fraud to escapethe consequences of their acts. Whileeverybody naturally desires to be as generous as possible, there are financial limitations which must be borne in mind in administering this scheme. I presume theTreasurer is satisfied that this schemecan be financed. According to thelatest official figures available on the 30th- October last, there are 79,724 persons in. Australia who are in receipt of the oldage pensions, and 11,247 persons who arein receipt of the invalid pension, making a total of 90,971. For every 10,000 of our population we have 173 old-age pensioners and twenty-four invalid pensioners. At the end of June of the present year, the average fortnightly old-age pension amounted to 18s. 11d., and the averagefortnightly invalid pension to 19s. 5d. If this Bill be passed, we shall be pretty well up to the limit. </para>

The Minister estimates the extra amount at from &#163;150,000 to- &#163;170,000. On the whole, the measuremodifies provisions which have been found to require amendment, and does not impose an excessively heavy &#39;burden on thecommunity in addition to that which it is now bearing.

I  congratulate the Government on the liberalizing of the law that is proposed. Although it means more expense, the money will be well spent. Personally,  I  should be prepared togo further, and  I  hope that the day will soon come when the old-age and invaliditypensions system will be liberalized still more. The Prime Minister told us that the waiver clause makes conditions better than they are, but that is not my opinion. </para>

Under the Bill, if a pensioner is prevented by an accident from applying, we can waive a whole series of payments, but under the Act only every second payment can be waived.If there is any doubt about the effect of the provision we can remove it in Committee. </para>

              <para>- I  have risen to speak more on the administration of the Act, which leaves a great deal to be desired, though in saying that  I  do not reflect on any of our officers, who,  I  believe, carry out the law as they find it. To obtain an invalid pension the claimant must present the certificate of a medical man that he is permanently incapacitated, but doctors differ, and  I  know of cases in which men who will never be able to do another day&#39;s work in their lives cannot obtain invalid pensions because medical men will, not certify to their incapacity. A case  I  have in mind is that of a resident of Charleston, in New South Wales, who twenty years ago met with an accident to his back, the doctors thinking at the time that it was broken. Silver wires were inserted, and the man was able to get about supported on sticks, but he has never been able to stand upright. Until he reached the age of sixty years he did what work he could in a mine, and then, finding himself unfit for further work, applied for an invalid pension. The medical man who examined him said that he thought that he was suffering from bladder trouble, and that he could be cured if he entered a hospital, but as the applicant would not do that the doctor did not pass him. The residents of the district who know the man regard him as incapacitated, and are subscribing money to keep him. Another medical man was appealed to, but he upheld the opinion of the first.  I  said at the time that the second reference would be useless, because doctors communicate with each other by telephone, and stand by one another. Any number of medical men outside the district would certify that the man was incapacitated. The Minister or Commissioner should have power to deal with cases like that; the granting of a pension should not rest wholly on the decision of one medical man. Let me give another case. Within the last four or five months a resident of Meath applied for an invalid pension, three doctors certifying that he was permanently incapacitated, but the medical man in the district told him that he would not get a pension, and certified against him. We battled on his behalf for months, and to-day  I  got news that he passed away yesterday. He should have obtained  &#163;8  or &#163;10 in pension money, but, being unable to get it, passed his last days in very poor circumstances. He was suffering from phthisis.  I  know that there must be safeguards against imposition, but where evidence can be obtained to satisfy the Minister or the Commissioner a pension should be granted, notwithstanding the opinion of the local medical man. </para>

              <para>- To the Prime Minister, who is guided by the medical certificate.  I  speak feelingly, because  I  know the men to whom  I  have referred. A man who for twenty years crawls to his work until he can no longer continue his occupation is a deserving citizen who should receive an invalid pension. The people of the district think it a shame that this man has not received a pension. </para>

              <para>- I believe that that is so. In the other case to which I have referred, three doctors certified that the man was incapacitated, but one said that he was not, and his certificate decided the matter. In regard to the property qualification, I understand from the Prime Minister that, although it has been reduced from&#163;50 to&#163;25, the amendment makes no real difference to the position. If that is so, I am satisfied; but I would point out that at the present time every pensioner is given an allowance of &#163;50, and a reduction to &#163;25 seems a hardship. </para>

            <para>.-! recognise, not only the difficulty of the honorable member for Hunter, but the difficulty of the Prime Minister, in striking the mean between what is just to the pensioners and what is just to the public. I do not see how it is possible to ignore the medical certificate as final proof ; but in cases where there is considerable dispute, it ought to be possible to call in an outside man. On a question of capacity for work, we are practically compelled to rely on the opinions of those who should be experts. I should like to direct attention to a class of cases which are very hard, and which are not provided for under the existing law. A little while ago a man who had been permanently incapacitated in Commonwealth employment was granted an invalid pension. That pension, however, has been cancelled, on the ground that his wife has, since his incapacity, managed to get a boardinghouse together, and, by dint of hard work, is now earning more than the statutory amount allowed. It has to be remembered, however, that this woman has six children to support, though, of course, the invalid pension relieved her to some extent, so far as her husband was concerned. I suggest that in such cases there should be an allowance of, say,&#163;25 a year for each child until the age of fourteen years, before the income earned is taken into consideration; and this, I think, could be accomplished by a small amendment. </para>

              <para>-I hardly think so, and I point out that such cases can arise only in connexion with invalid pensions, and when the pensioners are comparatively young. The case I cite was not one of money put by, but money earned from day to day to the amount of some &#163;95 a year ; and it, and all similar cases, merit the sympathetic consideration of honorable members. </para>

              <para>- I simply ask the Prime Minister to look into the matter. The Bill has my full sympathy and support, particularly in that part which enables pensioners to retain their homes. We can all understand how old associations would cause old people to put up with any privation rather than part with the home in which, perhaps, they commenced their married life. I admit the difficulty in differentiating between the ownership of a home and having money in the bank; but still there must be a limit. On the whole, the Act is as liberal as the state of our finances will permit; and no one will begrudge the comparatively small amount involved by this liberalizing Bill. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister is to be congratulated on all sides on the introduction of this Bill, and on being able to find the money to extend its privileges to the old people. To most of us the Bill simply represents one more step towards the time when the care of the sick and the aged in every regard, and without limitation, will be a charge upon the finances of the country. The remarks I have to make will deal more with the sins of omission than the sins of commission. I particularly welcome, however, the provision in regard to the homes of pensioners, as one which will meet the approval of every honorable member, and secure to very many thoroughly deserving citizens relief of which they are urgently in need. But there is a class of pensioners for whom I desire to say a word. I have already spoken to the Prime Minister privately on the subject, and now desire to repeat it publicly. A large number of pensioners have no homes, and are in a much more trying situation than those who have. The rents of dwellings have risen so much in the last few years that there are very serious inroads on the small pension now paid. I know quite a number of pensioners, who, out of the 10s. a week, have to pay 5s. or 6s. for a house to live in. My point is that a house thus rented is the pensioner&#39;s home; and I desire to know whether, under this Bill, that rental could be allowed to the pensioner. </para>

              <para>- That is most unfortunate. I would not say a word to detract from the privileges that this Bill extends; but I think that the class of pensioners to whom I refer are much more necessitous, and deserving of much more consideration, than those who have homes. A pensioner who rents a house is as much entitled to an allowance as is the pensioner who has a home of his own to receive the full pension. </para>

              <para>- Unfortunately, we do. While the Government are so amending the principal Act, that the possession of a home will not militate against the obtaining of a pension, I think we ought to consider the advisableness of providing homes for pensioners who have none. In , other countries, which are not so far advanced as we are in social and humanitarian legislation, hostels - not poor houses or unions but genuine homes - are provided where old people in receipt of pensions may spend their declining days in something like reasonable comfort. The Federal pension is so small that it is swallowed up largely in the payment of rent and by expenses that do not contribute to the comfort of the pensioners in the direction we desire. </para>

              <para>- I think it is sufficient to say, in reply to the honorable member, that teetotallers are the last to need old-age pensions, and the least likely to apply for them. Old-age pensioners come mostly from that unfortunate class with which my honorable friend is asso ciated. On one other aspect of this Bill, I find myself somewhat in opposition to the honorable member for Hunter. My experience is that a Government medical officer&#39;s certificate is accepted in absolute contradiction of the weight of evidence and of the certificates of other doctors in connexion with a pension claim. I know of a man who for the last fiveyears has been unable to do a stroke of work. It is not safe to allow him to cross the street, or to stoop to pick up anything, yet to all appearances he is a. healthy, able-bodied man. But the Government medical officer, who had not seen him before, after putting a few questions to him, certified that he was quite able to work. I had no difficulty in obtaining from the doctor who had been attending this man a certificate that he was quite unfit to work, yet the certificate sent in by the Government medical officer was accepted, and this man&#39;s claim for an invalid pension was refused. My suggestion is that to meet the difficulty in such cases the applicant&#39;s last employer should be asked to make an affidavit as to his state of health. Where possible, the reasons for the man&#39;s dismissal, and the duration of his employment should also be obtained ;.. and if, in addition, the doctor attending: the applicant sent in a certificate, the Department would arrive at the facts. The powers of the Commissioner and  Deputy  Commissioners should be so extended as to enable them to exercise some discretion in such matters. As the law stands at present, they appear to have none ; it seems that they must accept the certificate of the. Government Medical Officer. In many instances, the  Deputy  Commissioner could.satisfy himself, by inquiry, that the facts alleged by the pensioner-claimant were correct, and in such cases the applicant should receive more favorable attention than he can secure at present. With the exception of these two sins of commission, I think that the provisions of this measure will be hailed with pleasure, and will provide for assistance to those who are most deserving of it. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to call the attention of the Prime Minister to&#39; a case of hardship which will serve to illustrate complaints that have been made this afternoon by one or two honorable members. Whilst a very generous movehas been made by the Government in dealing with the deductions made in respect of the homes of pensioners, no relief is given under this Bill to the larger volume of applicants for pensions who have no homes. I have to put before the right honorable gentleman the case of an aged widow, whose only means of support axe provided by her daughter. This widow lived in the country, where she had a house of her own; but as the daughter obtained -employment in Adelaide, she decided to accompany her, and had to sacrifice her home for &#163;150, which she placed to her credit in the Savings Bank. Of that amount&#163;75 represented money belonging to the daughter, and I advised the mother when she- went to town to apply for an oldage pension. She did so, but because she had . &#163;150 in the Savings Bank, a deduction of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> was made from her annual pension; so that, instead of receiving &#163;26, she received only &#163;16 per year. The cir- cumstances of this lady having been well known to me for many years, I attended with her before the  Deputy  Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner,</inline> and expressed my willingness to make an affidavitthat one-half the amount of&#163;150 was the property of the daughter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardiner</inline> said it was an exceedingly sad case, but under the law and the regulations he must make a deduction in respect of the full amount. </para>

            <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Government several matters of great importance in regard to the question of invalid and old-age pensions, but beforedoing so I wish to tender them my congratulations on the introduction of this Bill, which I feel confident will relieve a lot of the distress that now prevails. In my electorate, there are a number of blind persons who are denied the full amount of the pension. If they are in good bodily health, it has been the custom to insist that they shall go into an asylum where they may learn a trade, and, if they decline to do so, they receive only5s. or 6s. per week. </para>

              <para>- That is so. I think we all realize that the blind are not capable of earning their living, and that they, of all persons, should be entitled to receive the full pension allowance. The mere fact that a man is blind should not be used to force him to go into an institution against his will to earn a certain amount of- money. There is a blind asylum inWilliam-street, Sydney- </para>

              <para>- Certainly, if a man can do anything. But why stipulate that, unless a blind man does that which will deprive him practically of his liberty, he shall not get a pension. The pension itself is little enough, and it should not be degraded by the imposition of such a condition as that which I have mentioned. I trust that the Prime Minister will see that the persons who are suffering from this disability receive the pension without any qualification. It is degrading to compel a man or woman to enter an institution under pain of depriving him or her of the pension. </para>

              <para>- It is not right to make the payment of the pension depend upon their entrance into a benevolent institution. I know of dozens of cases of this kind. I have heard it said that when men enter these institutions they earn  16s.  per week. I have a suspicion that many persons in Sydney are induced to enter them for the purpose of assisting to maintain them. </para>

            <para>.- I wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister a matter connected with the payment of invalid pensions. Several cases have come under my notice in which the departmental doctor has declined to certify that an applicant for the pension is permanently disabled from following his occupation. The term &#34; permanently disabled &#34; is very difficult to define. I know a lad who is nineteen years of age, and who had the misfortune to fall down stairs arid injure his spine. Two medical officers certified that he would never be able towork again. But the departmental doctor declined to certify that he was permanently disabled, and inquired whether hecould not doclerical work.  His  reply was that he could not, as- he had received only a poor education. It was not until the second year after his injury that the departmental doctor would certify that the lad was permanently disabled. In another instance a man fifty-five years of age was suffering from chronic rheumatism. He visited two eminent doctors in Sydney, who certified that he was permanently incapacitated ; yet the departmental doctor declined to give a certificate to that effect. These are cases of great hardship. As soon as this Bill is passed, we shall be up against a lot of trouble. Many old-age pensioners are obliged to rent rooms, and they say that, owing to the increase in the rents charged, their pensions are very small, and that pensioners who have houses of their own are in a better position than those who have not. I know that the Prime Minister will soon be worried with a number of applications on that account. In these circumstances, I feel sure that&#39; the Government will be obliged to make provision for the payment of universal pensions. </para>

            <para>. - I am glad that this Bill has made its appearance, for one or two reasons. I am pleased to note that under it the disabilities imposed by the principal Act will be removed, and the administration of that Act will be rendered a little more just and a little more generous than it has hitherto been. I am particularly interested in one clause of this Bill. The Prime Minister will recollect that under the existing law there are cases in which men are separated from their wives, and in which, because the wife has an income, the husband <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> disqualified  from  receiving a pension. </para>

              <para>- It seems to me that in those cases the Prime Minister might very well exercise a little discretion, and make some allowance for the children whom the widow has to support. I admit that the question is a very ticklish one to deal with, because there must always be in the mind of the Minister charged with the ad- ministration of the Act the position of the widow and children who have no claim to any pension whatever. These are the hardest cases ofall. There is no more tragic form of invalidity than widowhood, where children have to be maintained. It seems to me that it will be very difficult for the Prime Minister to provide for equitable treatment in this matter. But I hope that some scheme will be devised for dealing with widows and children who are bereft of their breadwinners, and who find it difficult to make their way through our hard, competitive world. The more we legislate on these lines the more anomalies we shall create, until we establish some guiding principle which will give the people of the community the right to claim the pension under all circumstances, and without reference to benevolence or mercy. </para>

            <para>. - The clause amends the definition of the word &#34; income,&#34; by exempting what is paid to the pensioner by way of gift or allowance from son, daughter, step-son, step-daughter, grandson or granddaughter. I think that the words &#34; adopted son &#34; and &#34;adopted daughter&#34; should be added. I know of cases in which adopted children have lived on very affectionate terms with their foster parents; indeed, children aresometimes adopted in infancy, and grow to manhood without learning that their foster parents are not their real parents. The gifts of such children to their foster parents should not be regarded as income. Will the Prime Minister accept an amendment? </para>

            <para>.- As I pointed out when speaking on the second reading, there is sometimes a difference of medical opinion regarding the incapacity of a claimant for an invalid pension. The Government medical man might certify that a claimant was not incapacitated, and although three or four other doctors of equal standing would certainly say that he was, the certificate of the first doctor determines the matter. I admit the need for safeguards against imposition, but when the balance of evidence is in favour of an applicant, he should not be denied a pension because of the opinion of one medical man. In my opinion, these cases can be best dealt with by being left to the Commissioner. He could make some sort of inquiry, and, if necessary, call wit- . nesses, and if satisfied that the applicant was entitled to the pension, he should be able to grant it. I therefore move - </para>

            <para>. - I do not know if the Prime Minister can accept an amendment in this clause. It is provided that where a pensioner has accumulated property, the amount of the pension shall be subject to a reduction of &#163;1 for every complete&#163;10 by which the net capital value of the accumulated property exceeds , &#163;50. Under the New South Wales Act the deduction was made for every  &#163;15d  consequently a large number of pensioners had to accept reduced pensions when the Commonwealth passed its Old-age Pensions Act. I think that it would be fair to restore them to their original position, especially as New South Wales has the largest number of pensioners. </para>

It says to the blind man, &#34; You can enter our institution, and you will be guaranteed  16s.  a fortnight,&#34; but only 4s. is paid. There is nothing in the Bill to justify that. Will the honorable member see that blind persons are not compelled to go into this institution, and that they shall receive the full amount of the pension? </para>

            <para>. - The Government does not wish to compel any blind person to enter an institution, though had we the power I should like all blind persons to be trained for their own advantage and for the benefit of the community. If a blind person is not incapable of performing useful and remunerative work he is not entitled to a pension as if he could not earn his living. I think that blind persons should have to earn their living where they can do so, but they should be assisted in every possible way. </para>

            <para>. - I agree with the Prime Minister that blind persons should be put in the way of earning their living or of doing something for themselves, because without occupation they are apt to brood over their misfortunes, and thus to make their life&#39;s burden heavier than it need be. The Sydney institution referred to does valuable work in teaching useful trades to the blind, and helping them to cultivate their faculties, and improve their talent. I understand that any person entering that institution may obtain a pension which is supplemented by an allowance until he acquires sufficient skill in a trade to earn something on his own account. </para>

              <para>- Under the Act the blind are not entitled to pensions, though the benevolent administration of this Government has enabled them to receive pensions. The principal of one of those institutions told me that some inmates, recently admitted, were receiving pensions of  10s.  a week, and a further sum of10s. from the institution for the work which they did. Very often, when first admitted, an inmate can earn nothing ; and I wish to bear testimony to the usefulness of such institutions. There are, however, blind people in the country, so situated that they can make no use of such places, or who are so advanced in years that they cannot assimilate instruction. I should like provision to be made so that the Commissioner may exercise his judgment in the case of such persons as I have mentioned. </para>

            <para>.- By striking out the word &#34; indictable,&#34; we make it imperative that all prosecutions must be in a Court of summary jurisdiction, and for this the Prime Minister urges as a reason that it is undesirable to take aged people before the higher Court. I point out that aged people are very apt to make mistakes, and I only hope that this clause will not be used as a means to drag them, on the slightest provocation, before a magistrate - that there will be no abuse of the power thus given. If the object is to reduce the hardship that might be caused by heavy fines and punishments, I do not mind; but it is most undesirable that proceedings should be taken in any or every case of mistake. I cannot see why this change should be proposed, unless there is some reason of the kind I have suggested in the minds of the officials. It is to be hoped that this clause will not cause any change in the administration. </para>

In my constituency, there are a number of pensioners who are inmates of institutions, and amongst them a seafaring man, who, in order to get employment, has. in the past, represented himself as much younger than he really is. When the authorities found out that he was registered on ships at a certain age, he was deprived of his pension, and has been forced to become an inmate of the Liverpool Asylum. </para>

            <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This Bill proposes to amend the Judiciary Act of 1903-6 in two respects - by increasing the number of Puisne Judges from four to six, and by providing that, in matters affecting the Constitution, there shall be a majority of all the Judges in favour of the decision, and that, in every case where there is an appeal from a Justice of the High Court, or a Supreme Court, when the Justices of the High Court are divided, the judgment of the Court below shall not be disturbed. I shall deal with these matters in the order I have mentioned them. </para>
          <para>The business of the Judiciary, under a Federal form of government, differs in certain very important respects from that of the Judiciary under a Unitary form of government. In a Federal form of government - at any rate, as known in the United States, Canada, and the Commonwealth of Australia - the Judiciary not only exercises those functions usual to the Judiciary in all civilized countries where the rule of law obtains, but also acts as the guardian of the Constitution. The High Court of Australia, which is the supreme tribunal in which is vested the appellate power in respect not only to all matters affecting the Constitution, but also in cases under ordinary law, has wider functions than those exercised even by the Supreme Court of the United State of America. The High Court of Australia not only has jurisdiction as the Appellate Court in matters affecting the Constitution, or Federal matters, but it is the Supreme Court of Appeal in all matters from all Courts - it is the final Court of Appeal, subject, of course, to the right of a litigant to appeal to the King-in-Council in certain matters. The functions of the High Court, engaged as it is in appeal work, is then most important, and the business of the Judiciary demands the most persistent attention, and calls for the very highest legal training, and for men of first class intellectual calibre. The work of a High Court Justice is, in fact, the most arduous and trying of any form of judicial labour. It can only be done at all by highly-trained men with great capacity for work. </para>
          <para>The Judiciary Act, as passed by this Parliament in 1903, provided for the appointment of three Justices, &#39;but by an Amending Act, passed in 1906, the number was increased to five. It was pointed out at that time that the business of the Court had increased very largely, and that, as was undoubtedly true, the work thrown upon the individual Justices, and the Court generally, was such as to involve a strain that was becoming insupportable. Some figures were then quoted showing to what an extent the business of the Court had increased. During the last six years there has been a very marked influx of population, and there has been an increase in the work thrown upon the Judiciary in its original jurisdiction by reason of the passing of certain legislation. It is only fair to say that the number of Justices is not now sufficient for the work that the Court has to do. One Justice is almost wholly occupied in the discharge of his duties as  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the recent extension of his jurisdiction to the Public Service will add still further to the business of that tribunal. And as I have said, the original jurisdiction of the Court has also been largely increased. It occurs under the Australian Industries Preservation Act and the Customs- Act, and relates to Customs prosecutions, instances of which are the Motor Car and Fish frauds, as well as other matters of that type, Land Tax appeals, compensation cases in connexion with land acquired, and Patents and Trade Mark cases. In  1911  one case alone in the original jurisdiction occupied the attention of a Justice of the High Court for seventy-three days. </para>
          <para>The business of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is such that one Justice is almost wholly occupied in dealing with it, and when he has to leave that tribunal, as he has at the present time, in order to enable the business of the High Court to be dealt with, its work remains unfinished. That naturally involves the danger of industrial disturbances. It certainly tends to create difficulties, and to deprive organizations of the opportunity of securing the redress of their grievances in the manner for which this Parliament has provided. There are also special constitutional cases of great importance, to deal with which a Full Bench is desirable. At the present time several of these cases are pending. None can be heard, and none will be heard except by the Full Bench. Among these are the cases of the <inline font-style="italic">Engine-drivers</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Broken Hill Company; Merchant Service Guild</inline> v. the <inline font-style="italic">Steam-ship Owners,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Tramway Employes</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Tramway Trust.</inline> All these are special cases waiting to be dealt with by the Full Bench. And the Full Bench cannot be constituted without completely arresting business in the Arbitration Court. There are six cases waiting to be disposed of in Sydney, and there will probably be some <inline font-style="italic">remanets,</inline> including Benson&#39;s case, for argument before the Full Bench. Of the four constitutional cases waiting to be dealt with by the Full Bench, two have been standing over since January last. </para>
          <para>In order to give some idea of the work of the Court, it may be pointed out that the judicial year is one of  200  days, and that last year the full Court sat  161  days, in addition to the time spent by the members of the Court in travelling. I shall show the actual movements of the Court, and and shall prove that it is either sitting or travelling in order to sit, from the beginning of the judicial year to the end. </para>
          <para class="block">That the Court has been able to carry on is due to the remarkable capacity for work possessed by the Chief Justice and his colleagues. Without wishing in any way to reflect on any other Court, it is only fair to say that the High Court Justices dispose of more work than. does any other Court of its kind. But, after all, our Judges are human, and we have seen some of the consequences of their attempt to do more than men can fairly do. One of those consequences is irremediable, and this Parliament and the country has every reason to lament it. When the five Justices are working at high pressure, as they have to do, in order to dispose of the business of the Court, there is no opportunity for the hearing of full Bench cases unless the business of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is allowed to stand over. That much is clear. Now the Conciliation and Arbitration Court work cannot properly be allowed to stand over. </para>
          <para>And there is enough work, as I shall show, to keep one Justice going all the year round in that tribunal. At the present time among the plaints part heard is that of <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Tramway Employes Association</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Prahran and Malvern Tramway Trust and others.</inline> There are also a number of allied tramway cases which, as honorable members know, have been before the Court for months. Their hearing has been interrupted once. or twice - once because His Honour had to go to Perth, and for other reasons. Then there are the cases of <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Postal Electricians Union</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General ; The Post and Telegraph (General Division) of Western Australia</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General ;</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Federated Liquor Trade Employes Union of Australia</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Employers in the Brewing Industry in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland._</inline> The plaints now pending, in addition to those which are part heard, include <inline font-style="italic">The Federated Gas Employes Industrial Union</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Metropolitan Gas Company and others; Australian Institute of Marine Engineers</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">North Coast Steam Navigation Company and others;</inline> . and <inline font-style="italic">Australian Builders Labourers Federation</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Archer and others,</inline> in which there are nearly  500  respondents. Between  400  and  500  have already been served. Then there is the case of <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Telegraph Telephone Construction and Maintenance Union</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Public Service Commissioner and the Postmaster-General</inline> - a type of case that is entirely new -Australian <inline font-style="italic">Federated Theatrical Employe&#39;s Association</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Brennan&#39;s Amphitheatres and others; Federated Felt Hatting Employes Union</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Denton Hat Mills and others; Federated Tanners and Leather Dressers Employes Union</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Alderson and others; Federated Dredge Workers Union</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Burke&#39;s Hill Tin Sluicing Company and others; Australasian Institute of Marine Engineers</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand and others; Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen&#39;s Association</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Tasmania Gold Mines Limited and others; Merchant Service Guild of Australasia</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Federated Masters and Engineers Association of Australasia.</inline> The last is an appeal from the decision of the Registrar. All these cases are either pending, or part heard, and they ought certainly to be heard. But if the  President  of the Court is to be taken away from that work, to enable the Full Court to get through its ordinary business, it is obvious that the work of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court either cannot be done at all, or, if done, can only be done imperfectly. When the amending Bill of 1906 was before this House the Attorney- General of the day, now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, based his case for an increase in the strength of the High Court Bench on this very point, namely, that the work of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court had grown so much that it was practically taking up the whole of the time of one Justice. In support of that statement a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor was quoted, as may be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> of 12th July, 1906. I do not say for a moment that great stress ought to be laid on the mere increase in the number of cases. That, in itself, indicates very little. Ten cases may be disposed of in four or five days, and one case may occupy thirty days. But the number of cases set down for appeal in 1903 was two, whereas the number of cases set down for appeal in 191 2 was eightynine. In original jurisdiction in 1903 there were three cases, whereas in 19 12 there were sixty-four cases. The number of days on which the Court sat in 1903 was thirteen, whereas in 1912 it was 161. </para>

              <para>- I will, as far as possible, distinguish between the number of days on which the Full Court sat and the number of days on which the Court sat as a single Justice. I propose now to quote some figures in reference to the work of the Arbitration Court. In 1905 - which was the year preceding that in which the amending Act was passed - the number of days on which that Court sat was three; in 1906 it was twenty-one. It was in 1906 that the amending Act was passed, and the fact that the volume of business had so increased was made the basis of the argument in favour of the appointment of an additional Justice. But the rate of progress has since increased very greatly. In 1905 the Court sat on three days, in 1906 on twenty-one days, and in 19 12 on 158 days. If the circumstancethat, in 1906, the Court sat on twenty-one days was regarded as a reason why an extra Justice should be appointed - in order that one Justice might devote whatever attention was necessary to the work of the Arbitration Court - it can scarcely be contended that when a Justice sits on 158 days out of a possible 200 days in the whole judicial year, the appointment of additional Justices is not warranted. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Then, again, the ordinary work of the Court is growing, and all the Justices are kept going at top speed all the time. It must be remembered that the Justices of the High Court travel all over Australia. No other Justices do that. The Supreme Court of America does not do it. It sits in Washington only, although some of its Justices go on circuit. But here the High Court travels, not over a State, but over a continent. Let me give the itinerary of the Court for the year 1912, beginning on 19th February. The Court sat in Hobart from the 19th. to 21st February, in Melbourne from 26th February to 29th March, in Sydney from 1st April to 22nd April, in Brisbane from 29th April to 9th May, in Sydney from 13th May to 1 6th May, in Adelaide from 4th June to nth June, and in Melbourne from 13th June to 28th June. Then followed the winter vacation. The Court sat in Sydney from 29th July to 21st September, in Melbourne from 23rd September to 22nd October, in Perth from 29th October to 12th November, and it met in Sydney on 25th November, and will sit there till 21st December. It will be seen, therefore, that during the current year the Full Court sittings total 165 days out of a possible 200 days. During that period the Court has to travel to every part of the continent. </para>
          <para>For the information of honorable members, I will now give the number of sittings of the Court when single Justices were present. In 191 1 there were ninetyfour days occupied by single Justices, most of them being in connexion with the Vend case in Sydney. This year single Justices have sat on only twenty-five days, but that does not include the work of the Arbitration Court, which sat on 158 days. So that one Justice has sat 158 days this year, and some of the other Justices have sat twenty-five days in addition to the total Full Court sittings of 165 days. </para>
          <para>I come now to the position which has been created by the work of the Arbitration Court,, and by the constitutional cases, the decision of which require a Full Bench. One of the cases now before the High Court awaits re-argument before the Full Court Bench, and cannot be disposed of until the  President  of the Arbitration Court can take his seat, so as to enable the Full Bench to be constituted. Consequently, if he goes on with High Court business, the work of the Arbitration Court must stand over, and if he goes on with the work of the Arbitration Court the High Court business must stand over. </para>
          <para>I lay stress on the fact that this Parliament has approved most emphatically of the principle of arbitration. It has extended it to its public servants. Therefore it must make provision for the speedy determination of the matters which are brought before that tribunal. To delay justice is to deny it ; and in industrial matters, in particular, despatch is the essence of the contract. The work of the High Court, involving as it does an almost constant round of appeals on important questions of law, is the most arduous of all judicial work. When any Justice falls ill, or goes on leave, necessary business cannot be transacted. During this year, and on two occasions, business has been held up owing to the illness of Justices. That, of course, is quite independent of the consequences - whatever they were - of the extended leave which was granted to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor, and his application for leave was, in itself, the direct result of overwork. I say that of my own personal knowledge, because he himself told me so when he put the matter before me before asking officially for extended leave. It is not fair to ask men to do this work upon which so very much depends, and, amongst other things, upon which the very legislation of this Parliament depends, at such high pressure. We have to recollect that all day, and every day in the week excepting Saturday, theseJustices are engaged in listening to closelyreasoned arguments on matters of the firstimportance. They constitute the final Court of Appeal upon all matters in thiscountry, and they have not that relief which comes to Judges in <inline font-style="italic">nisi prius,</inline> whomay go home and need not bother themselves about the case which they are hearing till the next day. The High Court Justices -must occupy their time after theCourt has risen in looking up cases and&#39; preparing judgments. They ought to have a fair opportunity to do this if justice is not to suffer through lack of due consultation of the authorities, and calm consideration of every argument put forward. </para>
          <para>The number of Justices asked for is not too many. The State Courts are more numerous than the present High Court. The Supreme Court of New South Wales is composed of six Justices, the Supreme Court of Victoria of five Justices, and that of New Zealand of seven Justices. The High Court is the Appeal Court from all the State Courts, and it does seem an anomaly that there has to be an appeal from a Bench of sixJustices to a Bench of three Justices; and&#39; that a unanimous decision by, say, the full Supreme Court of New South Wales, consisting of six Justices, may be upset bytwo Justices of the High Court of Australia. We must assume that the recruiting ground for Justices is common to bothFederal and State Judiciaries. They are appointed from the same class of persons, and, so far as I know, there is nothing in the High Court Bench to attract a superior class of man. It may be that the honour is greater, but that is all. Certainly, the emoluments are no better. Indeed,  at  Judge is very much better off in Victoria, so far as the bread-and-butter side of this? question is concerned, than is a Justice of the High Court. I am not arguing whether that should be so or not. I merelymention it to show that we are just as: likely to get men of the first rank on the Bench of Victoria, or of any other State,, as we &#171;re on the High Court Bench. The fact then that, say, two Justices of&#34; the High Court can upset the decision of six Justices of a Supreme Court, who presumably are all men of the first class,, seems anomalous. A final Court of Appealshould not be less numerous than the? Courts appealed from. </para>
          <para> Again, since it . is thought necessary to have a Bench consisting of six Justices in New South Wales, and -of five Justices in Victoria, where the travelling is infinitesimal compared with that done by the High Court, and where the nature of the work is not anything like so strenuous, the argument in favour of appointing six Puisne Judges seems to me to be upheld. With seven Justices, it will be practicable for business of minor importance to hold two Full Court sittings at the same time in the different capitals, or to have Justices available to hear cases in original jurisdiction while the Full Court is sitting, and also while the Arbitration Court is sitting. At the present time, neither of these things is possible, and both ought to be. In 191 1, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Juslice</inline> Higgins sat in the Arbitration Court 139 days ; during the present year he has sat 158 days, and he has still some days to run. When we make allowance for the time occupied in travelling, it is perfectly clear that he cannot be available to sit upon the High Court Bench for more than twenty days. Honorable members who travel a great deal will appreciate what the travelling of that Court really means. It spends every available day during the working judicial year in travelling from one capital- to another. The Full Court sits the whole time at undue pressure, and this is aggravated by the fact that one Justice is practically not available for High Court work. He is employed all the time in the Arbitration Court. In 1906, when the Judiciary Act was amended by a Bill introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, then Attorney-General in the  Deakin Government, the cases in the Arbitration Court numbered twenty-one, but the cases this year to 9th December number 158, so that the sittings in that Court are more than seven times as many now as they, were six years ago, when the appointment of two more Justices was urged on the ground that there was. too much work for the existing Bench. Clearly it is no longer  possible to do the work of this Court without an additional Justice, while a second additional Justice is required for the ordinary work of the High Court. The present members of the Bench perform their duties under undue strain, no provision for absence through sickness or on leave being possible. The High Court is Australia&#39;s final Court of Appeal, and its Justices should have more time for the discharge of their duties and the determination of their judgments than they now have. That that </para>
          <para class="block">Court has earned the encomiums of every citizen  who  knows the need for the effective interpretation of the law is undeniable; but, despite the tremendous efforts made by the Justices to get through their work, the list shows that a number of cases have had to be held over. The following report of the Deputy-Registrar, dated  12th  December, contains the official record of the work of the Justices for the present year - </para>

            <para>The summer vacation ended on the 17th February, and the Full Court sat in Hobart on the 19th February. The sitting lasted three days. The Chief Justice and Justices Barton and Isaacs being on the Bench. Thereafter the Court came to Melbourne, and on the  26th  February, commenced a sitting which lasted until the  29th  March (25 days). The Bench being the Chief Justice and Justices Barton, Isaacs and Higgins, the lastnamed sitting only on the hearing of argument in special cases, stated by himself as  President  of the Arbitration Court in the engine-drivers&#39; and firemen&#39;s and Merchant Service Guild matters. The next sitting, which was held in Sydney, commenced on the 1st of April, and lasted sixteen days. The Bench being the Chief Justice, and Justices Barton and Isaacs. These three Justices then sat in Brisbane on the 29th  April, the sitting lasting nine days. After the Bris- bane sitting the Court, as then constituted, returned to Sydney, and sat there for four days, commencing on the 13th May. At the conclusion of this sitting, the Court came to Melbourne, and the Chief Justice and Justices Barton and Isaacs sat for nine days, commencing on the  21st  May. Following this sitting the same three Justices went to Adelaide and sat for six days, commencing on the 4th Jane. The Court then returned to Melbourne, and sat from June 13th to the 28th inclusive - twelve days. The winter vacation followed this sitting, and lasted four weeks, from the 29th June to the 27th July. </para>
            <para>After vacation, the first sitting of the Court was held in Sydney on the 20th July, and lasted forty days. During this sitting the Bench consisted of the Chief Justice and Justices Barton and O&#39;Connor, for the hearing of the  appeal  from the decision of Isaacs, J., in the Coal Vend case, and of the Chief Justice and Justices Barton and Isaacs for the balance of the sitting. On the 23rd September, the Court commenced its next Melbourne sitting, which lasted till the 22nd October,  twenty  days. The Bench consisted of the Chief Justice and Justices Barton, Isaacs, and Higgins, during the hearing&#39; of the Colonial Sugar Refining  Company&#39;s  case; and nf the first three&#39; Justices named for the balance of the sitting. After this sitting the Court, consisting of the Chief Justice and Justices Barton and Higgins, went to Perth, and commenced  a  sitting&#39; on the 29th October, which lasted for ten days. The-Chief Justice and Justice Barton then returned to Melbourne (Justice Higgins remaining in Perth for a further week on Arbitration Court business), and then proceeded to Sydney, where, on 25th November, a sitting of the Court was commenced by the Chief Justice and Justices Barton- and Isaacs. This sitting has now lasted fourteen days, and will probably not be concluded until the 21st inst., when the summer vacation of the Court commences. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins returned from Perth on the 25th November, and resumed the bearing of the Tramway case in the Arbitration Court. He will leave for Sydney on Saturday next to take his place on the Bench for the hearing of the  appeal the King v. Smythers  ex parte John Benson. The arbitration business will have to be postponed until some future date. </para>
            <para>The Court <inline font-style="italic">(i.e.,</inline> single Justice) sat in Melbourne during the year on the following dates : - April 3rd, September 16th, 17th; 18th, 20th, October, 28th, 29th, . 30th - eight days in all. Similar sittings were held in Sydney, Hobart, and Brisbane, and lasted nine, two, and four days respectively. These sittings were held for trial of causes. At the same time, appeals which, bv law, can be tried before a single Justice (Land Tax assessment appeals - appeals under Patents Act, &#38;c), were also dealt with. </para>

I am unable at present to compile any definite return of the Chamber business dealt with during the year, as some of the Justices take their Chamber business records with them .when engaged with the Court elsewhere. </para>

          <para>The work there outlined is heavier than that done by any other Bench of. which I have  knowledge, and is rauch more for each of the five Justices than had to be got through in 1906 by three, when it was considered that the Court was undermanned. The business of the country requires the appointment of more Justices. The interests of justice demand it. </para>
          <para>Let me now deal with the provisions of the Bill relating to the manner in which decisions on constitutional issues are to be arrived at. At present, when the Justices are evenly divided the opinion of the Chief Justice or, in his absence, of the senior Puisne Judge present, prevails. There have been very few such cases, but the decision of the Court was arrived at in that manner in the case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company against the Sugar Commission. This is not a sovereign Legislature, but the creature of the Commonwealth Constitution ; it can, therefore, pass only such laws as are within the powers conferred upon it by that instrument. It is foi the High Court to say whether its laws are consti tutional or not, and there is no appeal from the Court&#39;s decision. The High Court is, in this matter, the master of this Parliament. .The Constitution has made it so, and until the people alter it we roust not complain. We nave the right to insist, however, that a law shall not be declared unconstitutional unless clearly and obviously so, and when the Justices are evenly divided as to the constitutionality of a law that law is not obviously unconstitutional. We desire that only those laws shall be declared unconstitutional which a majority of the Justices think to be so.

            <para>A Full Court consisting of less than all the Justices shall not give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, unless a majority of all the Justices concur in the decision. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is to say, whatever the number of Justices, there shall be a majority who concur in the decision whatever the decision is.: In regard to appeals on matters of ordinary law from the Supreme Court of any State, or from a single Justice of the High Court, where the Court is evenly divided, the decision of the Justice or the Judge shall stand. Where there is an appeal from anr inferior Court, that provision does not apply, but the opinion of the senior Justice or the senior Puisne Judge prevails. </para>
          <para>I think that this provision, for decisions, by a majority of the Justices, is a perfectly sound and salutary one. As to the &#39;increasein the number of Justices, I submit that it is justified by the facts. The position of the-. Arbitration Court is such as to demand an increase; indeed, it is impossible for&#39; thework to be carried on without the appointment of another Justice. Deputations havewaited upon me quite recently from variousorganizations to call my attention to thefact that- their causes have been on thelist for a long while without any prospect, of their being reached. In one case, which I mentioned this evening, theexecutive committee assured me that it waswith the greatest difficulty that the meru were prevented from attempting to obtaintheir rights by some other method than thatprovided by law; and they urged that I should do something to get the case heard&#39; more speedily. Representations were made, but it was found that other organizationswere in exactly the same position, and that, every case must take its place in the order- set down in the list. There ought, however, to be no interruption in the Arbitration Court business. The question of appointing a second Judge to assist in the Arbitration Court work is one already provided for in the Act. </para>

          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs pointed out, it will require an amendment of the Act in order to provide that the Arbitration Court shall be differently constituted. It may be remembered that, as originally drafted, that Act provided for a  President  and two assessors; but that does not seem to me the most convenient plan. I do not think it would be effective to appoint two persons with co-ordinate authority in such a Court; and the best means to expedite the business is, I think, to allow one Justice to give his whole attention to it. In that way, the work will be done very much more quickly. The work of the High Court is, as I have said, increasing very rapidly, and will, in the future, increase still more rapidly ; and the number of Judges now is not sufficient to enable it to be done except under severe strain. As regards the Arbitration Court, the work cannot be done properly at all under present circumstances. </para>

            <para>.- The Attorney-General this evening addressed the House under favorable auspices. Some of his pleas, at all events, touch honorable members more than they are willing to confess. In the first place, the honorable and learned member very wisely adopted something approaching an adequate view of the status, importance, and influence of the High Court; I have heard him very much less appreciative. Australians are proud, and rightly proud, of this tribunal, which has far more than fulfilled expectations. It is a great Federal instrumentality, to which we are deeply indebted. Then, again, however much we may endeavour to divest ourselves of personal feeling, it is impossible to approach this proposal without recollecting the particular and special circumstance which forced it on our attention - the loss, not only of a distinguished Judge, but of one of the most distinguished representatives the Commonwealth Parliament has yet known. Any appeal in this relation is sure to find a responsive echo from every honorable member on either side who was acquainted with him. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>While these old associations help to make us only too willing to sympathize with any proposal for the enhancement of the status, functions, and influence of the High Court, yet we are bound, in this House, and under present circumstances, to, as far as possible, regard this Bill in the dry light of actual fact and business necessities. That being so, one cannot fail to recollect the nature of the arguments employed in 1906, when an increase of the Judges, proportionately larger than this, was sanctioned by both Houses. If I recollect aright, that was only after struggle, conflict, and resistance in both Houses, though nothing; like the resistance or opposition that the proposal for the establishment of the Court itself had to face in 1903. The decision hung on a single vote in this House. The Bill was only made law by appeals of a character that are very rarely addressed to members of a Legislature. </para>
          <para>Since then the Court has undoubtedly proved in every way worthy of its responsibilities. We were fortunate in the men it attracted, not by the monetary rewards or the prospects offered. These were reduced below what the AttorneyGeneral himself now admits to be a fair recognition of either the standing of the Justices or the immense importance of their work to the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>I notice with some surprise, and more regret, an entire absence from this measureof any proposal to adequately recognise the functions now discharged by members of the Bench. It is not yet too late. As a matter of fact, I fear that it is too late, but, at all events, it is still open to Ministers to reconsider the question whether they are justified in permitting the highest Court of Australia - well worthy of its obligations and its duties, and, as he has admitted, of a status higher than the highest Court in the United States of America - to be overburdened with work, most generously undertaken and thoroughly discharged, and yet with a lower scale of remuneration than any body of the same kind in any civilized country in the world. The AttorneyGeneral has very properly and very wisely recognised what this Court has done, and what it is doing, for the Commonwealth, so that this forces on us the question why that recognition does not take the shape which he himself points out as only fair and adequate under the circumstances. </para>
          <para>But let us come to the particular data which the Attorney-General laid before us in support of this view. The facts were drawn from several sources, and were very striking; they faithfully mirrored, so far as figures can, the very heavy burden imposed on the Court,, and, incidentally, the splendid manner in which it has discharged its duties. But almost the whole of the figures were vitiated, and some largely so, by the fact that, during the twelve months, the absence of the late Judge to whom I have referred, has to be taken into account, The extra burdens cast upon the remaining members of the Bench, which are mow put before us as justifying additional appointments, require -to be read in the light of that knowledge. If there had been no such illness, it is possible that the suggestion of an increase in the strength of the Court might still be justified, but it would have had to be by figures and facts not yet laid before us. In dealing with this question, we have to strip ourselves, as far as possible, of all prepossessions, and of the natural inclination to magnify this institution. Our duty, as representatives of the people, is to ask ourselves whether the Attorney-General has established a case for not only filling the regrettable vacancy on the Bench, but appointing two additional Justices. With the utmost good-will in the world, he does not appear to me to have been able to substantiate that case. </para>
          <para>He confesses that one of the two additional Justices is to render assistance in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and, in reply to a query, said that the attention of that Justice was not to be wholly devoted to the work of that tribunal. Apparently he is also to discharge general duties. Does that mean that he will, in a sense, undertake duties connected with the Full Court of the Commonwealth, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins remains at his original work as  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court? If so, the question of status appears to have been ignored. I mention such a consideration only because it appears to imply, even in the Attorney-General&#39;s mind, some uncertainty as to the particular duties that will devolve upon the Justice taking the place of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor. Of the work of the other Justices to be appointed, we hear, except in the most general way, practically nothing. It is true that the figures quoted suggesting the work to be done are impressive as they stand. Perhaps they are capable of bearing the interpretation which the AttorneyGeneral, without a moment&#39;s hesitation, put upon them. But I am not in possession of sufficient knowledge to enable me to say whether the facts, as submitted to us, call for the appointment of even one additional Justice. There appears to be an entire absence of proof of the necessity for the appointment of a second additional Justice. That the High Court is overburdened is undoubted; that it is likely to continue overburdened appears probable even after the present vacancy is filled. </para>

          <para>The plain issue is how far we are called upon at this stage to add to the High Court Bench. I feel disinclined even to appear to turn a deaf ear to any appeal of this character, knowing how greatly the present Justices have been overworked. But I have to proceed on such general sympathies and inferences, rather than upon exact data, to justify me, as a member of Parliament, with a duty to discharge to my constituents, in arriving at the conclusion that there is any necessity for any additional appointment. The proved necessity does not extend to the appointment of one additional Justice, and certainly does not justify the appointment of two. </para>
          <para>Among the circumstances that may fairly be taken into account, both in regard to the regrettable loss the Bench has recently sustained and to the appeal of the High Court Justices in relation to their overwork, is the fact that, contrary to the universal practice in Australia, no retiring allowance is available even to the men, who are breaking down owing to their devotion to duty, who, finding themselves crippled by the influx of new business and the illness of a comrade, have spent themselves without stint in the discharge of their duty. </para>

          <para>The few remarks I have made require to be supplemented by the fact that we are faced also with the consideration - which I can touch upon only in the lightest possible way - of the choice that is to be made. The strength of a Bench lies not so much in the number of its members as in their quality. It lies not so much in their wealth of learning as in the standards by which they are governed and the influence which they are able to exercise from their exalted position. Consequently, amongst the most embarrassing choices that can fall upon a Cabinet or its chief adviser, is the selection of the best ability available, and particularly a selection which will most effectively supplement the ability and learning already possessed by the Bench. The task that will devolve upon the Government in this regard will be of -the most serious character, and will be attended by the most fruitful results. I shall not, for one moment, assume that Justices chosen for what, in some respects, is the highest office in the Commonwealth, will not be selected from the very cream of the judicial intellects of the Commonwealth, and without partisan aims. Happily, we have never had to look outside our own boundaries for our Judges. But even in these circumstances, and with the liberty of choice open to the Government, it will be an extremely delicate and difficult matter to make such a selection for the existing vacancy, that the Bench we already possess shall be supplemented by the addition of a mind, not only equal to its present standard, but at the same time so equipped as to lend to it, not merely numerical, but special, individual strength. On that point it is not permissible to dwell, although it is necessary to lay some emphasis upon it. </para>
          <para>We have to remember that Justices are human, and so are Ministers and those who criticise them. The question whether laws are constitutional and valid, or declared to be unconstitutional and void, is, in itself, a recollection that must sober every serious member of our Legislature. Far more than we can guess depends upon the choice, and the choice made will be all the better, as it seems to me, if it is limited in the first instance to one Judge only. Ministers, of course, may not be responsible for the extra pressure that has been put upon them of late to make additional appointments, but I am confident that, if they added a first-class, capable man to the Bench they could then, with advantage, wait until they had studied the consequence of that appointment before undertaking to make a further -one. At the close of a Parliament, and in the face of a referendum, this would be both just and wise. In any event, we all recognise that the particular Bill before us marks not only a stage in the growth of this Commonwealth, and bf its responsibilities, but a critical event. Having regard to the present division of opinion amongst members of the existing Bench, even one appointment may possibly give a very decisive turn to the interpretations of important questions of constitutional law affecting Parliament and the whole </para>
          <para>Commonwealth. In this both sides of the House are deeply and vitally interested. All, I am sure, will sympathize with the Attorney-General in the responsibility that will be cast upon him and his colleagues by this far-reaching measure. </para>

            <para>-- The Attorney-General submitted this Bill for the consideration of the House with studied care, deliberation, and caution, and I see no reason to complain of any attempt on his part to exaggerate the case or to overstate the arguments in support of his action. So far as he appeared to make them, they seemed to me to be in his favour. I was glad to notice the full measure of justice that he did to the splendid work done by the High Court of Australia. I think that the people of Australia have every reason to be proud of the constitution of our High Court and of the magnificent work already done in the field of judicial interpretation, not only in great constitutional cases, but in the. field of private jurisprudence. With reference to its original jurisdiction the work of the High Court has been comparatively limited. Hitherto the public of Australia have not shown any disposition to rush to the High Court in matters of original jurisdiction when they could obtain justice through the State Courts. It is quite true that with the enlargement of Federal legislation litigants may be forced to go to the High Court, even in matters of primary jurisdiction. But, generally speaking, there has not been any preference manifested for the High Court in matters of primary or original jurisdiction. Its principal scope and usefulness appears to be confined to its appellate jurisdiction. In that arena it has doubtless done, and will continue to do, good work. The comparatively small amount of work done in the original jurisdiction of the Court is shown by the figures which have been supplied by the Attorney-General. These disclose the fact that in  1911  the Court sat in its original jurisdiction on ninety-four days, and that during the present year it has sat only twenty-five days. But as he very properly pointed out there was one great case in  191 1  which absorbed nearly the whole of those sitting days - I refer to the Coal Vend case. </para>

It is because of the deficiency of the Court, owing to the sad and unavoidable absence of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor. Similar circumstances may not recur for many years to come. Had the Court been at its normal strength there would have been four Justices available for the Full Court, and for hearing cases in its primary or original jurisdiction. There is no very strong argument in favour of the appointment of additional Justices to the Court in its appellate jurisdiction, and we have not heard that the Justices of the High&#39; Court, outside of the  President  of the Arbitration Court, have made any complaints that they are overworked. </para>

              <para>- At the same time, the Chief Justice of the High Court and his colleagues, who have been sitting in appellate jurisdiction, have not complained of being overworked. No doubt the most important work done in the appellate jurisdiction of the Court has been work involving the determination of constitutional questions. In that field the High Court has had a most strenuous time. It has dealt with a large number of leading cases which will be landmarks in the history of the development of our Constitution for many years to come. It has grappled with many problems, and it has laid down many leading fundamental principles of interpretation and rules of construction. It may be considered to have laid down the fundamental outlines and development of our Constitution, and it is not likely that as many constitutional questions will arise in the future as have arisen in the past. When it commenced its work there were a large number of problems demanding judicial settlement. These have now been settled until constitutional amendments are made by the people which involve new interpretations. I admit that if the Constitution Alteration Bills which we have just passed, and which involve enlargements of Federal power and conflicts with State rights, become law, there may be renewed activity in the constitutional interpretation work of the High Court. But it is by no means certain that those measures will become law. To do so, they must secure a majority of votes in a majority of the States. If any of the new appointments are proposed with an eye to the future interpretation of Federal law in conjunction with projected constitutional amendments, that proposal is based upon grounds which are not sufficiently tangible to influence the House at the present time. But should those amendments become law, it will be the duty of the Government to strengthen the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction. </para>

              <para>- It does seem tome that the work of the Arbitration Court is increasing, but even there the  President  has been occupied for only 158 days this year, whereas the Full Court has been occupied for 165 days. I suppose that the  President  of the Arbitration Court has also sat on the High Court Bench in many of the constitutional cases which have been decided. How many such attendances he has given does not appear. It seems strange, however, that during the 158 days on which the Arbitration Court sat, only about eighteen awards were made. I admit that the work is not to be gauged by the number of cases decided, but by the magnitude of the interests involved. </para>

              <para>- It seems strange that a Court from which the legal profession is excluded should occupy so long a period in disposing of such a limited number of cases. If any case has been made out in favour of this Bill, it is in the direction of strengthening the Arbitration Court. It appears to me that nocase has been made out for any such great increase in the number of Justices as is proposed. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that if a strong Judge were appointed as a successor to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor, the arrears of work in the Full Court might be overtaken, and the congestion which at present exists might be swept away. That would allow the  President  of the Arbitration Court more time to attend to arbitration work. I admit- that the work of that tribunal ought not to be allowed to accumulate. But for the unfortunate illness of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor there would not have existed the same cause for complaint, and no ground for the appointment of additional Justices. I hope that I shall not be regarded as endeavouring to obstruct the reasonable expansion of the High Court, but it is the duty of the Opposition to insist on strong reasons being given and sustained for important appointments like these, involving very high salaries and grave responsibilities. The country will require good reasons for an increased expenditure amounting to nearly  &#163;8,000  per annum. </para>

              <para>- The Bill is not needed for the filling of that vacancy. I congratulate the Attorney-General on his tone towards the High Court to-night, which contrasted markedly with that adopted by him towards it on a recent occasion. The High Court has a constitutional function with which the people of Australia are only beginning to become familiar. This function is unfamiliar to the people of the Mother Country, and even to some of the learned Lords of the Privy Council. That an Act of Parliament which had received the Royal assent should be called in question was recently treated by an extremely eminent law Lord as in the nature of an absurdity. This state of mind is due to the fact that Great Britain has a Unitary form of government, and the laws of its Parliament are therefore never questioned. We are beginning to get accustomed to a tribunal having the right to question our Acts. </para>

We must get accustomed to the exercise of this right, unless we are prepared to do away with the division of sovereign power between the Commonwealth and the States. It is the bounden duty, not only of the High Court, but of all our Courts, to inquire into the validity of the Acts of this and of the State Parliaments. When the validity of any of our laws is questioned, it becomes the duty of some Court to determine it, the High Court&#39;s decisions being by far the most important, because it is the final Court of Appeal. </para>

              <para>- I admit that there is a good deal of uncertainty sometimes as to the limits of our powers, but one of the main endeavours of the honorable member seems to be to introduce into the Constitution words of such ambiguity and uncertain effect that the determination of those limits will be still more difficult. The only way in which the limits of our powers can be determined is by appeal to a Court of Law charged with the duty of saying in regard to what purports to be an Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of a State whether it is within the power of that Parliament to enact. Consider the other side of the question. Suppose that the Act of a State Parliament is called in question, on the ground that it transgresses on the domain vested by the Constitution in this Parliament. Is  not any Court before which the question arises bound to determine whether that Act is, or is not, law? </para>

              <para>- A narrow or a broad view may be taken. I should be sorry to imagine that honorable members opposite, in dealing with this matter, will allow their judgments to be affected by recent decisions of the Court on constitutional questions. It is, of course, possible for the Court to take a narrow or a broad view. All that its Justices can do is to form a judgment according to their best ability. It is their imperative duty to determine whether any Act of the Commonwealth Parliament, or of a State Parliament, the validity of which is questioned, is valid, and they can do that only by studying the Constitution, and considering the powers expressly or impliedly vested in this Parliament. </para>

              <para>- Their opinions must be final. I have been drawn aside from what I was going to say by what appears to me a misunderstanding in the minds of some honorable members as to the true functions of the Court. The High Court is the final judicial tribunal of Australia, and a part - perhaps not the principal, but a very important part - of its functions is, when the question is raised, to decide whether an Act of this, or&#39; of a State Parliament, is within the powers of legislation given by the Constitution to these agents of the popular will. If honorable members can suggest any other way in which the Federal Constitution could be administered, the suggestion might be useful ; no other way has yet been suggested. Wherever there is a Federation, some <inline font-style="italic">Court</inline> - ultimately the final Court of Appeal - must determine whether what purports to be an Act of the Federal or a State Parliament is, or is not, constitutional. The main object of the Bill is to strengthen the High Court, and as the Leader of the Opposition has said, if that can be shown to be necessary, I shall not object to it. The reason put forward by the AttorneyGeneral is mainly a recent congestion of work, and I am not satisfied that such a congestion would exist had it not been for the unfortunate illness and death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor. I admit, however, that if one Justice is to continue to have practically the whole of his time occupied, by arbitration proceedings, congestion of the ordinary work of the Court, if it does not at present exist, is likely  to arise. </para>

              <para>- I take a different view of the functions of the Arbitration Court from that of honorable members opposite. In my opinion, the Court has not been a success, and is a cumbrous, heavy, unworkable piece of machinery. I know that honorable members opposite differ from me <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> but I cannot help expressing the view that  the  gains which have resulted in certain cases to those whom they especially claim to represent have been more than counterbalanced by the dislocation of business, delay, and expense, which the hearing of disputes has involved. In many, and perhaps the majority, of the cases, the proceedings - not merely those before the Court, but those which have led to the bringing of disputes into the Court - have involved great industrial disturbance and large expenditure, without any corresponding benefit. </para>

              <para>- We should all like to do away with strikes, and differ only as to the best methods of meeting the evils which cause them. I am not at liberty now to discuss this question generally. Whether the Court must be strengthened by the appointment of an  additional  Justice, or whether its work may not be considerably reduced by making its functions appellate or semi-appellate, leaving original jurisdiction to local bodies such as Wages Boards, will depend on what will happen in May or June next, which is something that &#39; we cannot control. If honorable members opposite are successful in obtaining a majority at the next election, no doubt they will press their policy and magnify the authority, and extend the operations, of the Arbitration Court. If we on this side are successful, I, for one, shall be strongly in favour of restricting very largely the operations of that Court. </para>

              <para>- I seem to be always pleasing the honorable member by my admissions, and possibly I shall make some more. The functions of the Arbitration Court, in my opinion, ought to be confined to work of a more or less appellate character. The main determination, so far as any determination  by law can be arrived at, of industrial conditions, ought to be vested in bodies of a totally different character, namely, bodies in the nature of Wages Boards. However, on this Bill we are not in a &#39;position to discuss these alternatives ; and I merely put this forward to emphasize my point of view. The main claim tor the proposed large addition to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the High Court Bench rests on the fact that the Arbitration Court, in carrying out its original, or nonappellate, jurisdiction, will have to extend its operations because it will have more and more original work to do. It was the original jurisdiction of this Court to which I objected, because I recognised that it would be almost entirely of a legislative character. I am glad to see that I am supported by, perhaps, the &#39; highest authority on this question, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins himself, who, if properly reported, has recently stated that what he is called on to do is not to decide cases judicially, but to make law. That is a candid admission on the part of the Judge, who is a clear-headed and able man. He has come to the conclusion to which we must all come, that the functions handed over to him are not so much of a judicial character as they are of a law-making or regulative character. That is the kind of jurisdiction which I think ought not to be invested in an Arbitration Court. If it should turn out that the views, which I believe are shared to a considerable extent on this side, receive the acceptance of the country, then the Arbitration Court, if still existing, will be a Court whose functions will not take up anything like the whole time of even one Judge. Unless we are going to devote the whole time of one Judge to arbitration work, and extend that work, I am not convinced that there is any actual or immediate congestion in the business of the High Court. That business also consists of appellate and original jurisdiction. If honorable members look back on the history of the High Court they will see that it is vested, under the Constitution and the Judiciary Act, with very considerable powers of original jurisdiction, but that very few cases of original jurisdiction have ever come before it. The AttorneyGeneral will admit that the extension of what is called the original, or nonappellate jurisdiction, has been very slow. An 5 immense amount of very strenuous work has, however, been created by the appellate jurisdiction. We cannot have a Court of Appeal with fewer than three </para>

              <para>- That is precisely the difficulty ; the two highest Courts might not be in accord on principles of Jaw, and there would have to be some machinery to bring them together. I am not suggesting that the plan should be adopted, but merely pointing out that such a suggestion has been made. In the United States of America there are Circuit Courts of Appeal, subject to review by the final Court of Appeal. So long as we have appeal cases from the Supreme Courts of the States, I do not know that the present tension can be relieved by the appointment of an additional one or two Judges. No doubt the Court would be strengthened, inasmuch as there would be four or five Judges instead of three ; but that would be the only advantage. The main necessity which is put forward for the enlargement of the Court depends, to a large extent, on whether the extension of the Arbitration Court as at present constituted is to go on; and it might be a very wise thing, first of all, to afford the people an opportunity of pronouncing whether this particular method of settling industrial disputes is to receive the extension claimed for it. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that it is a good thing that this Court should be a kind of centre of attraction - I do not say for what reason - for those engaged and interested in industries, especially when there are tribunals acquainted with all the local conditions which might, if it were not for this magnet or lodestone, very well settle the disputes without leading to those enormous combinations of industries - this coagulating together - in order to form a huge Inter-State dispute, and to bring about a kind of industrial warfare which is nearly, if not quite, as bad as strikes. There are one or two provisions in the Bill which I do not think have received quite, full enough consideration, from what I might call a technical point of view. Clause 3 provides that a Full Court, consisting of less than all the Justices, shall not give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth unless a majority of all the Justices concur in the decision. The object, of course, is quite apparent, and I can understand the AttorneyGeneral desiring that, before a law shall be declared invalid, a majority of the whole Bench shall be in favour of that view. </para>

              <para>- But the difficulty is that the clause seems to assume that the decision will be given on the abstract constitutional validity of an Act. A decision is, and would be, very rarely of that kind except, perhaps, under the Act which enables Parliament to remit to the High Court the question of whether a Bill is valid. The question then is - Is this law good or bad ? It is not very often, as I say, that the question arises in this particular way before the Court. </para>

              <para>- I doubt if there has been. The question for decision before the Court is usually a question, say, between Jones and Robinson, and not whether a law is good or bad. It often happens, and, in fact, it usually happens, that in determining whether, for instance, a fine is lawful, or whether one man is entitled to recover a sum of money from another, the constitutionality of an Act of Parliament is called in question; and it just as often happens that Judges take different views personally on the subject. </para>

            <para>. - I should like to say a word or two before the discussion closes. The honorable member for Flinders has talked very learnedly, and we were pleased to hear him, about the position the High Court occupies, the position it should occupy, and the functions it exercises. Certain gentlemen who occupy eminent positions in the law have a tendency to assume that other human beings, who are not in the legal profession, can have no knowledge of what is lawful or constitutional, and, therefore, that we are in duty bound to speak of a Court, whether it be a minor tribunal or the highest Court in the land, with the greatest possible awe. </para>

              <para>- The High Court is constituted of eminent gentlemen, each&#39; of whom has had experience in the field of politics. In addition to being members of the legal profession, they have been politicians fighting on the floor of Parliament with as much vim and, shall we say, party prejudice, as does any member of this House. We regard them as distinguished jurists, free from party political bias in the discharge of their duties, and we must assume that they do their best according to their high intellectuality, in spite of the unconscious bias and prejudice which, as human beings, they must carry with them. Our High Court is as eminent as any in the world, and quite as capable of performing the duties allotted to it as is any body of jurists of which I have read. The honorable member who has just resumed his seat has tried to impress upon the House and the country the idea that the High Court is to be a purely appellate tribunal ; in other words, that it is not to exercise any original jurisdiction. </para>

              <para>- Why is the honorable member excited? As to the position taken up by the honorable member for Flinders in regard to the Conciliation&#39; and Arbitration Court, I can only say that that tribunal should undoubtedly be a Court of original jurisdiction. Acting in an appellate character - dealing only with the decision of Wages Boards - I think that it would be an utter failure. I should therefore be very glad if another Justice were available to share, as far as possible, in its work. The honorable member was also good enough to say that the High Court did not limit the powers of this Parliament. It may riot directly limit our powers, but it claims the right to interpret every line of the Constitution, and, whenever it determines that any law is unconstitutional, we have to act upon that decision. </para>

              <para>- That may suit the honorable member&#39;s argument for the timebeing ; but he spoke also of other Courts. The Privy Council has laid it down that its decisions are binding, and cannot bealtered. Such a position is a perfectly tenable one for it to take up, since theParliament of the United Kingdom is free at any time to amend the law if any decision given under it shows that it is not inthe interests of the public. But what isthe position? -If the High Court gives a decision limiting the powers of the Federal Parliament - a decision which, in theopinion of the Parliament, is not in the best interests of the people - the Parliament itself is unable to act. It cannot help the people unless the Constitution itself, upon which the decision in question has placed a certain interpretation, isamended by the people. </para>

              <para>- It is an absolute fact that a judgment of the Privy Council can, in fact, be set aside by the Parliament of&#39; the United Kingdom. By Act of Parliament it can brush aside every decisionof that tribunal. To that extent, therefore, the people, through their representatives in Parliament, can intervene. Thepeople of Australia! however, cannot doso. I am glad that both sides of theHouse agree that the High Court should be strengthened, but we, as a people, cannot recognise the principle that a decisiongiven by the High Court shall be binding for all time. A great blunder would becommitted if the people did not face that question. </para>

              <para>- No. I believe that the High Court Bench does its best to interpret the law according to the strict wording of the law, but I hold that there is safety in numbers in this as in everything else. With a greater number of Justices I hope and believe that the Court will not only deal with new questions, but will be prepared, under new circumstances and on new evidence, to review any previous decision that may have been given&#39; by it. </para>

              <para>- The law has never been settled. If it&#39; could be settled the passing of a few short measures would be sufficient to determine the legal position in every country. The changing circumstances of life demand that laws shall be interpreted according to the wisdom of the people for the time being. That is the burden and principle of all law. Let us therefore pick the best, men that we can obtain to occupy these positions. Let us trust to their wisdom, and, above all things, let us leave it to the&#39;&#39; people, on whom the burden or the benefit will fall, to decide for themselves how they are to be governed in regard to all political questions. No one has a higher regard than I for the members of the High Court Bench. At the same time, we must not forget that they are men who have been elevated from the political arena, and who possess all the weaknesses and virtues that a political career involves. We hope and. believe that they will be added to, not only in numbers, but in intellectual strength, ant that they will help to guide to a successful issue the constitutional government of Australia for the benefit of the whole of the people. </para>

They have to see that the pegs which the people have put down are observed. One is not to step from one paddock to another, but <inline font-style="italic">each</inline> governmental instrumentality is to operate within its own domain. That is the function of the High Court.

              <para>- That is all they do, and that is the place of the High Court in our Constitution. The Court is not to tell us what we ought to do. That is a duty which rests with trie people, and must always rest with them. All that the Judges do is to try, as far as they may, to tell us exactly what the people intended that we should be able to do. There is only one other point with which I desire to deal. The Attorney-General, throughout the whole of his argument, has been urging that we are fettered now by the High Court. Hence the referenda proposals of the Government are neither more nor less than an appeal to the people from the High Court. The purpose of the Attorney-General, in connexion with these referenda proposals, has been declared on many an occasion to be to sweep .away all limitations. And why? &#34;Because,&#34; he says, &#34; whatever we do, the High Court keeps upsetting it. We cannot get ahead with our proposals.  We are constantly  Tunning  up against the High Court, and we desire to sweep away this limitation so that the Court may no longer interpose.&#34; </para>

              <para>- Is it? If the honorable member will but wait a moment he will see my point. If my honorable friends are going to sweep away these limitations, there will be less of this upsetting to be done by the High Court. Consequently, we shall require less upsetters- less Judges. It seems to me an utterly illogical position to say in one breath that we want to relieve the High Court of a lot of the trouble which it is constantly causing, and to strengthen it for the very purpose of doing what we do not want it&#39; to do. Had not my honorable friends opposite better await the result of the referenda? Had they not better allow the people to decide whether they want the Justices of the High Court to be as frequently interposing as they are - whether these boundary pegs are to be pulled up or not? If they are to be pulled up, we shall not want so many Justices as we have now. </para>

              <para>- No; but if the people say, on the invitation of the Government, that the High Court must not do what it is doing, I shall have to submit. Before cramming the High Court Bench in the way that is proposed, had not my honorable friends better wait and see whether it is to be given more or less work ? I suggest that the Attorney-General is already afraid that all he has promised in the way of relief from the High Court is not likely to eventuate. The very fact that he wishes to strengthen that tribunal to enable it to do very much more work shows that he anticipates the loading up of the Court with further business instead of get- . ting away from the limitations against which he has fulminated on so many occasions. </para>

            <para>.- I think that we ought to await the fate of the referenda proposals of the Government before appointing further Justices to the High Court Bench. The way in which that tribunal&#39; has been recently conducted shows that there is no need for any more appointments, apart from that necessary to fill the vacancy which has been occasioned by the death of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor. We should then have five Justices. When the fate of the referenda proposals of the Government has been settled, it will be time enough to consider whether or not more Justices are required. It seems to me that a good many honorable members opposite have rather a misconception of the High Court and its functions. I have frequently heard them use the phrase &#34;Judge-made law.&#34; I think that some honorable members who have used that term do not quite understand what it means. If they will take the trouble to analyze the judgments of the High Court, they will see that it has simply interpreted the laws enacted by this Parliament, and also the Constitution. It has not attempted to strain the Constitution in any way. I have read many of the judgments carefully, and I am satisfied that the Justices of the High Court keep well within their province as interpreters of the law. Of course, 1 exclude the work of the Arbitration Court, the  President  of which has a chance, to a certain extent, to become something in the nature of a legislative institution. It will be time enough to elevate two more gentlemen, to the High Court Bench when the fate of the referenda proposals has been determined. But whether one or three Justices are appointed to that tribunal, I hope , that the idea expressed by the Prime Minister will be carried out, and that the best men in Australia will be appointed. If the Government are going to appoint politicians only to the Bench, we shall sooner or later degrade it. If they do not follow the recognised rules in making such appointments, this Parliament will do itself and the people of the Commonwealth an injury. I hope that they will keep that fact in mind. We are just at the point in our history when the purest administration is necessary. </para>

          <para>I wish to say that I understand it is the desire of the Opposition that the first business to-morrow should be the consideration of the two Bills relating to the repeal of the Sugar Bounty and Excise Acts.
