          <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. When the Maternity Allowance Bill was at the second reading stage, on behalf of the Opposition, I moved an amendment affirming the undesirableness of dealing piecemeal with the big question of social insurance, and favouring the introducing of a comprehensive scheme. I supported the amendment with a statement that it represented on broad lines the policy of the last Government. That statement was subsequently challenged by the honorable member for Cook, and the Minister of Trade and Customs declared that only one report on the subject had been found in his Department, that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor.</inline></para>

            <para>- I understand that the other records referred to by me have not been found, but I only heard of my statement having been doubted a few days ago. Fortunately, I have in my possession papers which place the correctness of what I said beyond doubt, and I shall read a letter addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> to myself and dated 24th January, 1910, which sets forth what took place between us, and covers a preliminary report of even date - </para>

          <para>At the request of yourself, the Prime Minister, and the Attorney-General I have looked pretty thoroughly into the question of workmen&#39;s insurance in various countries in Europe. It is clear to me that the full benefits from the stand-point of social economics require that, if possible, it should cover (a) old age, (b) invalidity, (c) sickness, (d) accident, (e) death of breadwinner, (f) non-employment. </para>
          <para>No solution has yet been found for (c) and (f), though the matter has been very carefully considered in various quarters. </para>
          <para>I have all the necessary literature, and came in contact with some of the men in Europe who are personally dealing with these problems, and have in my mind the lines on which a report should be prepared. </para>

          <para>It would be a great pleasure to me to devote my whole time to the matter, but I am unable to do so through the great pressure of current duty. The literature to be looked up and verified is extensive, and it is in foreign languages. </para>
          <para>So great is the importance of the matter for the proper guidance of the Government, especially if legislation be contemplated, that it would be well if I were authorized to employ some capable man with a thorough knowledge of at least French and German, and a reading knowledge of Italian. He could, under my guidance, and in a form to be determined by me, complete a comprehensive report on the social experiments, experience, and legislation in regard to workmen, and in respect of the features mentioned. Probably such a person could be had for15s. to &#163;1 per day. I would draft the report, direct the research, check results, and make myself responsible for the whole thing. </para>
          <para>I transmit herewith a General. Apercu: on German Workmen&#39;s Insurance from the standpoint of social economics, and up to 1904. This is obtained from authoritative sources, and will advise you as to the movement in the direction indicated. </para>
          <para>I have sent copies also to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, and I may be able to send more information at a later date, say, in fourteen days, but this is doubtful. </para>

          <para>.- This is one of the clauses which were originally omitted from the Bill, and which are contained in the Merchant Shipping Act. I have looked through them. On the whole, they seem to be copies of the provisions in the Merchant Shipping Act, but in one or two of them amendments have been introduced. In new clause 202, for instance, there is an amendment. It provides that where a ship is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, so that life is liable to be endangered, the person sending the ship is guilty of an indictable offence unless he proves that he used all reasonable means to insure her seaworthiness. In section 457 of the Merchant Shipping Act there is an additional ground of defence, and that is that the sending of the ship in the circumstances was reasonable and justifiable. It will be recognised that there may be special circumstances justifying the sending of a vessel to sea apart altogether from the question of whether her seaworthiness has been ascertained or not. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">I do not know why this additional ground of defence has been left out of the new clause. I think it is much better, unless there is substantial reason for varying the terms of the Imperial section, to adhere to the text, because then we shall have the advantage of any decision which may be given. There is no doubt that the additional ground of defence given in England is a very substantial one. The captain or the owner - this refers to the owner, I think, as well as to the captain - may not be able to test on a particular occasion the seaworthiness of a ship. An emergency may have arisen, and it may be necessary to take a risk. If it can be shown that the risk was justified in a case, that defence is open in England, but it will not be open in the Commonwealth. But whether this provision is in the Bill or not, the persons affected by a vessel being sent to sea in an unseaworthy condition have, I think, a right of action for damages. The sailors would certainly have a right of action for damages. </para>

            <para>- I knew that there was a provision somewhere in the Bill. I see that in clause 57 there is an implication that the vessel shall be seaworthy. I know that that is required by the common law apart altogether from the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act which we have copied. I merely mention that to show that, even apart from this new clause, there is some protection given to the persons affected, and, therefore, there is no reason that I can see why we should not add the additional ground of defence. It appears, however, to be shifted to another place. I hope that, as far as possible, unless there is some ground for altering the text of the Merchant Shipping Act, when we do adopt any provisions of that Act we shall maintain them in their fulness. </para>

We have decided to deal with the matter of exemption by regulation rather than by a provision in the Act, so that the power to exempt any ships will exist. On account of wireless telegraphy being a system&#39; which is continually altered, we think that it should be dealt with by regulation, and not by a special provision. I think that sufficient power is taken in the new clause. In the previous discussion the honorable member for Fremantle said that there should be some auxiliary appliance or accumulators provided for the purpose of keeping the batteries going.

            <para>- A vessel which did not get enough energy to supply the accumulators would &#39;be in a very bad way indeed. I think it is safe to say that nine-tenths of the steam-ships - all steamships over 2,000 tons - are lit up by electricity, and carry out various operations with electric power. If there is not sufficient electric power on a boat to keep the, wireless communication going it means about the end of that boat. We have adopted the limit which was fixed up by the International Convention which sat about the time when this Bill was read a second time. Of course, if the limit is found to be insufficient it will require to be altered, but I am informed that at present it will cover practically all cases that may arise. It will be a very extraordinary case which it will not cover. We have taken sufficient power by regulations to do everything which may be necessary. </para>

          <para>.- The new clause is, in effect, retrospective, because it says that &#34; a ship shall not engage in the coasting trade which is receiving, or which, under any arrangement, is to receive, or which in the immediately preceding twelve months has been receiving&#34; a subsidy. Suppose this measure were to come into force on 1st January next year. A vessel may have been in receipt of subsidies for the whole of the present year. When she received them&#39; this clause was not in contemplation. But the Bill will operate so as to exclude her from engaging in the coastal trade. What is the reason for it? The desire is, generally speaking, of course to exclude vessels which are in receipt of subsidies from engaging in the coasting trade. We have agreed to that. But under this clause the Government are harking back twelve months before the Bill comes into force. If the measure were not to come into force for a period of twelve months, there might be some reason for it, but I presume that the Government will bring it into force as soon as they can. The clause seems to me to act unjustly in that respect, because it will involve a prohibition of vessels engaging in the coasting trade which are not in receipt of subsidies at the time, although they did receive subsidies twelve months before. The clause appears to me to go further than is needed. We only wish to keep out vessels actually in receipt of subsidies. The mere fact that a vessel received a subsidy twelve months before need not prevent her engaging in the trade. Will the Minister explain the reason for this clause? </para>

          <para>. - The object of this clause is to prevent unfair competition, which may be brought about in various ways. It has to be remembered that the British mercantile marine is an established and persistent fact. The mercantile marine of other countries has to fight for a share of trade. Other countries pay subsidies to their mercantile marine because it is comparatively small. But it is impossible for the British mercantile marine to be subsidized correspondingly. The honorable member for Angas takes exception to the fact that we are bringing under the prohibition vessels that have been receiving subsidies. I think that is very necessary. Take a case. Suppose a subsidy is paid for any twelve months at the rate of one penny per ton, or per running mile, according to the French practice, or in a lump sum. All that would have to be done to avoid this clause would be to pay double the subsidy for one year, and the subsidized ship would have the. free run of our coast for a year, at any rate. Other arrangements might be made for the next year, calculated to destroy the purpose of the clause. If the prohibition is necessary at all, it is necessary to be put in this form. </para>

        <para class="block">Some merchants have drawn attention to the fact that a clause ought to be inserted to meet the case of ships clearing out of Australian ports without discharging obligations incurred here. That particularly applies to tramp ships. I am aware that some honorable members on the Ministerial side think the matter ought to be considered by the Government. The honorable member for Melbourne spoke to me about it yesterday, and the honorable member for Hindmarsh has also mentioned the subject. Under the circumstances, I thought it better to draft and circulate a clause to meet the object in view. It is intended to make the agent of a ship responsible for the obligations of the owner, giving the agent power to disclaim any liability by giving twenty-four hours&#39; notice before the vessel clears out. That would afford persons having claims against a vessel to take proceedings to stop her if the agent disclaimed liability. The clause as drafted is practically the same as one which appeared in the Bill of 1904. I have tried to find out the reason why it was excised then. I think the reason is that the whole of the clauses dealing with bills of lading and cognate matters were omitted. Some may be covered by the Sale of Goods Act. But, in omitting the whole of the -clauses to which I have referred, the Senate dropped a provision which is necessary to be inserted in this Bill. There is some anxiety in connexion with the matter. The Adelaide Chamber of Commerce have sent me a letter on the subject, and I have also had letters from merchants. </para>

            <para>- The question of pillaging has been under consideration by the Comptroller-General, with whom I have had several consultations with a view to comprehensive legislation. I think, however, that a Navigation Bill is not the place for such a provision, its only connexion with navigation being that the Collector of Customs may refuse a ship permission to leave. I have no objection to the clause, because, after all, it is only carrying out a proper principle. I point out, however, that the goods which are mostly stolen are those in every-day use, quite a different class from those carried by tramp steamers. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">The principle underlying the proposed new clause is very simple. Under this Bill, a number of pilots throughout the Commonwealth will be transferred to the Federal Service. I do not know what are the conditions of employment in the .other .States, but in South Australia the pilots are Government servants at the present time, and I am sure none of us desire to see a repetition of the misunderstanding and trouble that were experienced in connexion with the transferred postal officials. Under the Public Service Act of the Commonwealth the retiring age is sixty-five, whereas in South Australia, under the State Act, pilots, who, of course, are competent, may continue their work until the age of seventy. It appears to me only fair that, if these men are taken over under this Bill, they should retain all the rights they now enjoy under the State law. Of course, in regard to pilots engaged in the future, the retiring age may be fixed at any point we desire - it is all a matter of the contract. In the case of the transferred pilots, however, we are practically making a new agreement ; and, unless a clause of this kind is passed, they will practically have no rights at all, just as the transferred postal officers have, unfortunately, found out. The new clause cannot entail any great expenditure, and I can see no objection to it. It is not suggested that inefficient or incapable pilots should be kept on until they are seventy, or whatever may be the retiring age in the several States at the present time. The seafaring life, we know, is a hard one, and, doubtless, all the weak men are weeded out in their young days; at any rate, we know that the shipmasters and pilots, who have been navigating our coasts for the last thirty or forty years, are a robust and hardy lot. Navigation is a matter of experience, of knowledge and nerve, and nerve most of all. The difference between two navigators is much the same as that between two generals ; one, who has all the book learning possible, does nothing but lose battles, while the other, with not half the learning, is gifted with nerve and dash and sound judgment, and always wins. We ought to have men of nerve and knowledge as our pilots, and they should be retained as long as they are capable of doing their duty. </para>

            <para>- Attorney-General) &#91;n.25&#93;. - I hope the honorable member will not insist on this amendment. Whether the principle of compulsory retirement at the age of sixty-five is a sound one in all cases, I should not like to say ; in some cases, I think it is not. It is clear, however, that we must have uniformity. I am free to admit that there are men of sixty-five who are as well able as men of twenty-five to perform the duties of a pilot; and while an age limit is general, the principle may have to be reviewed and modified in view of our improved hygienic conditions and consequent prolongation of life. I have known men in the Public Service retired at sixty-five who were as competent to perform their duties as they ever had been. But it would be anomalous if in New South Wales, for instance, the pilots were retired at that age, while those in South Australia could continue their work until they were seventy. If there is to be any compulsory retirement ft should apply equally throughout the Commonwealth. To abolish compulsory retirement at a certain age, would throw the onus on some person or persons of saying that a public servant might go on indefinitely ; and in a large and growing service like that of the Commonwealth, this would lead to a condition of things worse than that caused by retiring, in a few cases, public servants who were physically and mentally capable of continuing their duty. Generally a pilot, when he has reached the age of sixty-five, finds his sight, hearing, and general capacity not so good as formerly ; and, beyond those faculties which are capable of test, there is that tendency to break down, which, of course, becomes more accentuated as a man grows older. Since, then, there must be, I think, a retiring age, that retiring age should be uniform. A similar argument to that used by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, was used in the case of the postal officials. Seventy may not be a great age for some pilots, but it is a great age for pilots in general ; and, therefore, while we are not by any means circumscribed by the Public Service Act in this connexion, there ought, to be uniformity. </para>

            <para>-  Some had not, but, in any case, there has been a reform in that connexion. In view of the fact that steamers are getting larger, and that the pilots, whose responsibilities are becoming greater, are exempt from all responsibility for damage, I hope the amendment will not be pressed. There may be hardship in one or two cases. I have been very reluctant in some cases to retire men. who were engaged only- as temporary employes, and1 were well over the retiring age. We must, however, be very- careful- that men- occupying highly responsible positions should not be permitted to continue in them when they have ceased to be at their best. No doubt many of us think that we are just as fit to-day as we were- ten or twenty years ago, but we may at any moment be suddenly shocked to find that we are not. I hope that the honorable member will not press his amendment. </para>

            <para>- No; what I mean is that under the schedule we propose to substitute for that in the Bill men who do not hold the higher certificates will be allowed to take charge of what may be called the lower class of boats, such as river and bay boats. With regard to the second part of the schedule, covering the scale of engine-room officers and greasers, the honorable member for Darling Downs, as a member of the Navigation Commission, will remember that the scale proposed was the subject of much controversy. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Marine Engine Drivers Society, and third-class engineers are all interested, and with other persons vitally affected by the schedule they put their views before the Commission. Under the schedule in the Bill a third-class coast engineer could take charge of a river and bay boat under 55 nominal horse-power with a run of under 20 miles. It is proposed to liberalize that provision, and to provide that the holder of a third-class coast engineer&#39;s certificate may take charge of a river and bay boat under 85 nominal horse-power with a run from the place of departure not specified. Except in the case of the limited coast trade there was only one step provided for such a man. It is now proposed to make arrangements which will enable such a man to go from third to second, and from that to first-class coast engineer, and providing he passes the necessary examination he will be able to secure the Board of Trade certificate for a second-class engineer. In framing the proposed new schedule we have consulted the marine engine-drivers and the third-class engineers, and the schedule as proposed will enable men, provided they pass the necessary examination, to work their way up into the higher grades. </para>

            <para>- Certainly. There are a good many men who hold third-class engineer&#39;s certificates, and under the schedule of the Bill no provision was made except in one instance to enable them to work their way up. Under the new schedule proposed many more opportunities will be afforded them provided they are efficient and pass the necessary examination to progress in their profession. I am sure it is not the desire of any member of the Committee to prevent an efficient man, who shows a desire to equip himself for some better position, from working his way up. I understand that some honorable members desire to move an amendment in a particular section of the proposed schedule. </para>

            <para>- Not in this connexion, but I shall look into that matter and see whether it is necessary to make the alteration. I prefer, if honorable members will allow me, to continue dealing with the scale of engineers and greasers. I have said that the new schedule we propose will afford opportunities of promotion that are not afforded by the schedule of the Bill. In clause 21 we have provided that all uncancelled and unexpired certificates of competency for masters or ship officers, which include engineers, issued under any State Act shall continue as if issued under this Bill, but shall be valid only for the purposes and to the extent to which they would have been valid under the State Act under which they were issued. </para>

            <para>- That is so. But though we give him an opportunity to transfer his certificate, he may not be able to get a job. It must be remembered that the third-class engineer&#39;s certificates which have been issued by the different States are not of the same relative value. Those- issued by some States are of a higher class than those issued by others, since they involve the passing of a higher examination. In some cases, a man had only to be a deck hand and a fireman for a little time to secure a third-class engineer&#39;s certificate upon the passing of a very simple examination. Such a man should only receive a third-class coast engineer&#39;s certificate, which would be good only on river and bay boats, and should not take charge of a boat going outside a harbor. The third-class engineer&#39;s certificate issued by some of the States requires much qualification. It may be necessary for the Marine Council we have provided for to grade these certificates according to their value. We have tried to arrange the proposed new schedule in such a way as to deal fairly with all men holding certificates at the present time, as well as those who will follow this calling in the future, giving them every opportunity, if they pass the necessary examination, to progress from one grade to another. </para>

            <para>- Everything will depend upon the value of the certificate he holds. Some are allowed to go outside now with vessels of a certain nominal horse-power. We have tried to unify the different systems of the six States. After the adjournment on last Friday, the Attorney-General and myself stayed here until tea-time discussing the matter with the representatives of the bodies to whom I have referred, and, as a result, I think a schedule has been framed which, though it will not give either of these bodies all that they desire, will be more just than any schedule which has previously been framed. Holders of existing certificates will be able to do what they have done before. </para>

        <para class="block">Committee negatives the existing schedule. The question to be considered is one of considerable difficulty. When the schedules were originally inserted in the Bill, the idea was that provision would be made for an expert committee, to whom the technical questions involved would be referred. I do not see why we should not adhere to the schedules originally proposed. We are now dealing with a part of the Bill which is of a highly technical character,, and. so far we have had no opportunity of checking it with a view to seeing exactly what it means. In regard to the position of engineers, my own view, as a member of the Navigation Commission - after having heard the opinions expressed by all parties who are interested in the measure - is that we should recognise and preserve to every man in the different States the rights and privileges which he possesses at present. We ought not to insert in the Bill any provision which will prevent him from earning his livelihood in the way that he has earned it hitherto. We ought also to afford him an opportunity to qualify for a higher position if he chooses to do so. At the same time, the standard of efficiency which has been heretofore observed, ought not to be lowered in any way. When we come to deal with that class of engineers who do not hold Board of Trade certificates, we ought not to put them in the same position as we do engineers who are in a higher grade. But we ought to afford them an opportunity of qualifying for those higher grades, provided that they comply with the conditions which we lay down. The schedule in the Bill is a technical one, and in a matter of this kind we must rely absolutely upon expert advice and assistance. It seems to me that it would have been safer to retain the schedules which are set out in the Bill, and to allow an expert committee to deal with them. </para>

            <para>- The schedule in the Bill has been there for years. It has passed the Senate, and it has been discussed both by ship-owners and men. At the very last moment it is proposed to substitute an entirely new schedule. Either we ought to adhere to the schedules which are set out in the Bill, or we ought to postpone consideration of the proposed new schedules until next week, in order that we may be afforded an opportunity of looking into them more closely. I should like to know from the Minister what effect the proposed new schedule will have upon the scale of officers which the original schedule prescribes in the case of limited coast-trade ships. I should also like to know the extent to which the proposed new schedule will alter the original schedule to the Bill in regard to the persons employed on river and bay boats. The Bill of 1907 did not contain any provision for the creation of a Marine Council. It contemplated the appointment of an expert committee to deal with each technical subject.

          <para>. - I do not think that the proposed new schedule will increase the number of men employed upon the vessels mentioned. It will merely vary the certificate which engineers will be required to hold as compared with the certificate for which the original schedule in the Bill provided. We propose that in the limited coastal trade it shall not be necessary for vessels to carry a greaser. That is to say, that in a vessel between 100 and 200 horse-power we have decreased the number of men who may be employed, because in some cases it may not be necessary to carry a greaser. The new schedule will not increase the number of engineers who will be carried. Previously a third class engineer could be employed only on river and bay vessels of less than 55 horsepower, but in the proposed new schedule he will be at liberty to engage on any such vessel up to 85 horse-power. In short, the proposed new schedule has been framed with a view to meeting the varying conditions which obtain in the different ports of Australia. I think it is infinitely better than the old schedule, and that it will give greater satisfaction to all parties interested in this matter. The schedule in the Bill would not have given satisfaction to the interests affected. </para>

          <para>. - I think that the proposed new schedule is a big improvement upon that which is contained in the Bill. But there is one point upon which I am not quite clear. To-day in New South Wales third class engineers may engage, not only on river and bay boats, but also on vessels employed in the limited coastal trade. By virtue of the certificates which they hold they are able to travel for a distance of 10c miles along the coast. I am not sure whether under the proposed new schedule they will not be debarred from doing that. I admit that clause 21 of the Bill protects all existing rights. </para>

            <para>- It does not matter whether it increases the size of vessels by 100 horse-power if it debars these men from travelling along our coast as they do now. If the new schedule will preserve their existing rights I am satisfied. But it appears to me that by omitting them from the schedule, so far as the limited coastal trade is concerned, we shall prevent them from going out in vessels which travel 100 miles from port. The men who have third class engineers&#39; certificates to-day are entitled to continue running along our coast for a distance of 100 miles.  1  understand that the Minister wishes to preserve existing rights, and thinks that he has done so in clause 21. But seeing that this particular class of officers is not specifically mentioned in the schedule, I am inclined to think that some mistake may arise. </para>

          <para>. - This is one of the most important portions of the Bill. If the schedule contained in the measure will not give satisfaction to those who have to earn their living under it, it is idle for us to retain it. When we seek to bring about an altered condition of things by means of legislation, it is usual to recognise the claims of those who have been earning their living in a particular way up to that time. Take as an illustration the case of the master mariners. Many years ago, when the States were legislating upon navigation matters, they recognised that the examination which master mariners should be required to undergo ought to be the examination of the British Board of Trade. They were, however, faced with the difficulty that quite a number of old shipmasters and engineers could not pass that examination. But the shipowners were satisfied to commit the safety of their vessels into the hands of these men. Accordingly Parliament was approached, with the result that the difficulty was overcome by granting old shipmasters and engineers servitude certificates. It does not matter whether we like it or not, the fact remains that our past legislation is a jumble. At the present time, the law of one State is different from that of another. In their place we are. now to have a uniform law. In Great Britain they have very wisely recognised only the British Board of Trade tickets. So far as the small fry are concerned, the authorities have said, &#34; From Cape Finisterre to the Elbe you can do what you like. If people are prepared to employ you, let them do so; we shall not bother our heads about you.&#34; We have not clone that here. The third-class engineer&#39;s tickets issued by the States- are not recognised by the Board of Trade. As a matter of fact, they are not recognised here, and very properly so. The Board of Trade certificates must be recognised for the security of our own lads. It will never do for them to go to the Old Country with a ticket which is not equal to one that they can obtain from the Board of Trade in any English port. All that I am urging, so far as this schedule is concerned, is that we ought not to take away the existing rights of these men. I am putting before the Committee, as I promised to do, the claims of the third-class engineers, to the best of my ability, and I shall leave honorable members to decide, after hearing the facts, what course ought to be adopted. I say nothing about the younger men who hold third-class certificates. If they can pass the examination, let them do so ; but, surely, middle-aged men, who for many years have been earning their living on our rivers and harbors as holders of third-class engineer&#39;s certificates, should not suddenly be deprived of this means of earning a livelihood. I am sure that we should all be very sorry if any action on our part had that result. The position is that New South Wales issues a third-class engineer&#39;s certificate which entitles the holder to take a vessel of 50 nominal horse-power to any part of the New South Wales coast. The holder of a third-class engineer&#39;s certificate is allowed to take a vessel of any nominal horse-power in rivers and bays. Tasmania issues a port engineer&#39;s certificate, allowing the holder to take charge of a vessel of any nominal horse-power within any of the port limits of Tasmania. That is a more restricted ticket. Then, again, Victoria issues a marine engine-driver&#39;s certificate, which entitles the holder to take charge of engines under 100 nominal horse-power, and which is applicable to all ports and harbors in Victoria. Queensland issues a third-class engineer&#39;s certificate, which entitles the holder to take a vessel with engines up to 50 nominal horsepower to any part of the Queensland coast. There, again, we have a more extended certificate. Then I find that South Australia issues a third-class engineer&#39;s certificate, which allows the holder to take charge of steamers of unlimited nominal horse-power on the inland waters, and up to 50 nominal horse-power on the coast. These certificates are recognised by the authorities as being practically of equal value, and holders have been allowed to work on them in any of the States, thus making them interchangeable by usage. Under this schedule, however, the holders of these certificates will have a restriction placed upon their rights. I should not object to an age limit; I am really anxious to protect the middle-aged men who hold these third-class tickets. Their certificates, I think, ought to be recognised. They should be allowed to exchange them for a second-class coast ticket, which would enable them practically to take charge of a vessel on a voyage round the Australian coast. Unless we are prepared to do that, we shall certainly restrict the value qf these third-class tickets. I suggest to the Minister that, with the assistance of the Attorney-General, he should draft a clause providing that any man, say, over the age of forty years, shall be allowed to exchange his third-class engineer&#39;s ticket for a second-class coasting ticket. </para>

          <para>. - The position in regard to the third-class engineers has been very exhaustively discussed at different times by the Senate and the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill, and has also been the subject of very earnest consideration by the Government and by the representatives of the societies concerned. Every effort has been made to obtain information straight from the fountain head of each interest affected, and this procedure is obviously sound. It is not pretended for one moment that a member of Parliament can know as much about every industry as do those who follow them. We have therefore gone in each case direct to the ship-owners, the Masters and Officers, the Australasian Institute of Marine Engineers, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the third-class engineers, the seamen, and others. It is not said that we have agreed to everything put forward, but the conflicting interests by conference and by mutual concession have been so adjusted that the schedule as a whole is now as acceptable to the various parties as seems possible, having due regard to public interests. At the latest conference dealing with this schedule there were present the general secretary of the Marine, Institute and the general secretary of the Federated Masters&#39; and Engineers&#39; Association of Australia. After a lengthy discussion, certain points were brought out by the secretary of the Masters and Engineers Association, and were adjusted to his satisfaction and to that of the general secretary of the association. The principle that we desire to attain is first of all that no man&#39;s position will be made worse by this Bill. Clause 2 absolutely safeguards that. That is to say, whatever a third class engineer can do now he will be able to do when this Bill comes into operation. No one will be any worse off by the passing of this Bill than he is now. If a man can take a boat of 65 horse-power anywhere at present, he will be able to do so under this Bill. If he can take a vessel of any horse-power to any part of the New South Wales coast, he will continue to be able to do so. Whatever he can do now he will continue to be able to do. In addition, he will have something that he had never any  hope of getting before, and that is the means of obtaining a first-class Board certificate without shop experience. This will place in the hands of every greaser, marine engine-driver, or third-class engine-driver, the means of becoming a first-class engineer. Just as a private carries a marshal&#39;s baton in his knapsack, so these men will carry with them, under this Bill, the chance of becoming first-class engineers. The schedule has been amended to remove the last objection. The man who now holds a third class coast engineer&#39;s certificate may take service with such a boat as will enable him to qualify for a second-class coast certificate, then for a first-class coast certificate, and in turn for a second-class Board of Trade certificate. These men will be asked to undergo, not a literary, but a practical, examination. We cannot set it forth in the Bill, but the joint committee of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and the Australian Institute of Marine Engineers have drawn up what they regard as a fair, practical test of a man&#39;s acquaintance with marine engines. This is what they recommend as the practical test to be required from candidates for examination for first or second class Commonwealth or coastal certificates under the Bill:-  1st. Mark <inline font-style="italic">oft</inline> and chip and file out a  keyway  less than 6 inches by i inch in pulley, shaft, or boss, and properly fit key thereto. 2nd. Bore a 2-in. hole in a &#163;-in. plate; chip and file it out a true hexagon, then fit di round bar not less Ulan 6 inches long into it. 3rd. Properly bed, fit, and groove a brass on shaft or crank pin. 4th. Correctly mark off, cut the seat, fit the feather, and adjust an eccentric sheave on shaft, also fit on the strap. 5th. Chip and file up two cast-iron flat surfaces at least 12 inches square as representing a valve and cylinder face. 6th. Mark off a check valve or other boiler mounting, drill and tap the holes, put in the studs, and make a high-pressure steam joint. 7th. Turning : Bore out and bush a gland, true up and cut the thread on a bottom end bolt ; bore out a pair of brasses ; turn up a pin for any part of the surface. 8th. Smithing : Make a pair of hollow bit tongs; make a flat, round nose, and cross-cut chisel; a 12-in. drill to fit a ratchet brace; weld together two  1&#189;-in.  round or square bars. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Without committing myself to that, I put it forward as typical of an examination of a wholly practical kind. It has nothing to do with asking men questions of a highly technical nature, over which a third class engineer, perhaps not being a scholar, might find himself in difficulties. It is a practical examination, and is the only thing that stands between a third class coast engineer and a first class Board of Trade certificate. I say to the third class engineers of Australia that their interests are amply safeguarded. What they have now &#39;they hold, and the intention of the Government is that they shall hold it. That is plain English, and there is no ambiguity about it. Not only that, but the schedule aims at giving them the means of qualifying successively through the various grades that separate the third class coast engineer under the Bill from a first class engineer holding a Board of Trade certificate. </para>

          <para>.- I propose to ask the Committee to accept the schedule as put forward by the Minister. The Institute of Marine Engineers - my own society - and the Masters&#39; and Drivers&#39; Association, or, as they call themselves, the Federated Masters&#39; and Engineers&#39; Association, met a few days ago. This has been a question of great dispute amongst the contending organizations, and it has also been a matter of the utmost interest to the employers themselves. I can safely say that to-day there is some unanimity among us, but we are not agreed upon every possible point. We have attained a fair line of compromise, as expressed in the amended schedule that the Minister has put before the Committee. I think that in some aspects the Masters&#39; and Engineers&#39; Association are seeking for more than they are entitled to, and the Committee will have to be very careful in determining the nature of the tests that third class men must go through. The Attorney-General expressed himself in favour of what he is pleased to term a practical test, and that test is undoubtedly desirable. It must be passed in the interests of the life and property of the people of Australia, as a guarantee of the efficiency of any man who steps out of a river and bay ship on to a coastal vessel, and I take it that it will be placed in the regulations. But something more is wanted. There will have to be embodied in the requirements for any certificate that these men get some technical training and knowledge. It is not simply a matter of getting practical experience in a workshop or at a technical school. Practical knowledge is not enough to create efficiency such as is requisite in a second or first class engineer. Let these men get that technical knowledge or information, I do not care how. I raise no objection, because I believe every man has a right to climb to the height of his  ambition, but his efficiency must be proved. No doubt many members have had placed in their hands a circular from the Federated Masters&#39; and Engineers&#39; Association. I desire to point out certain misrepresentations in it, although I do not say that they were wilfully made. Under the heading of &#34; unlimited nominal horse-power in rivers and bays,&#34; the following statement appears : - </para>

          <para>In the State of New South Wales we have had the privilege for nil time, and we think that the examination the third-class engineer has to undergo entitles him to retain the same. Ninety per cent, of the ferries running in Port Jackson are manned by third-class engineers in charge of engines, and have given every satisfaction to the different companies, who prefer this class of man (holder of a third-class certificate), as being the most suitable for their class  of work </para>

        <para>Let me point out how misleading a statement of that sort is. These people have not one individual in the Manly Ferries Company&#39;s service. All the engineers in that service are members of the Institute of Marine Engineers or of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and the company will not accept any others. The largest vessels of the Sydney Ferries Company Limited are not manned by these gentlemen, so that in that regard there is a gross misrepresentation in the circular, misleading to the House, and most undesirable from the stand-point of the public well-being. I believe the amended schedule proposed by the Minister is the best line of compromise that we can get, and I think it will give to the members of this organization all the opportunity that they desire. If they have ability they can utilize it to go as high as they please. All that we ask in the interests of our own trade, and. of the public well-being, is that they should not be permitted to take any step forward unless they can show such competency as will justify it. </para>

          <para>.- With other honorable members, I am pleased that the Minister has endeavoured to meet the difficulty in regard to the employment of third class engineers. The honorable member for Dalley stated that certain information supplied to honorable members is not in accordance with facts so far as the <inline font-style="italic">Brighton</inline> is concerned. If any society is guilty of supplying honorable members with misleading information of this kind, it is doing a very wrong thing, because members cannot be expected to be in touch with all&#39; the technical details of professional occupations; and must be guided by tha information supplied to them. I have no proof beyond the information supplied to me that the Association has members employed on the boats referred to, but I am told that it has five members employed on the <inline font-style="italic">Brighton,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Kuringgai,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Narrabeen.</inline> Notwithstanding the opinion expressed by the Attorney-General, which, of course, carries weight with every honorable member, I am not yet clear in my mind that the Bill meets the case in the way he states. Clause 21 provides - </para>

          <para>Every British steam-ship registered in Australia or engaged in the coasting &#39;trade (other than a limited coast trade or river and bay ship of less than fifteen tons gross registered tonnage), shall be provided with duly certificated engine-room officers and with greasers according to the following scale -  and then sets out a scale which, amongst other things, provides that, in New South Wales, river and bay steam-ships under eighty-five nominal horse-power can carry one third class engineer, while on ships of over eighty-five horse-power no third class engineer can be carried. How can that be said to preserve the existing rights of third class engineers? To-day, in the harbors and rivers of New South Wales no nominal horsepower is specified with regard to the employment of third class engineers. According to the schedule the third class engineer will disappear from all the boats over eighty-five nominal horse-power. </para>

            <para>- Third class engineers can be employed in any river or harbor in New South Wales, irrespective of the vessel&#39;s horse-power. So far as I can see, if clauses 10 and 21 preserve these men&#39;s rights, the schedule conflicts with them, and fakes those rights away. According to the schedule, a vessel of rover 85 horsepower would not be able to carry a third class engineer on any river or harbor ; and under the New South Wales law vessels of only 50 horse-power can be taken anywhere along the coast by a third class engineer. Under the schedule, limited coast-trade vessels will be prevented from carrying third class engineers, and this will lead to the dismissal of men holding third class certificates who are now employed on such vessels. It is useless to say that by clause 21 the existing rights of the engineers are preserved, if you enact in the schedule that third class engineers shall be excluded from the employment in which they are now engaged. My opinion is that under the schedule many of the men to whom I refer will lose their positions, and I want the Minister to make sure that they shall be fully protected. The Attorney-General tells us that the existing rights are protected, but to my mind they are not sure of their position, in view of the requirements of the schedule. I am told that in Victoria a third class engineer can be employed on a steamer of roo horsepower. But as the schedule prohibits the employment of an engineer of that class on any vessel exceeding 85 horse-power, it will mean the loss of a job to several engineers. No doubt the Minister wishes to meet the position, but I think that he should see that it is not being met. It is useless to say to the engineers, &#34; Your rights are preserved,&#34; and to the owners of certain vessels, &#34; You must not employ third class engineers.&#34; With such a conflict of law the result must be that certain third class engineers now in employment will be dismissed. Men who are working on vessels trading along the coast will have to seek employment on harbor and river steamers. This being the effect of the Bill, it cannot be said that their existing rights are preserved. </para>

          <para>. - I find some difficulty regarding the position of engineers. The question appears to be, not whether the certificates of third class engineers will remain in force, but whether, although possessing those certificates, the men may not in some cases be deprived of their jobs because of the requirements of the schedule. Clause 21 says that all uncancelled and unexpired certificates of competency for masters and ships&#39; officers issued under State Acts shall continue to be issued under Commonwealth law. In effect, we tell the holders of certificates that they may still retain them for what they are worth. But if we impose on the owners of ships prohibitions in regard to the employment of the holders of certificates of a certain class,, the result will be that we shall deprive some of the holders of such certificates of their jobs, although they still possess their certificates. A limited coast trade steamer of 200 horse-power and over will be compelled to carry as a minimum, one first class engineer and one second class engineer. Possibly such a vessel is now carrying only one first class and one third class engineer. </para>

I have no practical knowledge of this subject, but it does not seem to me that clause 21 will maintain men in their present jobs. We are requiring the employment of engineers of higher attainments than are now employed on some steamers, and the result must be that some of those now employed must be dismissed. </para>

Some amendment will, I think, be necessary. </para>

            <para>- Very well. I wish to  state now the intention of the Government. The intention of the clause is that not only should the rights of these persons be conserved in a technical sense, but that, included in their rights, opportunities for employment in the same capacity and to the same extent as they now enjoy should not be affected by anything in the Bill so far as a certificate of competency and status is concerned. I am of the opinion that the clause does that. It says -  (1.) All uncancelled and unexpired certificates of competency for masters or ship&#39;s officers issued under any State Act shall continue as if issued under this Act, but shall be valid only for the purposes for which, and to the extent to which, they would have been valid in accordance with the provisions of the State Act under which they were issued. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; but it will be issued under the Bill subject to the qualification that if it was a certificate under a State Act it is to have the same validity as if issued under this Bill for the purposes and to the extent that it would have been valid if issued under a State Act. The whole question is : To what extent is a certificate of competency issued under a State Act now valid? Because, to whatever extent it is now valid it will be valid under the clause. I do not think that we can serve any useful purpose by discussing the matter any more, because we are all trying to do the one thing. The Government are trying to safeguard the rights of these men. If upon inquiry of the Law Officers I find that the opinion which I hold, and about which the honorable and learned member has some doubt, is not upheld, we shall strengthen the clause so as to make the intention perfectly clear. </para>

We are faced with a difficulty which is on all-fours with a difficulty which we experienced in dealing with branches of the Commonwealth Service. We have to unify and apply generally six differing State conditions. It seems to me that honorable members have overlooked the fact that this Bill must not only absolutely safeguard existing rights, but also provide for future contingencies. </para>

            <para>- I think that clause 21 not only guarantees that existing certificates shall be valid under the Federal Act, but specifically enables the holder of any such certificate to surrender it for a certificate of a similar or corresponding grade under the Federal Act. The existing certificates, as well as the existing rights and&#34; privileges, are guaranteed in this measure specifically and categorically, and any new arrangement in regard to qualifying for certificates or introducing new men into the service will be made under the schedule. Seeing that an existing certificate can be surrendered for a similar or corresponding certificate under the Federal Act, it seems to me that not only are existing certificates absolutely protected, but the admission of new qualifying candidates under the schedule is absolutely secured, too. </para>

            <para>-  The terms which the honorable member uses are not applicable to this clause. He referred, for instance, to a &#34;corresponding&#34; certificate. In regard to three certificates, there is no corresponding existing certificate. At present there are three classes of certificates, namely, first class Board of Trade and second class Board of Trade. Then there are three classes of engineers, marine engine-drivers, and so on. It is proposed to substitute for these three new classes of engineers - first class coast engineer, second class coast engineer, and third class coast engineer ; while for petrol marine engines there will be marine engine-drivers. </para>

          <para>. - Clause  21  assures to a man all the rights which he now has. As the Attorney-General interjected rather lengthily, the Bill provides for three classes of coast engineers. There is no such system at present. As I said before, it is quite possible - in fact, very probable - that, directly the Bill is brought into operation, it may be necessary to grade the existing certificates, because the conditions under which they have been issued in the States have varied. It may be held that some of the third class certificates existing to-day are equal to the first class coast certificate to be issued under this Bill. Probably others of them will be found equal to a second class coast engineer&#39;s certificate. Where it has been very easy to obtain a certificate - that is, where there has been no difficult examination to pass- - the certificate will pro*-&#39; bably be held to be equal to a third class coast engineer&#39;s certificate. </para>

          <para>:- According to information which has been supplied to me, the new schedule which is to be substituted for this schedule will make important changes, and greatly increase the scale. I shall give an illustration in connexion with passenger steamers. Take the ordinary seamen and the boys that will be introduced under the Bill. At the present time Inter-State passenger boats carry eighty-one, but under the Bill the number will be  104,  showing an increase of twenty-three. The amendment introduced by the Minister to-day will increase the number to  187,  being an increase of  106  over the present conditions. I have a number of cases here. The illustrations regarding different ships show a great: increase. In the scale of the crew on passenger steamships under the Bill as brought here there will be an increase of four, and under the amendment an increase of nine. Take, for instance, the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra,</inline> with a gross tonnage &#176;f 6&#62;9S3 tons. At present she carries fifteen able seamen, two ordinary seamen - total, seventeen. Under the Bill there would be nineteen able seamen, two ordinary seamen, bringing the total up to twenty-one. Under the amended schedule there are to be nineteen able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and six apprentices, making a total of twenty-six. Under the Bill, therefore, there is to be an increase of four, and under the amendment an increase of nine. That increase runs right through the whole scale of the boats. I ask the Minister if he cannot see his way to reconsider the schedule. I do not think that it is his intention to unduly burden the ship-owners in this connexion. I should like to know why the schedule has been altered at all. </para>

            <para>- My attention has been drawn to the schedule as it originally stood in the Bill. There are many vessels trading in the South Australian gulfs which do not carry a mate. I am informed that there are no steamers plying in the gulfs. Some of them make voyages of only four hours&#39; duration, moving from one side of a gulf to the other. There are also about sixty sailing ketches. I have made inquiries, and believe that these ketches as a rule have a registered tonnage not exceeding 50. If that be so they will not be much affected, because I understand that &#34; over 50 tons &#34; means over 50 tons gross. If so, these vessels will come under the description of river and bay ships. In South Australia vessels under 50 tons are not obliged to carry a mate. I have a memorandum before me from a man who owns several of these ships, in which he says that the present system in South Australia is not to require a mate for vessels under 100 tons trading within the State. Has the Minister any information as to how these South Australian vessels will be affected? The schedule does not mention whether the tonnage is gross or net. </para>

          <para>- I have circulated an amendment to insert after the word &#34; officers &#34; the words &#34; including a duly qualified medical practitioner as prescribed.&#34; The object of my amendment is to make the first paragraph of the schedule read - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>Every ship shall be provided with duly certificated officers, including a duly certificated medical practitioner as prescribed. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Subsequently I desire to move the insertion of similar words under the heading &#34; Steam-ships.&#34; Perhaps honorable members are not aware that on many ships coming to Australia the medical man is paid only is. per month. I desire to do away with that sort of thing. I think that every vessel of upwards of 1,000 tons, registered for carrying passengers, should carry a duly-qualified medical practitioner, who should be properly remunerated. Inasmuch as a new schedule has been brought forward, I hardly know where my amendment would come in; but by courtesy of the Minister I am speaking now in order to explain my intention. It must be within the knowledge of every one that persons travelling by sea are not only liable to nearly every illness which may occur on land, but, in addition, to illnesses and accidents that are peculiar to the sea. It is the height of absurdity to expect trained men to look after the welfare of human beings at the munificent remuneration of  is.  per month and found. The China Navigation Company, to its honour, was the first shipping company to recognise Australian-born officers, from the captain downwards. This company pays a fair sum to its medical officers, equal to about the pay of a first mate. The Eastern line of steamers also pays its medical officers fair salaries. The Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies used to pay a nominal salary, and the medical officer was supposed to receive tips. Speaking personally, I have been medical officer on four steamers, and am glad to say that the indignity of a tip was never offered to me. Therefore, I never had the opportunity of refusing one. This is a monumental Bill, which we hope will confer advantages on our officers and seamen. I desire to make it mandatory on shipping companies to carry trained medical men on their vessels. I am informed that under Japanese law, if even a collier makes a return journey of over 1,000 miles, she must carry a duly-qualified medical officer. </para>
        <para class="block">I believe that many valuable lives would have been saved if there had been a medical man on board some of the ships, making even so short a journey as from Australia to New Zealand. One instance stands out in my recollection. I refer to the case of that great Englishman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> whose death might have been avoided if there had been a doctor on board the ship on which he was travelling from Sydney to New Zealand. A medical man would probably have observed the premonitory symptoms, would have prescribed complete rest, and then the small artery in the brain, the bursting of which caused <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon&#39;</inline> s death, might not have given way. I trust that the Minister will give consideration to my proposal and that the Committee will determine that ships of over 1,000 tons shall not be permitted to undertake voyages without carrying a qualified medical practitioner on board. If the amendment in the schedule be agreed to, it will involve the recommittal and amendment of clause 4, giving the Governor-General power to make regulations for &#34; the fixing of the remuneration to be paid to the medical practitioner.&#34; </para>

          <para>. - I am in cordial sympathy with the ideas expressed by the honorable member for Melbourne, and I think the Minister might take into consideration something which is, at any rate, as important as the carrying of a medical man. There ought to be provision made on vessels for proper surgical treatment should occasion arise. For instance, appendicitis can be treated with almost absolute safety in a modern hospital; but on a ship, where there is no possibility of aseptic treatment, it is, I am told, most? dangerous to touch a patient with the surgeon&#39;s knife. It would not cost very much to provide for surgical operations, and there is no doubt that something of the kind is necessary. A relative of my own, who was travelling from England some years ago, developed appendicitis in the Red. Sea, and, though it was in the month of August, had to travel all the way to Australia before the necessary surgical relief could be safely given. </para>

            <para>- I would not be sure as to that. The amendment suggested by the honorable member for Melbourne, referring as it does to vessels of  1,000  tons and upwards, would apply to most of the cargo boats trading round Australia, and I am not sure that it would be a wise provision to insert. If the honorable member desires to carry his amendment, perhaps the better course would be for him to move the recommittal of clause  133,  and have it there made. My own opinion is that we had better try the Bill as it is ; though, no doubt, the time will come when doctors will have to be carried in other vessels than those prescribed. </para>

          <para>.- As surgeon at is. a month I twice brought immigrants out to Australia, and I may say that the medicines authorized by the Board of Trade were of the crudest, while the instruments prescribed by .the same body were so old that I had to go to the museum of St. Mary&#39;s Hospital and borrow instruments in order to comply with the regulations. I do not think I could give a more absurd example, though I must say that since then there has been an improvement so far as the Board of Trade is concerned. If, however, a person were to develop typhoid in Ceylon on any ship other than one of the big shipping companies which trade to Australia, he would have to be doctored by the captain, who may or may not be lucky enough to hit upon the right medicine. The life of a sailorman is just as valuable to his family as is the life of any other man ; and the accommodation provided for him in the past has been so terrible that, but for the fresh air on deck, his average length of life would have been much shorter on account of the lack of proper ventilation in his quarters. Even the forecastle on an up-to-date steamer is not all that could be desired, and there has been much agitation on the subject from the time of Plimsolll 1. I contend that a sailorman should have as much care taken of him as has an ordinary passenger. There is hardly a medical man of any large practice in Australia but who knows of cases on board ship, which, for lack of proper treatment, have resulted in permanent injury ; and I think something should be done to remedy the present state of affairs, for the sake of common humanity. The whole of the four vessels of the China Navigation Company are registered under  750  tons, so that it will be seen that a vessel of  1,000  tons is much above the average. Whether the doctor be regarded as a deck hand or an engine-room hand is scarcely worth discussing; but I understand that the salaries from the captain downward are fixed by the shipping companies themselves. </para>

            <para>- The Dutch Packet Company affords an excellent example, inasmuch as they give the highest pay for white officers of all the ships that visit our port, not even excepting the great mail steamers. Dutch Packet Company captains are allowed to retire at the age of forty-five on a pension of &#163;200, and they draw as high as&#163;1,000 a year in salary. I do not suggest such high salaries as that ; but I say that a doctor ought to be rated with the first officer, for no one will deny that the education of a medical man equals, at all events, that of a ship&#39;s captain. Shipping companies would then not select men who merely desired to save the expense of a voyage, but would, as some of the greater companies do, engage a doctor for a year or three years. This would result in a better class of men being employed, and the passengers and crew would, have the advantage of modern medical science. </para>

          <para>.- Some time ago I mentioned the matter of the tonnage of river and bay ships required to carry a certificated master. As the new schedule stands, every vessel of over 15 tons gross registered tonnage must carry a certificated master, and a river and bay ship of over 50 tons, and running more than 20 miles, must also carry a mate. It is suggested from South Australia that the tonnage should be fixed at 100 tons. There are a number of vessels in South Australia of about that tonnage that, under the State law, do not carry a master and a mate. Recently, under an Arbitration Court&#39;s award, the obligations of the owners have been very much increased by a considerable addition to the wages paid, the number of holidays allowed, and other concessions. If they are under this Bill to carry on their vessels a greater complement of officers at the higher rates, the measure will largely increase their existing burdens. Some of the vessels trading in the two South Australian gulfs are over 100 tons register. A letter sent to the honorable member for Boothby, and handed to me, suggests that the limit ought to be 100 tons for river and bay ships required to carry one certificated officer. I mention the matter because it is proposed also to increase the manning of engineers. There is a complaint made in another communication which has been received that the manning of engineers proposed by the schedule is excessive, that no distinction is made be tween river and bay ships, and that three steamers that are mentioned will be required to carry two engineers, although they make only a few hours&#39; run on each trip. The limitation of 15 tons to require the carrying of a certificated master is retained in the new schedule, and it is proposed that vessels of over 50 tons must carry a mate in addition to a master. I am informed that the South Australian vessels to which I have referred are very much sought after by engineers because of their short run, and the fact that they are in port every night. It is said, also, that if the proposed schedule is carried there will be one engineer on each of these vessels who will have nothing to do, but who will have to be paid all the same. From Queensland also there is a communication in which it is stated that several of the Inter-State companies have small vessels trading in the Queensland rivers as lighters. They are over 50 tons register, and have only a few hours&#39; run, and it is ridiculous that such vessels should have to carry a mate in addition to a master. I should like to know from the Minister whether there is any substantial objection to altering the 15 tons to 100 tons to meet the case of some hundreds of vessels in the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. - Under the New South Wales law every seagoing vessel, no matter of what tonnage, is required to carry a certificated master. Some of these little boats of less than 50 tons go from here to Tasmania. I can mention one, the <inline font-style="italic">Mary Burgess,</inline> that is used in connexion with the fishing industry. The men in charge of these vessels have masters&#39; certificates. We have agreed to increase the tonnage, in regard to certain matters, from 15 tons to 50 tons, but it must not be forgotten that the schedule as it stands in the Bill, providing only for 15 tons, was agreed to in the Senate, and any alterations we propose in the schedule are in the direction of reducing the obligations on ship-owners. </para>

We are proposing to exempt vessels up to 50 tons net tonnage, which means up to 70 to 100 tons gross tonnage from carrying mates. Honorable members know the type of vessel that will be affected. A great portion of the forepart of these vessels is used as a chain locker, and for the storage of spare gear, and in the after part there is a little cabin for the master and a deck hand, and this is not reckoned in estimating the tonnage. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to a matter which, I think, is worthy of serious consideration. In the portion of the schedule dealing with river and bay ships, it is provided that if they are over 50 tons, and run more than 20 miles from the place of departure, they must carry a mate in addition to the master. I wish to point out that we are overlooking a very necessary precaution in the public interest. There are in Sydney Harbor a number of ferry boats, many of them large vessels, which carry from 1,000 to 1,500 passengers on a trip, but do not run a distance of twenty miles from place to place. It is not a sufficient protection for the travelling public that these vessels should be required to carry only a master. </para>

            <para>-If boats of over 50 tons register, running over 20 miles, are obliged to carry a mate, in addition to a master, where is the justification for permitting a large ferry boat, carrying a large complement of passengers, to be in charge of only one man? The attention of the captain of one of these boats is so much occupied with his duty of navigating his vessel that he can give no attention to passengers. It is, in my opinion, a defect in the Bill that under it such a vessel is required to carry only a master. I do not know how the difficulty should be met, but we might insert a provision requiring a boat carrying more than a certain number of passengers to carry an officer in addition to the master. </para>

            <para>- I should not say that, because some boats carry only one or two passengers. We should adopt every precaution possible to secure the safety of the travelling public, and we shall not do so if we permit this schedule to go through, and require the boats to which I have referred to carry only a master, while much smaller boats, with a run of over 20 miles, usually carrying very few passengers, and earning considerably less, are required to carry a mate as well as a master. The travelling public should be assured that if any accident happens to the captain of one of these boats, there will be some one else on board capable of taking charge of the vessel. </para>

Whether the matter is one which comes within our jurisdiction, or is a matter for State regulation, I am quite unprepared to say. We are dealing with the question of navigation generally ; but, perhaps the Minister will take advice on the point, and certainly, if we have the power to deal with these vessels, we should make some provision in the direction suggested by the honorable member for Hunter. When he is considering this question, I ask the Minister to also consider the point which was raised by the honorable member for Melbourne in regard to the carrying of a medical officer, and that which was urged by the honorable member for Wentworth in respect of providing accommodation on board ships for the performance of surgical operations. </para>

            <para>- Provision has already been made that a surgeon shall be carried under certain circumstances. It is useless to carry a surgeon unless we provide him with suitable accommodation in which to discharge his professional duties. I know of very few ships to-day which are equipped with proper surgical accommodation. It is true that most of them have what is termed a surgery, but it usually consists of a little pantry, which is just large enough to contain a washing basin and sink, together with a few shelves for the storage of medicines. </para>

          <para>.- Unfortunately this schedule appears to be based on the assumption that a ship is more valuable than are the lives of the passengers which she carries. I am rather inclined to support the contention of the honorable member for Hunter that every vessel carrying a certain number of passengers should be obliged to carry an officer in addition to the captain. I think that in section  3  of the schedule we should insert a provision that all ships licensed to carry passengers should be compelled to carry one extra officer. After all, the care of human life on board ship is of primary importance. To commit the safety of passengers into the hands of one man who is subject to the physical infirmities to which we are all subject is not wise. The security of life is of much more importance than is the security of the ship. I suggest that the Minister ought to insist upon a second officer being carried on all ships licensed to carry passengers. </para>

            <para>- I am pleased to hear that. But I think the scale which requires a greaser to be carried on vessels of from 55 to 85 h.p. will apply to these ferry-boats. I would point out to the Minister that on such vessels there would be absolutely nothing for a greaser to do, inasmuch as the engines are stopped every few minutes. Will such vessels be compelled to carry a greaser ? </para>

I would also point out to him that this schedule is a new one, and that it has yet to receive consideration in another place. Should it affect any of the interests which are supposed to be affected by it, representations will doubtless be made by the persons chiefly concerned whilst the measure is under review elsewhere. The matter of requiring greasers to be carried on board such vessels as those mentioned by the honorable member has, I understand, been fixed up. </para>

          <para>.- Whilst the Minister appears anxious to meet the wish of the Committee in this matter, I would point out that in New South Wales to-day third class engineers are employed on steamers of, nominally, 50. h.p. ; whereas the proposed amendment provides that they may be employed on vessels of 40 h.p. If the Attorney-General is correct in his contention that under clause 21 their rights are preserved, well and good; but if, on the other hand, the schedule directs who is to be employed, then their rights will not be preserved, since we are reducing the nominal horse-power from 50 tons to 40 tons. I simply refer to this matter in order that the Minister may give it further consideration. </para>

          <para>.- Are we to understand that the Minister does not intend to alter other parts of the schedule relating to apprentices? If that is the position, then this schedule raises a very serious question regarding the increase of the manning scale. The Minister has withdrawn the old schedule and is adding to the number of seamen and apprentices that must be carried. That part of the schedule which deals with apprentices was not in the Bill as passed by the Senate, and it seems to me that, by means &#39;of this proposal the Government are going to increase very considerably the. manning scale. Let me point out what will be the effect of this new schedule. For instance, the Inter-State passenger steamers now carry eighty-one ordinary seamen and boys; under the Bill as it stands they would have to carry 104, or an increase of twenty-three ; whereas under the new schedule they will have to carry, including apprentices, 187, or a total increase of 106 on the existing scale. When we consider that, in respect of each of these hands, 140 cubic feet of accommodation has to be provided, we must recognise that this increase in the manning scale must mean a very considerable encroachment upon the boat space. </para>

            <para>- The Government are asking this House to do what that Committee ought really to do. In order to illustrate what the effect of this new schedule will be upon the Inter-State companies, let me point out that at present the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra,</inline> 6,953 gross tons, carries 15 A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S., or a total of 17. Under the Bill as passed by another place, she would have to carry 19 A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S., or a. total of 21 ; whereas under this amendment she will have to carry 19 A.B.&#39;s, 1 O.S., and 6 apprentices, or a total of 26. In other words, the present scale will be increased by 9. Then, again, the <inline font-style="italic">Kanowna,</inline> a vessel of 6,942 gross tons, carries 15 A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S. Under the Bill she would carry 19 A.B.&#39;s, and 2 O.S.; whereas under this amended schedule she will have to carry 19 A.B.&#39;s, 1 O.S., and 6 apprentices. In that case also there will be an increase of 9 in the manning scale. The <inline font-style="italic">Levuka,</inline> a vessel of 6,129 gross tons, carries 15 A.B.&#39;s and 4 O.S. Under the Bill she would have to carry 19 A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S. ; whereas under this new schedule she will have to carry 18 A.B.&#39;s, 1 O.S., and 6 apprentices, or an increase of 6 on present requirements. The <inline font-style="italic">Riverina,</inline> a vessel of 4,758 gross tons, carries at present 11 A.B.&#39;s and 4 O.S. Under the Bill she will have to carry 15 A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S., or a total of 17 ;&#39; whereas under this new schedule she will have to carry 15 A.B.&#39;s, 1 O.S., and 4 apprentices, an increase of 5 on the present scale. The <inline font-style="italic">Ulimaroa,</inline> 5,777 gross tons, carries 13 A.B.&#39;s and 3 O.S. Under the Bill as passed by another place, she would have to carry 17 A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S.; whereas under this provision she will have to carry 17 A.B.&#39;s, 1 O.S., and 5 apprentices, or an increase of 7. The <inline font-style="italic">Wyreema,</inline> 6,338 gross tons, carries 15 A.B.&#39;s and 4 O.S. Under the Bill she would have to carry 18&#39; A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S. ; whereas under this provision she will have to carry 1.8 A.B.&#39;s, 1 O.S., and 6 apprentices, or a total of 25 as against her present complement of 19. The <inline font-style="italic">Zealandia,</inline> 6,660 gross tons, carries 14 A.B.&#39;s and 3 O.S. Under the Bill she would have to carry 19 A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S. ; whereas under this new schedule she will have to carry 19 A.B.&#39;s, 1 O.S., and 6 apprentices, or a total of 26 as against 17 at present carried. Finally, the <inline font-style="italic">Warilda,</inline> 7,712 gross tons, which at present carries 16 A.B.&#39;s and 3 O.S. , would have to carry 21 A.B.&#39;s and 2 O.S. under the Bill ; whereas under this new schedule she will have to carry 21 A.B.&#39;s, 1 O.S., and 6 apprentices, or an increase of 9. </para>

Has this new scale been framed with the object of meeting such a contingency ? As a matter of fact, the Government are simply proposing to make an increase in the number of apprentices to be carried.

        <para>Mir. HUGHES (West Sydney- Attorney-General) &#91;3.44&#93;- - The Government are asked to explain- why they have made an alteration in the schedule with regard to apprentices and boys. In view of the attitude of the Board of Trade and the shipping companies of Great Britain, I do not think that&#39; such a question need have been put. The condition of things that was tolerated by the Board of Trade for twenty years is one that finds no apologists in the United Kingdom to-day. By general consent it is now admitted that vessels, so far as the safety of passengers was concerned, were undermanned. This Bill gives certain very real advantages to the Australian shipping companies. All that they are asked to do in return is to employ Australian seamen, and pay them a decent wage. Take the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra</inline> as a typical boat. She will carry six boys. At the present time, apparently, she carries none, but I do not think that can be true. If she does not, it is about time that she started, because we want our mercantile marine to be a nursery for the production of sailors. The great shipping companies of Great Britain have recognised that sacrifices must be made in order that seamen may be trained. I say emphatically that in* view of the fact that we have to defend what we have got first by a ring of naval defence, we ought to do everything in our power to encourage men to go to sea, and provide opportunities for them to do so. We ask that in a great boat like the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra</inline> six apprentices or six boys shall be carried. It is not imperative for them to take apprentices ; they can take apprentices or boys. I frankly admit that I would rather have confined them to apprentices, but an uproar has been made because of the accommodation for apprentices. It seems, for some mysterious reason, that an apprentice must be lodged and fed better than a boy, although I am totally unable to say why. Although there is a difference of names, there is no difference in the thing. We are asking them to carry six boys or apprentices, and they object. Why? I ask any honorable member who desires to build up an Australian mercantile marine that may be useful as a nursery for seamen, and as a means of continually replacing our marine as it dies off by men who have been trained to the sea, what possible exception can be taken to this provision? I do not deny that it would mean a little extra expense, but that cannot be much. In a memorandum issued this year by the  President  of the Board of Trade, reference is made to the safety of life at sea in connexion with merchant shipping. The following passage regarding the manning of boats shows how completely views have changed during the past few months in regard to what is sufficient on board ship - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It is evident that the large addition made by the new rules to the number of lifeboats required to be carried by certain classes of vessels must raise at once the question of the sufficiency of the crew, and their efficiency to handle and manage the boats. The Board of Trade have no power to make a statutory life-saving rule prescribing a scale of manning for various classes of vessels. They have, however, power, under section 305 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, to require emigrant ships to be manned with an efficient crew to the satisfaction of the emigration officer; and under the Merchant Shipping Act 1897 they can detain as unseaworthy a vessel which, by reason of under-manning, is unfit to proceed to sea without serious danger to human life. Under each of these widely differing powers the Board of Trade have in the past given instructions to their officers as to the minimum number of deck hands to be carried by emigrant and passenger and cargo ships respectively of various sizes. These instructions are being revised so as to secure a sufficient complement of efficient boat hands to deal with the total number of boats which will now be required to be carried, and to be manned in an emergency. It is proposed that, in foreign-going passenger steamers, within certain limits, the boat hands must be efficient deck hands, while outside those limits seamen of other ratings may be drawn to make up the complement, provided that they satisfy the Board of Trade by certificate or otherwise of their competence as boat hands. </para>

        <para class="block">There is, therefore, ample ground for our changing and enlarging the provisions, so far as the manning scale is concerned.

          <para>.- Whatever force there may be in the reply of the Attorney-General in regard to the employment of apprentices, I think he cannot for the same reason object to my suggestion that the proportion of firemen or trimmers to tons of coal turned out ought to be fixed at one in five. I interjected that suggestion when the Minister was speaking. In 1896, according to the report of the Navigation Commission, the Board of Trade fixed a proportion of one to three, but the Imperial Conference of 1907 thought that they could not equitably fix any proportion, and that either the matter ought to be left to a Committee, or that a provision should be put in the Navigation Bill that the ship must be seaworthy in respect of the complement of crew, which would include all hands. As a matter of fact, we have that provision in our Bill. We have adopted what the Imperial Conference recommended, but we are going beyond that by putting in a provision, which is objected to by a good many,  that a certain number of trimmers and firemen must be carried in proportion to the output of coal, the proportion being fixed at one to three and a half. To some extent that is modified by the fact that the Minister may submit the matter to a Marine Council or a Committee, who may recommend an alteration dependent on the circumstances of the particular vessel; but as we are fixing a scale now we ought to fix the scale that has been accepted, I understand, by both the Seamen&#39;s Unions and the Federated Ship-owners Association. The average of the agreements is more nearly one to five. I know that in the case of one vessel it is one to 4.8. By altering the proportion, which is at present in practice before any committee has met, we are really upsetting the terms of some of the agreements already entered into. </para>

        <para> He said, in the first place, that we must endeavour to build up an Australian mercantile marine. This means more than building up our Australian commercial enterprises. It means an establishment of flesh and blood to man our Australian ships. Why, then, are  the Government taking out the stipulation that apprentices must be carried, and allowing the ships to carry either apprentices  or  boys? Is this another concession to the already well-treated shipping ring? </para>

            <para>- I am glad to see apprentices provided for, and want to see them retained. Why should they be taken out and a ship allowed to carry any casual boy, who may be used for all jobs for one voyage, and fired off at the end of it? The Attorney-General said that the ships had to treat apprentices better than boys. That is an extraordinary argument to urge in favour of abolishing apprentices. Are we in favour of worse treatment for boys on ships? Is that why the change from apprentices to boys has been made ? </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Another astonishing argument from the Attorney-General, indorsed by interjection by the Minister of Trade and Customs, was that it was necessary to pass this schedule in order to man the boats. Will honorable members examine the schedule, and see what an absurd pretence that is, or, if not, what a hollow fraud the second part of the schedule is? The first part deals with passenger steam-ships carrying not more than ten passengers, and cargo steamships. A vessel of that class, of between  1,500  and  2,000  tons net register, has to carry nine able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and one apprentice, or eleven hands in all. If now we turn to passenger steam-ships of the same size, we find that a vessel that can carry any number of passengers that she can get on board, must carry just one extra apprentice, so that there is to be one extra boy to do all the manning of all the boats for all the hundreds of passengers that the ship carries ! The thing is a farce ! What is the use of insulting the Committee with such an argument? There must be some reasonable basis for providing this scale. I would prefer it in the original form, providing for apprentices, and not for &#34; apprentices or boys.&#34; If, as the honorable member for Darling Downs was told, it is a case of insuring the safety of those on the ship, the schedule dealing with passenger steam-ships should provide for twice as many hands as on cargo steam-ships. What is the use of trying to humbug us in this way? I hope that when the Bill goes to another place its closing hours will not be defaced by such an appeal to prejudice and sentiment as we have heard - an appeal not borne out by the actual wording of the measure itself. If any one will help me to divide the Committee on this question, I shall be happy to do so. I trust that all those who are in favour of good conditions, which the Attorney-General says are necessary for apprentices, but are not necessary for boys, will vote with me, in order to secure the building up of that Australian mercantile marine upon which the Attorney-General laid such great stress when asking us to abolish apprentices, so far as this schedule is concerned. </para>

          <para>. - While I admit the importance of building up a mercantile marine, I cannot see that apprentices can be trained on board colliers or coastal steamers. It is on sailing vessels that boys learn to become seamen. A boy on a steamer gets no knowledge of seamanship. Like a certain &#34; ruler of the Queen&#39;s Navee,&#34; his business is chiefly to polish up the handle and brasswork generally. Seeing that the manning scale provided is fairly good, there seems to be no reason for the amendment. I know that seamen are of opinion that there is nothing for apprentices to learn on board steamers. There are not very many young Australians on our coasting steamers and colliers, the crews being composed chiefly of men who years ago learned their business on sailing vessels. </para>

          <para>. - I am at a loss to understand the situation. According to the definition clause -  &#34; Seaman &#34; means every person employed or engaged in any capacity on board a ship, except masters, pilots, and apprentices and persons temporarily employed on the ship in port : </para>

        <para class="block">I should like to know what is the relation of an apprentice to a seaman, and of a boy to an apprentice? What is the apprentice to be taught? In my opinion, these provisions are very loosely framed, and it is difficult to understand what is intended. What are boys going to do on board these vessels? They will surely learn something about the working of the vessels on which they are employed. Why, then distinguish between a boy and an apprentice? What work will a boy do that an apprentice may not do? Is it not necessary to have a definition embracing every youth of a given age employed on a vessel, terming him an apprentice ? I urge the Minister to look more carefully into the matter before coming to any determination. </para>

          <para>. - I support the schedule as it is proposed to amend it. In former years, a boy going to sea learned a trade which was useful to him, but things have changed, so that to apprentice a boy to the sea is to waste his time. If a boy, after being at sea for a voyage or two, likes the life, he can remain at it and become efficient. If he were apprenticed, and found that he did not like it, and that it gave him no outlook, he would have to waste a number of years before he could get free. In a good many trades besides that of the seaman, apprenticeship is becoming a thing of the past, because there is so much specialization. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to refer to the question of providing for apprentices on sailing ships. It was proposed, in the first place, that we should provide for an apprentice to learn the trade of an able-bodied seaman on a steam-ship. I think that most of the seamen on steamships learned their seamanship on sailing vessels. </para>

The matter has been looked into, and it is thought, after consideration, that it is a provision which ought not to be included in this Bill, but should be made the subject of a separate measure. That being the view of the Government, it is not their intention to accept the proposal. </para>
