                        <para>- Communications with Canada have taken place through the Minister of Trade and Customs, who will be able to give the honorable member, later, more detailed information than I have at present, but I am able to say that Canada has expressed herself in favour of improved trade relations. The most recent cable from that country is to the effect that further time is desired to consider the matter, and a personal interview between parties representing both countries concerned has been asked for. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister of Customs for Canada wrote to me early this year on the question, and expressed a desire that we should exchange lists of the articles on which we were prepared to give each other the best Tariff arrangement. I forwarded to him a list embracing such commodities as meat, butter, fruit, wool, hides, and skins, and so forth, and told him that I was anxious to hear from him. No list, however, has been forwarded from Canada. My letter was acknowledged by cable, and about a fortnight ago I cabled asking for the list. The reply was that the Canadian Minister of Customs was engaged on the Imperial Trade Commission, and that my cable would be repeated to him. That is how the matter stands at present - we have forwarded a list, but no list has been sent to us. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to ask the Honorary Minister representing the Minister of Defence a question arising out of a recent meeting of the Lithgow Political "Labour League. At that meeting a discussion took place on a report that two working men at the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory did not belong to any trades organization. In view of the declaration of Federal Ministers that preference must be given to unionists, the secretary was instructed to write to the manager of the factory calling attention to the case. Will the Minister state if these two men have been dismissed from the service, or forced into the ranks of the union? </para>

                                <para>- The Attorney-General was quite in order in using the words he did. A question was asked as to a certain statement alleged to have been made outside; and, now that the matter has been raised, I may say that I do not think there should be such frequent necessity for me to intervene in regard to the form in which questions are asked. Honorable members are stating what they say are facts, and, by putting the questions in the form, " Is it not a fact," they technically bring them within the category of questions that may be asked. When honorable members know that certain things have been reported, as set out in the newspapers, I do not think it is necessary for them to ask a question on the point. In this case, the Attorney- General was quite in order in answering in the way he did. I did not understand him to say directly that what an honorable member had said was untrue. </para>

                                <para>- I understood that what took place was as follows : Application was made by the defendants for a date to be fixed for the hearing, and it was stated that they could not be ready before a certain date. The Court then said that the appeal would either have to be heard on the date mentioned by the Chief Justice, or stand over until the new year. The Crown refused to assent to that, but was willing, I think, to agree to the appeal being heard some time in August. The Chief Justice wished to put it down for hearing, I think, late in July. It is, therefore, quite untrue to say that the Crown is, in any sense Of the word, responsible for the delay, or that it has concurred in any delay, beyond that which the circumstances of the case required. </para>

What took place outside the Court, according to the honorable member for Bourke, was this: On nth June the honorable member for Ballarat, at Ballarat, in the course of a speech, made the following remarks, according to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Age -</inline></para>

                                <para>-  I do not want to make a speech, but there has been made upon the honour of the Crown, and upon my Department,  a reflection under which I decline to sit, and it has been made in the form of a question which, with your permission, I propose to answer. I shall confine myself strictly to the question put, and the remarks made, and the subsequent extracts read by the honorable member for Wentworth. The inference drawn by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat is that what happened was a ' ' curious ' ' thing. Now, what precisely does that mean ? There is nothing legally curious about it. Nothing on earth is more common. Therefore, it must be meant that it was curious from a political stand-point, and from an honorable stand-point, and, therefore, that there was something rotten in it. </para>

I shall content myself by saying now that the instruction! given to the counsel for the Crown by me, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powers,</inline> before his leaving this State, was that under no circumstances was any proceeding to be delayed, or he to be absent from this country upon the first occasion on which the case could come on. </para>

                        <para>I shall lay on the table of the House the correspondence which passed between me and the Crown Solicitor, by which his absence from this country will be shown to be clearly contingent upon his return upon the first day upon which this case could be heard. Those are the clear and unmistakable facts. I see nothing " curious " about them. </para>

In fact, there was a probability at that time that none would appeal. Since then all the defendants have given notice of appeal, and some propose to go on with it, but I believe not all. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powers</inline> that he must be back here in time for the appeals whenever they would be heard, and counsel for the Crown had no instructions at all to do anything other than what I have said. </para>

                                <para>- May I invite the Attorney-General to reconsider the very serious statement he has made about the counsel representing the Crown - a statement which is not called for or warranted by any question that we have put? The issue as to where counsel obtained his authority for concurring in the proposal for an adjournment, or why, is an entirely different thing. We have not raised it. My statement; which the Attorney-General contradicted, was that counsel for the Crown had publicly concurred in an application for an adjournment. The honorable and learned gentleman has now admitted it. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable and learned member for Ballarat says that some of my remarks were not warranted by the question, but this question cannot stand by itself. It was a question asked really for political purposes. During the election at Werriwa, statements on the same lines were repeatedly made which could bear only one inference, and that was that the Crown was corrupt in this matter. </para>

                                <para>- I have already answered the honorable member, but he has omitted to take notice of my remarks. I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powers,</inline> in his letter to me, mentioned the date - which I cannot recall - on which it was probable that the case would be heard, and said he would make his arrangements to be back on that date. " I said that, whether the case came on upon that date or any other date, he would have to be back in Australia when it did come on. He has been cabled that the case, is set down for July, and he is returning accordingly. </para>

                        <para>- When the Government has a wireless station open for public business, vessels in Australian ports will not be allowed to send communications on a commercial basis which could be sent by the Government station. If a vessel moored to a wharf in one of our ports were allowed to communicate with another of the same line, or of any other line, it would interfere with the revenue of the Government wireless station. The <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline> could easily have been communicated with from Melbourne had the Government station there been asked to send a message to her. </para>

                        <para>- This matter has been under consideration for some time. It was mentioned, I think, before the Tariff Commission, of which the honorable member for Perth was a member. The desirableness of having some test of these pea-rifles was suggested, but I am afraid that if we start to prohibit everything that may give rise to accident, we shall have to go much further than pea-rifles. </para>

                    <para>. - Following well-founded custom and usage in regard to a -notice of this kind by the Leader of the Opposition, I think we ought to take time to deliberate 'over it. I have only to say that, in accordance with the statement made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Parramatta, at the end of last session, the Government refrained from taking Supply beyond the end of the financial year, lt may, therefore, be necessary, before the close of the debate upon the Address-in-Reply, to obtain one month's Supply. Subject to an agreement to give Supply, if desired, on the basis of the old Estimates, I shall be prepared to at once agree to the resumption of the debate to-morrow, and will afterwards move the adjournment of the House. </para>
