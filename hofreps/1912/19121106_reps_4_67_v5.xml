                                V. Francis, Superintendent of Railways of the Northern Territory, who came to Melbourne in connexion with the survey of the proposed railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, visited Adelaide towards the end of September last, with a view of obtaining all available information in the possession of the South Australian Government regarding the trial survey which was made from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges, a distance of about 300 miles.

                                Stewart, Engineer-in-Chief for South Australia, with the result that arrangements have been made for all the available plans and data in connexion with the trial survey referred to to be forwarded to this Government. So far, this material has not come to hand. However, I expect before the session closes to be able to submit for the consideration of the House a proposal in connexion with a railway survey of the country from Oodnadatta to the Katherine River.

                        <para>.- I am afraid it is too late to do anything in the matter, but when clause 40 was under consideration, the suggestion was made that two copies of every book published in Australia should be sent to the Commonwealth Library. In this connexion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> has made a very useful suggestion which I understand has been communicated to the Attorney-General. The suggestion is that we might make it a condition of protection in Australia of any book published in the United Kingdom, that copies shall be furnished to the Commonwealth Library. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick&#39;s</inline> idea is that we should arrange with the Imperial Government for a provision to be inserted in the English Act, or for us to make a provision under the power of modification, so long as we do not touch the substance, that one of the six copies which have to be sent to the British Museum for distribution amongst the bodies specified in the English Act, shall be sent to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> points out that some of the institutions which get these copies, such as the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, can very well afford to buy them. They are in close touch with the publishing world, and can, from moment to moment, obtain works they require, whereas, in our case, not more than one-sixth, on an average, of the IO,000 works published in England, and a similar average of the works published in the United States, reach this country. It does not pay the booksellers to have copies sent out on the chance of their being sold, and the result is that the Commonwealth Library Committee are rather limited in their selection. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> further suggests that there should be kept in the Commonwealth a register of the books sent to the Commonwealth Library. At present the British Museum does the registration, since the abolition of the Stationers&#39; Hall. The registration of patents rights is a distinct matter altogether; and the idea is that a copyright registration, similar to that at the British Museum, might be connected with the Commonwealth Library. Again, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> suggests that there should also be a Commonwealth Library circular in which should be recorded all the books sent to Australia. As to the proposal that two copies of every book published in Australia should be sent to the Commonwealth Library, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> thinks it would be better if the collection of these books were left to the State public libraries who are more in touch with the publishers. I believe there are more than 1,000 printing presses working in the Commonwealth at the present time; and it would be difficult for the Commonwealth Library Committee to find out what really is being published in the shape of books within the meaning of the Act, which covers more publications than are books in the ordinary sense. The idea is that the State libraries should make a collection and forward one copy of each book to the Commonwealth Library Committee. The circular would be sent periodically to the great public libraries of the Empire, and even of the Continent. At present there is no official record of the books published in Australia and circulated beyond the limits of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> was for many years literary agent for colonial publishers and author&#39;s in London, and has a great knowledge of the feeling of the trade at Home in these matters. He sent a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Athenaeum</inline> which indorsed his suggestion, and he informed the Library Committee in a circular that the publishers at Home, from his knowledge, would jump at the proposal. The <inline font-style="italic">Athenaeum</inline> described the idea as a splendid one, which could easily be put into practice. The result would be that the Commonwealth Library would get a copy of every book published, instead of only for selection one-sixth of the publications as at present. The collection of the books at Home could be done through the agents, who at present collect the books which are sent here for criticism, and so forth. As to the cost, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> does not think it would exceed ^250, while the actual annual saving in outlay would be about .&#163;2,000, and we should get a perfectly up-to-date collection. The local collection through the State libraries was discussed in some measure on clause 40, but the Imperial collection of books seems to have been largely overlooked. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick</inline> communicated with the Australian publishers as to the suggestion that two copies of every book published in Australia should be supplied, and they expressed themselves as willing to supply them, merely asking in return some acknowledgement, which he thinks could be furnished by a record in the proposed circular. This circular, I believe, would be subscribed for by every public reading institution, including, of course, our great public libraries. Since last week I have made inquiries in Adelaide as to the difficulty im obtaining books from publishers,, and I am told that it is exceedingly difficult in the States to make a collection, for, in some cases, it is only under threat of&#39; prosecution that they are supplied. These difficulties would be intensified if the responsibility were thrown on the Commonwealth Library. However, as I have said, I am afrai&#39;d it is too late to do anything now, and I regret that the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick,</inline> which 1 understand was, in substance at all events, communicated to the Government, was not considered early enough to be made use of. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petherick,</inline> it would have been indorsed at Home. It received the approval of some of the leading literary papers published in England, and fell into line with the desires expressed here. All&#39; that was wanted was sufficient acknowledgment of the publication they were having carried out. </para>

                    <para>.- On Friday last a good deal of time was occupied by the Opposition in trying to show that the Labour party has at last launched upon a policy of borrowing. Let me say, at the beginning, that the Labour party has always said that it would borrow for works that would be self-supporting. The members of the Opposition have endeavoured to make the public of Australia believe that we now propose to borrow in the same way that they would have borrowed, and that the Governments of the States have borrowed. They have asked us to admit openly that our policy is similar to theirs. I wish to point out how strongly- the two policies contrast. The honorable member for Parkes referred to the proposal of the Opposition to borrow ^3,500,000 for the construction of a navy, the loan to be repaid within sixteen years by means of a sinking fund. He claimed that our policy is similar to the policy under which that proposal was made. That is not so. In the first place, we have determined not to borrow for naval purposes, realizing that men-of-war have a definite and limited life. According to the authorities, a warship becomes obsolete within about ten years. The purposes for which we now wish to borrow are the acquisition of a site for a post office in Western Australia, which will be a reproductive work returning interest, and therefore a good investment, and the meeting of the indebtedness incurred by South Australia in connexion with the Northern Territory, a liability which we took over on the transference of the Territory to our control. Had ^3,500,000 been borrowed for the construction of a navy according to the proposal of the Opposition, the vessels would have become obsolete at the end of ten years, so that for six years the people of Australia would have been paying interest on the whole amount, together with the pro vision for the sinking fund, at the same time finding money for new vessels. For six years the people would have been paying 3J per cent, interest and 1 per cent, for a sinking fund contribution on ^3,500,000 borrowed to construct vessels which had become obsolete, and at the same time would have had to incur further liabilities in respect of new vessels. The Labour party has not borrowed a shilling for naval construction, having paid for everything out of revenue. We are paying for all defence preparations out of current revenue. Furthermore, we are now proposing to borrow, not from private lenders abroad or in Australia, but from the Trust Funds. How has the Trust Fund been created? It has been created by the payment into it of the money received from the note issue and of the surplus revenue. The money belongs to the people. It can only be used for specific purposes, with the approval of Parliament, and when used for any purpose, the interest paid on it must return to the Trust Funds. We propose to use the money of the people, paying 3J  per cent, interest on the amount used, and returning the interest to the Trust Funds, which, of course, will continue to grow. To-day no less than ^270,000 is earned by the money in the Trust Funds. We have lent money to the Governments of the States&#62; for which they pay interest at rates varying from 3 per cent, to 3 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., and the interest returns to the Trust Funds. Is not that a better arrangement than the system of borrowing from foreign money lenders or within the Commonwealth? Whatever interest is paid returns to the people, so that what is taken out of one pocket is put back into the other, and the Trust Funds go on growing. In ten years or so the amount to the credit of the Trust Funds will be very great, and If rge national undertakings will have been carried out without the public having to pay interest on their cost to the amount of a farthing. The Opposition passed a Loan Act which we have repealed, and although we have been nearly three years in office we have not borrowed a shilling from any private money lender.&#39; o </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta has contended here and outside that we have increased taxation, but the only new tax imposed by the Labour party is the land value tax on estates worth more than  . &#163;5,000.  The Customs duties are the same to-day as they were when the Opposition was in power, so that we have not increased the Customs taxation. In imposing land taxation we put into force the policy that we submitted to the people and on which we were returned, and were therefore true to our principles in regard to it. Persons possessing over  &#163;5,000  worth of property in unimproved land ought to contribute more largely to the revenue than others. The newspapers have stated that the Labour party has caused taxation to increase, but, as a matter of fact, although over  &#163;1,300,000  is obtained from our land tax, there is no other tax for which we are responsible, and the land tax is being paid by the wealthy, the owners of large estates. </para>

                        <para>- It would not dare to do so. The land tax is paid by those who possess land of an unimproved value of  &#163;5,000  or more. In borrowing from the Trust Funds, although interest is taken from the Consolidated Revenue, it goes back to the Trust Funds. If we continue this policy, as I have no doubt we shall, the amount to the credit of the Trust Funds in ten years time will be astonishingly large. The Opposition would borrow for defence, and would constantly increase the interest bill due to the private money lender. According to Admiral Henderson, we shall need  &#163;23,290,000  for our Navy.. If, following the policy of the Opposition, we borrowed that money, and had to pay  31/2  per cent, interest on it, our interest bill would eventually come to  &#163;815,150  per annum, and in addition there would be a contribution to a sinking fund. I ask which is the better policy, that of this Government, which provides out of revalue for all expenditure on naval and military defence, and uses its surplus revenue, which is being paid into the Trust Fund, for the carrying out of large national works, or the borrowing from private individuals of the money needed for defence? We propose to borrow from a fund which belongs to the people who own the transcontinental railway, the post offices, and the Northern Territory. We intend to use their money for the carrying out of national works to improve their property, and the interest on the amount used, instead of going to private money lenders, will go to swell the Trust Fund. </para>

                        <para>- As I have stated, the Trust Fund now earns  &#163;270,000,  and at the expiration of ten years will have some millions to its credit. Is not our policy one that will meet with the approval of Australia? The Opposition would borrow for purposes of defence, and pay interest on the money borrowed to the private money lender, here or abroad. We, on the other hand, are constructing public works out of revenue, and the people will reap the benefit of the whole of the accumulated interest on the Trust money which we are using. I rose principally to put that aspect of the matter before the Committee, and feel assured that when the people of Australia learn the true position, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> they will do within the next few months, they will be quite satisfied with the financial policy of this Government. They will realize to the full the difference between the financial policy of the previous Government and that inaugurated by the present Ministry, and there need be no fear as to what their decision will be when all the facts are placed before them. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Hunter does not seem to be at all diffident, but speaks with the utmost confidence as to the correctness of the policy adopted by the Government. He expressed some anxiety regarding the pockets of the taxpayers; but as long as our taxation does not come out of the pockets of a certain section he is quite satisfied. He forgets that only  14,000  persons primarily pay the land tax to which he referred ; probably the actual number, in the ultimate result, is much larger, but since primarily the tax is paid by only  14,000  persons, I do not think it was right for him to speak as he did concerning this form of taxation. The honorable member seemed to think that the Government had an illimitable amount to the credit of the Trust Funds. </para>

                        <para>- I am simply pointing out that there is not a very large sum to the credit of the Trust Funds. The Government should tell us where they are going to obtain this money. It is not quite right for them to say that they are going to borrow money from thirty or forty Trust Funds; they should tell us what particular funds they are going to use. To what item or items of this fund are they going to charge this money? </para>

                        <para>- There is legal power to do this until the money is wanted for the purpose for which it is voted. The financial policy of the Government is an extraordinary one. They raise from the people far more money than is required, and place the surplus into various Trust Funds. When the Old-age Pensions Bill was passed, the Parliament intended that the money necessary for the purpose should be voted annually, just as was done in connexion with other projects undertaken by us. We find, however, that the Government have raised considerably more money than is required. In respect of old-age pensions, they had at the end of last year an unexpended balance of &#163;1,153,411,. whilst in respect of the building of the Fleet they bad put by &#163;1,196,828, which had not been spent. It is a well-known axiom that the people should not be taxed to a greater extent than is necessary to meet current expenditure. It is not in accordance with the ordinary financial business arrangements of a country for nest-eggs to be put away, but here we have in respect of these two items nearly &#163;2,500,000 taken out of the pockets of the taxpayers and placed to the credit of Trust Funds, to be manipulated as required by the dominant majority. Such a system of finance is neither safe, proper, nor justifiable. There is no attempt made by the Government even to pay their liabilities. The debt on the transferred properties amounts to &#163;9,000,000, and the Government are paying interest on it after haggling with the States as to whether the interest rates should be 3 or 3J per cent. Then, again, there is no attempt on the part of the Ministry to consolidate the State debts, although they had last year a surplus of over two millions. We should not raise in any one year a large sum to be put away as a sort of a nest-egg for future use. The revenue of each year should Be sufficient to meet the expenditure of that year. It seems to me that the policy that is being adopted by the Government is to tax their political opponents. It may be justifiable in time of war to demand toll from any one and every one, but in a reasonable, sensible community political warfare in regard to taxation should not be waged in that way. The Government and their supporters, however, actually rejoice in what they are doing; they say, in effect, that there is no limit to the taxation which should be imposed upon a man who has been fortunate. As a matter of fact, we do not know what are the obligations. of the reputedly wealthy; if we did, we should probably find that many who appear to be rich are really not so. We ought not to make one law for one class and a different one for another, and, generally speaking, we should not spend more money in a year than we can reasonably hope to receive. I hope the time will come when it will not be considered a virtue to set up by taxation and spoliation one class against another. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the right honorable member would like to do right, and that &#34;he loves the virtues he cannot claim.&#34; It seems to me that to tax one section of the community because they are supposed to own broad acres, and to let all the others go free, is unjustifiable, and is spoliation. A good deal has been said by the honorable member for Hunter as to the Government of which I had the honour to be a member and their alleged desire to enter upon a borrowing policy. I can assure the honorable member that there was no such desire on our part if it could be avoided. But the principle I have observed in the administration of public affairs is that the present generation should not be unduly taxed. An undertaking for which the necessary money cannot at once be found out of revenue can easily be carried out when the payments are spread over a number of years. That is, indeed, an everyday business principle. When a man buys a. house he generally pays a deposit, and the balance by instalments. If he assures his life he also pays the premiums by instalments in the hope of obtaining by-and-by a large amount. And so with the Government of a country. Great public works can be carried out by a Government under a loan system accompanied by provision for a sinking fund, which could not possibly be carried out if the whole amount had to be found at once out of current revenue. I need not go further than my own experience to support this point of view. For instance, a great water scheme involving an expenditure of nearly &#163;3,000,000 was urgently required in Western Australia at a time when the population of that State was only 130,000, and when we could not have raised the amount by means of taxation. We decided, however, to obtain authority to borrow the necessary money, by raising a loan, and by that means &#34;we were able to carry out that great work.- It was thought that the pipes would last- at least twenty-one years - our engineering authorities advised us that they would last very much longer - and in order to be on the safe side we provided for a sinking fund of 3 per cent., which meant that in twenty-one years the whole of our indebtedness, in respect of this loan would be paid off. We could not possibly have carried out that work if we had had to find the money out of revenue by additional taxation. </para>

                        <para>- There is a limit even to the Commonwealth&#39;s power of taxation. That was done in 1903, and twelve years hence the sinking fund will have amounted to a sum sufficient to pay off the whole of the principal. When we were in office in 1909, as the Prime Minister knows, it was impossible for us, unless we imposed additional taxation - which we saw no necessity for doing - to order  a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> without temporarily borrowing. What was wrong about a borrowing policy which provided for repayment of principal within sixteen years? I do not see that there would have been as much difficulty in dealing with the matter in that way than was experienced in dealing with it in the way that was adopted by my honorable friends. The same pro cess was followed in each instance. But the plan we adopted would have been easier on the community. When we limit taxation to a few individuals, they cannot cry out very loudly, even if they all cry out together. They are not sufficiently numerous, and that is why my honorable friends have escaped the odium which would have attached to them had the tax been spread over the whole of the landed proprietors of Australia. We saw no reason for increased taxation. The termination of the operation of the Braddon section was close at hand. We knew that within a year or two we would have a good deal more money at our disposal. Not only did my honorable friends receive that additional money, which represented some &#163;2,000,000 odd per annum, but the revenue from Customs and Excise also increased very considerably. I am sure the Prime Minister will admit that no more fortunate party than that which he leads ever occupied the Treasury bench. No sooner did they come into office than the Braddon section ceased to operate, and the Customs receipts increased by leaps and bounds. As a result, the Treasurer has had a very pleasant experience. My experience, both as a State and Federal Treasurer, has been exactly the reverse;. I always had to face difficult times from a financial stand-point. Very much more money was required than was at my command. On the other hand, the Treasurer has had the benefit of good seasons and an overflowing Treasury, in addition to which he has received &#163;1,500,000 from land taxation, for which there was no necessity whatever. The right honorable gentleman also forgets that he has derived a sum of &#163;9,000,000 from the note issue, half of which has been lent to the States on short-dated loans, so that it will soon be returned to the Commonwealth, and will thus be available in connexion with the carrying out of our public works. But I would remind the Treasurer that that money does not belong to- the Government. </para>

Out of the &#163;15,000,000 which are held in trust, &#163;9,000,000 represent notes at call, and we have a liability of another ,&#163;9,000,000 in connexion with the transferred properties. That, too, will have to be paid. Altogether, the lines of the Government have fallen in exceedingly pleasant places. Nobody grudges them their good fortune. We all congratulate them upon it. But the question which we have to put to ourselves is, &#34; Are the people more satisfied now than they used to be?&#34; <inline font-style="italic">-I</inline> shall be very glad to learn from the honorable member for Hunter, who has a large experience in New South Wales, that the people of Australia are better satisfied than they used to be. I understand that a considerable amount of the money which will be raised under this Bill is required to purchase land in Perth upon which to erect a post-office. I hope that the Government will push on with that work now that they have put their hands to it. Nothing is so unsatisfactory as delay in these matters, and, unfortunately, there is a good deal of that sort of thing. </para>

                        <para>- Considering that the buildings upon the site carry a rental of &#163;10,000 a year, it does not look as if the Government made a bad bargain. I have no objection to the Bill on its merits. I do not know why it was not possible to do without this proposed loan. Before resuming my seat I should like te* ask where this money is to come from? I hardly think it is right to take it from the Trust Funds. That seems to me a slipshod method of doing business, and, moreover, I do not think it is within the law. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to make a few observations on this Bill. In regard to great public improvements, honorable members opposite are constantly saying that we should load posterity with a certain amount of the burden. But we have to recollect that we are the posterity of preceding generations - we ourselves have to carry a heavy financial burden. </para>

It has been affirmed, and reaffirmed, as part of the programme of the Federal Labour party, that we believe in the restriction of public borrowing. It was absolutely necessary to use the word &#34; restriction &#34; on account of the extravagance which characterized those who preceded us. </para>

If any political party indulges in excessive borrowing, I am prepared to condemn it, irrespective of whether or not that party is associated with the Labour movement. But it does not lie in the mouth of any member of the Opposition to condemn a Government which has been in office in New South Wales for a period of only two years on the ground of extravagance, in view of the records of their predecessors. </para>

On our borrowing during the last seventy years - and the Mother State was the first to initiate a borrowing policy in 1842 - we have paid in round figures ^&#163;270,000,000 in interest on &#163;370,000,000 borrowed, and we still owe the principal. </para>

                        <para>- I do not deny that; but, at the same time, honorable members opposite are continually urging a policy of not doing to-day what can be done tomorrow - the policy of an effete political party. Another difficulty was presented in the old system of borrowing, as compared with this new system. We are now borrowing from one fund to supply another - taking money out of the right-hand pocket of the taxpayer to put it into his left - whereas, under the old system, although we nominally borrowed &#163;270,000,000, there was, at least, ,&#163;15,000,000 of that which we never received, owing to the flotation and other expenses, although we are paying interest on the full amount. </para>

                        <para>- It is an unpalatable fact to advocates of borrowing across the water that of the money Australia has borrowed we have not received fully &#163;15,000,000, and&#39; yet have to pay interest on it. It has cost fully, if not more than, that sum to raise the loans of the past. The money lent by the .Commonwealth to the States is being circulated, and, if the State Governments are wise, spent on reproductive works, thus affording employment to the people. It is suggested by honorable members opposite that the financial policy of the Government has helped to create a certain stringency by removing gold from circulation. I remember that when the Notes Bill was under discussion the bold boast was made that behind the note issue of the private banks there was a big gold backing. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the imports are larger than is desirable, and their excess over exports is largely attributable to the reduction in the wheat yield and the lesser export of butter and of lamb. In Victoria alone last season we were 11,000,000 bushels short in the wheat yield, and there was a reduction in New South Wales, and practically every other State. As to the Bill, if these Trust Funds were not created, there is no doubt that they would very likely be desired by the State Treasurers; but, in my opinion, the States have enough with the 25s. per head and the interest on the transferred properties. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows a lot about that. I am glad to find the Opposition so agitated over our methods of finance, because this shows that we are on the right lines. It would be disastrous for the Commonwealth to go into the open money market, and compete with the States; and we are merely, by Act of Parliament, taking money out of our own Trust Funds. Before 1915 closes, the States will have to make arrangements for the repayment of about &#163;40,000,000 ; and yet honorable members opposite suggest that we should go into the outside market, and embarrass the States even more. I shall support the Bill, and thus provide money to meet some of the bills created by South Australia in regard to the Northern Territory, and to purchase the valuable property in Perth, which, at the present time, is returning51/2 per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- We are all pretty well agreed that borrowing should be confined as much as possible to reproductive works. This Bill can scarcely be termed a straight-out borrowing Bill. It is one for loaning Trust Fund money to the Government. This is a temporary expedient, because I suppose that when the time for the investment of Trust money arrives, it will have to be returned to the Trust Fund. </para>

                        <para>- We are practically taking money from one pocket and putting it into another. The stringency of the money market is the most notable thing at the present time. According to to-day&#39;s newspapers, the Sydney Water and Sewerage Board, because of the reduction of its Estimates, will dismiss 500 men at the end of the week, and unless advances are increased, another 500 later, and we are told that the secretary to the Employes&#39; Union says that if 1,000 men are dismissed it will mean a revolution. </para>

                        <para>- The question with which we are concerned is whether this Government has done anything tending to increase the financial stringency. I think that the repeal of the Loan Act, authorizing the borrowing of &#163;3,060,000, has had something to do with the present stringency, and so has the locking up of so much money under the Australian Notes Act. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say so; but had we borrowed &#163;3,000,000 under the Loan Act, it would not have been necessary to send money from Australia to the Old Country to pay for the vessels that we were having built there. As a rule, money should be borrowed only for reproductive works. In this case we were commencing the construction of a navy, and needed &#163;3,000,000. The question was whether we should borrow, providing for the repayment of the loan within sixteen years, or take the money from the pockets of the people. This Government followed the latter course, with the result that we have now &#163;3,000,000 less with which to carry on the development of the country and to find employment. I understand that our note issue now amounts, to about &#163;10,000,000, of which &#163;6,000,000 is used for the currency, and &#163;4,000,000 is kept as till money. Under the old system the coin would have had to be kept by the banks to protect the &#163;6,000,000 worth of notes in circulation, but it would not have been necessary to keep money as a backing for the &#163;4,000,000 worth of notes used as till money. A bank note is anI.O.U. issued by a bank, and a sovereign must be kept in reserve to meet it until it has been returned to the bank, when it at once becomes dead. No reserve is necessary in respect to notes that have not been issued. The position is that the banks have &#163;4,000,000 less to lend than they would have had if the note issue had not been taken over by the Commonwealth. As the result of the Commonwealth note issue and the repeal of the Loan Act, the money available for expenditure in Australia has been reduced by &#163;7,000,000, and that has had a great deal to do with causing the present stringency of the money market. Many of our friends opposite think that when a Government gets short of revenue, everything could be put right by the imposition of direct taxation. But supplies are not inexhaustible. Our land tax, which is one of the heaviest in the world, returns only &#163;1,400,000, and additional direct taxation would give only a small return, which would be insufficient for the enormous amount of work that we have to do. We shall be forced to borrow, and have lost our chance of borrowing &#163;3,000,000 cheaply. The repeal of the Loan Act was one of the first, and one of the worst acts of this Government. I doubt whether we shall have an opportunity of getting cheap money again for many a day. The honorable member for Hunter told us that the people are better off now than they were some years ago, but I do not see evidence of it. What is occurring in Sydney contradicts his statement. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> used to refer to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;sullivan</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owe</inline> Sullivan, because he was such a splendid loan floater. That journal has always opposed public borrowing, but it says now that the Labour party in New South Wales has outheroded Herod in the matter of borrowing, and apologizes to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> and former politicians whom it used to abuse for the manner in which they borrowed, because the Labour Government has borrowed much more recklessly. The Labour party, at its advent, told us that it would never borrow, a statement at which I could not help smiling, because there are economic laws that cannot be evaded. You cannot have your cake, and eat it. The Labour party has been nibbling very freely at Australia&#39;s cake of late years, but it is rapidly finishing it, so that before long the conditions of the money market will be the most stringent we have ever witnessed, and great care will be necessary to avoid serious results. </para>

But the Governments in power have spent money right and left beyond what we could afford, and the climax surely was reached the other day when this Government sent an inspector of schools to the Northern Territory, where there are only two schools and only 117 scholars. </para>

                        <para>- I did not hear that stated. Expenditure has increased all along the line. By the creation of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, we are duplicating the 1,700 Savings Bank agencies of Australia, and doubling the staffs employed in the collection and investment of the people&#39;s savings. That greatly increases the expense of government. If this sort of thing is going to continue, and the Commonwealth is going to duplicate all State machinery, we must cut down expenditure somewhere, and I ask the Prime Minister if he does not think that we could do away with the Senate. I make the suggestion in all seriousness. Will any honorable member opposite say that the Senate serves a useful purpose? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to be reminded of that fact. The honorable member for Maribyrnong pointed out that the public indebtedness of the States amounted to &#34;something like  &#163;270,000,000,  and that more than that amount had been paid by way of interest. That fact alone shows the importance of making provision for a sinking fund in connexion with every loan we raise. Since we are to provide for a sinking fund in every case, the honorable member for Maribyrnong will recognise that, under a loan policy, we would not saddle posterity with the whole of the debts incurred by us to-day, but that we should be gradually paying them off. In that way, our load of taxation, which no one deplores more than I do, would be reduced to a minimum. I do not see that we can further attack this measure. It is not a straight-out Loan Bill ; but I should be glad if we had a proposal to borrow money from abroad. A good deal of the money that we are about to pay off will go to the foreign bond-holder at a time when our local market is urgently in need of it. This is an exceptional time, and, in meeting it, we should apply exceptional measures. I should be glad, even now, to learn that the Prime Minister proposed to raise this money abroad. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. This money will be taken from the Trust Funds, and the Prime Minister has pointed out that most of the money in the several Trust Funds has been loaned to the State Governments. The withdrawal of this money, therefore, will, I think, mean a curtailment of the funds in the hands of the State Treasurers. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Fawkner has taken the .Government to task, claiming that the note issue and our general financial policy have had the effect of tightening the money market, to the detriment of the general community. That charge has been made again and again, and is likely to be repeated, not because there is any truth in it, but because there are not many people who possess a thorough grasp of financial matters, and it is, therefore, easy to mislead the public. It is an easy matter for the press, or for speakers at meetings of banking institutions, to point out that the money market is tight, and to make charges against the Government. We know that groups of interested persons of that character have no love for the Government, and those who sit behind them ; and I suppose that, after all, it is only human nature for our political opponents to try to thrust upon us the responsibility for the present situation. If the matter be faced fairly and squarely, however, it must be admitted that there is no justification for this charge. The money market is tight to-day, not only in Australia, but all over the world, and this is not the first occasion when we have had such an experience. In 1893 we had a financial stringency greater than that which prevails to-day. We had a similar experience in 1848, 1859, and 1866 ; whilst there was a financial panic in England in connexion with the failure of Baring Bros., in 1901 or 1902. On all of these occasions we had financial stringency, although at the time there was not a Government note issue in operation, and, consequently, no store of gold against a Government note circulation. That being so, there can be nothing in the argument that the Commonwealth note issue is responsible for the present situation. It may have affected the situation to an infinitesimal degree; but, even had there been no note issue, the money market would have been as tight as it is to-day. Honorable members opposite, who know anything about banking, must admit that this is true, and that if they say anything to the contrary they are deliberately humbugging the people. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so stupid as to think anything of the kind. Any man who knows anything of banking knows that a banker is a dealer in credits, and that if there is a big demand for credit, and a lot of gold is going out of the country, he will guard against possible risks. Bankers are shrewd business men. It is only their directors who are fools, and who worry them. That is what is going on at the present time. As the same thing occurred prior to the Commonwealth assuming control of the note issue, it is monstrous to blame the Government for it. Only the other day the honorable member for Balaclava told the people of Australia that they should curtail their expenditure all round, because there were bad times ahead. But what is the position to-day? </para>

                <para class="block">Such general prosperity was never before experienced by Australia. Business - is good all over the continent of Europe. We cannot say that general prosperity does not obtain in France, in Germany, and even in America. I cannot recall a period of such uniform prosperity. This result is generally attributed by those who have made a closer study of this question than I have to the tremendous amount of enterprise which is being exhibited in opening up new countries and generally in increasing production. What do we find in regard to British Consols? In periods of remarkable prosperity they are usually quoted at a very low price, and the reason is not difficult to, discover. Some few years ago the British Parliament passed an Act empowering the trustees of estates in England to invest in Colonial securities, so that whenever British Consols are low in price their holders naturally sell out, with a view to securing a better return for their money elsewhere. It is doubtless true that money will be dearer than it is. We know that the cause of many financial panics which have been experienced has been overproduction. But over-production is unthinkable by those who share my views, and who support the Government, although it is a relative term, conveying only a certain amount of truth. When times are prosperous men will naturally obtain advances from their banks in order to push forward their businesses. Thus production proceeds at a remarkable speed, until the banks realize the necessity for curtailing their advances. Then they give their customers notice that these, must be reduced. That is what is happening in Australia today. I quite admit that a need exists for caution, but I contend that there is no necessity to scare the public by promulgating the idea that we are on the eve of a financial crisis. I do not believe that we are. It has been urged by some of the new school of social thinkers that when the standard of living in a country is raised, and the purchasing power of its people is increased, its general prosperity must also be increased. If we lived in times of low wages and limited production, I venture to say that we should have experienced a financial panic long ago. It is only the high standard of living, and the increased purchasing power of the people, which have kept things going. I do not intend to argue that there is no limit to our increase of production. But I do say that there is no &#34;necessity for alarm. We do not know what may be the result of our next harvest. Each year the area under wheat is being considerably increased, and, consequently, it is reasonable to expect that our export trade in this cereal will largely increase. Of course, there are always croakers in the community, who are prepared to tell us that the forthcoming harvest will not be as good as we anticipated. For my part, I think it is premature to hazard an opinion. But I make bold to say that within a comparatively few years the export trade in wheat from Western Australia will equal that from Victoria. Some honorable members have pointed with alarm to our increase of imports. I am inclined to think that there has been a big importation of locomotives and other rolling-stock into Victoria, and, probably, into the other States, notwithstanding that that rolling-stock could have been manufactured in Australia. My own view is that a certain quantity of rolling-stock should be turned out by our private engineering establishments &#39; each year. I am also under the impression that, for some time past, most of our manufacturing plants have been working up to their full capacity. If that be so, the circumstance would tend to increase the volume of our imports. All these circumstances indicate the extent of the prosperity which has been enjoyed by the Commonwealth for some years, and the necessity which exists for increasing our manufacturing plants and of generally bringing them up to date. In view of the criticism to which the Government and their supporters are sometimes subjected, it is difficult to know exactly where we stand. Almost every day we are condemned because we have not embarked upon a big loan policy. Now, the Labour party are not opposed to borrowing, although they have not a mania for borrowing both in season and out of season. I think that, owing to the prosperous conditions which have obtained in Australia, the States, during recent years, have been tempted to go in for too much borrowing, and especially has this been the case when the money has been- required for the construction of railways. A good deal of excuse may be urged on behalf of a Government which borrows for that purpose. But I question whether much of the borrowing indulged in by the States has been for railway purposes. Men who call themselves financiers and business men go to the extent of saying that the note issue has caused a tightness in the money market, although they know that that tightness is world-wide; and this only shows that they are prepared to risk their reputations for the purposes of a paltry party attack. Matters of finance should be kept, as far as possible, free from party politics. It ,is easy to cause a scare in Australia amongst people who do not know the causes of the present tightness or the effects of borrowing, or do not realize the infinitesimal influence that the note issue can have in this connexion. If public men have one duty and responsibility, it is to see that the public are not led to create anything in the nature of a panic; and similar responsibility rests on bankers and commercial men, who ought not, merely for the sake of a party attack, to ignore the facts of history. I hope we shall continue careful and economic administration ; and, at any rate, I contend that no charge can be made against the Government in respect of their borrowing from the Trust Funds. Such a transaction is about equal to a temporary borrowing out of a reserve fund, and is certainly in no way analogous to raising a loan in the open market. Any schoolboy in the street could see the difference; and yet, day after day, we have it dinned into our ears that the Labour party and Government have departed from their policy. We were never insane enough to say that under no circumstances would we borrow; but, unlike honorable members opposite, we do not declare that we shall never be happy until we have piled up a debt of &#163;30,000,000 or &#163;40,000,000. Had honorable members opposite, instead of the Labour party, been in power, the Commonwealth would by this time have been liable for &#163;15,000,000 or &#163;20,000,000 - honorable members opposite seem likely to die of a broken heart if there is not a big indebtedness. </para>

                        <para>- It is the policy on which honorable members opposite have been bred, and in which they believe. We have been told that it is not enough to have a financial policy for one year, but that there ought to be a policy for ten or twenty years ahead; but, in my opinion, there is no necessity for such a course, and I hope it will be a long time before we have a&#34; borrowing policy, and that then it will only be resorted to when all other means are exhausted. I hope that a just view will be taken by the people, and that they will realize that the Government are not responsible for any tightness in the money market, which has really been brought about by the prosperity, the increased production, and the energy and enterprise of the people who have obtained credit from the banks in order to push their various businesses. The same tale has been told generation after generation, and will be told in the days to come; for, under such circumstances, there is always a. reaction under tightness. Bankers, if shrewd, sensible men, and not gamblers, when they see such a state of affairs, call in their advances, and this causes a tightness and affects the labour market. </para>

A man who gets an advance from a bank knows that he is liable to be called on to pay up, and the people themselves are largely to blame for running to the banks. No doubt, they think that by means of this credit they can expand their business ; but we ought not to blame the banker, who has to look after the interests of his institution, and the more he safeguards those interests, the more he safeguards the welfare of the community. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government are to be congratulated on initiating a borrowing policy. The Opposition, generally speaking, are pleased to observe that the Government realize that the enterprises of Australia require more money than can be derived from ordinary forms of taxation, especially in view of the large public works that are contemplated. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has defended the policy introduced by the present Government, and supported what is an integral part of the policy of the Opposition, namely, the appointment of a Tariff Board. These are long strides in the direction in the policy pursued by the Opposition ; first, there is the policy of borrowing for important public works, and then the Tariff policy advocated by the Opposition at the last election. If the honorable member continues to advance so rapidly, we shall be able to claim him as a member of this party. </para>

                        <para>- The present Government, who condemned the borrowing policy of the previous Government to the extent of repealing the legislation for a naval loan, are introducing a loan on their own account.

                <para class="block">Australia, but of other lands. It is remarkable to find that, after three years of office, the Government admit that in the money market there are influences outside the power of government, and that we are, at the present time, on the eve of a financial stringency caused by operations in other parts of the world. This shows that Australia cannot have a financial policy of its own, and so control the internal money market as to enable the Government to carry out the necessary public works out of the ordinary revenue. The Government rightly claim that they have met a great deal of expenditure out of revenue ; but they have been blessed with an overflowing treasury, which no previous Government enjoyed. Through the Customs they have had &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000 a year extra, and they have been paying the States &#163;2,500,000 less than previously, while they have imposed direct taxation amounting to nearly &#163;1,500,000. This means that during the last three years the Government have had &#163;18,000.000 or &#163;20,000,000 more than was received by any previous Government; and it is not at all extraordinary that it has been possible to find money for defence and other purposes out of revenue. Indeed, if this had not been done, the Government would have been open to the charge of not properly applying the public funds. The honorable member for Hunter informed us that the new taxation falls on the wealthier sections of the community, who are best able to bear the burden. As a matter of fact, the taxation is borne by the poor as well as the wealthy - by the taxpayers as a whole, whatever their income. It has been pointed out by the honorable member for Parramatta that no less than 18s. or 19s. per head has been added to taxation during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the present Government - that we are paying 12s. or 13s. per head more in Customs duties, and 7s. per head through the land tax. The most cursory analysis of the land tax will show that a great proportion of it is paid, not by the wealthy squatters, but by the working classes. Practically the whole of the taxation paid by wealthy property owners within the cities is passed on to the wage-earners by means of an increase in the price of goods or a considerable increase in rentals. Probably one-half, or nearly one-half, of the land tax has already been passed on in the cities in the way I have indicated. 1 admit that a considerable portion of the tax is paid by squatters and other large property owners ; but we know that, during the last three years, the increase in land settlement has been less than in any previous three years since the beginning of Federation. It is evident, therefore, that what was supposed to be the chief object of this taxation, namely, the bursting up of large estates, has not been achieved. I do not wish to say more on that point at present further than to emphasize the fact that the great bulk of the new taxation is being drawn from the pockets of the wage-earners. Although taxation would have been lessened by the adoption of a wise and discriminate policy of borrowing for reproductive public works, this Government have made no attempt to lessen it. The last Government passed a Loan Act authorizing the borrowing of money for the building of the first Naval Unit. Although I was a supporter of that Government, I thought that it would be better to borrow for public works, paying for the Naval Unit out of revenue. But I believe that the Treasurer of the day thought that the Bill provided the most convenient method of borrowing, and one which would enable his Government&#39;s progressive policy in connexion with the Post Office to be best carried out out of revenue. The Postmaster-General of the day proposed to expend about  &#163;2,000,000  on necessary works connected with his Department, most of which would have been interest-earning. The expenditure was to be spread over three years; and since this Government have been in office, it has probably been increased by  &#163;1,000,000.  Nearly  &#163;3,000,000  has thus been spent on necessary works in connexion with the post, telephone, and telegraph services, and I am sorry that more has not been spent. But, after three years of office, this Government have to admit that there is a stringency in the money market which they cannot control, and that the people are not much more prosperous than when they were returned to power. The people were told that if they were returned to power there would be no more unemployment, and that every housewife- would have a few pounds to spare; that borrowing would be restricted; and that the public services would be paid for out of revenue, borrowing being permitted only to meet maturing loans or for purely reproductive works. But, during their term of office, Ministers have made the Commonwealth responsible for a debt &#176;f  &#163;3,500,000  in connexion with the </para>
                <para class="block">Northern Territory ; for the expenditure of  &#163;5,000,000  or  &#163;6,000,000  on the railway to Western Australia ; foi the spending of a large sum of money on a site for Commonwealth offices in London ; and for the spending of  &#163;600,000  or  &#163;700,000  on land resumption in the Federal Capital Territory. Within a few years, if they remain in office - which I hope they will not - the Commonwealth will have to borrow  &#163;15,000,000  or  &#163;16,000,000  from the local or foreign money-lenders. Therefore, the statement that they are opposed to borrowing comes with a bad grace from them. They are prepared to borrow for the erection of buildings in London. I ask whether that expenditure will be immediately reproductive, returning at once interest and the amount of the annual contribution to the sinking fund? Will the Western Australian railway be reproductive within many years? Will the Northern Territory railway expenditure, which will amount to a couple of millions, return more than the expenditure on the Navy Unit, which, under our proposal, would have been provided for by a loan which would have been extinguished within sixteen years? This Government have had more money to spend from Customs revenue than any of their predecessors, and with a proper system of borrowing for reproductive works, could have paid their way and provided for defence out of revenue, and at the same time could have lessened the taxation. But they have made no attempt to do that. There has been no proper scientific proposal for a revision of the Tariff. Had we on this side remained in power, a Tariff Board would have been appointed to scientifically revise the Tariff, and some of the duties which press heavily on the taxpayers would have been removed. </para>

A vital plank of our platform is the appointment of a Tariff Board to make a thorough and scientific investigation into all Tariff matters, and to inform the House fully and accurately regarding the conditions of trade, and the operation of the Tariff.. Parliament, having been placed in possession of exact information, could have revised the Tariff on a scientific basis, making it truly protective, without unduly burdening the people. </para>

                        <para>- I say it. Honorable members opposite seem to think that money can be taken from the people and put into the Treasury without any one being any the worse off. But the more the people are taxed the more production is retarded. I congratulate the Government on having determined to borrow for reproductive works. But I regret that their proposals have been introduced in a piece-meal fashion, and that they have not been sufficiently courageous to put forward a statesmanlike policy which would have had the effect of lightening the burdens of the taxpayers, which,.., during their term of office, have been increased by nearly &#163;r per head of population - men, women, and children - or by nearly &#163;5 per family. </para>

                    <para>.- Like the other electors of Perth I should perhaps be thankful, in accordance with the maxim, &#34;Better late than never,&#34; that at last money is to be provided for the erection of the new general post-office there, for which we have been waiting so long; but I am at a loss to understand why Ministers have waited until the closing hours of the session to make this proposal. They have expended considerable sums out of revenue on postal improvements for the other States, and it is unfortunate that Western Australia has had to wait until all available revenue has been expended, and is to be the first State on which loan money is to be spent. When the Works Estimates were under discussion, I commented on the fact that only &#163;5,000 was set down for the new general post-office at Perth, and was unable to obtain definite information as to how the rest of the money that would be needed was to be provided. We are now told that the land is going to be bought by this means, but still there is no information as to how we are to have placed upon it the building for which the people of Perth have been waiting so anxiously, and which is so necessary for the postal business of Western Australia. Does this mean that its erection is to be postponed for, perhaps, another year? How long will it be before the appropriation which we are now discussing will be available for the purchase of the land? When will the land actually become the property of the Commonwealth, and when shall we have available the money to erect the building on this site? All these are questions which I, as the representative of Perth, have a right to put to the Government, and which the people of Perth, and Western Australia generally, are entitled to have answered. So far, there has been very little information on the subject, and we shall probably have to wait for the advent of another Government before very much is done in connexion with supplying a new General Post Office at Perth. </para>

                <para>I have listened with a good deal of interest, and some little amusement, to the speeches of honorable members opposite, and must congratulate the Government on the magnificent crop of financiers growing behind them. It has been quite illustrative of the new-born tendency of Labour financiers, to listen to the more or less edifying speeches from these developing financial experts on the other side. Some of them have distinctly novel ideas as to the credit attaching to the Government for their finance, and there are equally novel ideas as to the methods by which this Government have placed themselves in possession of the funds upon which they are now operating. One honorable member, apparently, entertains the belief that this Labour Government can actually manufacture money out of nothing - they have simply to wave a fairy wand in some beautifully mysterious way, and, hey presto, they have at their disposal a credit fund, on which they have not to pay interest, and which is secured, without any detriment whatever, to the public of Australia. I agree-, however, with the previous  speaker  that, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> whatever way money is drawn by taxation from the pockets of the people, there must be a corresponding loss in the producing power of the community as a whole. I join with other honorable members of the Opposition in deprecating the policy of the Government in continuing a system of taxation which brings them in a revenue in excess of normal requirements. The note issue, for which so much credit is being taken by honorable members opposite, was, to my mind, a normal and natural development of Federation. It was inevitable that, when the people of Australia federated, the state of affairs in regard1 to the note issues should be altered at the earliest possible opportunity. We had a number of private banks issuing notes which were negotiable in more than one State only at a very heavy discount, and it was, therefore, inevitable, having regard to the power which was conferred upon the Federal Parliament by the Constitution, that this matter of issuing Commonwealth bank notes should be taken up sooner or later by a Commonwealth Government. I congratulate the present Government on having had an opportunity to carry this policy into effect ; but, at the same time, I believe we had reached a position at which almost any Government would have carried into effect this policy of a Commonwealth note issue. </para>

                        <para>- I think that many honorable members of the Opposition spoke favorably of a Commonwealth note issue ; they took exception only to certain features of the system adopted by the present Government. Believing, as I do very ardently, in the advantage to the community of a Commonwealth note issue, I still hesitate to indorse all that has been done by the present Government in this connexion. I do not think that the low gold reserve which they are holding against their note issue is altogether wise, in view of the very unsettled condition-of finance throughout the world, and in view also of the possibility of international complications, which may create panic conditions even in remote Australia. The banks have, undoubtedly, of late years exported a considerable quantity of gold. That is due to the fact that they can now hold, instead of gold reserves, Commonwealth notes, knowing that if at any time anything in the nature of a panic should ensue, and result in a demand being made on the banks for gold, they can, if their gold is exhausted, turn to the Treasury and demand gold for the notes which they hold. In view of the possibility of complications occurring almost at any moment in the older countries of the world - complications which would result in panic conditions everywhere - I think that the Government would be well advised in increasing its gold reserve to meet such an emergency. There is no doubt that, in the past, State Governments have been very much to blame for a lack of financial ability in floating their loans. The Commonwealth has taken a wise and prudent stand in making it a statutory provision that every loan shall have a sinking fund. I wish, however, to point out that this policy of creating a statutory sinking fund for loans was adopted by at least one State - Western Australia - several years before the Federal . Government took it up. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. It was more or less of a sham, and it remained for the Western Australian Parliament, and for the Federal Parliament subsequently, to create legislation which would make a sinking fund in connexion with every loan an actual reality. But when honorable members opposite claim credit for the Labour Government for their policy in borrowing only in respect of reproductive works, I am unable to follow them. There is on the platform of the party a statement to that effect, but at no time could I see much in it, for the simple reason that, after all, borrowing for almost any work required by the people of a country might be regarded as reproductive. Even borrowing for such an apparently nonproductive work as the beginnings of a navy for Australia might fairly be claimed to underlie reproduction, because, without a navy, and the security given to us. by the peace that only organized strength does give, no reproduction of any kind would occur in Australia without our having to pay, at all events, a heavy penalty for it. But, if we assume that this Government require to borrow, whether from Trust Funds or otherwise, &#163;1,000,000 for certain interests that have to be met during the current year, it is a matter of indifference whether that sum is debited to a reproductive or non-reproductive work, so long as a sinking fund is provided in both cases. There is, in such circumstances, only the difference of tweedledum and tweedledee. If we have a sinking fund to provide in regard to all loans, and we wipe out our loans automatically at a given time, then a loan may he debited either to one account or to another without affecting in the least the general interests of the community,, or making the one loan for a supposedly non-reproductive work more expensive than another for reproductive purposes. And so I am very glad to find the Government adopting an eminently safe policy in connexion with the schemes they have in hand. . I heartily support them in this respect, and, in conclusion, can only express the hope that, having now obtained the money to pay for the land upon which the Perth Post-office is to be erected, they will proceed without any further delay to erect the building necessary to give the people of that remote part of the Commonwealth the postal conveniences for which they have waited in vain during all these years. </para>

                        <para>- I think I have heard the Prime Minister use it. I have here some figures which must convince honorable members that there is a good deal to worry about concerning the expenditure for which Commonwealth Governments have been responsible during the last six years. In  1906-7  the Commonwealth expenditure was  &#163;4,987,317.  In  1907-8,  it increased to  &#163;6,162,129;  in  1908-9,  to  &#163;6,420,398;  and, in  1909-10,  to  &#163;7 (499,516.  Honorable members will notice that during those years the expenditure steadily increased. But, in the year  1910-11,  when the Labour Government came into office, it jumped from  &#62;&#163;7&#187;499&#62;5l6  to  &#163;13,158,529. </para>

                        <para>- A great deal of extravagance has occurred in carrying out public works&#39; by means of day labour. The work carried out under that system has cost twice&#39; as much as it ought to have cost. I would like to Say a word or two in regard to the tightness of the money market. It has been said that that tightness is being experienced all the world over. I do not think that it is. I attribute the tightness of the local money market to the fact that, owing to the Labour <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> capital has been withdrawn from Australia. People are afraid to invest their money here. I know that the local money market is exceptionally tight. The banks do not want to open new accounts. They will not make advances even on gilt-edged securities. They may advance a little money to oblige old customers, but they do not want new accounts. They will not ordinarily lend money on any security whatever. I attribute this to the fact that capital has been driven out of the country. I know that we have to expend a very considerable sum  each year upon things which are absolutely necessary. There is, for example, the expenditure upon our Fleet Unit and upon the Federal Capital. But if we wish to borrow, let us do it in a straightforward manner. The system of taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another is a bad one. It is like a man borrowing from Peter in order to pay Paul. The honorable member for Maribyrnong said that he approved of borrowing, because the money was used for the employment of our people. I say that it is not. It may be used for the employment of a small section in the shape of the unionists. It is the festive unionist who gets it. The honorable member spoke of Australia having borrowed  &#163;270,000,000,  but where should we have been to-day if we had not borrowed that money ? The essence of sound finance is to borrow well. It would be a good thing for me to borrow  ,&#163;10,000  at  4  per cent, if I could invest it in good security at 8 per cent. If Australia had not borrowed, the honorable member for Maribyrnong would probably have had to be conveyed to the Melbourne Cup yesterday in a bullock dray. It is ridiculous to talk about the money we have borrowed. In the absence of a borrowing policy, Australia would have made no progress. The platform of the Federal Labour party is said to be the restriction of public borrowing. The Labour party of New South Wales have a plank in their platform which affirms that they will not borrow except for works which, from the commencement, will pay interest upon their capital cost, and provide i per pent, for a sinking fund. It is absolutely ridiculous to say that, from their very initiation, new railways should pay interest on their capital cost, and provide for a sinking fund of i per cent. </para>

What will the Government do next year when they have not this money to play with &#62; The honorable member for Hindmarsh stated that it was not the bank managers of whom he complained, but the fools of directors. It struck me that at some time or other he may have approached a bank manager with a request for a loan, and that the manager may have replied that the directors would not authorize it. Possibly, that may be the reason why the Government did not require directors for the Commonwealth Bank. But I do not think that it is. The reason why they did not wish directors to be appointed to that institution is that they knew the Governor of the bank would be under the thumb of the Caucus. </para>

                        <para>- The matter of the Commonwealth Bank, I submit, is relevant to this Bill, in which is bound up the whole financial policy of the Government. I. agree with every word which was uttered by the honorable member for Wimmera! upon the question of land taxation. He pointed out that a large amount of the revenue which is collected from that tax comes out of the pockets of the small men. The metropolitan land-owners pass the tax on to their tenants. This is the direct taxation upon which the Government pride themselves. Yet, they now have to resort to a loan policy. I congratulate them upon the circumstance,, because that policy is an absolutely sound one. But I object to them gulling the electors with the cry that they will not borrow. From hundreds of platforms in this country, they affirmed at the last election that they would not borrow, whereas, the Liberal party, they declared, would ruin the Commonwealth by borrowing. I predict that the time will come when this Government will have to adopt the course which has been adopted by the New South Wales Labour Government, of dismissing men from public works as the result of their reckless extravagance. It is owing to the adoption of the day labour system that the New South Wales Government have come to the very end of their tether. They are at their wits&#39; ends te* know where to turn for money. At the last election, from hundreds of platforms, the members of the Federal Labour party proclaimed to the people that they would not resort to borrowing. The Government now find themselves forced to borrow, and they are doing it in a way which they think will gull the public. But when the time comes <inline font-style="italic">tt&#62;carry</inline> out the works- for which the Trust Funds are allocated, what will have to be&#62; done ? They will have to borrow to -make *rp the  Money. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with the honorable member for North Sydney in  regard  to the general electoral attitude of honorable members opposite when they faced the country nearly three years ago, and when, by their platform, they  &#39;Committed  themselves to the &#34; restriction of public borrowing.&#34; Now &#34; restriction &#34; is a broad term, and,  in  the case of the Commonwealth, it means no borrowing at all, &#39;because no previous Government had &#39;borrowed. Yet we find that a Government returned on a policy of the restriction of public borrowing, is the first to actually borrow for Commonwealth purposes ! Against this it will be urged that &#39; the previous Administration sought to borrow &#163;3,500,000 for a special, urgent, national necessity, namely, the building of ships for the Australian Naval Unit. Those ships have to be provided within a -certain period, and we undertook on behalf of the public, in 1909, to see that they were not only provided in time, but that they should take the seas as an organized Australian Unit, instead of taking the water separately and independently, and thus rendered of no value for timely joint naval effort. The policy of borrowing for this particular purpose was guarded by a sinking fund - the first effective sinking fund in Australia - that would wipe out the debt in a very few years, and there was, further, the promise of the Minister of the day to provide a war chest, out of which automatically, from accumulated revenue, &#39;we were from, time to time to provide money to pay for the replacement of the Fleet. Under such a policy the ships would have been in existence and in commission  long  before this. We now know that under the procrastinating, slack, and inefficient methods of the existing Administration, those ships, instead of being, as was arranged in the first place, ali &#39;completed about the end of this year, will practically not be completed until October,, 1914. The battle cruiser will not be completed &#39;until next April, and the other cruisers until May of next year, and October of the year following, while the four other vessels will -not be completed, a&#39;s I -say-, before October, 19 14. Our policy of borrowing was to meet ari urgent and external danger that will not wait the &#34;convenience of honorable members elected to &#39;this place ;at &#163;600 a year. Our policy, which &#34;would have brought the Fleet into being this yean, ha&#39;s been so messed up by honorable members opposite, that we are not to have the Unit as a whole -until 1914. I have shown conclusively, I think, that the purpose for which the previous Government sought to borrow was an external purpose. The reason we had to seek to borrow was that our revenues, then governed by the Braddon section, amounted, when1 all was said and done, to only about one-half of the revenues of the present Government. We had to return our surplus revenues to the States, and the money we had for Commonwealth purposes amounted to only &#163;,7,000,000 or &#163;8,000,000 per annum. The present Government are receiving between &#163;15,000,000 and &#163;16,000,000 to play with, and now they are asking for more. Not only have the present Government twice the previous revenue of their predecessors; but as pointed out by <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> honorable member for North Sydney, they have borrowed from the Australian public some &#163;10,000,000 sterling, without interest, by means of the note issue. Does the confident member for Corangamite pretend that intrinsic value has been given for every &#163;1 the Treasurer has paid over the counter in bank notes ? </para>

                        <para>- Then there is some obligation in connexion with the paper ? The banks undertook to pay the money back as it was wanted, and the notes were made fey law a first &#39;charge on the resources of .the bank, so that the holders could get &#39;gold at a moment&#39;s notice. I presume that the honorable .member for &#39;Corangamite now recognises the note issue as an obligation; and, if that be so, how can he pretend that the issue is not equivalent to a loan? Thus the honorable member answers himself when he comes down to hard facts from the airy places of his own self-importance ! We have seen that those honorable gentlemen, who started out with the &#34; restriction of public borrowing&#34; in an area where no public borrowing had taken place, have arrived at the stage, when, in addition to double the revenue of their predecessors, they have received some  &#163;10,000,000  on the issue of Australian I.O, U.s, a trifle of  &#163;2,500,000  borrowed last year, and a further instalment now asked for ! </para>

                <para>I should like to say a word on the general aspect of borrowing. I am not an advocate of borrowing when we can get along without it. I regard borrowing as good business for the individual who can use the credit with advantage to himself ; but there is a tendency on the part of all Governments to extravagantly waste loan funds. That tendency is exemplified in the State of New South Wales at the present time. In that State we used to regard &#163;3,000,000 or &#163;4,000,000 a year as an orgy of loan extravagance. When the Labour party of New South Wales kept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;sullivan</inline> in power, his main purpose seemed to be to provide high wages for Government employes on day labour, and in this way some &#163;3,000,000 or &#163;4,000,000 a year was spent. The public imagination became inflamed, and honorable members opposite came in on a policy of &#34; restriction of public borrowing &#34; - borrowing that they themselves had connived at when supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;sullivan</inline> ! In New South Wales, another Government, composed of official members of the same organization as my honorable friends opposite, came into power also . on a policy of the &#34; restriction of public borrowing,&#34; but that restriction has consisted in raising the State&#39;s yearly loan account to- double the proportion that it had ever reached in the State&#39;s history. The State Government of New South Wales are now spending &#163;6,000,000 a year of borrowed money ; and that very fact has tended to tighten the money market there, and retard the development and progress of the State. Those budding financiers opposite desire to borrow, and decide to gull the public ; and. they have, therefore, entered upon a policy of borrowing, not from oversea, but locally. Other persons, however, desired to borrow in the Australian market. Every man with an undeveloped tract of country must have money to make it profitable ; all landholders, small or large, must borrow to make their lands productive. These private persons, however, find that their main competitor is the Government, and that the money is being taken from the people of New South Wales and expended, not in developing the State, but in concentrating Socialistic enterprises in the city of Sydney. After two or three years of this sort of thing we find that the price of money is as high - I speak subject to correction - in times of seasonable prosperity as it ever was in the worst times of drought. The extravagance, stupidity, and folly of the colleagues of honorable members opposite in the State Parliament have come home to roost, and the development of New South Wales has been retarded, and every enterprise there is stagnating, because, instead of financier s in high places, we have men whose main object is to evade the pledges they gave at the general election. Can the honorable member for Gwydir indorse everything that the New South Wales Government have done in the way of borrowing during the last three years? </para>

                        <para>- I submit, with all deference, that the question of the Commonwealth entering the field as a borrower is vitally affected by the tightness of the money market ; and we are entitled to consider how that tightness has been created. New South Wales is part of the Commonwealth ; it represents about one-third of the electors, and about one-third of Australia&#39;s material prosperity. If I can show that the tightness of money is due to excessive borrowing in the local market, I submit that the fact is a vital one in considering a proposal to still further borrow on the part of the Commonwealth Government </para>

                <para>In regard to borrowing in the abstract, public finance is one of the greatest elements in unemployment in any civilized community. If a country borrowed &#163;5,000,000 a year, this would employ so many persons; who are taken from private employers to work for the State. When the borrowed money comes to an end, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cann,</inline> of New South Wales, say, cannot raise any more, these men will have to leave the employment of the Government, and try to get work from private persons. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Within the last few days 1,300 men in all have been dismissed from Government employment in New South Wales. They had been drawn towards Government employment by the wildly extravagant expenditure of loan money, which has now come to an end, and the public credit has been so demoralized that the Government cannot borrow further to carry on its works. These men have consequently again to seek private employment, and many will find that the places which they had left have been filled up. The practice of Governments being large employers one day and retrenching in all directions the next is one of the chief causes of unemployment in this country. </para>

                        <para>- I have not accepted the honorable member for Brisbane as an authority on Queensland affairs since I heard him speak on the tramway strike. In the initiation of Commonwealth borrowing we should recognise the connexion between Government expenditure and employment, and. borrow continuously and moderately instead of extravagantly and spasmodically. A Government ought not to borrow up to its credit&#39;s limit, and then be forced to dismiss men for want of funds. Retrenchment not only injures the public servants who are retrenched, but every person directly or indirectly connected with Government expenditure. Borrowing should proceed continuously, so that there may be no cessation of employment. A Government should not seek, by lavish expenditure during three years of office, to buy its way to a further lease of power, bankrupting the public by its methods. </para>

I ask the right honorable gentleman how he proposes to charge these items in the schedule against the moneys of the Trust Funds? Money so taken from the Funds cannot be charged against them as a whole ; but must be charged against some item. </para>

                        <para>- General trust accounts, and other trust accounts are involved. The Trust Fund moneys are far in excess of the investments, and I think it my duty as Treasurer to use part of them in the manner proposed. I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that all the trust money ought not to, be tied up for a long, period. Most of it, however - at least, half - has been advanced on short-dated loans. Regarding the note issue, if demand were made for &#163;3,000,000 worth of notes, I think we could meet it without encroaching on the 40 per cent margin that I promised to keep. </para>

                        <para>- I should say so. It should be a still better investment as time passes. Does the item of &#163;153,000 include the cost of building the new General Post Office, or does it simply cover the cost of the property as it stands? I take it that we shall have to spend a considerable sum in building an up-to-date post-office. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that we are getting into a very peculiar position. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has denied that his Leader had any connexion with the arrangement made with the Prime Minister. Apparently, it was the honorable member for Franklin who originated the idea. </para>

                        <para>- There is no need for the House to adjourn to enable honorable members to attend a ball at GovernmentHouse; but a good many honorable members like to attend the races, not for the purpose of betting, but for the purpose ofT sight-seeing. The business of this country is more important than is a Government House ball ; and if we adjourn at 10 o&#39;clock this evening, honorable members will then be able to attend that function. If the Opposition are prepared to abandon their responsibilities to enable their members to attend a Government House ball, it is only right that the public should know of the fact. I protest against the proposal to adjourn. </para>

                    <para>. - I do riot know at what position we have now arrived. A short time ago the Prime Minister said that he had been approached by honorable&#39; members upon both sides of the House. I wish to place on record the fact that I am not one of the members who approached him with a request that we should get away early to-night. I should like to know the names of those honorable members who did. We have been told that he entered info an arrangement with the Opposition that the House should adjourn at - the dinner-hour, and that it was &#34;good business.&#34; What does that mean? That the Opposition would have talked all night on this measure, but that they desired to get- away this evening. </para>
