Is it not possible for it to be introduced by means of straw used in various imported packages ? Will the Minister instruct his officers that, wherever there is any doubt, they must require that such packages be destroyed, or otherwise sufficiently fumigated or sterilized? </para>

                        <para>- I am informed that the foot and mouth disease has been introduced into some countries by means of straw packing. The Quarantine Department is looking into the matter with a view to the issue of a proclamation prohibiting the introduction of straw as packing, as well as for fodder, from infected countries. The Department is fully alive to the importance of keeping this disease out of Australia. </para>

                                <para>I am informed that, owing to the prohibitive cost of installing electric light at Rockhampton, the substitution of electric light for gas cannot be recommended. Gas fixtures were recently overhauled at a cost of over £30, and lights are now very satisfactory. The plan of alterations includes a scheme for improving ventilation of the mail and operating rooms. No system of electric light is installed at Townsville, but provision has been made in the plan of alterations for improved ventilation of the operating room, and the telephone exchange will be fixed on the cooler side of the building. </para>

                            <para>.- I have pleasure in supporting the motion.  I know that, generally speaking, there is great feeling amongst the public against the granting of pensions, and the honorable member for Melbourne said the other day that he was absolutely against any system of pensions other than old-age and invalid, and possibly a child pension in the future; but I would point out to the honorable member that there is a very strong line of demarcation between a pension granted to the ordinary public servant and a pension such as we ask for to-day. The permanent force men have not the rosy billets that have been enjoyed by public servants in the past. They do not receive the same amount of pay, and at the end of their term they are cast adrift, practically like a worn-out horse, without any consideration. These men are engaged .in what is really our second line of defence, and are asked to give up their lives in the interests of their country if the country at any time requires it. Lord Kitchener realized that it was necessary to get men mentally and physically fit for our forces'. In one paragraph of his report he said that " If men of the right stamp are to be attracted to the corps the pay of each rank must be good." So far as our Permanent Military Forces are concerned, the pay is not good. Although some honorable members have said that the pay is high, I say it is remarkably low. If. we compare the rates received by artisans in Australia with those received by artisans engaged in similar occupations in Great Britain, we find that the rates of pay in Australia are from  80  per cent, to  120  per cent, higher. The rates paid to the military service in Australia are nowhere near  80  per cent, higher than those paid for corresponding positions in Great Britain. The following table compares the rates of pay in the Imperial Service and in our Permanent Military Forces : - </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">According to that statement, there is not one man employed in the Permanent Forces of Australia who receives even the minimum increase of  80  per cent, over the Imperial rates; and when we realize that the difference in the case of artisans goes up to  120  per cent, we can come to no other conclusion than that the men of our Permanent. Forces are sweated. If we gave these men an increase of  80  per cent, over Imperial rates - which is the minimum increase in the case of artisans - the various divisions would be paid as follows : - </para>
                        <para class="block">The position of sergeant-major of engineers, for instance, requires a high educational standard and expert technical knowledge. A position carrying similar responsibility is that of an engineer on a steamer; but, whereas the latter receives  ^20  per month and his keep, a sergeant-major of engineers in our service receives only <inline font-style="italic">£16</inline> a month, and has to keep himself. We pay our sergeants something like 5s. 6d. per day. To my mind, and from my personal experience, that is undoubtedly a sweating wage. These men, as Lord Kitchener pointed out, must be exceptionally good, mentally and physically. They have to attain a high standard of education and be physically perfect. They are often in charge of bodies of men, as they have to go out and take charge of the different gun corps. In outside employment gangers in charge of "bodies of men receive up to 11s. a day for their services; but the men in our permanent service, in the permanent artillery in particular, who act as sergeants or gangers, are receiving only 5s. 6d. per day. Gunners, who must also be fit for special work, receive the miserable sum of 4s. per day. "That may strike the honorable member for Melbourne as being diametrically opposed to the' opinion he expressed the other day when he said that our soldiers are paid more per unit than the soldiers of any other nation in the world. The figures I have quoted will, I am certain, bring honorable members to the conclusion that that statement is incorrect. Furthermore, in dealing with the report of Lord Kitchener, the honorable member to whom I am now directing attention said that it must be remembered that the circumstances of an officer's service prevented, and rightly so, his participation in commercial ventures. What applies to officers applies with equal force to the gunner and the noncommissioned officer. Men outside the military service may engage in private enterprises, but the soldier must be kept rigidly to his profession. Then why is it that our soldiers, if they become dissatisfied with their conditions, have no opportunity to place their case before an Arbitration Court ? It is true that a number of gentlemen ridicule the idea that any such opportunity should be given ; but not many years ago the same argument was applied in connexion with the Public Service generally. Since then, however, the Government have permitted public servants to approach the Court ; and, in my opinion, the same privilege ought to be granted to men of the permanent Defence Forces. Lord Kitchener went on to recommend that, in view of the conditions, a compulsory deduction should be made in each rank sufficient to insure adequate provision for maintenance on retirement. It will be seen from this that Lord Kitchener was in favour of some such scheme as is to-day being proposed. These men, after they have given the best of their lives to their country, should not be turned adrift practically penniless, but some scheme should be devised whereby they can end their days in comfort and in peace. The honorable member for South Sydney, who is of opinion that the men in the military service receive adequate pay, has said that since the Government took office the pay of the rank and file has been increased from  2s. 6d.  to  3s. 6d.  a day, and that, with clothing, food, and shelter, they receive the equivalent of  8s.  a day. If the men were receiving the equivalent of  8s.  a day, I am sure they could, amongst themselves, propound a scheme to provide for their old age; but, as a matter of fact, they receive nothing like that amount. They receive  3s. 6d.  for seven days, and are provided with two suits of clothes, a pair of boots, a couple of flannels, and food, which is equivalent, at the most, to another  2s. 6d.  ; bringing the pay to  6s.  a day. </para>

                                <para>- Personally, I do not think that the clothing and so forth amounts to  2s. 6d.  a day, but I have fixed on that amount, so as to allow a wide margin. Men in outside employment work only six days a week, and, very rightly, receive up to os. per day ; and if the military are paid for seven days they work seven days. Further on, the honorable member said that many men employed outside the service do not receive  24s. 6d.  a week clear after paying the expenses of the maintenance of their families. My reply is that neither do the men within the service receive that amount clear. They are paid for seven days, and receive  24s. 6d.  per week, but out of this many of them have to keep wives and families, whose position is not a very happy one in these days of high rents and high prices. Further on, the same honorable member said that, seeing the minimum military expenditure was  23s.  per head, or about the third highest in the world " we must be careful." Careful of what? Careful of the increasing expenditure? Have we to sweat these men in order to make our balance-sheet satisfactory? That same argument has been applied by employers who could not, or would not, pay a fair wage; many  a  time has it been declared that increased wages would result in the stopping of a business. The honorable member, and all of us, believe that every individual is entitled to a living wage,  and,  consequently, we support legislation which makes a living wage possible. The Government ought to act or* the principle that they have been indorsing for years, and see that the men in the Defence Forces have this right. Great Britain, which we generally regard as a Conservative country, does not forget her old soldiers, and has already provided a pension scheme.  In  the United States, owing to lack of foresight in this regard, the taxpayers are called upon to foot an enormous bill. After the Civil War, when the American people were silk of the whole proceeding, they had not the heart to refuse the (demands of those who had taken part in the war. The consequence has been that, whereas in  1861,  the pension fund of the United States was  .£200,000,  it had increased by  1865  to  ,£1,700,000,  by  1875  10 £5,900,000, by  1885  to  £13,000,000,.  by  1895  to  £30,000,000,  by  1905  to the enormous sum of  £34,000,000.  In other words, the further we get away from the war period the greater the amount paid in pensions to those who fought, or to those dependent on them. In Canada there is a pension scheme under which, according to the Defence Act of  1901,  no deduction is made from the pay of the rank and file, though in the case of officers there is a  5  per cent, deduction. In Canada, after fifteen years' service, a pension is given at the rate of one-fiftieth of  ,£100  for each, year of service, or  £30  a year ; after sixteen years' service,  £32  ; after twenty-six years' service,  £[52;  and after twentynineyears' service,  £68  a year. This question of defence pensions is a very important one. We are practically in our infancy,, so far as military operations are concerned, and it is necessary that we should have some guidance. Admiral Henderson, when, reporting on the Navy, particularly referred to the necessity of some system of pensions; and I was pleased to see the Minister introduce a scheme for what he calls "deferred pay." So far as our military are concerned, however, a system of deferred pay will cause hardship to a number of men who have been many years. in the service, and are just about to retire. When this question came up, last session I think, the Minister of Defence gave the men permission to meet and devise some-. scheme ; and the men drew up a number cf resolutions to which the Minister replied as follows - </para>

He has not done so, and he refuses to give us any information as to why he then moved that the debate be adjourned. </para>

                                <para>- I want no interjections from the supercilious member for Capricornia. I object to the proposal to submit this proposition to a referendum of the people. One of my chief reasons for that objection is that I can see that there is not the slightest chance of such a referendum being carried. We know what attitude would be taken up by trade unions - by the Australian Workers Union, for instance - and by such people as were engaged in the Brisbane strike. </para>

We might have heard something from the Minister regarding its financial aspect. Personally, I am in favour of the principle involved. I do not know how far the honorable member for Melbourne Ports wishes to go ; but to obtain the best men for the military service we must offer inducements to remain in it. It is continuity of service that creates efficiency, and those who enter our service should be inclined to make it the serious business of their life. </para>

                                <para>- The Government is supposed to lead the House on public questions to which attention is directed, and it is usual for a Minister to make an announcement regarding important matters of this kind. If the Minister representing the Minister of Defence says that the Government has not yet considered the proposal, but that on the passing of the motion it will do so, with a view to submitting a definite scheme, I shall be satisfied ; but we have had no declaration of the views of the Ministry. The provision of pensions may have to be considered also in regard to civil offices, such as those connected with the administration of Papua. Many of the civil officers in the Papuan service work under conditions of hardship, and receive salaries which are by no means extravagant'. Their claim to pensions should deserve consideration at the proper time. </para>

                            <para>- I confess myself in somewhat of a difficulty, regarding the statement which has been made. Personally, I do not care much whether the Government does or does not express an opinion on the motion. I have no desire for any Minister to guide me in the matter, and I certainly would not accept dictation regarding it ; I prefer to make up my own mind. The rambling statements of the honorable member for North Sydney convinced me that he is trying to make political capital. He is evidently trading on his reputation as a colonel. </para>

If they are opposed to the pension system, why is it? He is a poor student of history who does not know that the military has always been opposed to the workers, and on the side of patronage, privilege, and power. The working classes have had to fight the military classes for every advantage they have gained. </para>

                                <para>- No; but we refuse to submit to the arrogance of such men as the honorable member. The trade unionists are not men of the kind he suggests. The working classes recognise that the members of the Defence Forces are their brothers, and entitled to fair and reasonable payment for their services to the country. We look upon every man who is doing anything for the country as a worker, whether he uses his hands, his feet, or his pen. The members of the Defence Forces are working for their living as best they know how, and are entitled to consideration. I rejoice in the fact that the Democratic principle, upon which this Parliament is founded, and by which the country is now being governed, is opposed to the payment of pensions. I hold the view that those engaged in the military service should, when they can no longer carry on their duties, be assisted by the State ; but the granting of pensions is another matter. The references to the pensions system of the United Kingdom and the United States of America were not helpful to those who support the motion. Nothing is more unfortunate than the way in which the Mother Country has treated those who have spilt their blood in her defence. </para>

                                <para>- What is done is not to the credit of the Mother Country, and I should be sorry if we were to take her pensions system as the basis for a similar system here. There must be a better way, and it is in that better way that I hope the pension will be given. The United States of America pays annually an immense sum in pensions. </para>

I would support, by voice and vote, a system of insurance, compulsory or otherwise, to protect members of the Military Forces against the time when they will be unable to earn, their own living. They are especially deserving of consideration, because, although they must give their time exclusively to military pursuits, they are forced, after a few years, to retire at an age when they are comparatively helpless as regards entering into competition with others. The honorable member for Darling Downs suggests that we should make the military profession attractive, but I hope that in this country the profession of arms will not attract men from other avenues of employment. </para>

The great objection to the military system is that it causes the expenditure of a large sum of money on a Department that is absolutely unremunerative, and withdraws from the work of developing the country able and capable men, who should be employed in rural or industrial pursuits. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members who are supporting the motion are asking that the country shall provide a system of pensions. What I do hope to see before long in Australia is some system of State insurance, beginning with our own public servants, but eventually extending to the whole of the people of the country, whereby the whole of our public servants shall pay small amounts, by an easy method, into an insurance fund, from which they will be able to draw a. reasonable amount to assist them when they have to retire from active service. It is peculiar that we have over 30 per cent, of withdrawals from the Permanent Forces almost every year. There is a continual stream of men going out, the whole reason being that outside employment is more attractive in regard to its remuneration. If the proposal were to increase the remuneration of those men, and give them a reasonable payment for the time they put in, I should be heartily in support of it. I believe that the men employed in the military service of the Commonwealth, in view of the cost of living, are not being adequately remunerated, and I should be quite prepared to support any proposal, and approve of any increased expenditure, to assist them in that direction. </para>

                                <para>- lt does not matter who proposed the motion. As the Leader of the Opposition said, we are all in favour of it, but what I regret is that there is nothing definite about it. It does not commit us to anything, and therefore we can all help to pass it, feeling as though we had done a good thing, and yet knowing well enough that we had done nothing. It is a mere matter of balloon legislation. The motion is being made a purely political move, and the time of the House could be better occupied with a definite proposal. </para>

I should hail with a good deal of pleasure any concrete proposal or definite suggestion putting the matter on a right basis. It is a matter that demands attention. It is one of those things to which we ought to give our very closest and most favorable consideration ; and  1  hope that, whatever the fate of the motion may be, the time is not far distant when we shall provide some means whereby not only every member of the Military Forces, but every public servant of the Commonwealth throughout Australia, whatever rank he holds, shall be protected when the time comes for him to leave his occupation. </para>

                                <para>- I should never bury the honorable member. I should embalm him and put him in a political museum as a curiosity from Waverley. I am very much interested in the Opposition this afternoon. Finding that long-winded speeches have not done any good to their cause, they have evidently passed the word round to say very little. I never saw them so quiet before. We have not had a speech from the honorable and loquacious member for Wentworth this afternoon, although never on any previous occasion, I believe, has the honorable member allowed a motion to pass without making a speech of some kind. I cannot understand his silence to-day, unless it is that he hopes, as usual, to embarrass the Government. Honorable members opposite will not embarrass the Government very much by their tactics this afternoon. They are hoping to get this proposal through without any argument. The honorable member for North Sydney, who described me as supercilious because I wanted some information from him, did not put before the House a single argument why the motion should be carried. Members of the Opposition, by rising to speak and asking for an early vote, have indicated that they are very much in favour of raising the status and improving the financial position of  a  very poorly-paid section of the community. I have never known them to take up that <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> before. During this session, at any rate, they have been relentlessly pursuing a certain poorly-paid class in the community who work in the trenches, endeavouring to hold them up to ridicule and contempt, and cast a slur upon them. Are honorable members opposite in favour or a pension for the man in the trench when he becomes too old to carry on his occupation? Are they in favour of a pension for the wharf labourer, who runs great risks in following his calling? I venture to say there is as great a percentage of mortality amongst those workers, from the risks which they incur through handling cargo on the wharf, as there is among: the men who go out on active service. There is no proposition, however, to give the wharf labourers a pension. </para>

                                <para>-I understand that the retiring age of the military is about sixty years. Look round the wharfs, and find how many men are there at sixty or even fifty-five years of age. They are mostly very young men. Men engaged in that occupation for any lengthened period are old before their time, and are compulsorily retired, but they have no pension to support them in their crippled and declining years. Are honorable members opposite in favour of a pension for them ? Are they in favour of a pension for sailors, deck hands, or firemen? The firemen who travel along this coast and overseas have an abominably difficult time, and are compulsorily retired long before the age of fifty. Do honorable members opposite favour a pension for carpenters, builders' labourers, stone-masons, and others engaged in the building trade? There is no mention of them. Let any honorable member in this House, or in any other Legislature, where there is an Opposition of the same political opinions as those of honorable members opposite, propose to increase the wages of the workers in the building trade in order that they may have something to put by for their declining years, and he will find honorable members opposite opposing it to a man. Honorable members on the opposite side seem to think there is a very fine chance on this occasion of getting a few votes at the next election.Theythink that the Defence vote will he a considerable one, and they are setting their sails to catch any breeze. </para>

                                <para>- I shall not impute any improper motives to honorable members opposite, and I shall not pursue that line of argument farther. My chief objection to the system proposed by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is that it is of a class character. If we are going to do anything in the way of pensions, let it be general, and apply it to every citizen in the community. </para>

                                <para>- My idea is that we should have a system of national pensions. We are paying now from the Consolidated Revenue over ^2,000,000 per annum in the way of old-age and invalid pensions. Honorable members who come forward with a proposition like this should tell us how much it is going to cost. How much money will have to come out of the Consolidated Revenue, and how do they propose to raise the money? The honorable member for Flinders, and others, have already been talking about our extravagance in expending large sums of money ; but here is a proposition from the Opposition- </para>

The honorable member for Illawarra had much to say the other evening about taxing the poor working man. Does the honorable member propose now to tax the millionaires of Australia in order to pay military pensions? No; honorable members opposite would take the money out of the general revenue which is contributed mostly by the general public, who will not receive pensions. </para>

                                <para>- What we require is a national scheme, and not a scheme merely for our unfortunate defence men, with their 4s. a day. Not long ago there was great objection raised to the giving of free railway tickets to Ministers of the Crown who had been in office for a certain period, and the ground of the objection was that the pass, regarded commercially, really meant a pension of perhaps <inline font-style="italic">£jo</inline> a year. In any case, that is not much to give the poor politician, who, after a long, strenuous life, leaves this festive scene and goes out into the cold world ; but we do not favour the idea, because it means a sectional pension. Our desire is that every man and woman shall share in any benefits we can confer. I sympathize very much with military and naval men who are engaged at an unproductive occupation at poor pay. </para>

                                <para>- Perhaps; but their life is made weary in polishing up brass buttons and things of that kind, and in marching up and down like so many prisoners, half their time, or standing in certain postures for any period at the discretion of the officer in command. How very uncongenial their life becomes after a time is shown in the fact that in the United States, for instance, there are thousands of desertions from the army every year. Why is it not proposed to ameliorate the conditions of our soldiers and naval men - to make their life a little more bearable by giving them some trade or occupation which they can carry on in barracks after they have performed their ordinary duties, which become doubly irksome when imposed merely to keep them from being idle? There would then be no difficulty about paying them better wages, because they would, to a certain extent, become self-supporting. They would not be kept all day " polishing up the handle of the big front door," but would be doing useful work, and adding to the wealth of the country. I put that to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports as a practical business scheme for improving the lot of military and naval men. I am sorry to say that I cannot support the motion; but if the Government accept it, I am sympathetic enough to give due consideration to any scheme that may be introduced. No scheme, however, has been laid before us by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who, doubtless in a most generous spirit, has merely in a casual kind of way thrown down the motion. The Government, with their programme of business -and the machinations of the Opposition, have not time this session to discuss any pension schemes of the kind. The honorable member for Melbourne proposes to submit this question to the referendum. For very many questions I believe in the referendum; but there are others which cannot be so submitted, such, for example, as that submitted in South Australia the other day in regard to increasing the salaries of State members of Parliament beyond ^200 per annum. That is a question on which the people cannot very well make up their minds, because they do not really know the work of a member of Parliament. People outside may be very much surprised to know that I have to write some sixty or seventy letters a week. </para>

                                <para>- Then I shall withdraw the remark that the honorable member is "ferocious." The honorable member said that members of the Australian Workers Union, and trade unionists generally, would vote against this proposition if it were submitted to a referendum. If they did it would be for the reason that the vast majority of people outside who have to earn their daily bread, and to bear a considerable portion of the taxation of this country, would say that there was no pension for them until they reached the age of sixty- five years, when, provided that they had no property, they could draw an old-age pension of 10s. a week. Does it not seem rather unreasonable that we should give a pension of 10s. per week to the man who has saved nothing during his lifetime, and refuse to give any pension to the man who has saved £300 or £400? A deposit of £800 would provide interest amounting to about £26 per annum, and that is the amount which we pay by way of an old-age pension to a man who has, perhaps, every Saturday night got gloriously drunk, and never saved a penny ; while we refuse to give a pension to old people who, by saving, have secured a home over their heads. </para>

He spoke the other day of my embarrassing the Government.  1  hope that  1  am not doing so, and that I shall never embarrass this Government by making irrelevant and inordinately  lengthy speeches, which might well be marie on the hustings, but not in this House, where we are expected to keep to the question before the Chair. I wish to emphasize the point that I am thoroughly in sympathy wilh those military and naval men who are being paid a sweating wage. People who are making huge fortunes in and out of Australia should contribute to the public revenue sufficient to enable us to pay naval and military men something more than a living wage. I do not take the view held by some of my friends outside, that the poor of Australia have nothing to defend; nor do I think that view is shared by many people in the Commonwealth. People prefer to live under the Australian Government- </para>

                                <para>- There is a certain measure of interruption which makes my remarks rather diffuse. I certainly desire to be concise and clear. I am pointing out why rich men, who draw large revenues from Australia, but live abroad, should pay more. We allow such men to escape taxation to such an extent that they are able to live in luxury at the other end of the world, without doing anything towards the production of the wealth that they enjoy. We ought to get more out of such men. </para>

                                <para>- Tn reply to die honorable member for Calare, I venture to say that it would not be a bad idea to impose a little more taxation on men with big. holdings, in order to get the money necessary for a pension scheme. We have a graduated land tax, and I would not favour a reduction of the exemption, ir» order to secure the money necessary for such a scheme as this ; hut I would impose a heavier burden On the big landholder, and compel him to pay more. </para>

                                <para>- The big capitalist is the man who makes it necessary for us to have a h'g defence scheme, and he is the man who ought to pay. As I remarked a few days ago, 1 believe that the capitalists of the world could decide the question of peace or war. They could .so shape their actions as to render it unnecessary for us to hn ve such an extensive defence' scheme as at present, with the result that we should have more money with which to pay our soldiers and sailors. As to the question whether I would raise the money necessary for this pension scheme by means of a Federal income tax, 1 can only say that I see no objection to such a tax, provided that a sufficiently high exemption be fixed. Under the Federal Land Tax --vet we have an exemption of £5.000 of unimproved value. I have not quite made up my mind whether such a large exemption should be allowed in the cr.se of a Federal income tax, but it might be necessary, in view of the fact that most of the States at present levy an income tax. Honorable members might think that we could not get the money for a pensions scheme of this kind by means of an income tax, because the amount gained at present is not very large; but I believe a good deal of revenue could be secured by taxing very large incomes. No man ought to be permitted to amass a fortune of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 in his lifetime. Our social organization is wrong when it is possible for a man to acquire that amount of property, whilst we pay naval and military men only 4s. or 5s. a day. Are honorable members of the Opposition prepared to support a scheme to pay naval and military men 8s. or .9s. a day, and at the same time to tax the Australian millionaires who are able in a lifetime to acquire as much as £4.000.000 in wealth or property? Has it ever occurred to honorable members that if a man getting  £1,000  a year saved the whole sum, it would take him  1,000  years, could he live so long, to accumulate  £1,000.000? </para>

                                <para>- I am pointing out that there is a way of providing for a pension scheme, namely, bv taxing our millionaires, who make thousands every year, and die worth £3,000,000 or £4,000,000. If we wish to help the naval and military men, we should give them a living wage, and should not require them to defend the property of millionaires for 4s. or 5s. a day. It is not to be thought that, because I refer to them as defending the property of millionaires, that is all they have to defend. They defend the hearths and homes of the poor as well as of the rich. 1 heartily sympathize with the desire of the members of the Defence Force to improve their position. In my opinion, officers who now have to retire at sixty years should, if in good health and mentally and physically robust, have their period of service extended by five or seven years, or so long as they are capable of good service. Nowadays we do not live the fast life that used to be lived, .when even kings died at the age of thirty. Military and naval officers, like others, take more ore of themselves, and many of them at sixty have ten years' capacity for service. One of the means of improving their condition would be to enable them to remain in the service as long as they are fit for the duties of their positions. I hope that the honorable member for Melbourne will not press his proposal for a referendum. If he does, I fear that the public will be embarrassed, when called upon to vote at the next election, by the number of questions put before them. There is the all-important question whether we shall find our way back here. </para>

                                <para>- The amendment proposes the taking of a referendum, and I am giving, perhaps imperfectly, reasons why that is not a wise course to adopt. I have shown that I am thoroughly in sympathy with the- desire of the members of the Defence Force to have their rates of wages improved, and that the members of the Opposition would not support any attempt in that direction. I have shown that their support of the motion is a piece of electioneering dodgery. Having done that, I am ready to have a division taken on the question. </para>

                            <para>. - I am totally opposed to the establishment of a pension system. This Parliament, in its first session, when providing for the appointment of Judges to the High Court, resolved that pensions should not be attached to judicial positions, and the people of Australia understand that we do not intend to revert to the pension system of the Old Country. Like the honorable member for Capricornia, I cannot forget that if  1  vote for pensions for the Military and Naval Forces, I shall have to ask the miners, the carpenters, the artisans, and other hard-working persons in the community, who are not so well off, to contribute to the pensions fund. Those persons would be justified in pointing out that, although their occupations are precarious, and they have no continuity of employment, pensions are not provided for them. In Sydney, during the last three or four- weeks, there are men in the building and engineering trades, with which I have been mostly connected, who have not earned 25s. a week, even at the present rates. The average labourer getting 9s. a day does not earn <inline font-style="italic">£go</inline> a year, taking into account public holidays and other lost time, and many mechanics, who are apparently in constant employment, do not make more than £148 a year. I am speaking of what I know, 'because I have checked the figures on the time-sheets of contractors, and on my own time-sheets. The statements hold true in regard to men who have been employed by me for ten or twelve years. Could I ask such men to contribute to a pension fund for the benefit of military officers getting more than £200 a year? I could not, although many of these officers are personal friends of mine. I admit that a man who devotes his life to military service, and is retired at the age of fifty-five, is not fitted for commercial life afterwards. As a soldier, he is removed from commercial pursuits, and, in many cases, such men, having left the military service, have completely failed in business, and, where they have had a few pounds to invest, have been "taken down." I should like to know why the military officers should .not, like the railway servants of New South Wales, be asked to contribute to a superannuation fund. The word " pension " I cannot swallow; it seems to stick in my throat. I therefore propose to substitute for it " superannuation fund." Of course, to give effect to that proposal it would be necessary to obtain actuarial tables. I have had experience in this matter in connexion with friendly societies and other bodies. A difficulty arises by reason of the fact that many officers are now comparatively near their retiring age, and very large contributions would be required from them to make provision for a superannuation allowance at all commensurate with their present salary. As for the proposal for a referendum, I do not know whether the honorable member for Melbourne has any idea of the opinions of the people of Australia, but, in my view, to give effect to his amendment would make him a laughingstock. </para>

That is what I am trying to make them understand. It is of no use to deal with the question unless we do it in such a way tha* our action will be beneficial to those whom we want to benefit, while, at the same time, the people of Australia are not penalized by having to provide the pensions. Personally, I should like to see some provision made in this direction, but I am strongly convinced that the present Government are so anxious <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do justice <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> everybody that they will not overlook a matter of this kind. They are determined that no section of the community, especially those in their service, shall be deprived of any privilege to which they are entitled, and if people have been in the military service for many years there will be a natural inclination on the part of the Government to treat them favorably. If I looked at this matter from the point of view of a politician, I should say, " I must do something, because there are a large number of military officers in my electorate," but I do not want to look at it in that light. I want to take the point of view of the man who represents the people of the whole of Australia, and not his own electorate only. As I should like to present to the House, some actuarial tables on the subject, I ask leave to continue my remarks o* a future day. </para>

The proposal is so obviously in the interests of sound finance that it would be difficult for any future historian, digging up the musty records of the third Commonwealth Parliament, to understand why the Commonwealth ever showed reluctance to pay municipalities for the services rendered by them to its agencies. Apparently it is necessary to ask the authorities of the Commonwealth to carry out their simple obligations to the great municipal self-governing bodies «f Australia.

                        State must not " impose " a tax upon any property of the Commonwealth, and, consequentially, no agency of a State - and municipalities are State agencies - has that power. The power, if it were given, might possibly be used for illegitimate purposes, in order, so to speak, to blackmail the Commonwealth for special rates which ordinary taxpayers had not to bear, but, whilst the illegitimate taxation of the Commonwealth is prevented, there is nothing in that section of the Constitution, nor can anything be read into it, which denies to the

                    <para class="block">The question of payment for services rendered to Commonwealth Departments is undoubtedly a matter " relating to Departments of the Public Service under the control of the Commonwealth." We have, therefore, an .express power in that section, which is not taken away from us by section 114 of the Constitution. As a matter of strict fact, if there had been no provision whatever in the Constitution, the Crown - and the Commonwealth of Australia is the Crown in this connexion - would be exempt from taxation by any other body. The Crown is exempt from taxation whether there is a written Constitution, as in Australia, or an unwritten one, as in Great Britain. The Imperial Parliament, however, recognises its obligations to these great self-governing bodies, and pays yearly, as an act of grace, an amount to which it would have been subject in rates and taxes, were it not exempt through the exemption of the Crown from taxation. The amount given in the Imperial Estimates for 1910 for this purpose was £563,000. </para>

In July, 1909 - I have no later figures, but there will not be any material difference - the unimproved value of Commonwealth properties in Australia was £2,035.855, and the improved value was £6,214,789. As far as I can find from the Statistical Department of the Commonwealth, the rates and taxes for the year 1909, if the Commonwealth. had not been exempt, would have been <inline font-style="italic">£51,542,</inline> but the Commonwealth already pays the sum of  £14,139  per year for sanitation and water services, so that the new payment that would have to be made for common municipal services would amount to  £37)4°3  - not a vast sum of money in order to recognise the obligation of the Commonwealth to pay for all services rendered to it by municipalities. </para>

After all, the continued .greatness ot the people does not depend only on economic production, but equally on the maintenance of the individual physique and stamina of the people. In matters of health, sanitation, and housing, which present some of the biggest problems of to-day, we have to look to the municipalities. If we recognise this fact, the Commonwealth Parliament ought to pay the municipalities for the services they are rendering us in lighting our streets, paving our roads, and making the Commonwealth Offices accessible to Commonwealth officers. 1 shall not detain the House, because I should like, if possible, to have a vote taken this afternoon ; and, further, I addressed myself to the subject at greater length previously. On that occasion, unfortunately, one of the Ministers was opposed to this project. This question, however, is an absolutely non-party one ; and I hope I shall receive support from both sides of the Chamber. </para>

                    <para>The motion on a previous occasion was seconded by the honorable member for East Sydney, who showed, in the clearest way, the unequal bearing of the present practice as it affects municipalities. If every municipal area had an equal proportion of Government property within its borders, it might be urged that such an allowance would be merely putting money from one pocket into another. But, even so, the contention would be faulty, inasmuch as every governing body ought to pay for the services it receives, and be credited for the services it gives. In this case, the distribution of Commonwealth properties is, unfortunately, though necessarily, most unequal. One municipality may have a whole host of Government properties within its borders, as pointed out by the honorable member for East Sydney, and as will be recognised by the honorable member for Nepean and the honorable member for Maribyrnong ; and such municipalities should not be penalized because they have been chosen as localities in which to carry on the great services of Australia. </para>
                    <para>I commend this motion with confidence, asking both sides to give it their impartial consideration, and  not to be led away by this or that prejudiced person in office, whose impressions have probably been gained from some public servant anxious to avoid the trouble of adjustments. </para>

                        <para>.- I have much pleasure in seconding the motion. The honorable member for Wentworth has covered the ground so completely that it is not necessary for me to add very much. I cannot, however, understand the attitude of the Government. With a surplus, and more money than they know well what to do with, the Government could very easily recognise what seems to me to be the al )solutely just and reasonable claim made by the various municipalities, not for a tax on Federal properties, but for an allowance in lieu of taxation which, ' under the Constitution, cannot be levied. It is contended that the States in which these Commonwealth properties are situated get such service from them as to entitle the Government to consider that the numerous municipal functions performed for the State generally should be given to the Commonwealth; practically, without charge. It is to be remembered, however, that these Commonwealth properties, situated as they usually are in the capital cities, do not give a service to the capital cities alone. For instance, the General Post Office and the various military buildings in the State capitals do not exist for the benefit of the capital cities alone; in fact, it may be urged that these buildings exist in a capital city very largely for the benefit of people outside - for the benefit of the State as a whole. Yet municipal authorities have to carry out expensive works in connexion with services which these properties enjoy, while the State as a whole gets the benefit. It is only reasonable that the Commonwealth should meet the municipalities in an equitable spirit. I feel that the precedent which has been already established in Great Britain could very advantageously be adopted here. The Commonwealth Government, with its Imperialistic tendencies, ought, I think, to welcome another opportunity to show its willingness to follow a good example. I hope that the motion will be carried, and that it will be an instruction to the Government to do something which is not unreasonable, but which may be fairly expected from them. If we make such a suggestion to the Government, I feel certain that, with their ordinary democratic spirit, they will recognise it as a direction to make haste to retrace the steps which they have taken in error up to the present time. </para>

The honorable member for Wentworth has embodied in the motion a statement to the effect that the practice recommended has been followed by the Imperial Government ; but he does not say for how long that has been so. It may have been for a few years or longer ; but I know that it was not always the practice of the Imperial Government to subsidize municipalities and shire councils to the extent of the rates that would otherwise have been paid on Government property. Another view, which I do not press as an exceptional one, is that, up to the present, no State Government, so far as I can gather, has yet initiated such a practice. </para>

                            <para>- I do not advance this as a particularly powerful reason why the Commonwealth should not make a grant, because  1  do not know that we should necessarily be guided by the conduct of any State Parliament in any matter. We have to remember, however, that the State Parliaments have considered this subject from time to time, and that many honorable members, who now occupy seats in this House, must have discussed the matter when members of State Houses. At any rate, the arguments have proved sufficiently powerful to prevent any State Parliament accepting the principle up to the present time; and the arguments submitted this afternoon are not strong enough to convince me that it is the duty of the Commonwealth. Government to make any such grant.I cannot help overhearing the somewhat loud remarks being made by some honorable members who have certain Governmentbuildings within their districts. Why are those buildings there? </para>

                            <para>- Not necessarily. It unquestionably suits the Departments to have certain buildings in a particular place ; and we may take it for granted that they were put in the best possible places, in view of the ' information available when their establishment was decided on. It does not follow, however, that the buildings are in the best places at the present time ; it may be that the buildings are left where they are simply because they happen to have been placed there at a time when it was thought by a majority that they were being put in the best places. Further, we may take it that honorable members have been particularly keen - and this is not to their discredit, but, on the contrary, to their credit - on securing the establishment of Government buildings within their districts. </para>

                            <para>- I admire the enthusiasm displayed by honorable members in that direction. No doubt they are doing what each and every one of us does in certain circumstances - no doubt they are doing their very best for their electorates, when the Government are considering the erection of public buildings. But the very moment those buildings are erected some honorable members, not satisfied with the expenditure of public money, ask that there shall be an additional expenditure in the shape of a grant to municipalities. As to the interjection made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports regarding certain military stables now being erected in his district, I may say that I have never known a municipal council to offer a word of opposition to the erection of public buildings within its boundaries. </para>

                            <para>- There is no particular reason why one particular municipality should suffer for another, and there is no especial reason why shire councils out in the back-blocks, that do not yet enjoy the privileges attaching to any public building, should be made to suffer in order that we may subsidize other municipal councils in respect of public buildings within their boundaries. We have to remember that there are areas outside of Melbourne Ports and Paddington. If I were to study my own political interests, I should support this motion, for, representing, as I do, the city of Adelaide, I have within my electorate several large public buildings, such as the General Post Office and the barracks, which occupy a prominent position, and rates in respect of which would amount to a considerable sum. The Adelaide City Council has been active in preferring requests for Government assistance in making pavements in front of public buildings, and carrying out like works, so that, if I studied my own political interests, I should certainly be found supporting this motion. I happen, however, to have had the unique experience of representing a country district for some years prior to my election as the representative of Adelaide, and consequently I am able to place myself in the position of a representative of a rural constituency, the residents in which do not enjoy the privileges of city life or the advantages that attach to the erection of huge public buildings. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member lived, for instance, in Blinman, South Australia, he would recognise how limited is the service which such country places receive from the General Post Office, Adelaide. If those who, like myself, are luxuriating, so to speak, within huge city boundaries, lived in some of the backblocks, they would find how limited is the service that people there receive from the public buildings in our large cities. Indirectly, of course, a general benefit is derived by the whole community from the establishment of public institutions, but a man living 1,000 miles away from Adelaide is very little concerned with the General Post Office there, and I fail to see why he should be taxed in order that an elegant footpath may be laid in front of the General Post Office in any city. I have not yet heard that the absence of a subsidy of this kind has caused any municipality to be seriously involved in a financial sense. No man, however, wealthy, will refuse to take more money when it is offered to him, and no municipality, no matter how good its financial position may be, would refuse to take this subsidy if the Federal Parliament decided to grant it. </para>

                            <para>- The Federal Government pay for services rendered, but they do not pay ordinary municipal rates. The honorable member for Wentworth admits that this will be a gradually increasing expenditure, and the Minister of Home Affairs estimates that it will involve an outlay of nearly£60,000 per annum. I aim not prepared to say which estimate is correct, hut we may be sure that the adoption of this proposal would involve the expenditure of many thousands of pounds per annum. Some honorable members are constantly referring to the rapidly increasing expenditure of the Commonwealth, and we ought to consider whether, in the circumstances, we should be justified in adding this expenditure to that of which they complain. On its face, this motion seems to possess some degree of fairness ; but when we remind the elector, who has been considerably stirred by the outcry regarding the colossal expenditure of the Commonwealth, that the adoption of this motion would involve the expenditure of many thousands of pounds per annum, we shall put him in a fit frame of mind to ask whether it is a fair proposition, and whether, after all, the references which  we  have heard to extravagant expenditure are of a really conscientious character, or whether they have not a political aspect. </para>

                            <para>-  I am not. I said in my opening remarks that I was not speaking for the Government. I have not asked my colleagues what position they intend to take up, but I shall vote against this motion. I think that I am justified in asking honorable members to give special consideration to the expenditure which this proposal would involve, and to consider whether we could not spend the money to better advantage. This afternoon several honorable members have expressed their full and unqualified approval of a certain motion. That is an easy and a popular thing to do. The adoption of that motion, however, would mean the expenditure of some thousands of pounds, and, in all probability, a day or two hence some of the very honorable members who supported it will be denouncing the Government in general terms - but failing to specify details - because of what they describe as its rapidly increasing expenditure. There is no fear, so far as the Government are concerned, if honorable members will specify any one item of expenditure to which they object. But when honorable members time after time support motions which must add largely to the Commonwealth expenditure, and immediately afterwards denounce, at public meetings all over the country, the expenditure of the Government, I am justified in calling attention to their attitude. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; and when any honorable member opposite complains of the expenditure, and specifies the items to which he objects, no complaint can lie. In such circumstances, those who are responsible for the expenditure will, I am confident, be able to justify it. But I am justified in calling attention to the attitude of those who complain in general terms of the expenditure of the Government, and who, at the same time, are prepared to support motions the adoption of which would add largely to the expenditure of the Commonwealth. This is not a fair request to make in the circumstances. The money that is available can be better spent in other ways with more advantage to the community generally. The proposed expenditure would be in the interests of a limited number. I know how hard it is to withstand the pressure of municipal councils, having been for some years, before entering the political arena, a councillor myself. I remember how energetically we button-holed the local member of Parliament, and how incessantly we made requests to the State Government. Those requests were often refused point-blank, but I do not remember that we ever made a claim similar to that now being put forward. I hope that, in the general interest, apart from the particular interest of any council or shire which enjoys -the advantage of having a Commonwealth building within its boundaries, the motion will not be pressed, because it is not a fair one in the circumstances. </para>

                            <para>. - I should not speak on this motion were not I strongly of the opinion that it is fully justified. In the division which I have the honour to represent, there are no ornamental Commonwealth buildings, nor any Commonwealth buildings that are not mere public necessities, conveniences which could not be refused to the community. There might not be so great a demand for rates from the Commonwealth were it not for the mean-spirited administration of the Commonwealth Public Works Department. When taxpayers are compelled to walk ankle deep in mud to get to a post-office, and can get no redress from the Commonwealth Government, some change should be made. Either the Government should keep in proper repair the approaches to its premises, or it should pay the local authorities for doing so. In one town in my division the public buildings occupy the <inline font-style="italic">frontages of two</inline> blocks, extending over 220 yards each. When, some time ago, I asked the Home Affairs Department to asphalt the footpath in front of this property, the reply came that it was the affair of the municipality. If that be so, it is the affair of the Commonwealth to pay the municipality for doing the work. Under the New South Wales Local Government Act, all owners of property in a shire or municipality are compelled to pay 50 per cent, of the cost of kerbing and guttering the footpaths in front of it, and are rated on its unimproved value. There may be in Victoria Commonwealth institutions which may be regarded as a benefaction bestowed by a generous Government on the municipalities in which they have been placed, but there are no such institutions in my electorate. Just outside the boundaries of a town in the Nepean electorate, there is a Commonwealth factory to which there is constant traffic along a road for which the municipality is held wholly responsible, but in a Victorian division, in a similar case, the local authority has been able to secure substantial contributions from the Commonwealth funds for the maintenance of the road. It is because in my division no consideration of this kind has been shown to the local authorities that I support the motion, though I do so with reluctance. </para>

                            <para>. - I was surprised at the arguments of the Minister. If his contention that Commonwealth institutions should not be taxed because they often bring a large population into a municipality were to hold good, it would apply with equal force to the property of large employers of labour. In my division, there are iron works, coal mines, tweed mills, and other factories, the establishment of which has brought a large population into the neighbourhoods where they are situated, but that is not considered a good reason for exempting the proprietors from the payment of rates. As for the statement that there is no instance in Australia of a Government paying rates, I would remind the Minister that it is only recently that the Government of New South Wales discontinued subsidizing the municipalities of the State, and the shire councils still receive an annual subsidy, the land tax which used to be levied by the Government being handed over to the municipalities. The local authorities have nothing to thank the Commonwealth Government for in connexion with the public buildings erected within their boundaries. These buildings have been placed in positions convenient for Commonwealth purposes without consulting the local authorities. In my division, there is the Small Arms Factory, to which leads a road, about 8 chains of which is practically impassable ; and recently a motor car was stuck there for a week. The Commonwealth says that the local municipality should make the road and keep it in order; but the municipality replies, " You ought to pay rates on your premises, or make a contribution towards the maintenance of the road, because it is used only to give access to your property, and any expenditure on it improves that property." In thickly populated areas the existence of Commonwealth buildings is sometimes a hardship. The Paddington municipality, for instance, receives nothing from the Victoria Barracks, and if the land were used for other purposes, it would get a big income from the rating of it. The " National " argument is no argument at all, because the BritishGovernment makes an allowance to the local authorities. We need not be afraid of the cost; it would not be very much, after all. In New South Wales, the rating is on unimproved values. </para>

                                <para>- That is not a large sum. The contention that to pay rates would mean an enormous expenditure is a bogy raised to frighten members from voting for the motion. Why should the Commonwealth ask the municipal authorities to shoulder its burdens? </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. The Minister had a great deal to say about Adelaide and thickly populated centres; but I have received dozens of applications from persons in the municipalities in my division asking me to get the Commonwealth authorities to put the approaches to post-offices in proper order. The invariable reply to my representations is that the local authorities should do the work. The providing of access to Commonwealth buildings, and the lighting of the streets, should be paid for by the Commonwealth just as other owners of property pay for the services given to them by the municipalities. We shall be doing only what is fair by voting to the municipalities and shires a sum of money in lieu of rates. Every local governing body in New South Wales circularized its members, Commonwealth and State, on this subject, the desire being that both the Commonwealth and the State Governments shall pay rates on their properties, and thus bear their fair share of the burden of maintaining and lighting roads of access. I hope that the motion will be carried. </para>

                            <para>.- The wish just expressed by the last  speaker  is not echoed by me. I recognise the value of the work of municipal councils. It is one of the highest importance, and done by men without reward. Therefore the remarks which I shall make must not be regarded as disparaging of that work, but designed merely to properly focus attention on this proposal, which is that the Commonwealth shall pay rates on its properties. That is not a fair proposal. In the matter of Defence, for instance, the Commonwealth is asked to spend millions on an unproductive undertaking. If we are going to give money to municipalities is it fair that we should give it only to those in whose boundaries the Government have spent the most money, and so improved the value of their property ? We have raised the value of the surrounding properties by the erection of big Commonwealth buildings. Honorable members are all eager to get these works in their constituencies, but when they get them they ask us to subsidize the councils because we put them there. If this National Government is to give any money to municipal councils, I would suggest that we should distribute it in the shape of a subsidy. There are places in my electorate which would get no money from rates under the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth, but which would be very glad to receive Commonwealth money to spend on making military roads to the sea coast for defence purposes. </para>

                                <para>- The broad national view comes in, in the case of the honorable member, who has in his electorate two places which he thinks will get an advantage from his proposition. The honorable member for Nepean talked about the roads that were cut up. If any particular action of the Government has inflicted hardship on any place, we should deal with that case specially, but to lay down a general rule that we should pay rates on every public building is an absurd proposition. It will mean that in the large centres, where the municipalities are financially strong, and where the largest number of Federal buildings has been erected, we shall be paying out the great bulk of the subsidy, whereas in the back country, where the people would be glad to have a black stump with a kerosene tin on it for a post office, none of the money will be received. If we are to take the broad national view referred to by the honorable member for Wentworth, if we believe in a decentralization policy, we ought to spend any money that we have to spare on losing propositions in the back country. I can assure honorable members that shire councils in the bush part of my electorate, and of other honorable members' electorates, would be very glad to have one-fourth of the money spent on public buildings, without looking for any rates. Even the largest town in my electorate, the town of Warrnambool, would be glad to have the Woollen Mills established within its boundaries, and not expect any extra rates on the property. I do not think even the Geelong council will turn down the proposition to have the Woollen Mills established in their territory, if they do not get any rates on the building when it is erected. The argument of the honorable member for Nepean with regard to the cutting up of roads goes right back to the old toll-bar system. I take it that the honorable member believes in the system of rating on unimproved values. The very first argument we are met with when we advocate rating on unimproved values is the argument we have heard from the honorable member for Nepean about the cutting up of roads. We are told that if a man raises sheep on a big property he should not be asked to pay as much in rates on the same area and the same value of land, as a farmer should pay, because the farmer grows potatoes and hay, and cuts up the road in carting them to market. The argument is that, because the farmer is progressive, he must pay more rates on the same quantity of land in the same locality. We advocate an enlightened system of taxation on the unimproved value, but we have not got it in Victoria. The honorable member for Nepean would go right away from that proposition. </para>

                                <para>- Under our present system many land-owners go practically free, but when the Federal Government purchase land, put up a valuable building on it, and give employment in the district, causing houses to spring up all over the place to provide homes for the workmen, the rates received by the local council from that area are trebled and quadrupled. Land which was formerly returning only a few shillings is made to return as many pounds, but because the Federal Government have benefited the municipality in that way, they are to be asked to pay rates also. </para>

Cut off that communication, break up the railway line, smash down the telephone, interrupt the mail service, and the value of land in the city of Melbourne will drop considerably. </para>

                                <para>- It was the honorable member for Perth that raised the issue, by his interjection. Prior to the present Government coming into office, people in Mel bourne, Sydney, and other cities were getting their telephone services for practically a song; but when a telephone line was built in a country district, the people there, were charged every penny of the difference between the revenue and expenditure. At the present time they are charged 75 pec cent., the Government taking the responsibility for the other 25 per cent; while in the cities the people are asked, under the toll system, to pay something like a fair thing for the services they receive. Every telephone line and mail service the people in the back country get, although some immediately show a loss, shows an actual gain in the receipts of the General Post Office in Melbourne. </para>

The State pays no land tax to us, and we pay none to them..

                                <para>- Is it worthy of the dignity of this Chamber to raise the paltry question of whether one public body should pay rates to another public body? One would think we were different entities, whereas the Federal Parliament represents all the municipal councils of Australia. If, as one honorable member has said, this is only a matter of bookkeeping, why "raise such a dust"? But it is not only a matter of bookkeeping, for it means that £50,000 or £60,000 for the first year at least - and this is advocated by honorable members who talk about the extravagance of the Government - will be paid by the Federal Government to some of the wealthiest municipal cities in Australia. The honorable member for Wentworth laughs, but it is a fact that the big city councils will get the bulk of the money. </para>

                                <para>-Yes. Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, and others. In the back country of Victoria and New South Wales there are shire councils which, even with heavy rates, find it almost impossible to provide a simple bush track cleared of stumps. These shire councils have no public buildings worthy of the name, and are wearing their hearts out trying to get a little post-office, or some public facility of the kind. To such councils this motion would provide practically nothing, and yet they are the very councils that should have our consideration. On the other hand, the bulk of the money, as I say, will go to the large city municipalities, with their highly-improved land values, with their magnificent buildings, on land worth up to £1,000 a foot, the rentals from which make their owners wealthy. We build great post-offices at the very front doors of these people, and give them three mail deliveries a day ; and yet this National Parliament is asked to subsidize great city councils in order to relieve wealthy ratepayers. Where is this money to come from ? The other day we were told by the honorable member for Laanecoorie that, in some way, the building of the Federal Capital had to do with municipal and shire councils ; and he justified the position by saying that every penny spent by the Federal Government meant so much less money for those municipal bodies. The honorable member pointed out that the money had to be raised from the same people, and that, therefore, if the Federal Government increased taxation, there would be so much less for the local bodies. At any rate, this motion means raising more money from people who will get nothing in return, while city congestion and centralization will be promoted. Yet when people in the back-country ask for a telephone service, they are called upon to pay for it. </para>

                                <para>- My desire is to see the Government spend more money in providing facilities for the people in the back country, instead of subsidizing city councils. It is inevitable that the question of town <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> country should be raised on this motion ; and my view is that, if £50,000 or £60,000 is to be spent on municipal councils, it ought, in all fairness, to be given to those councils which most require assistance. </para>

                                <para>- I am going to use my voice in this chamber, and elsewhere, in support of the principle that the cities should be charged more than they have been charged to help the people of the back country. I do not say that because I happen to represent a country constituency, but because it is a sound proposition - that when the cities are fed by the people of the back country, the latter should get something more of a <inline font-style="italic">quid, pro quo</inline> in return.  1  hope that there is no chance of this motion being carried, because it would be the first t.me in the history of Australia when one public body has been asked to pay rates to another public body. There is no more reason why we should pay rates to municipal councils than there is why municipal councils should pay the Federal land tax. From that tax we exempt the municipal councils, and rightly so ; and, in the same way, the State Governments are exempt. Those cities to which we render the greatest services are the last to which we should pay rates. </para>

                            <para>.- I rise to reply to some of the fallacies and peculiar statements of the Honorary Minister, and also to correct the honorable member for Robertson, who is under a misapprehension. The correction is one  I  have to make, not only every session, but several times in a session ; and it has reference to money already voted by the Federal Parliament for the construction of a particular road. I desire once more to say that this money is voted simply because the road is Commonwealth property ; and the other money which I desire to have spent is for another portion of the road within the territory of the poor, unfortunate, country shire known by the name of Braybrook. I have no desire to raise the question of town <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> country ; but  1  can say that for quite a number of years  1  have been a ratepayer in both. I found that in one city area where I lived a few years ago I had to pay a rate of 2s. 6d. in the £1, and that when I shifted into the country all I was called upon to pay was is. in the £1. </para>

                                <para>- The valuations were not too good. When I returned once more into the city I was called upon to pay 2S. 3d. in the £1 ; and if we analyze the rates paid in most of the country shires, and compare them with those paid in the cities, we see that the countryman pays much less, lt will be seen, therefore, that the argument of the honorable member for Corangamite does not hold water. A great " mouthful " has been made of the fact that the erection of some of these Commonwealth buildings enhances the value of land in the vicinity. That is not so in the case of the Cordite Factory in my constituency, where the people do not desire it, and would be very glad if it were removed. As a matter of fact, owing to the presence of the factory, an Essendon or Braybrook citizen is debarred from the use of a boulevard which was made at considerable expense alongside the Saltwater River by the ratepayers, the Government having thought fit to " warn off " the people. </para>

This amount ceased to be payable in1879, but a subsidy, amounting to £310,000, was voted by Parliament annually, and was increased year by year, until £450,000 was  granted  in 1889-90 and 1890-91. The Local Government Act1891 authorized the payment  of  an annual endowment of £450,000, but this amount was reduced year by year to £50,000 in1902, but was increased to £75.000 for the year1906-7, and to £100,000 from the 1st July, 1907. </para>

                        <para class="block">To-day, by Act of Parliament, the Victorian Government make this grant apply to every shire council. I am in hearty sympathy with certain sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Corangamite, and shall always do my utmost to give the man in the back-blocks some of the comforts of the more settled districts, and every facility to get his produce to market. I should like to point out to the honorable member, however, that the subsidy granted by the Victorian Government is distributed as follows :  - In the case of first class shires, at the rate of 3s. in the £1 ; second class. 5s. in the£1 ; third class, 6s. in the £1 ; fourth class, 8s. in the £1 ; and fifth class, 10s. in the £r. The way-back shires, which would include such a district as Beech Forest, are placed in the sixth class, and receive a grant equal to 12s. in the £1. These figures show how the country shires fare in comparison with city municipalities. Most of the municipalities within the city areas receive practically no subsidy, and whilst some of them levy a rate up to 2s. 3d. in the £1 - they can levy a rate up to 2s. 6d. in the £1 - the average rate in the case of country municipalities is1s. or1s. 3d. in the £1. In exceptional cases a rate of1s. 6d. in the £1 is levied. </para>

                                <para>- No, I am sorry to say that that system of municipal taxation is not in operation in Victoria, but I believe that the day is coming when it will be. In Queensland the State Government instead of granting a subsidy to municipal councils, have made it possible for them under a special Act of Parliament to borrow money from them on the best terms, and in that way, no doubt, they assist them materially in carrying out their works. In common justice the Commonwealth should be prepared to contribute to the cost of maintaining roads of which it is in some cases the chief user. In my own electorate roads have been made almost impassable owing to the heavy cartage in connexion with the Cordite Factory. Some roads out there are in a disgraceful state. I hope that next month a goodly number of honorable members will join me in visiting Commonwealth property in my electorate. </para>

                                <para>- I believe that he made an effort to travel along one of the roads in my electorate, but found it impossible to do so. It is a veritable quagmire as the result of the heavy cartage brought about by the Federal Government. The Government, however, expect the ratepayers of the shire to make the road in question as level as a billiard table to facilitate the cartage of goods to arid from the Cordite Factory. I do not know whether my case is exceptional, but I do know that at one time the Braybrook Shire Council received revenue from property on both sides of a road which has now been purchased by the Commonwealth, and from which the municipality consequently no longer obtains any income. The shire for which I am fighting is not a wealthy one. I dare say it would be found, if its financial position were compared with that of some of the way-back shires, that it has just as much trouble to make ends meet as have some other country municipalities. It is pounced 9n, however, by the powerful Commonwealth Government, which refuses to recognise its responsibilities in this regard. The Commonwealth acquires rateable property and refuses to pay rates in respect of it. It uses roads leading to this property, cuts them up badly, and then" has the unblushing effrontery, to say to the local council, " Put these roads in proper order so that we may continue to use them." </para>

                                <para>- I have already dealt with that question, and I am sure the people of Braybrook would vote almost unanimously for the removal of the Cordite Factory. It has not enhanced the value of property in the district, but it has destroyed one of the most beautiful parks and boulevards in the metropolis. These are the drawbacks under which communities are labouring, yet the Commonwealth Government are putting their backs to the wall, and refusing to accede to what, after all, is a legitimate demand. If this question goes. to a vote, as I think it will, the Government will find themselves in a minority, whether the division be taken today or at any other time. </para>

                            <para>.- This debate has been responsible for a surprising reversal of argument. From time to time we have heard much noise in this House regarding the erection of big Commonwealth establishments in certain constituencies. A demand has been made that they shall be established in all sorts of places, and now we are told by the honorable member for Maribyrnong that those who have secured the erection of such buildings in their districts never wanted them. I suppose we are to assume that Geelong has no desire that the Woollen Mills shall be erected there, and that we should proceed to establish them in the Federal Territory. Then, again, it is to be regretted that the honorable member for Nepean did not warn us when we proposed to erect the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow that we should be expected to make the roads leading to it. I am surprised that the honorable member for Wentworth should have submitted this motion. Representing as he does part of a city, . the roads in which are well made, he does not, perhaps, base his case on the ground upon which other honorable members have urged that this motion should be agreed to, namely, that the Commonwealth Government cuts up the roads leading to its various establishments, and should pay for their maintenance. The Commonwealth spends vast sums of money in purchasing land and erecting buildings for the convenience of the citizens. </para>

When the Constitution was being framed, the States took care to transfer to us many services that could not be made self-supporting. They were prepared to hand over to the' Commonwealth all that gave no result, and there is now, apparently, a " little game on " to relieve the States of some more of their expenditure. These public buildings are necessary for the convenience of the people, and it is unreasonable for the people concerned to ask us to make the roads leading up to them. It would be just as reasonable to ask the Commonwealth to make the footpaths leading to the post-offices in our towns and cities as it is to urge that we should make the roads leading to other Commonwealth buildings. </para>

                                <para>- I have never heard of any argument in favour of the adoption of such a course, unless we are to socialize all the roads, and to have a complete Socialistic community. Whilst I believe that local government has done a vast amount of good work, I do not think any case can be made out for this demand. The honorable member for Maribyrnong has himself proved the case that I was going to put before the Committee, namely, that in this instance it is proposed to reverse the system under which municipal subsidies are paid by the States. Under that system the city municipalities receive practically 0 nothing, whereas the shires receive a subsidy amounting, in some cases, to £3 on every £1 locally raised. Such a grant is considered necessary to open up new country. The proposal which the honorable member for Maribyrnong is supporting is not based upon that principle. Property in towns and cities is worth far more than are country properties, so that the adoption of this proposal would mean that the biggest proportion of the grant would be paid to the municipalities that least required it. While the honorable member for Corangamite was speaking, the honorable member for Perth interjected that the residents of the cities were paying for the postal accommodation enjoyed by country districts. The honorable member is absolutely wrong. I do not desire to traverse the ground already covered by the honorable member for Corangamite, whose arguments were unanswerable, but I would remind the honorable member for Perth that the cities exist only because of the backing they receive from the country districts. Cities and towns consist of groups of business people, and also, in the case of cities like Melbourne and Sydney, of manufacturers. Where is their market? In the country. Their correspondence is paid for by the country consumers. The farmer pays freight on what he buys and on what he sells. It is he who is charged for the cost of running the railways, and the interest on the money borrowed for their construction. He also pays the rents of the city business firms, and the expenses of their correspondence. It is the man in the country who pays, and the man in the city goes scot-free. I could mention facts which tell against the proposal even more strongly than those adduced by the honorable member for Corangamite. Only yesterday, for instance, the residents of a shire in my district, far removed from the big cities, asked for telephone connexion, and were told that they could have it if they supplied £250 worth of material. This they are going to do, I believe. According to the arguments of those who support the motion, the shire council in which the line is to be constructed should be paid a subsidy for having the poles along its roads. If we agree to this proposal, the Commonwealth will be expected to make good the wear of country roads caused by mail coaches, and there will be no limit to the demands on it. I do not think that the House will be foolish enough to agree to the motion. Municipal councils, like other .bodies, look upon the Government as a sort of milch cow. They consider us good-natured people, from whom they can get money. In my eyes this proposal is an attempt to relieve the States of the duty of assisting the municipal authorities. The honorable member for Maribyrnong spoke about the high valuations. These would mean a very large sum out of the Commonwealth purse for city properties, if we were to make ourselves responsible for rates. At the present time, the State Treasurers are cutting down their expenditure, and if we subsidized the municipalities, the State Governments would decrease their subsidies, so that the municipalities would really be no better off. It must be borne in mind that we have no control over municipal authorities. We are not responsible for their constitutions. Their franchise has a Conservative basis, which no Labour man could support, it being founded on a property qualification. We cannot subsidize bodies over which we have no control. Only two instances have been mentioned in which special damage has been done to roads by the traffic to Commonwealth factories, and it would be foolish to subsidize all municipalities because of those two special cases. To say that £50,000 would be sufficient is absurd. In the big cities there are post-offices every block or two, although in the country postal facilities are not easily obtainable, and there are people in my electorate who pay £15 and £20 a year to get their letters forwarded. In the cities the people will not walk a quarter-of-a-mile to post a letter, and there are so many post-offices, and other Commonwealth buildings, that £50,000 would not cover the rating for one State alone. It must be remembered that in the future several big industries will be nationalized, and the Commonwealth will then own huge factories. It would be a nice thing to have to pay rates on that property, which might be worth millions of pounds. I should not oppose, on the ground of cost, a proposal which I considered just, but this is not a just proposal. We are here to protect the public purse, and, in view of the charge of extravagance which has been made against the.s Government, I am surprised that some </para>

                        <para>Of course, one cannot be surprised at anything that the Opposition may do. If they can increase the troubles of the Government, they will gain a party advantage. I -am aware that the Municipal Association lias circularized honorable members with a view to getting a subsidy. For this it is not to blame, but it is none the less our duty to study the public interest. I agree with the honorable member for Corangamite that public bodies should not tax each other, seeing that they all work for the common good. The municipalities have done good work in Australia, though they have yet to take up questions which are handled by the municipal authorities in the Old World ; but their ratepayers would not benefit if this proposal were carried into effect, because, even if there were a reduction in rates, there would have to be an increase in taxes, and if the Commonwealth gave a subsidy, the State Governments would reduce their subsidies. No case has been made out for the motion. </para>

                                <para>- My words of wisdom must be heard- in this chamber whenever I have the opportunity, and my opportunities are so few. The honorable member for Nepean said the question of the cost of the proposal was an absolute bogy, as the cost was hardly worth discussing. If a matter of ,£50,000 or ,£60,000 is a bogy so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, how insignificant must be the share which any particular municipality would get ! The honorable member for Maribyrnong, when correcting the errors of those who failed to agree with him,1 said the principle of endowing municipalities had been adopted in Victoria, and that they were graded into classes. That statement neither pointed a moral nor adorned a tale. In the first place, the State Government endows the shires in proportion to their poverty. The proposal before us is to allocate a grant of national money to the shires, boroughs, and municipalities that are the richest, because it is within their boundaries that the greatest proportion of Commonwealth buildings is established. There is an agitation in my constituency to secure a rifle range at Preston. The local council knows that the land on which die rifle range is established will be changed from private to Commonwealth property, and that, consequently, they will lose a certain amount of rates which they now collect on it, but they will consider that the loss is more than counterbalanced by the advantages that will be derived through people being brought to the district. The honorable member for Nepean, having secured the establishment of the Small Arms Factory in his constituency, having used all the means at his disposal to secure the largest expenditure of Commonwealth money in his district. and having brought into the district a large number of people, who will probably vote for him at the next election, now tells us that these things are of no value to him, and asks us to believe that he would rather have those men in somebody else's constituency. </para>

                    <para>.- I listened to the Budget-speech of the Prime Minister with very great disappointment - a feeling created by the fact that I expected the honorable gentleman to take this opportunity, in the last session of this Parliament, to take the House and the country into his confidence by a clear and definite exposition of the financial policy of the Government. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I think that was due to members on both sides of the House, even to those who are supporting the Government. The occasion was so important, and the interests so great, that the fullest and clearest exposition was expected from, and should have been afforded by, the Treasurer. </para>
                <para>Instead of a Budget-speech, we had simply a long statement. It lacked every quality which a Budget-speech ought to have. There was hardly a reference to the previous year ; no attempt to bring before the minds of honorable members what the course of finance had been during that year, by calling our attention to the amounts which the Treasurer had estimated to receive at the beginning of the year, the amounts he had received ; the amounts which he had anticipated to expend during the year, and the amounts he had expended, to explain the sources of the excess of revenue and expenditure. These facts could have been given, with some clear exposition, which need not have been lengthy, to put honorable members <inline font-style="italic">en rapfort</inline> with the position and bring it up to date. Certainly, from the somewhat awkward way in which the Budget statement was introduced, it was very difficult for any honorable member to quite follow the Treasurer. A feeling of disappointment in that regard was exhibited on his own side of the House. I think, through hurry, or for some other reason which I cannot explain the Treasurer had not prepared himself, and we were, therefore, all left to find out for ourselves, as we best could, the real meaning of his statements. If he had told us what he might have told us, we should have learnt from him that last year he. expected to receive £19,515,000, and actually received £20,546,361, or a surplus over his estimate of £1,031,361. The expenditure he estimated at £19,515,000, and he actually expended £20,121,995. That is to say, he received £1,031,361 more than he expected, and spent £606,995 more than he anticipated, with the net result that he had a balance on the year's operations of £424,366, which he appropriated under a method that has lately been adopted of putting moneys into Trust Funds. That sum was placed to the credit of Trust Funds in the proportion of £278,242 to the Fleet Fund, and £146,124 to the Pensions Fund. </para>
                <para>That was the position when we started the year, and it revealed to us that we had had a second prosperous year since the present Government came into office, and that, although the balance was not so large as in the previous year, it was still substantial, and had gone to the credit of Trust Funds, to be dealt with as I shall show later on. </para>
                <para>Having initiated the business and shown us where we were, we had a right to expect the Prime Minister to explain, on behalf of the Government, what his financial proposals were for dealing with the great engagements which the Commonwealth has undertaken; but we did not get one word of explanation. </para>
                <para>Honorable members will recollect that on the Address-in-Reply I raised the question of the large commitments of the Commonwealth, and asked how the Government proposed to meet the obligations which would accrue therefrom. My remarks were received with a good deal of interjection and objection, as if I were objecting to the expenditure; but I clearly showed on that occasion that then, at any rate, I was not objecting to the expenditure, but was asking the Government to tell Parliament and' the country how they intended to find the money. I was followed by the Postmaster-General, who, having acted for six months when the Treasurer was away, might have been supposed to know something of the subjects to which I had alluded, and, being the Minister to follow, might naturally have been expected to give some information. Instead of that, he asked a series of questions: " What would the honorable member do? Does he object to old-age pensions? Does he object to defence ? Does he object to this, that, and ,the other?" As a matter of fact 'it was the merest "gag," and had no reference to the subject. It was simply a means of putting me off with the appearance of giving an answer, while giving no answer at all. </para>
                <para>The Postmaster-General, when I repeatedly asked where the money was to come from, said that the Prime Minister would tell the House, and, later, that the Prime Minister would give the information in his Budget. I am here to-night to say that not on one single point I then raised, and on which I was promised an answer in the Budget, have I received any information. I do not think that is treating serious business in the way it should be treated. This is not, or should not, be a matter of party j it is one that concerns honorable members in all parts of the House, and for the consequences of our action at this stage we shall rightly be held responsible. To-night it is my intention, so far as I am permitted to discharge my obligation, to place before the Committee and the Government the position of our financial affairs as it appears to me, with the object that, whatever the consequences may be by-and-by, we shall know to what the state of things, which may exist, is owing. </para>

                        <para>-  I am not going to answer interjections ; and the honorable member for Hindmarsh and others will excuse me if I ask them to allow me, without any interruption, to present what is a complex and heavy argument. I say now, as I said before, that the Government have lost or put aside the most magnificent opportunity that any Government could have to put the finances of the Commonwealth in a position which would do credit to themselves and to this Parliament. However, it is not my desire to dwell on that aspect; I have expressed my view, and I can only regret that the opportunity has not been availed of. The Government which had this opportunity, with a majority to carry its proposals, and which could, therefore, have afforded to take the Opposition into their confidence in order to get this important question settled on non-party lines, have failed to do so. </para>

                <para>Having entered into office, on, I think, the last day of April, 1910, this Government came into a heritage of great prosperity. We are accustomed to hear honorable members opposite tell us with great pride that it is only since the advent of the Labour Government that prosperity has exhibited itself. There never was a greater misrepresentation, as I shall show ; and the first witness I shall call in support of my view is the Prime Minister himself, who, on the 7th September, 19 10, in his first Budget statement, said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The receipts from Customs and Excise amounted to £n,593..o50, showing an excess of £748,983 over those of the previous year, and of £793,050 over the amount estimated. The collection of this large amount was undoubtedly  due  to general prosperity throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That was two or three months after he entered office, and, as I say, in his first Budget-speech. I shall show that prosperity had begun, and was increasing, when the Government came into office, and I shall' further show that it has increased since. </para>
                <para>The question we have to consider now is how much longer it is probable that prosperity will increase, ' or whether it is not more likely to decline than to remain at the high point recently attained. I remind honorable members that this prosperity continued, as we know, right through 1910-11 ; and when the Prime Minister delivered his Budget on the 1st August last,, he said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The financial, industrial, and commercial development of the Commonwealth since Federation must have been watched with considerable interest by honorable members. The progress that has been made is astounding even to those who are most intimately acquainted with the subject, and it raises the question whether any of the public men of Australia have been overconfident in their anticipations regarding the advancement of the Commonwealth in these respects. We are sometimes inclined to be pessimistic, and in bad times we hear a great deal of the misfortunes of the country, but * think that all the evidence now before us indi&gt;cates a continuance of progress and prosperity equal to that which we have hitherto experience* in Australia. In speaking thus, I have in mind not the prosperity of this year or last year, but the average. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I shall show honorable members, a little later on, that the Prime Minister has altogether failed to carry out what he then indicated - that he has not taken the prosperity on the average, but on the particular, and that the particular is the highest point of prosperity which we have reached. The honorable member for Hindmarsh interjected just now that I desired a Budget; not for one year, but for ten years; and I suppose he meant that I wished to make a Budget-speech for that period ahead. I am not going to do that, but I am going to give a Budget-speech for six years back. I am going to cite some very important figures which I have taken the trouble to  cast together, so as to focus as nearly as may be the  actual position during two periods - one the period of three years (1907-10) anterior to the entrance into office of the present Government, and the three years (19 10-13), including the Estimates now before us, since they entered into office. I should have liked the Prime Minister to be present when I am discussing this matter. Although I am only a private member, I have given the subject consideration, and I think the right honorable gentleman ought to be here. It is only courteous and right that when the Treasurer's Department, which is the main Department of all, is being criticised, the Prime Minister should be present. I do not consider that any plea of public duty elsewhere should be held to be an adequate answer. The Prime Minister's place is here, especially when the Budget is being discussed, and I do not think it is fair that honorable members should be treated in this way. </para>

The average excess for the latter period was £4,652,949, of which amount the land tax provided £1,345,599, leaving as the increased revenue from other sources, £3,307,350 per annum. </para>
                <para>The average expenditure corresponded in amount with the revenue as set out above, viz., £15,121,491 for 1907-10, and £19,774,440 for 1910-13, showing the increase in the average expenditure to be £4,652,949. The character of the expenditure, however, differed materially in the two periods, as the result of the termination of the Braddon section in 1910, and the operation of the new arrangement made with the States. </para>
                <para>For the years 1907-10 the average payments to the States were £8,427,476; and for the years 1910-13, £5,699,868, a reduction for the latter period of £2,727,608 per annum, and amounting for the three years to £8,182,824. </para>

He came into office at a time when, as he said himself, the tide of prosperity was rising. The tide has risen, and I am afraid that the right honorable gentleman has to some extent lost his sense of financial perspective. </para>
                <para class="block">He may think that he and his party alone have been responsible for the largely increased revenue of the Commonwealth, but I have shown clearly that there is only a sum of £1,345,000 a year in respect of which they can make any such claim. I have shown, also, that they have had no more to do with the increase in the ordinary revenue than they have to do with the setting of the sun to-night, or its rising tomorrow. I have shown that it has come into the Treasury because of the prosperity of the country which the Prime Minister in his opening speech in 1910 declared had begun. Nearly ten millions of money is traceable to that source; and I do not think the Labour party will have the effrontery, in the face of these facts, to say that they have had anything to do with its production. If they do, these figures will confute them. I have taken a little trouble to set them clearly before the Committee, so that the public may understand the position. As to the remainder of this additional revenue, £2,727,000 a year came into the hands of the Government upon the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section. Perhaps they will claim that they have also been responsible for that increase. </para>

                        <para>- I simply say that a mere interjection that the States agreed to the new arrangement has nothing whatever to do with my argument. I am not discussing that question ; I am dealing with the question of where the money came from. I am not saying whether it came rightly or wrongly into the Commonwealth Treasury ; I am simply giving the facts, and they are such as to show clearly that the claims made, in season and out of season, by the Labour party that they have done this and that, and that there is money for every one, has no real foundation. </para>

                <para class="block">These figures will show that the wave of prosperity had begun to rise long before the present Government came into office, and that it has been rising ever since. In only one year since 1904-5 has the revenue gone back upon that of the previous year. I refer to the year 1908-9, when the revenue was £801,285 below that of the previous year. The Customs receipts, however, had been abnormally large the previous year - 1907-8, owing, it was said, to the alteration of the Tariff which then took place. It is to be noted that for the three years 1904-7 the receipts averaged about £2 4s. 8d. per head of the population; and for the period covered by the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the Fisher Government the (average is about £3 is. 8d., an increase in the latter period of 17s. per head. Were the rate to fall back, from bad seasons or other causes, to what it was only six or seven years ago, the receipts from Customs and Excise revenue would decline by ;£3.995,i7o, at 17s. per head of the estimated population as at 31st December, 1912, upon which this year's finance calculations are based, viz. : - 4,700,200. If, however, the fall were from the figures of the last financial year, which closed on 30th June - £3 4s. 5$d. - to those of 1904-5 - £2 3s. 5|d. - the difference at £1 is. per head would amount to -£4,935,210. In the light of experience, and the above-quoted figures, a decline in Customs and Excise revenues of from £4,000,000 to £5,000,000 is quite within the range of possibility - a consideration which a prudent financier would take into account when tempted to incur extensive new obligations. </para>
                <para>All experience teaches that although prosperity may continue to increase 5rear after year, there must come a time of reaction, when a decline will begin, the extent of which will depend on its causes ; it may be sudden, as I have seen in Victoria, or gradual. I am not a prophet, nor do I expect the Treasurer to be one. Possibly our present prosperity may continue during this and next year, but history teaches the lesson that when you have reached what appears to be the summit of prosperity you are within measurable range of a period of adversity. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, lt is all a matter of relation. I am not a pessimist, I believe that the future prospects of this country are incomparably more brilliant than that of any other in the world if we are wisely governed. If, however, our financial operations are not sound, the progress of the country will be retarded, and much misfortune and hardship will be entailed on our1 citizens before things can be put right. My complaint is that the Treasurer has not placed the facts before the country. When I have done so - and my statements cannot be gainsaid, because every figure I shall use will be taken from official returns published by the Treasurer - honorable members will be able to say whether, in spending our money as we are spending it, we have acted wisely, and whether in committing ourselves in every direction, when at the apex of our prosperity, and disbursing every shilling we have, we are not leaving many liabilities unprovided for. </para>

                <para>I wish now to say a few words on a subject of much importance - the relation of our imports and exports of merchandise. </para>
                <para class="block">Upon our imports of merchandise depends our Customs revenue. If they decline it must decrease, and the value of the imports apparently depends on the exports. Exports may fall by reason of drought, mismanagement, or want of confidence crippling or destroying enterprise - quite a possible contingency - and with the decline of exports will come the decline of imports and the diminution of the Customs revenue. In this connexion, I call attention to the following interesting table which appears in Knibbs' <inline font-style="italic">Monthly Summary of Statistics for May,</inline> which records the imports and exports of merchandise and specie since the inauguration of Federation, 1901, to the end of 1911. </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="065331191208220_35_5.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para class="block">The total imports of merchandise for the eleven years was ,£504,674,458, and the total exports of merchandise £534,579, I2°&gt; the exports exceeding the imports by £29, 904,702, or on the' average by ^£2,718,610 annually. The value of the gold exported covers any deficiency between exports of merchandise and imports of merchandise and meets expenditure beyond seas not provided for by the shipments of merchandise. During the first four years after Federation, which were bad years, our exports of merchandise were comparatively small, and our exports of gold correspondingly large, -namely, £15,000,000, ,£15,000,000 and £19,000,000 and £17,000,000; but dur"ing the prosperous years that followed the  export of gold declined, so that in 1909 we sent away only ,£8,000,000, and, in 1910,  only £4,600,000. Last year there was a rise to £12,000,000, and this year there may be a further rise. Whether that rise is due to a shortage in exports of merchandise, or is to be accounted for bv the fact that money is being taken out of the country, remains to be seen. If the relation between the imports and exports of merchandise re- mains comparatively unchanged, and the export of gold increases, the inference will be that money has been taken out of the country. That has not happened yet. There are some who think that banking and finance is a sort of game, forgetting that there are great economic laws with which we cannot interfere, and which produce an automatic adjustment. We can only watch the results, and shall be wise if we are guided by them in forecasting the future. </para>
                <para>I and other honorable members went through the crisis from 1888 to 1893. When I have alluded to that experience previously, honorable members opposite have said that it was solely the result of borrowing too much money. So it was to a large extent, the over-borrowing creating speculation and inflation, but I would remind honorable members who take that view that you can bring about the same result by different means. According to my diagnosis of the present position, comparing it with previous experience, I see many of the symptoms existing that ended in those days in a great catastrophe. The wise medical man is he who detects the symptoms as they arise in their early stages, sees what may be coming, and even if it does not come, takes precautionary measures, and thereby averts the catastrophe. That is all I am pleading for to-night. All I ask is that we should -look the facts in the face, and "deal with them as reasonable men, and not as party politicians. If we do not. deal with this great financial question as it deserves to be dealt with, we shall not be doing our duty. In those days we had all sorts of extravagance. Honorable members talk about the rise in the cost of living, but we have seen all that before. The rise in the cost of living is a case of cause and effect. It leads to increased expenditure by the multitude, everybody spends too much, imports increase, and so does the revenue, and then comes the end. I think we ought to keep those facts in view. </para>

                        <para>- I commend to the honorable member the task of finding an explanation. It will be noticed that the increase in the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department between 1909-10 and 1912-13 is£1,159,157,or an increase of 36 per cent., while the increase in the expenditure in all the other Departments for the same period is £462,701, or 35 per cent. Thus not only is the expenditure on the Post and Telegraph Department up by fully one-third in two years, but the cost of the other Departments is also up by about the same percentage. The aggregate increase of those Departments has been £1,621,858 since 30th June, 19 10. With these figures in front of us, shall I' be asked, as I have been asked before, what item I would reduce, and what I object to in this big expenditure? My position here is to call attention to these things, and ask the Government to explain to the Committee and to the country how the increased expenditure comes about. We have not had one word of explanation. We have had read to us by the Treasurer a series of amounts, nearly always rises, so monotonous that it reminded me of the reading of the conditions of sale at an auction. It is for the Government to justify these enormous increases in public expenditure. It is not my place as a member sitting in Opposition to suggest this, that, or the other. The Government are in a position of power, they have made these increases, and should justify them.I am discussing the question simply as a representative of the people. </para>

                        <para>- It is 35 per cent., in addition to the cost two years ago. I have given the loss on the working; and I shall also show that on new works and buildings there was an expenditure in the first period of £1,524,372, and in the second period °f ^3)378,196; that is to say, more than double has been expended on works, which no doubt were necessary. An honorable member interjected that these works had not been provided for before ; but I have shown that there was then no money in the Treasury, while the present Government have had the money and have spent it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not objecting; I am merely pointing out what has been spent, and showing that, with this increased expenditure, much of which was on plant, there should not be an abnormal increase in the working expenses. If plant is introduced to carry on the business, surely that ought to aid in- keeping down expenses. The Department expended for new works and buildings, between 1901-2 and 1907-10, the sum of £2,439,170; and in 1910-13, the sum of £3.378,196, or a total of £5.817,366. The surplus of receipts over expenditure from 1901-2 to 1907-10 was £1,836,000, which is reduced by the deficit of £437,265, on the period 1910-13, to £1,447,259 for the whole period since the inauguration of Federation. That is to say, the margin of profit over working expenses, if this year's estimate is realized, will, at the end of 19 13, be £450,000 less than the surplus when the honorable member for Ballarat went out of office. </para>

                        <para>- Ask me something easy ; I am giving results for which I* am not responsible, though I am addressing those who are responsible.

                <para>It seems to me that in this* country, under the present <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> we have departed from every sound principle of financial policy. Hitherto, when a tax has been imposed, it has been for a purpose, and a surplus has been applied, at any rate in England, to reduce debt. Here, however, a surplus in prosperous years is put into a Trust Fund to be spent the next year, but there is never any attempt made, so far as I can see, by the Treasurer to stem the tide of expenditure. I have always understood that a Finance Minister's duty is to sit tight on the public money-chest. I have always thought it is a bad arrangement for a Premier or Prime Minister, unless a very exceptional man, to be also Treasurer. On him is focussed all the pressure of his colleagues and supporters outside for the spending of money ; and, therefore, I think it is always a good plan to have, as Treasurer, and not Prime Minister, a good., solid, sound man sitting, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Mcllwraith once said, firm and tight on the money-chest, so that the money may not go out too freely. As to any attempt at that sort of thing, it seems never even to enter the" minds of honorable members opposite. In the interests of the public, it is absolutely necessary, and the whole idea of finance is, that it should be administered by some one who understands the business, and who is capable of saying to his colleagues, " Well, gentlemen, I am not going to give you this amount ; I have not got it, and if you must have it you will have to face new taxation, or some other means of finding the money." The present Government do not seem to object to new taxation very much at present; but that is not sound finance ; it is not doing the best for the country, and it is not what I conceive to be the duty of a Treasurer of a Dominion or Commonwealth like this. The other night I noticed a most amusing interjection by the Prime Minister. When the honorable member for Ballarat was quoting a gentleman in Sydney, who had said that the taxation of the people of this country is £5 per head, the Prime Minister said, evidently with indignation, " He does not know what he is talking about." it happened that, when I read this in the newspaper report, I was looking into that very question ; and I find that it was the Prime Minister who did not know what he was talking about. The Commonwealth taxation, including Customs and Excise, the land tax, and other small taxes, is stated in the Budget-papers to be  £3  ns. 8d. per he,ad. Some honorable member said that the State taxation cannot be ascertained, because it is mixed up with public works, but this only shows that he also did not know what he was talking about, because it is set forth in Knibbs' <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> very clearly that the simple taxation of the people of the State, without taking into account public works for water supply or other conveniences, amounts to 19s. per head, while the municipal rates, also without water, sewerage, and other conveniences, amount to 15s. 9d. per head, or a total of £5 6s. 5d. per head in the year 191 1. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member opposed me on one occasion, and .was handsomely beaten. I should be glad if the honorable member, instead of interjecting in an unmannerly way, would confine his attention to the business of the Committee. The obligations that we are incurring have never been put before the House by the Treasurer. I have shown where the money has gone, and I now propose to show that there are yet great obligations to meet. During the debate on the Address-in-Reply I referred to a number of items in respect of which I urged that we should have some information from the Government. I desired to obtain from them some explanation as to how the money necessary for these undertakings was to be provided. I am. now going to call attention to the fact that if the Government intend to carry out Admiral Henderson's scheme, following strictly the lines of his report, they should have provided for the purpose  £3,000,000  last year, and another  £3,000,000  in respect of the current financial year. Unquestionably, they have in hand a sum of  £3,600,000  which' has been provided for in previous years, but if they are going to carry out Admiral Henderson's scheme in accordance with his recommendation they should have provided this year an additional sum of £2,400,000. This is a matter for explanation.  1  have Admiral Henderson's report before me, and it is perfectly clear. He submitted a scheme of expenditure extending over a period of twenty years, and set out a table providing for a uniform rate of contribution amounting to  £3,000,000  per annum for the first seven years, £4,500,000 per annum for the succeeding five years, and £5,000,000 per annum for the remaining five years. If his recommendations are to be followed by the Government £6,000,000 should have been set aside in respect of the years 1911-12 and 19 12- 13, whereas only £3,600,000 has been provided. This is a staggerer. The Government have yet to find £2,400,000 in respect of this two years' period if they intend to carry out Admiral Henderson's scheme. Surely there should be some explanation of this omission. It appears to me, however, that explanations, concerning any matter, are no longer furnished in this House. We have not yet been informed of the views of the Government in regard to Admiral Henderson's report, nor have we been given an opportunity to discuss it. We are rushed into expenditure with no other information than that we are to vote for the Fleet Unit a sum of, say, £1,000,000, or whatever it may be. We are not in a position to prevent the passing of such an item, and, as a matter of fact, we have no desire to do so, for we are all agreed as to the defence expenditure. I would remind the Committee that the Government have also to provide for the erection of lighthouses. We have taken over the Department of Beacons, Buoys, and Lighthouses, and have been presented with a series of reports, the carrying out of which will involve a capital expenditure of nearly £300,000, and an annual increased expenditure of £20,000. This year only a small sum appears on the Estimates in respect of lighthouses. We are not told to what extent we are to commit ourselves in this regard, nor have we any means of , ascertaining how the' necessary money is to be provided. Honorable members opposite do not appear to like this criticism of the Budget. It is, however, a proper criticism - a criticism of the kind to which I was accustomed when I was a youngster in politics. In those days we did not pass Estimates without criticism. Honorable members opposite do not seem to understand that attitude. </para>

                        <para>- No, I have been confining my remarks to two periods of three years, and the honorable member does not seem to like my criticism. The next item to which I would draw attention is that in connexion with the Northern Territory, in respect of which we are asked to vote for 191 2-13 a sum of £378,795, although the estimated deficiency, as shown at page 77 of the Budget-papers, is £478,857. It is possible there may be another item of£100,000, which, owing to the confused manner in which these accounts are submitted to us. I have not been able to trace. Then again we have had a voluminous report as to the Quarantine Department, which indicates a large expenditure under that heading. In the Estimates provision is made for a small expenditure on quarantine which the Treasurer has said is intended to meet the most urgent requirements. We have not been informed, however, what this commitment may mean. We are told that a huge expenditure will be necessary. </para>

                        <para>- A sum of about £187,000 is required at once, but we do not know what the ultimate commitment will be. Dealing further with our obligations. I set down a sum of . £5,000,000 in respect of the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie railway. I have previously given that estimate of the expenditure on the railway and no one has corrected me. If I am mistaken, I shall be glad to be corrected. Owing to the failure of the Treasurer to give necessary information, we are really forced to ask questions. In an obscure passage in the Prime Minister's speech, we have the statement that £1, 000, 000 will be required this year for the purposes of the railway, but there is no' indication as to whether it is to be taken out of revenue or provided by loan. </para>

The Treasurer should inform the Committee where he proposes to get the money to meet all these obligations.

                        <para>.- The Committee must be under a great obligation to the honorable member for Mernda for his able, comprehensive, and moderate survey of the financial position.  His  speech certainly bore evidence of great care, thought, and preparation. In matters of finance, which involve a considerable amount of special knowledge, I think that the honorable member is entitled to a little consideration, and I regret that he was not allowed to complete his speech. The refusal to allow him to continue beyond the time allotted by the Standing Orders has taken us by surprise, and I feel somewhat at a disadvantage in continuing the debate after his unfinished but masterly speech. I cannot hope to make an analysis of the financial features of the Budget in the same critical and searching manner; but that, perhaps, is hardly necessary, in view of the ground already covered. I think it might be convenient to premise a few remarks of a practical character on the Budget by some general observations regarding the conditions under which the financial statement has been presented. This is the third, and, for this Parliament, the last of a series of three financial statements submitted by the present Treasurer during a period of unparalleled prosperity in the history of the Commonwealth. I cannot but congratulate him and his colleagues on the. good fortune they have enjoyed in being in office and in power with a big majority behind them during such a glorious period of prosperity'. Although this has been, apparently, a brilliant financial period, judging from some stand-points of history, there are other features hardly consistent with a period of prosperity, and the promises and policy of the Prime Minister and his colleagues. I should like, in a few sentences, to contrast some of the phases of this period of Labour rule. On the one hand there have been increased imports of merchandise, a larger revenue, higher salaries, more work in the Public Service, larger expenditure, an expansion of Government functions and of opportunities for political patronage; on the other there have been unsatisfactory features requiring consideration and explanation. There has been a remarkable reduction in our exports and in the production of gold, the cost of living has increased, money has become dearer, the power of the banks to give accommodation has been diminished, and the industrial unrest has been remarkable. We were promised that under Labour rule wages would rise and employment increase, but there have been more strikes since this Government took office than in any other similar period of our history. During the last three years no fewer than  220  strikes were recorded in the various States. I gave particulars concerning them on a former occasion, and shall not repeat what I said then. This industrial unrest is in striking contrast to the prosperity which the country has enjoyed. A most extraordinary position was revealed by the deputation which a few weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Victoria introduced to the Premier of the State. It complained that there are some  2,000  Victorian artisans now out of work, most of them agricultural implement makers, iron and metal workers, clothing and textile workers, and machinists. An account of the deputation appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the11th July, not long before the delivery of this extraordinary Budget, which discovered a larger revenue and expenditure than we had ever before known in Australia. Evidently the picture, presented with such self-glorification by the Prime Minister, has its reverse side. There is something needing explanation. We were not told why, in the midst of so much activity and prosperity, there should be such dissatisfaction in the ranks of the working classes. We must be thankful for the prosperity we have enjoyed, and glad that the country has so greatly progressed, and must hope that the evils to which I have referred will in time disappear. Apparently we are now on the crest of the wave of prosperity, and two lines in the Budget show that the Treasurer expects the revenue from Customs and Excise to decline, a sign - not greater than a man's hand in the sky, perhaps - that unfavorable developments are approaching. I am afraid that there may be some justification for the apprehension of the honorable member for Mernda that less prosperous times may shortly be upon us. One of the characteristics of the period ot Labour rule has been the increased cost of living, and the higher price of money. Notwithstanding the inflation of revenue and expenditure, money is not so abundant as it was ; it is not so cheap to those who require financial accommodation. Plainly, the Labour party has not fulfilled 'its promise to give us cheaper money and to reduce the cost of living. We were told that, when the Commonwealth Bank had been established and the Australian notes issued, money would be plentiful and cheap ; but one of the immediate results of the note issue has been to raise the rate of discount and to increase the price of money. Careful consideration of the facts shows that the note issue has not realized the hopes held forth on its account. About 4,000,000 sovereigns are locked up in the vaults of the Treasury as a reserve against the note issue. That gold is idle. It has been withdrawn from circulation, and- no longer earns interest; and its withdrawal has reduced the credit of the Commonwealth. A gold reserve is essential to the note system; but the result of the withdrawal of gold from circulation is a reduction of credit. Under the old system, the banks could have lent out the money to the borrowing public; now the necessity is imposed on them of keeping a certain number of Commonwealth notes in their coffers, to be used as till-money. For these notes the banks have paid sovereigns, and have thus diminished their lending power. The statement in the speech delivered some time ago by the honorable member for Mernda, and the evidence of all financial experts, is that the effect of the note issue has been to diminish the financial power of the tanks, to force them to compel their customers to reduce their overdrafts. To that extent it has interfered with the industrial expansion of the Commonwealth, and the business operations of many people in it. I do not say it is the sole factor, but it is undoubtedly one of the factors which account for the financial depression of the. times, and which have to be remembered when credit is claimed for the note issue. The Prime Minister claimed that he had realized about £184,000 net interest on the balance which had been lent to the States and other institutions from the note issue fund. After allowing a certain amount for the expenses of the issue, he said the net profit would be only about £143,000. </para>

                            <para>- It has been already pointed out that, so far as the profits of the note issue are concerned, the Commonwealth Parliament and Government could have had just as much profit by authorizing the banks by legislation to continue issuing notes under Federal sanction and licence, subject to the imposition of a Federal bank note tax. Originally under the State there was a bank note tax of 2 per cent., which realized nearly £100,000 a year. The Federal Government could have imposed a 3 per cent, tax if it had thought fit, and that, coupled with the saving in the cost of issue amounting to £30,000 or £40,000, would have been * just as profitable a proposition as the issue of_notes by the Commonwealth. We should have been financially just as well off, and there would have been the advantage of not inflicting a blow upon the financial institutions of the country, and thereby helping to contribute towards the present financial depression. With the increase of the Australian note issue and the suggested creation of a 10s. bank note, the Treasurer will call into being a very formidable competitor with the Federal money order and postal note business. The charges in connexion with the issue of money orders and postal notes in Australia have been a large and growing source of revenue. In 1906-7 the Postal Department received £92,240 from fees on money orders and postal notes; in 1907-8, £94,624; in 1^08-9, £100,033 &gt; in i9°9-IO&gt; £io4.457 ; and in 1910-.11, £112,568. We have therefore a fine and growing source of revenue in that financial branch of the Postal Department, but it will now find what will probably be a destructive competitor in the Australian note issue. It will therefore be found on ultimate analysis, in my opinion, that the claim put forward on behalf of the Australian note issue, glorified so much by the Ministerial party, is not, after all, so real and substantial as it seems. The advantages will be discovered to be more showy and glittering in form than solid and useful in substance and realization. There is one uncomfortable fact in the present outlook of Australian trade, commerce, and industry which cannot be ignored in any Budget statement or any consideration of our finances. That is the unfortunate gradual reduction in the winning of gold in Australia, and the undoubted increase in the export of gold. There has been a downward tendency in the gold mining industry since  1903,  when it obtained its maximum in the shape of a yield of nearly  £16,000,000  sterling. Ever since then the production of gold has been substantially on the down grade, and this may be one of the factors in the financial pressure which is beginning to manifest itself, aggravated by the fact that our imports have been increasing disproportionately with our local manufactures and productions, resulting in the abnormal export of gold in order to make up the balance of trade. The production of gold in Australia has been gradually decreasing, as the following figures show :  -  1907,£13,515,109; 1908, £13,058,853; 1909,£12,604,509;£12,604,509,£11,553,840; 191 1, £10,551,624.  That, unfortunately, shows a downward tendency in gold production which must materially affect the productive industries and the financial power of the Australian Commonwealth. There has been, during the last three years, a very large increase in the export of gold. In  1907,  gold to the value of  £10,543,304  was exported, and in  1908  the value was £13,566,738. In that year  £507,885  worth of gold was exported in excess of the. actual production. In  1911 £11,540,782  worth of gold was exported, or  £989,158  worth in excess of the local gold production. These are startling features, which must receive attention at the hands of our financial advisers. </para>

                            <para>- This year there has been an even more remarkable increase in the export of gold. From January to June,1911, the export of gold from Australia was  £3,764,483,  while from January to June,  1912,  it has been  £6,677,080.  These facts are certainly cause for anxiety. </para>

                            <para>- It is only used as an export when we are short of our ordinary merchandise or produce. That is the rule, excepting, of course, exports for special banking purposes, and it is certainly one of the most unfortunate signs of the times that during this period of unexampled prosperity such large exports of gold should be taking, place. The value of our imports in  191 1  was nearly  £67,000,000,  and to make up for the deficiency in our exports we had to export gold to the amount I have mentioned. 1 have had considerable trouble to get these figures. I had personally to go to the Statist's Office to-day to obtain them. It is a great pity that up-to-date figures of this kind, relating to imports and exports, are not included in the Budget. </para>

                            <para>- I find, even in the Customs Department, a great difficulty in classifying their materials up to date. The imports for the first six months of this year amounted in value to  . £37, 689, 580,  and the value of the exports was  £34,831,541,  showing that our export trade this year has fallen off alarmingly, and that we shall have to export gold to make up the balance. I have shown the gradual growth of imports and the reduction of exports, in order to lead up to a few remarks on the Tariff question, and for that purpose I asked the Statist to give me the very latest figures available upon a group of items in the Tariff which come within the operation of some of the highest protective duties, and which may, therefore, be fairly regarded as typical of protected industries. I asked him to give me a return showing the value of the imports during  1910-11  and  1911-12  of such groups as apparel and attire, agricultural implements and machinery, other machinery, boots and shoes, hats and caps, and manufactures of metals. I think the return will be found very instructive, as showing the tendency to importation in classes of items which it is quite evident, upon an examination of the Tariff, come within the description of protected industries. The following table contains the information that has been furnished to me - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">On the face of this return the result does appear to be somewhat startling; and a searching examination is necessary to understand its real significance. I find, on inquiry from the Statist, that the item of apparel and attire includes all descriptions of softgoods and piece-goods, some of which are actually free. I have not the particulars of this year's imports, but I have those of last year in regard to apparel and attire; and apparently they will afford an index of the headings under which there has been an increase. From this return it seems that there has been a slight reduction in the imports of agricultural implements and machinery, a slight increase in the imports of hats and caps, and an increase in the imports of apparel and attire, other machinery, boots and shoes, and manufactures of metal. On coming to an analysis of the first item I find from a return for  1910-11,  with which the Minister of Trade and Customs has favoured me, that apparently the imports of " apparel of fur n.e.i-, including articles cut into shape therefor," indicate the line along which there has been an increase. In  1 910  the value of imports under this heading was  £1,337,710,  and in  1911  the value was  £1,528,941  ; and this suggests that there must have been a substantial increase in the importation of articles cut into shape. In  1911  there was a great increase in the importation of minor articles, also corsets, gloves, trimmings and ornaments, cotton, linen, and other piece-goods, " silk goods or containing silk," and one large item was "woollens or containing wool." I have troubled the Committee with these details in order to arrive at a fair idea of the meaning of the figures. We must go into details; we cannot draw a broad generalization. I think the result of the analysis I have roughly made indicates that in certain lines, at any rate, on which there are high protective duties, there has been a large increase in importation. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that there would be sufficient work to keep a Tariff Board exclusively watching the Tariff; and the functions of the Board might very well be conferred on a great body such as the Inter- State Commission, who could watch the Tariff and report to Parliament any odd, abnormal changes in the increase of imports or the reduction of exports, and suggest any revision or adjustment necessary in the interests of trade and commerce or of Australian manufactures. I have had experience of the difficulties of such inquiries, and I know the necessity' for caution, prudence, and calm survey before submitting any Tariff proposals to Parliament. The last amended Tariff, submitted five or six years ago, had the advantage, at any rate, of being preceded by a searching investigation of the trade and commerce and the industrial relations of Australia. During the course of these investigations, in which the honorable member for Capricornia, other honorable members, and myself had the honour to participate, we heard evidence from all parts of the Commonwealth. We received about  700  complaints, and examined over  600  witnesses on both sides, with the result that we were able to present proposals that were, at any rate, backed up by evidence. </para>

                            <para>- A Tariff may be subject to conflicting changes, interests, and modifications in every trade. In the United States it has been found that the Tariff require?, constant supervision and periodical reports, so that Congress may have the advantage of full information in making any revision whenever necessary. I know that such assistance would be invaluable to a Minister of Customs. It is a very onerous task to submit Tariff alterations to Parliament merely on request by deputations from one side or the other ; and any Tariff revision, even on a limited scale, might well be preceded by inquiry, so that a Minister might come to Parliament knowing that he had sufficient material and a strong case. Under such circumstances, a Minister would have very little difficulty in rectifying anomalies, or bringing about substantial improvements or modifications. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, we ought to have men sympathetic with the recognised policy of the country. We should not put enemies to the recognised policy on such a Board, because they would not be in the position to' do the duty assigned to them with the justice that Parliament might expect. As a result of a prolonged study of the question, I am convinced that it is only fair, in a country like this, in dealing with such complex questions, to have a standing tribunal, to which Parliament could look - not merely the Minister, who is the mouthpiece of a party for the time being, but a tribunal, Board, or Commission, to whom the Minister or Parliament might refer the duty of the collection and formulation of evidence and information. The views of a Board so constituted would have great weight with, and be a great relief to, the Minister, as well as to members of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing can deprive Parliament of the right of final review ; but Parliament is entitled to the assistance of the best evidence-gathering and recommending authority that can be secured. This view ought to commend itself to honorable members of all complexions of political thought. I now pass on to the Post and Telegraph Department, in which I feel an interest, having had the honour of presiding over it for nearly twelve months. Not being able to gather very much information from the Budget-papers in regard to the real position of the Department, I wrote to the Department itself, and  1  have been supplied with certain facts which I have summarized for the information of honorable members. I find that the revenue from the Post Office, including posts, telegraphs, and telephones in' 1908, when the Deakin Government were in office, amounted to £3,400,000 odd; while in 1911-12 it was £3,916,000 odd, showing an increase of £500,000 odd. That seems to be a very substantial increase in revenue, because it makes no allowance for the loss suffered by the adoption of penny postage. That loss has been variously estimated at from £300,000 to £400,000, but I think it would be impossible to arrive at any accurate calculation. Whatever it was, the increase in the revenue from the Postal Department during the three years amounted to £500,000. The principal sources of increase were as follows : - Postal, £57,641 ; telegraphs, £138,553; telephones, £310,980. The heavy increase in the revenue from telephones has evidently arisen very largely from the higher rates imposed by the present Administration, and also from the extension of net-works and the additional number of subscribers. In view of that large increase in the telephone revenue, I think that it is the duty of the Postmaster-General to present to Parliament a balance-sheet showing the exact condition of the telephonic service. When I was in office, there was a difference of opinion among the experts as to whether the telephone service, under the old system, was paying. With the concurrence of the House, I appointed a special Finance Committee, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitton</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holmes,</inline> to investigate the telephonic service, and they found that under the old system it was paying, and that there was no necessity for any very drastic increase in the telephone rates. That was in 1909. Since then there has been an increase in the rates, and an increase in the number of subscribers. The additional revenue shown strongly suggests that the telephone service must be paying well, and that the time has arrived for a special investigation to show whether the increased rates imposed by the present Minister of External Affairs, when he held office as Postmaster-General, are justifiable. I believe that a thorough balance-sheet, giving receipts and expenditure under various headings - debiting all the sources of expenditure and crediting all the sources of revenue - would show that there was a balance on the right side, and that it is unnecessary to penalize the subscribers by high rates. </para>

                            <para>- I would go back to a. reduced rate. I believe that our telephones are paying better than is any other branch of the Public Service; that there is a growing tendency towards popularity; that there is a desire for the extension of the service throughout Australia; and that we should be quite justified in reducing the rates and making extensions, not only in the towns, but in the country districts. An extension of the system in country districts would make life there more attractive; it would bring the people to a greater extent within the lines of communication, and would so aid in putting people on the land. </para>

                            <para>- We have in operation a mixed system, but I do not desire that we should go back to any form other than the toll system. When I was in office, I said I believed the time would arrive when the toll system would have to be adopted, but I did not think a change was necessary under the existing circumstances. The Finance Committee which I appointed justified the retention of the system, but the time has arrived when we should make a thorough investigation, and see whether concessions cannot be made. I apprehend that it is not the desire of the Government to make a profit out of any of these services. The Minister of External Affairs himself said, when Postmaster-General, that he did not wish to make ' a profit out of them, and it it be shown that the telephone service is more than paying well, we should grant concessions in the shape of reduced charges' to the people in both town and country. This leads me to point to the necessity for the preparation of a balance-sheet relating to the whole Department of the Postmaster-General. When I was in office I directed the preparation of a departmental balance-sheet showing the in-  come and expenditure of the whole service, and that balance-sheet was presented to Parliament on 26th August, 1909. It gave particulars of the income and expenditure of the three great branches; the various branches of the services were separated, and their revenue and expenditure shown under their several headings. That report was presented to Parliament in pursuance of a resolution of this House carried some years ago on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dugald</inline> Thomson, who then represented North Sydney. The resolution is still in force, and I should like to have from the Postmaster-General an explanation as to why effect has not been given to it from year to year. I gave instructions when in office that, in accordance with the resolution, a balance-sheet was to be prepared and- presented to Parliament every year; yet we find that nothing has since been done. I regret the absence of the Postmaster-General through illness, but I feel justified in again drawing the attention of the Committee to the necessity of bringing the telegraphic service well up-to-date in the matter of  scientific equipment, and the adoption of scientific methods. Our Telegraph Service is not' as up-to-date as it ought to be. On a previous occasion I mentioned three important telegraphic instruments which I saw in the Central Telegraph Office, London, last year, but which have not yet found a place in the Telegraph Service of the Commonwealth. They are the Creed receiver; the Hughes telegraph instrument, and the Baudot telegraph instrument. I mention these names once more in order that honorable members may <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> forget them, and in the hope that the the Postmaster- General will insist upon his Department being brought up to date. Those instruments are required, not for ornamentation, but for practical use. I was informed when in London that they effected a great deal of saving, not only in respect of capital expenditure, but in labour - that their use resulted in a material saving in respect of wires and service. We should have them. The Postmaster-General promised me twelve months ago that he would make inquiries in the matter. [ wish to know whether those inquiries have been made, and whether any action has been taken. I propose now to make a few general observations regarding the growth of the Public Service - the increased number of governmental functions which have been established by appropriations in connexion with this and other Governments, and which have resulted in an increased number of Government employe's. The secondary result of that increase of functions and increase in the number of Government employes has been the growth of political or official patronage, and the gradual development of a bureaucratic system in this country which ought to be brought within the control of the law. During the last two years , while the Labour party have been in office, Ministers have made 134 appointments to offices carrying salaries over £300 per annum, and representing a total of £74,000 a year. These appointments were made by Ministers in the exercise of uncontrolled political patronage, apart from, and regardless of, the Public Service Commissioner. During the same period, the Public Service Commissioner has only made thirty-six appointments to offices, carrying a salary exceeding£300 a year, and these represent total salaries of £15,000 per annum. The Public Service Act was passed in the early days of Federation with the object of purifying the Service, and securing a guarantee that public servants would be appointed regardless of political or departmental influence, and apart from personal considerations. No doubt, the control of permanent appointments now rests with the Public Service Commissioner; but, unfortunately, in the drafting of the Act a loophole was left for the exercise of political and departmental patronage of a very serious and extensive character. These are to be found in the sections relating to temporary employment, and, as they are called, exempt hands. In order to give honorable members some idea of the extent of the temporary employment in the Service, and of the appointment of exempt hands, let me quote the following figures relating to exempt hands, not including the military and parliamentary officers :  - Exempt hands, 1909, 13,675; 1910, 14.954. Temporary hands, 1909, 2,725; 1910, 3,308;or an increase from 16,400 to 18,262. In 1910 there were 12,187, and in 1911 13,233 permanent officers. The total number of officers in the Commonwealth, temporary, exempt, and permanent, was, in 1910, 28,587, and, in 1911, 31,485. The appointment, employment, retention, and dismissal of those men, women," and girls depend entirely on departmental or political influence. Things would not be so bad if the figures were not growing, but the tendency seems to be to enlarge the area of government, to create new kinds of employment, and to substitute public officers for contractors. Within the last few years, we have had established a Cordite Factory, a Woollen Cloth" Factory, a Clothing Factory, a Small Arms Factory, a Harness and Saddlery Factory- </para>

                            <para>- There has been a growth of the bureaucracy which the honorable member for Bourke denounced the other night. These appointments should not be left to the independent judgment of managers, without the oversight and regulation of Parliament. I have had a plan prepared showing the vast expenditure on these Institutions. As they grow, the hands employed in them will increase, and something must be done to provide satisfactory conditions of management. The fitters in the Telephone Department are artisans who have a defined and recognised position in the Public Service. Their appointment, pay, promotion, and the like do not depend on political patronage. The employment in the Government factories should be controlled in like manner by Act of Parliament. I have ascertained - that the Cordite Factory, with its site and buildings, cost for establishment, including machinery, plant, and equipment, £991935 ; the Woollen Factory, £27,983; the Clothing Factory, ^26,787 ; the Small Arms Factory, £170,749 ; and the Harness and Saddlery Factory, £10,250; a total of ^335, 704- That is the capital cost to date of these factories for the manufacture of Government stores and materials, no account having been taken of any loss that may have been incurred. The Treasury is not in possession of balance-sheets showing how these institutions are being worked. I have contended for the production of a balance-sheet to show the operations of the Telephone Service and of the Post Office Department, and I am justified in contending for <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> production of balance-sheets in connexion with each Budget to show the profit and loss of each of these factories. There should be some understanding on the subject. Matters should not be allowed to drift, and managers should not be permitted to carry on at their own sweet will, without responsibility, or being called to account. These factories should be worked on business lines. Why do not honorable members opposite demand balance-sheets ? </para>

                        <para>While the provisions of the law are as indicated, a regrettable omission occurred in the failure to provide for a system of selection for employment which would remove any possibility of undue influence, and enable temporary or casual work to be distributed on fair grounds without favour to any person. It must be acknowledged that where opportunities occur foi the exercise of patronage, they are liable to be availed of, and, in the absence of restriction as to the method of engaging temporary assistance, the greatest temptation exists to find work for solicitous applicants, irrespective of the requirements of Departments, or of the claims of other applicants for prior consideration. And the danger does not end at this stage, as once having secured temporary engagement by means of undue influence, the same influence is brought into play to prevent the services of temporary hands being dispensed with. Viewing, the matter not only from an economical stand-point, but also from that of efficiency, the present system is detrimental to Departmental interests; and nothing but demoralization of the Permanent Service can result from a wasteful introduction of temporary hands. </para>

                        <para>Instances have occurred where irregularities of a serious nature in respect to employment have been reported, and where persons who have never even complied with the provisions of the Act, as to registration, have been placed on the Temporary Staff. In one State four men were engaged by the Department in this way, and, when it is stated that two of these persons were considered to be ineligible for registration, owing to previous bad records when in the permanent employ of the Department, the gravity of the position is apparent. These cases were reported to the Auditor-General, and it is probable that the officers responsible for the irregularity will be surcharged the amount of salary which has been illegally paid to the temporary hands. </para>

Even in the employment of men to do temporary work, or exempt hands, we should insist upon their undergoing some test to show their efficiency. We should not let them be put on as an act of favour or patronage. The complaint of the Public Service Commissioner is that even persons required for temporary purposes are put on without regard to efficiency, and very often without regard to registration. </para>

It is time that Ministers insisted upon the enforcement of the law in reference to temporary employment; but there is a still more insidious way of evading the provisions of the Public Service Act requiring qualifications for service. That is by withdrawing certain classes of employment altogether from the Act, under the term of "exempt employment." In this report, which was made last November, the Commissioner refers to some things that were news to me, and I think will be news to a number of honorable members. He says - </para>

                    <para class="block">Those make a large group of men actually exempt from the ordinary operations of the Public Service Act. Their employment is vested in departmental heads, without any conditions or regulations, or any mode of choice being determined. It is a mere matter of favour, influence, and pressure brought to bear. I am just as much against departmental patronage as against political influence. It might, perhaps, be more objectionable, and therefore I think all this group of employes ought to be withdrawn from departmental influence. Why should men be dependent for employment as letter-carriers, tradesmen, mechanics, &amp;c, on departmental officers, overseers, or superintendents ? There ought to be a recognised method of registration, and certain defined qualifications for a man who wants to obtain employment of this kind. The work might be temporary, or, if it is exempt employment, it might even be permanent, and it certainly should not depend on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit,</inline> favour, or preference of anybody. There should be a regular standard of choice and mode of selection, as recommended by the Minister himself.

It is best to allow them to be determined by certain regular tribunals authorized by law.
