                            I wish to ask you the following questions : - 1. In view of standing order No. 128, viz., " A. question having been proposed may be amended (1) by leaving out- certain words only ; (2) by leaving out certain words in order to insert or add other words ; (3) by inserting or adding words," was the amendment " That the report be referred back to the Commissioners for further consideration," moved by the honorable member for Herbert, on the 23rd of July, in order? (See
                            <inline font-style="italic">Votes and Proceedings</inline>
                            of 23rd July.) 2. If the said amendment was in order, should it not, when carried, have been put to the House as a motion ?

                        <para>- The honorable member gave notice yesterday of his intention to ask these questions, but they do not appear on the notice-paper, because it is not customary to put upon the notice-paper questions addressed to the Speaker: Strictly speaking, an appeal cannot be made to the Chair by means of a question, save on a point of order, and the question should be asked when the point arises. The honorable member will, see that, were I liable to be called upon at any time to give rulings in regard to past  occurrences, so many questions might be put to me that a great part of the time of the House would be taken up in 'the answering of them. Appeals for my ruling should be made when the occurrences which call for them arise. Although I propose, to reply to the questions which the honorable member has asked, I wish him to understand that they should have been asked when -the business to which they refer was under the consideration of the House, and I wish the House to understand that my present action is not to be taken as a precedent. I propose, in the future, not to answer questions on points of order, unless raised at the proper time. My reply to the honorable member's questions is that the standing order to which he refers deals only with the methods by which the terms of a question proposed by the Chair may be amended ; the standing order does not deal with the- disposal of such questions. When a motion has been proposed from the Chair, it is competent for an honorable member, whether an amendment has been moved or not, to move the previous question, or that the debate bo adjourned,- and it often happens during the consideration of Bills., when a motion for the adoption of the report from the Committee of the Whole has been moved, that another motion for the recommittal of the Bill follows. In these and similar cases the original motion is not dealt with, but is superseded. In the case to which the honorable member has called attention, the motion was made that the House approves of the distribution of Queensland into electoral divisions, as proposed by a majority' of the Commissioners in their report, and, subsequently, another motion was moved, to the effect that the report be referred back <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Commission. This second motion was a definite instruction, complete in itself, and plainly superseded the original motion, settling the question before the House. </para>

                            <para>.- I am taking this course because, not only on this, but also on the Ministerial side of the House, there is a great amount of dissatisfaction with the action of the Government in fixing the site of the Commonwealth woollen mills at Geelong. I wish to dispel at once any idea that I am taking this action on account of the decision to establish the mill within Victorian boundaries. The time ought to be long past in this Federal Parliament when matters of this sort could be considered from a provincial or parochial point of view. All these big questions, affecting the establishment of factories or other undertakings necessary to the defence of Australia and other purposes, and belonging to the Federation, ought to be dealt with from a national point of view, independent altogether of the particular State affected. I take exception to what has been done in this matter, first of all, in connexion with the visits made by the expert appointed to recommend a site. He received his instructions from the Government, and, according to his report, which has been issued to honorable members this morning, he visited thirty-three places. The first spot to which he went in New South Wales was the Federal Territory, and in his report he states that he was unable, for various reasons, to find at Y ass-Canberra a suitable site for the establishment of a woollen mill. It must come as a great surprise to honorable members to learn that he gave as one of his reasons that there was no water there. That used to be said here by honorable members five or six years ago, and also by a section of the press, but the gaugings which have been taken by Commonwealth officers since that time have absolutely proved the absurdity of the statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> said, in his report, that it was absolutely impossible to visit all the sites which were suggested to him. What I consider one of the finest sites in the whole of the Commonwealth, in accordance with the conditions laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> himself, was not visited by him at all. I refer to the site at Port Kembla, about 45 miles south of Sydney. He lays down the following eight conditions to be kept in view in choosing a site :  - Water supply, drainage, climatic conditions, proximity to wool markets, railway and shipping facilities, condition of labour market, geographical position as a distributing centre, and local conditions for efficient and economical working. While not expressing, an opinion on the climatic conditions necessary for the establishment of a woollen mill - that being a matter for an expert to decide - I consider that the site at Port Kembla absolutely fulfils, better than any other place in the Commonwealth, the other seven conditions which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> lays down. </para>

                                <para>- How can the honorable member say so, in view of the fact that the expert has never been there ? There was no delay in bringing this important site before the Commissioner, but as he never visited it, he is not in a position to pass an opinion upon it. I, however, who know the site well, and have had a great deal to do with it ever since the district was opened, a good many years ago, can speak confidently of it with regard to seven of the conditions laid down by him as necessary for the establishment of a mill. The other places visited by the Commissioner are fully reported upon, and it will be for other honorable members, who have a better acquaintance with them than I have, to deal with what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> says about them. After visiting the thirty-three sites enumerated, he has undoubtedly come to the conclusion that the Geelong site is in all respects the best of them j but, whilst it may be absolutely the best amongst those he visited- </para>

                                <para>- Other honorable members, and particularly the honorable member for Nepean, will be able to say something about one or two sites. All I contend is that it is absolutely impossible for the expert to have chosen the best site when he neglected to visit the one at Port Kembla. Another complaint which I have to make regarding the action of the Government is that, after this definite report, signed by the Commissioner on the 25th June, and stating that the Geelong site was the best, had been received by them, different honorable members in this House, notably the honorable member for Denison and myself, have received answers to questions, and have also received letters from the Department, which, to say the least of it, have been absolutely misleading. Two letters which I have received, dated 19th July and 25th July respectively - bringing the matter right up to date - would lead any one to believe that the Port Kembla site and others would receive careful attention from and consideration by the Government, when, as a matter of fact, the Government had already decided on Geelong. This was simply fooling, not only with honorable' members, but their constituents. I can imagine the indignation which the people of Port Kembla and the surrounding district - one of the largest industrial centres in the Commonwealth - felt when they learnt that, without their place having been visited, and without the slightest inquiry having been made regarding it, another site had been selected. I feel sure that all honorable members must object, with me, to the way in which we have been treated by the Minister in the answers that have been given us from time to time about this matter. The next point to which I wish to refer - and it is, after all, the principal consideration from my point of view - is the national aspect. When the fixing of the site for the Naval College was under consideration, the deciding factor, so far as honorable members on the opposite side of the House were concerned, was that it should be placed in Federal Territory. Many honorable members on both sides of the House were under the impression at the time that the land granted by the State of New South Wales to the Commonwealth at Jervis Bay was to be Federal Territory. It was found, however, on reference to the schedule to the Act by which the property came over to the Commonwealth, that, while the land in the Federal Capital area was Federal Territory, the strip at Jervis Bay had only been " granted " to the Commonwealth, and therefore did not constitute what was known as "territory." When that position arose the Government fought the Government of New South Wales for all they were worth. They threatened to place the college on some other site unless the State of New South Wales agreed to give them absolute sovereign rights over the area at Jervis Bay. Although the New South Wales Government fought them for some time, the Prime Minister and his colleagues were able to secure, over the 15,000 acres which the Commonwealth now holds there, absolute sovereign rights. The reason given was that it was absolutely necessary for the Commonwealth to be able to govern its own factories and establishments independent of any possibility of State interference. What applied to the naval college and other places applies with equal force to such factories as the clothing factory, the harness factory, the small arms factory, and the cordite factory. The position has been taken up very strongly by honorable members opposite - I shall not use the word "caucus," because I found the other day that it was regarded as offensive - and by members of the same party in the Senate, that Commonwealth factories should be established in Commonwealth territory. A resolution to the following effect was carried last year in the Senate, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> : - </para>

                        <para class="block">That motion was strongly supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and others. The mover, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>Commonwealth. It must be obvious that factories for the manufacture of all the requirements for our military service should be established in Commonwealth Territory, whether in view of possible aggression from outside Australia, or of trouble which might arise within the Commonwealth. Such things have happened in other parts of the world, and they may happen in Australia. I do not say for a moment that they will, and I hope that they never will happen ; but he is a wise man who can foretell the future. Our factories for the supply of rifles, ammunition, and other requirements of our Defence Force could be easily cut off from the coal supplies which are necessary to keep them working. That will be admitted to be very undesirable. There are in the Federal Territory all the fuel and other requirements necessary to keep them going...... </para>

                        <para>That was similar to the strong position taken up by the Government in connexion with the Jervis Bay territory - </para>

                            <para>If all our factories were established close together in the Federal Territory, the labour might be made interchangeable. Men might be worked in one factory until its output had met requirements, and they could then work in another. It would not be necessary for them to go, as they may have to do now, from one State to another, looking for work. It is necessary that we should adopt some means of keeping our hands constantly employed, and my idea is that we should have our factories established close together within the Federal Territory. </para>

                            <para>So far from furthering the establishment in our own territory of our own works, not a single thing has been done by this Ministry since the site was selected to establish anything in the nature of a Commonwealth work there. The Government have been put to great expense in purchasing or leasing offices and sites for the establishment of factories. By-and-by, when we move into our own territory, those factories will be scattered all over the face of the continent. They will require separate supervision and separate power to work them. We shall have nothing in our own territory at all.

I think I have quoted sufficient to show that honorable members of the Labour party in both Houses have taken up the attitude that, where possible, all Federal factories and institutions should be established within Federal Territory. That, I think, is a national stand taken up by honorable members opposite. The expert in this case has said that he could find no suitable site at Yass-Canberra for the establishment of the woollen mills, but I should like to know what is the matter with Jervis Bay. The Government fought hard and long for a piece of territory running down to Jervis Bay, and I should like to know why the territory acquired there was not visited by the expert. Every one who has visited Jervis Bay is aware that it is a magnificent harbor, and would be a magnificent centre of distribution. The Jervis Bay territory fulfils all the requirements which the Commissioner has declared essential to the successful establishment of these mills. </para>

                                <para>- Any quantity, but I will not say that there is a running stream. Honorable members opposite should insist upon the Government expert inspecting the Federal Territory at Jervis Bay before it is finally decided that this factory should be erected outside Federal Territory. With the exception, perhaps, of a running stream, the Jervis Bay territory fulfils all the requirements, and I trust that it will be inspected, and a site selected there. With a view to securing effective administration and avoiding interference by any State authority, I hope that the supporters of the Government will insist upon the expert being asked to see if he cannot select a site in Federal Territory. All who view this matter from a national stand-point must recognise that the woollen mills should be established in our own territory, but, apart from that fact altogether, I think that sites which have been brought under the notice of the Minister by myself and other honorable members, but which have not been inspected by the expert, should be visited by him before a final decision is arrived at, if it is to be placed outside of Federal Territory. </para>

                            <para>. - At 9.45 this morning the honorable member penned a note to myself to the effect that he intended to submit this motion. I did not receive that note until 10.28, or two minutes before the House met. I suggest to him that if in future he has a similar motion to propose, it might be useful to allow the Minister concerned a little more notice. </para>

Apart from that, however, the honorable member's reference to the fact that he sincerely hoped honorable members on this side would insist on the Government sending the expert to the Federal Territory to report as to its suitability, drives me to the conclusion that he has not read the report of the expert, which is in print, and was laid on the table two days ago. </para>

                                <para>- Apparently, the honorable member cannot help being disorderly. In regard to the quotations read by the honorable member for Illawarra, I may point out that a resolution of the Senate, or expressions of opinion from either side of this House, do not necessarily bind the Government. All honorable members, particularly those on this side, are free to express their opinions ; and it is very cheering to receive a certificate from the other side that the speeches delivered by Government supporters are of a truly national character. The honorable member for Illawarra has overlooked the instructions given to the expert by the Government. This is a matter wholly and solely for an expert, and not for myself, whose opinions may be influenced owing to the fact that' I represent a particular district. An expert of undoubted ability was obtained from England, who could have no local opinion, and who has not been long enough in the country to be influenced in any way by local opinion. He was sent  out to visit various parts of the Commonwealth with an absolutely free hand. We relied on his expert knowledge, and expressly instructed him that the factory would be under his charge, and that he would be held responsible for its safe, efficient, and economical working. If I gather anything from the remarks of the honorable member for Illawarra, it is that if he and his party had been in charge they would have directed the expert to put the factory in a particular position, irrespective of its efficient and economical working, with the result that, subsequently, they would have had to foster it by continual subsidies of one kind or another, or they would have gone to the country and declared that another Socialistic institution was not paying, and that reliance should have been placed on good old private enterprise. I ask honorable members opposite, if they would, in public, differ from the instructions which were given to the expert. What I understand by economical management is that the factory shall be conducted on ordinary business lines, and, unaided by any Government subsidies, shall be made a paying concern in the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- I am sorry to hear the interjection of the honorable member. It does not follow that, because a man is not an expert in writing a report for submission to Parliament, he is not an expert in the manufacture of woollen materials. There are not many of us, even in this House, after long years of parliamentary experience, who can claim to be experts in writing reports ; indeed, many of us have to apply for legal assistance when we desire to be particularly careful. However, the report of the expert was such that the Government had no option but to accept the definite recommendation in favour of Geelong. I know that honorable members, particularly on this side of the House, desire that such factories shall be successfully established on efficient, safe, and economical lines; and that they shall not be interfered with later on by persons who are only too willing and glad to seize any opportunity to say that enterprises of a Socialistic character ought not to be undertaken. Under all the circumstances I hope that honorable members will not permit a motion of this description  to be passed. Although the proposal has, to some extent, in the able remarks of the honorable member for Illawarra, been freed from the parochial element, it has in it all the elements of parochialism; but be that as it may, the Government have decided to accept the report of the expert. </para>

                            <para>. - I desire to assure the Honorary Minister that in all matters of behaviour I appeal to the standard set by himself ; everybody knows that he is a perfect Chesterfield in this House. But may I suggest that when next he sets out to deliver lectures on behaviour, he should address himself to some of his own colleagues? In my wildest flights I never described honorable members as "miserable, sulky, paralytic, one-legged, one-eyed muck worms." </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member has received encomiums, plaudits, and thanks from the townspeople of Geelong, and I congratulate him on his fortunate position in this matter. The complimentary references which have been made to him are, of course, all based on national grounds. We are all Nationalists, and do not need to parade the fact, but it is rather a strong dose to be told that there is a monopoly of Nationalism among the supporters of the Government. We shall see before the debate is finished how much Nationalism there is on the Ministerial cross benches. I can see the Nationalism of some of the members sitting there oozing out of their finger tips almost. I shall be glad to hear the Nationalist notes sounded by the honorable member for Nepean in this matter. I hope that it will not be regarded as a departure from Nationalist ideals if I claim that the report is entirely inadequate, and tells us nothing. It lays down principles, and then dismisses one place after another in a single line. For instance, we are told that Parramatta is " more suitable than Lithgow, but not at all in the running against Liverpool and Geelong." That is not an enlightening description of the advantages of the district for the manufacture of woollens. The expert was in Parramatta for only an hour or two at the most. He speaks of running water as a prime qualification, but appears not to know that there is alongside the retaining walls of the Parramatta Woollen Mills a stream of water equal for that purpose to any in Australia. I do not say that the Commonwealth Woollen Mills should be erected at Parramatta, although the mills now there have been so successful that they are being duplicated. Clothing for the Government Departments of the State is made there, and I believe that its qualities have never been called into question. On the contrary, it has received the highest approval from experts. Therefore Parramatta should not have been dismissed in a single line. I hope I may make that statement without being taken to cast the slightest reflections on the expert. It is a justifiable complaint in regard to a proposal for the expenditure of ^"60,000 that we have not sufficiently full information. If' Geelong is the best place for the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, by all means let them be put there ; let them be put in the best place for them. That is my Nationalism. But Parliament should be told why Geelong is better than any other place in the Commonwealth. This Government has completely reversed its policy regarding the selection of sites for national institutions. </para>

                        <para>The plea for abandoning ' the Naval College site near Sydney, and adopting another in the Federal Territory, was that it was intended to concentrate all the Federal institutions there. That policy has now been departed from, and the reasons for the departure should be fully and adequately set out. It is evident that the Federal Territory was not properly examined to find a site. Only the site of the city was looked at, and districts where there is water and facilities for distribution were not examined. _ The expert lays it down that geographical position for distribution, local conditions as to efficient and economical working, railway and shipping facilities, and proximity to wool markets are the important considerations, but he did not go to that part of the Federal Territory in which shipping facilities could be provided, and the geographical position of which is advantageous for distribution. A report which deals with thirty-six sites in two pages cannot be regarded as adequate. Of Lithgow it is said that " the only advantage here is proximity to coal. In all other conditions it does not come up to Liverpool." That may be true enough. Yet there has been a successful woollen mill at Lithgow for many years, one of the oldest mills in the State. If the disadvantages of these places were explained, we should be in a better position to judge of the advantages of the Geelong site. I do not say. a word against Geelong, which must have many advantages, being close to the sea, and pretty central ; but I do not know that it possesses a better water supply than some of the other sites, nor a more suitable climate. The invidious comparison of </para>
                        <para class="block">Parramatta with other places would justify the inference that there is not a water supply there, whereas there is an excellent water supply, as good as is to be found in the State. I hope that the Minister will obtain a fuller report from the expert, so that Parliament may come to a proper decision. The comparisons in the report before us leave us entirely in the dark as to the merits of the various sites. If in the end it is shown that Geelong is the best site, I shall be ready to say " Good luck to her; let her have the prize." </para>

                            <para>.- I was surprised" at the moving of the adjournment to discuss this matter. The chief complaint of the honorable member for Illawarra seems to be that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> did not inspect Port Kembla. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> came to Australia about six months ago, when the possibility of establishing Federal woollen mills at Yass-Canberra was freely discussed. Every honorable member had an opportunity then to bring under the notice of the Government sites which he would like to have visited. Why did not the honorable member for Illawarra avail himself of that opportunity? He waits for six months, until a site has been selected, and then asks why Port Kembla was not visited. Apparently, he has been asleep. I have always understood that Opposition members are great believers in experts, because from time to time I have heard them condemn the Government for not accepting expert advice. </para>

                                <para>- In listening to the honorable member for Illawarra, I hardly knew whether he was a Nationalist or a parochialist. We gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> every facility to see for himself the advantages of Geelong. In establishing a factory, it is an advantage to have it in a town where labour is available. If a man were establishing a woollen factory in England, he would put it in Bradford, because there he would get men and women who had been trained to woollen manufacture from their infancy. Similarly, a cutlery factory would be established at Sheffield. At Geelong there are three big woollen mills, and the number of persons acquainted with the manufacture of woollens is twice as large as in any other district in Australia. Furthermore, we have there a cord and textile college, fitted up with the latest machinery for training persons in every branch of the woollen industry. </para>

                                <para>- It is riot. The Harbor Trust is an up-to-date body which wants to encourage the establishment of factories at Geelong, and is quite willing to be generous. In tact, generosity is a feature of Victorian public bodies. The honorable member for Illawarra said that the mill should have .been established in Federal Territory, if the views of members of the Labour party were considered. </para>

                                    was told by the Government to visit the Federal Territory first, and, if it were possible economically to select a site for the mill there, he was to do so. He gave one of the fullest reports on any site on that at Yass-Canberra. He wrote -

                        <para class="block">The Opposition only recently condemned the Government for extravagance and waste fulness, but now they are condemning the Government for endeavouring to spend the taxpayers' money to the best advantage. I cannot follow that sort of logic, but it is in keeping with many of the statements made by the Opposition in the past. The site selected is magnificent. It is one of the best that could possibly be obtained in North Geelong. It is situated on a small inlet called Corio Quay. There is a magnificent supply of water there; and if it is necessary to transport any of the woollen material by sea, barges can be brought right up to the factory. It is next to the Harbor Trust works, from which the factory can be supplied with all the electricity requisite. It should, therefore, not be necessary for the Government to establish an electric plant of their own, because the Harbor Trust, a Government institution, are quite willing to supply all the electricity that is wanted. So far as the employes are concerned, we have a number of highly-trained men and women available to do the work of the factory. With all this evidence in support of the site chosen, I am sure the House will have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the Government were quite justified in adopting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail's</inline> report. </para>

                            <para>.- I am quite in accord with the action of the honorable member for Illawarra in moving the adjournment of the House. I think the question is of sufficient importance to warrant the course he has taken. The Honorary Minister told us that the Ministry had been guided by an expert specially appointed to select a site for the woollen mill, and that they wanted to establish a mill which would be a paying concern and a credit to the Commonwealth. I quite agree with those remarks, but I blame the Ministry for not having taken the slightest trouble to send the expert to the best places. They allowed him to go about the Commonwealth, apparently, just where some honorable member or other wanted him to go. </para>

                                <para>- The Government have not treated the Commonwealth as they should have done. I quite agree with those honorable members who contend that nearly all the industries which the Commonwealth is going to establish should be in Federal Territory, provided that there is not some particular reason for placing them elsewhere. I do not want to bind myself down too rigidly in that regard, because we are  legislating, not only for one little bit of Australia known as the Federal Territory, but for the whole of Australia, and it may be necessary at times to go outside of our own territory for the purpose. The Defence Department have handled this matter in the most casual manner. They brought out the expert, but, while professing to try to find the best site in Australia, they took no trouble to do anything of the sort. They practically allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> to be at the beck and call of anybody who liked to approach the Government. When he was in Tasmania, I did not approach him when I might have done so, simply because I saw that he had been instructed to go to Hobart and Launceston, and I felt that it would not be fair to him or the Government to approach him behind their backs and ask him to go somewhere else on my initiative. The next day, I noticed by the press that some one had spoken to him, and that he had said that he did not feel himself at liberty to go to any places other than Hobart and Launceston, because those were the limits of his instructions. On the following day, I noticed that some one in another part of the State had telegraphed to the Minister, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> was going to be sent to that particular place. I then tried to meet him on the train, and tried also to get into touch with him by telephone, so that he might spend at least an hour at one site which he had not seen, but I could not get him. I placed myself in communication with the Minister of Defence, and was told, by letter, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> was going to visit Tasmania again. Consequently, I informed the public bodies who, I thought, were interested, and they have been expecting to hear from me the date of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail's</inline> arrival. I was not told by the Department that he was not going to Tasmania again, although they must have known perfectly well by that time that there was no intention of sending him there. </para>

                                <para>- I suppose the honorable member had some means of " knowing a bit," and that is another complaint that I have to make. If honorable members in one part of the House were informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> was about to peregrinate Australia in this haphazard manner, we ought all to have had a similar opportunity of knowing it. I do not think it redounds al all to the credit of the Government to allow themselves to be approached by individual members, and then to send their expert where those individuals wanted him to go. Is that the way to find the best site ? </para>

                                <para>- Everything that I . have said will bear scrutiny. The way the Defence Department have acted in this matter is only too patent to everybody. It is on a par with their beautiful action in connexion with the Naval College. When they had made up their minds that they were going to use Osborne House, at Geelong, as a temporary site for the college, they allowed an expert to go round the Commonwealth hoodwinking the people into the belief that they were trying to find the best site. They knew all the time where they really intended to start operations, but they allowed public money to be spent in that way. Another illustration of the conduct of the Department is the recent placing of a contract for material required by them at Westernport. They made a bargain, and then called for tenders to save their face. It is about time the Defence Department was looked into. </para>

                                <para>- I am not saying anything against Geelong as a site, but I notice that Launceston ran it very close. Seeing that the Tasmanian woollens and the Tasmanian water are the best in the Commonwealth, the report is scarcely satisfactory in placing Geelong first. The expert's report is a scrappy production, and does not suggest that some of the sites were very closely inspected by him. As to the suggestion that he should pay a second visit to Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> states that he is satisfied from the information that he obtained on- his first visit that there is no place in Tasmania to compare with Launceston, which he has already reported upon as the most suitable in that State. I should like to know, however, from whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> obtained this information as to sites in Tasmania which he did not inspect. I have heard men who have had practical experience in the woollen mills of Scotland declare that certain sites in Tasmania which were not visited by the Government expert are ideal ones for woollen factories. One of these might readily have been visited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> if we had had the same chance of obtaining his services as certain other honorable members and public bodies have had. The site in question is on what is really one of the finest running streams in Australia. It is easy of access to shipping, wool can be brought there freely and cheaply, and it possesses a domestic water supply superior, with the exception of that of Launceston, to any in Tasmania of which I know. The Ministry claim that they have obtained expert advice, but they did not take the trouble to see that the expert was sent to some of the best parts of Australia to make the inspections for which he was engaged. </para>

                            <para>. - I strongly object to the absolute farce in which the Ministry indulge in regard to what they describe as questions of national importance. The farce that we have seen in connexion with the selection of a site for the woollen mills was also played in connexion with the selection of a site for a Naval College. An expert was paid a high fee to make an inspection, and to recommend to the Ministry the most suitable site on which to establish the Naval College, but when he submitted his report the Government promptly disagreed with it and asked him to make another recommendation. In the first place a site at Burraneer Point was recommended, but that site was objected to on so-called national grounds, and Geelong was at once brought to the front. The price of Nationalism in that instance was the offer of a large house at Geelong for use as a Naval College. In this case we have had a precisely similar experience. I have a strong objection to "nobbled" experts being paid a high fee to inspect sites in this country and presenting a report which is promptly disagreed with.- The price to be paid in this case is the offer of 10 acres of land, free of charge, at Geelong and a free supply of water for ten years. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. There are many sites equal to Geelong in the matter of water carriage and general shipping facilities. I feel it necessary to say that this continual mouthing of the national spirit is nauseating to me. I have never claimed to be a pure-blooded Nationalist. I am out all the time to get all that I can for my constituency, and I believe that all honorable members are actuated by the same spirit, although we all recognise that there are some questions regarding which that attitude must not be taken up. I cannot help recalling the pressure that was brought to bear upon honorable members in regard to the establishment of the Naval College in Federal Territory. I had rubbed into me the necessity of dealing with the matter in a national spirit, and the Government declared that it was in the national interest that the College should be established in Federal Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail's</inline> report, in which he deals with the Federal Capital as a site for the woollen mills, is very interesting, and it seems to be something more than a mere coincidence that it should have been issued at a time when so many " twopenny-halfpenny " public bodies in Victoria are passing resolutions in opposition to the building of the Federal City. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> writes of the Federal Capital - </para>

                                <para>- If the Commonwealth Parliament is to consider these matters from a national stand-point, it should not be influenced even by an offer of 2,000 acres. It is a farce to send out experts to report if the whole matter upon which they are to report is decided before they leave Melbourne. While it is true that two sites in my own electorate were reported on, I object to the honorable member for Wilmot attributing to honorable members on this side certain motives in regard to the inspection of sites. I received a letter from the Lithgow Progress Association, in the one case, and from the local Municipal Council, in the other, asking that these two sites should be visited, and I think that an honorable member who receives such a request from public bodies or institutions has a right to forward them to the Minister, and to ask that they be complied with. </para>

                                <para>- It is no disgrace to be poor. In thus referring to the institutions in question I had in mind the measure of their importance, and not any question of their finances. If it is the policy of the party that all Commonwealth factories and institutions are to be established in the Federal Capital I shall say no more. I am prepared to stand by such a policy as long as it is properly observed; but in connexion with both the cases to which I have ' referred the Government have gone right in the teeth of that policy. If it be true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Small</inline> has said in his report, that at the Federal Capital there is no water supply, no drainage, and so forth, then the sooner we shut up shop there the better. But I do not believe that it is true. It is interesting to note the way in which the representatives of Victoria cheered the reading of this quotation from the report. They do not desire that any factories shall be established at Yass-Canberra, and the passing of resolutions by various Victorian institutions in opposition to the building of the capital has a very sinister meaning in connexion with the decision of a question of this kind. I hope the Ministry will rise above these petty attempts to interfere with the establishment of the Federal city. </para>

                            <para>.- I cordially indorse the general attitude on  this question of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. It is known not only to honorable members from New South Wales, but to the Minister of Home Affairs, that a water gauge has been established on the Cotter in connexion with the water supply for drinking purposes, and that it proves that, even in time of drought, all the anticipations of the most favorable reports as to the water supply of the territory are widely exceeded. It is therefore ridiculous to talk of a lack of water supply there. As to the balance of these reflections on the suitability of the Federal Territory for a woollen mill - the statement that there is no definite lay-out plan of the. city, no drainage, and no railway - I think that the fact that there is so little is something for which we cannot blame the site itself, but which we can urge the Government to take immediate steps to remedy. It strikes me that this expert and the Government that have indorsed his recommendation in so curious a way do not realize that there is going on throughout the world to-day a movement to remove industries from dense populations in order to conduct thea more comfortably in suitable surroundings. What is the  Garden  City movement? It is to take workgirls and workmen away from the sweat areas and to give them comfortable conditions in healthy surroundings of life. We ought, also, to aim at that. Here we have a Labour Government, acting, allegedly, upon an unsatisfactory and inadequate report of an expert establishing a factory in areas where the population is clamouring and struggling and competing bitterly for a mere existence, instead of taking the people they want to a place where they can be well treated under healthy conditions. If private enterprise in England finds that it suits itself to take people away from large cities to start place's like Sunlight City, where every person has at least a chance of enjoying a healthy life, and knows no slum conditions, should we not expect at least a similar wide comprehensiveness of labour conditions from a Labour Administration in Australia? </para>

                        <para>I much regret the attempt of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence to crack the party whip in connexion with this proposal. He came to honorable members and said, " This is' a proposal to try to make this proposition unworkable. The anti-Socialists in the House want to destroy the balances of your woollen mills so that they will be able to say that this is only another instance of the failure of your schemes." Did honorable members hear the cheers with which representatives of Victoria, no matter on what side of the House they sit, greeted that statement? Did they hear the honorable member for Fawkner wildly cheering this reason for establishing the factory at Geelong? This is only another endeavour to "pull the legs " of supporters of the Labour Government - to deceive them into bolstering up the parish-pump influences brought to bear from time to time in this Chamber. </para>
                        <para class="block">I protest against the way in which the Honorary Minister has dealt with the question. If we had had an adequate report, and the Minister had, after mature consideration, acted on that report, and his representative here had given the House full and honest information with regard to the exact posi-' tion, I should have no complaint to make. But we find the House deliberately shut off from' information to which we are entitled. The Honorary Minister talks about experts, and I think I may describe him as an expert in affording inaccurate information in reply to questions. Only last Thursday, the day before this report was accepted by the Minister, the honorable member for Denison asked that some site in. Tasmania should receive consideration, especially in view of the water power available ; and the Honorary Minister replied that there was not the slightest doubt that the Minister would make a comparison of the cost " before he decides where the woollen mills shall be situated." </para>

"A further question was asked, also on Thursday last, by the honorable member for Wilmot, and the Honorary Minister, this expert in answering questions, said that he understood <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> had finished his inspection of the various sites suggested throughout the Commonwealth, and was " now preparing his report for submission to the Minister." We have seen that, as a matter of fact, the report was submitted to the Minister on the  2,5th  June last. Then, again, in order to still further trick honorable members into- a sense of false security, the Honorary Minister, on the same occasion, said that he was quite unable to say why certain towns had been visited. When pressed, however, he admitted that some honorable members had taken " the trouble to write suggesting that certain places should be visited," and that municipal councils and other institutions had " made similar representations, all of which were met by the Minister." It will be seen that the Honorary Minister did know exactly on what basis the inquiry had been conducted. </para>

It would seem that there were honorable members who happened to know, and some municipalities which were " given the wink," and it was they who got the advantage of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail's</inline> presence, and not, generally speaking, the public of Australia, who have a right to a reasoned report from a Government expert. </para>

                        <para>I desire to deal with another statement by the Honorary Minister, the expert in answering questions. On Thursday last, in answer to a question by the honorable member for Capricornia, suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> should visit the central districts of Queensland, the Honorary Minister said, " I shall submit the question to the Minister of Defence." I have searched the departmental records, and I cannot find any sign of the matter having been dealt with, at any rate by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail.</inline> All that we have on the 19th July is a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> assuring the Minister that he had got all the information he required when he visited Portland ; and that he did not consider it necessary to revisit the district. That is all <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> said, or was asked to consider, in spite of the definite promises and misleading statements made in. the House by the Honorary Minister. </para>
                        <para>I regret exceedingly that the Government have succumbed to the parish-pump influences of Victoria in connexion with this proposition. I fancy that if we were to undertake an investigation of the influence of the brain on physical development we should find the right biceps of the average Victorian member of Parliament very much enlarged by constant exercise at the "parish pump." Those gentlemen call themselves Nationalists; and we saw how violently national they can be when they tried to take the Naval College away from the place advised by the expert. Even then they did not propose to place the college somewhere in Tasmania, as suggested alternatively by the expert, but insisted that a temporary building, which might become the permanent building, should be erected at Geelong. This sort of thing has gone far enough in the Chamber. I stand on the principle of having Government agencies wherever they are most needed in the interests of the people. I see no objection whatever to the establishment of factories away from the city areas. If private enterprise can do that, with benefit to itself and' its employes, why cannot the Commonwealth do it in a national undertaking? I protest against the meagreness and inadequacy of this report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> on a work of such magnitude. Great private industrial enterprises, with hundreds of thousands in capital, have actually failed owing to their establishment in wrong localities ; and yet this report dismisses with a word places deliberately and successfully chosen by people already engaged in the woollen industry. The expert ought to have been given latitude, and not directed as to where he should go. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the penalties provided in the various sections which' it is proposed to insert in the principal Act are strangely apportioned. Under the proposed new section 6j, the penalty for practising any fraud or deceit, or knowingly making or exhibiting any false statement, representation, token, or writing to a witness, with intent to affect his testimony, is imprisonment for two year.s, and yet for giving false testimony, a very similar- offence, the penalty is five years. Why is the distinction made? </para>

                        <para>- I should say( so. In my opinion, the Government is on the wrong track. The inquiries of Royal Commissions are not like trials in Courts of law, affecting the lives and liberties of. individuals. We are now asked to impose for civil offences penalties which in many cases are greater than those imposed for criminal offences. The trend of civilization' is in the direction of diminishing punishments, and there is ho brighter page in - our history than that which deals with the amelioration, of our criminal code. A distinction must be drawn between a Court of Inquiry, such as a Royal Commission, which : is investigating business methods and obtaining information as to industrial  business' generally; and Courts of law dealing : with penalties against person's and property.  It must not be considered that in trying to fit the penalties to the crimes we on this side wish to condone wrong-doing. The. man who knowingly makes false statements should be punished. We differ as to the amount of punishment which should be inflicted. </para>

                <para>If imprisonment is wrong, three days is! as bad as three years. The clause does, not compel the Judge to award five years.", imprisonment. He can award anything up to five years which he thinks the' offence deserves. The laws of Australia furnish us with ample precedent as to the length of term,. Section  330  of the Crimes Act of New South Wales provided that whoever, before any person authorized to administer an oath, wilfully makes, 011 oath, any false statement knowing the same to be false, shall, where such offence does not' amount in law to perjury', be liable 'to penal servitude for five years. Where perjury is committed, the offender is liable to penal servitude for fourteen years, so that on the whole we have made a very moderate provision. Section 124 of the Queensland Criminal Code provides a penalty of fourteen years for perjury, and section 126 provides a penalty of seven years for fabricating evidence. The crime is identical, whether committed before a Commission or a Court of law. We cannot permit perjury; we cannot permit false testimony which stops short of what the law calls perjury, although in effect it is perjury before Royal Commissions any more than before Courts of law. If the honorable member is against imprisonment altogether, that is a sound and logical position to take up, but it is an impossible one in a civilized community. The difference between three years and five years will in practice not be substantial, because in a great majority of cases the maximum penalty will not be imposed. In drawing up this Bill we had to be guided by some principle, and we cannot be guided by a sounder principle than that which is embodied in the criminal codes of the various States. </para>

                        <para>- False testimony in relation to what? In the case of the statute which the honorable member has just quoted, it is false testimony in relation to a heinous crime. In the case of Royal Commissions, it is false testimony only in relation to the formation of an opinion. A Royal Commission's work is merely an inquiry for the purpose of framing a policy, and therefore penalties which relate to the trial of a man for his life or for some crime against society cannot be put in the same category. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure the honorable member does, but I do not. I will not permit myself to be obsessed by any outside circumstances in considering this matter. I have to consider it as it will relate to Royal Commissions in general. Royal Commissions are useful institutions for the purpose of gaining information upon which this House may frame its policy and opinions, but their composition will always continue to be a composition that suits the passing party needs of the moment. There is no" complaint to be alleged against them for that, and they make their inquiries with all these limitations surrounding them and all these prejudices entering into their composition. The very nature of a Royal Commission differentiates the offence aimed at in this clause from the crimes with which the Attorney-General has sought to parallel it. I know that perjury is perjury whereever it may be committed; but perjury is something that has to be established by a Court. A man cited for perjury may not be guilty, except in a technical sense, of any attempt to perjure himself. Miscarriages of justice occur even in courts of law. </para>

                        <para>- No matter how technical the offence may be, the punishment must be imprisonment. Three years' imprisonment for this kind of crime is severe punishment, and will act just as much as a deterrent as would a five-year period.I am not against strong sentences, but the trend of our modern humanitarianism is all towards fitting the punishment to the crime. For an offence of this kind against a Royal Commission, three years' imprisonment would be a sufficient deterrent, and when the very purpose of the imposition of penalties has been satisfied, surely that is as far as we need go. </para>

In one case it was practically proved by documents within twenty-four hours from the time of its committal, and yet the Judge who was chairman of the Royal Commission in question had practically no power to take action to deal with the guilty witnesses. I have a vivid recollection of the way in which the work of that Commission was burked, and I know what it meant to the public of New </para>

                        <para>- I think that even the Opposition will recognise the necessity of making this legislation effective. When we adjourned for lunch I had in mind a case in which serious injustice was done to the country by men, who, knowing that no effective penalty could be imposed for misstatements made before a certain Commission, took the liberty of making statements which they knew to be untrue. They knew that they could not be punished, and they undermined the reputation of men giving evidence before the Commission in question, regardless of what the consequences might be. I trust the Attorney-General will see that the penalties for which this Bill provides are retained, not so much because they' are fully justified by what has happened in the past, but because of what we know we shall have to provide against in the future. </para>

                    <para>. - I proposed the amendment without making a speech, because I thought that the glaring discrepancy between this penalty and the penalties in the proposed new sections 6j and 6k would be so apparent that the case for a reduction needed no argument. A lower penalty is provided for what ir&gt; my opinion is an equally flagrant offence, if not a greater one. All these penalties are in consonance with the vindictive spirit that seems to permeate the whole Bill. Penalties should be sufficiently high to act as a deterrent; but there is no necessity to provide for punishments that are altogether excessive. The punishment should be made to fit the crime, and a discretionary power should be vested in the Court. The committal of perjury before a Royal Commission, though a very grave offence, may in its consequences to others be much less harmful than a like offence committed in a Court of law. I admit that such offences must undoubtedly be punished ; but the scale of punishment should not be conceived in a spirit of vindictiveness. This provision may have a boomerang effect. It may be more far-reaching than its promoters  anticipate. </para>

                <para class="block">That is always the case when we depart from the principles of equity and justice, and attempt to revenge ourselves on any section of the community. It is our duty so to legislate as to secure even justice between all sections. I would remind honorable members opposite that Royal Commissions to inquire into industrial matters may be hereafter appointed, and working men giving evidence before them may make statements which, upon subsequent' examination may be found to be at variance with actual facts, and they will be subject to these revengeful penalties as well as others. I hope that a more temperate spirit will prevail, and that honorable members will not be influenced by any desire to go to extremes. We must view this Bill in a calm judicial spirit; but in proposing to provide for five years' imprisonment for perjury committed before a Royal Commission, we are going beyond the bounds of reason. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the clause as it stands, mainly for the reason that I gave last night in criticising another penalty for which the Bill provides. It is a mistake to arbitrarily fix a minimum penalty, so as to take away from a judicial tribunal dealing with a case under the clause any discretionary power to determine what the punishment shall belt is wise, however, to make the maximum penalty in this case a very severe one. I was astonished to hear the honorable member for Lang speaking of the crime of wilful and corrupt perjury as a trivial indiscretion. </para>

                        <para>- There is no crime more rife in the community than wilful and corrupt perjury, and no crime strikes more seriously at the very roots of the tree of justice. We all know that the penalty in the proposed new section under consideration is the maximum, so that we are vesting in the Court a very wide discretion. I hope there will be no departure from the power which we are giving here to a Judge to impose a heavy penalty. It is suggested that this penalty is put forward in a spirit of vindictiveness - that there is a desire to penalize certain classes of the community who are supposed to be opposed to the party with which I am associated. There is no spirit of vindictiveness in the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree that anything in the nature of criminality ought to be severely punished; but I fail to understand in what way the efficacy of this Bill, if it has any efficacy, will be interfered with by reducing the penalty in this case from five to three years' imprisonment. My reading teaches me that Draconian penalties of any kind defeat the purpose for which they are intended. We can surely recognise a difference between an offence of the kind now under consideration committed before a Royal Commission and such an offence committed before a Court of justice. </para>

                        <para>- I hope to be able to show that there is. We know that Commissions are generally constituted with a political object in view. We have not to follow the Attorney-General to the days of King John and Magna Charta to discover that Royal Commissions are constituted sometimes on the most frivolous pretexts, and placed under the control of addle-pated idiots, possessed of a great sense of their own importance and cocksureness concerning the correctness of their convictions. Bring a man before such a  Chairman,  and a feeling of antagonism will be created in the mind of the witness that may lead him, sometimes smarting under a sense of injustice, to say something which might technically be regarded, if uttered in a Court of law, as perjury, but which, in view of all the circumstances of the Commission, should surely be taken as something less than that. I fail to see, as the honorable member for Gwydir has argued, that, by reducing the punishment in circumstances of such provocation to three, instead of five, years' imprisonment, the object of this Bill will be seriously interfered with. I trust that the generous, instincts of the Committee will lead them to bring the Bill into accord with the spirit of the age; and I am surprised to find the enlightened Labour party of Australia emulating the doings of the days of mediaeval ism which we thought we had left behind us. </para>

I am prepared to go so far with the Attorney-General. I think it dangerous, however, to render  a  man liable to imprisonment for five years for a misstatement made before a Royal Commission. What I think the honorable member for Parramatta desired to impress upon the Committee was, that this provision is to apply to an offence committed before a Royal Commission, and that in nearly every case a string of questions as to " what is your opinion " is put to a witness before such a body. </para>

                        <para>- I know that ; and it is for that reason that I do not think there will be many prosecutions for perjury in connexion with Royal Commissions. The Government are proposing to mix up matters that ought not to be the subject of these penalties with matters that ought to be. In nine cases out of ten, questions put to a witness before a Royal Commission relate to opinions as well as to facts. In the Excise Procedure Act there is no penalty for perjury, nor is there any provided under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, although I think that, in the case <inline font-style="italic">df</inline> the Arbitration Court, the law of the States would apply to perjury committed before it. It is significant, however, that, in setting up a somewhat analogous body in connexion with Excise procedure, we have l.ot provided for prosecutions for perjury. I do not feel inclined to strongly object to the proposed maximum of five years' imprisonment in this case, because the general run of penalties for perjury is from seven to fifteen years' imprisonment. There is, of course, an opening for a legitimate  difference of opinion as to the extent of the penalty, and we are entitled to ask ourselves whether it is not dangerous to allow prosecutions for perjury to be initiated in connexion with mere inquiries by Royal Commissions as to matters of opinion, as well as- of fact.  Leading questions are often put to a witness. I know that, in connexion with Commissions of which I have been a member, a number of questions have been written out in advance, and" witnesses have been asked, " Do you think that so-and-so is the case?" Leading questions are put, and a statement of the question is accepted or rejected by the witness with the words "Yes" or " No." The statement of fact contained in the question is often accepted by the witness, and put down as his evidence. I fully recognise that, where there is any attempt to evade the scope of an inquiry, either by perjury or misstatement, the punishment should <inline font-style="italic">h*</inline> adequate. </para>

                    <para>. - It appears to me that while everybody is in favour of a heavy penalty in case of deliberate perjury or false testimony, there is some idea that telling lies before a Royal Commission is a less heinous crime than telling lies in a Court of law. I do not agree with that idea for one moment ; a lie is always a lie, and a lie in relation to a material fact ought to be punished severely. What is the utility of a Royal Commission of inquiry if it is undermined by a premium on lies? The honorable member for Angas attempted to draw a distinction between lies told before a Royal Commission and lies told in a Court of law ; but I again remind honorable members that, according to the Parliamentary Witnesses Bill introduced by the honorable member's colleague, the honorable member for Darling Downs, a punishment of five years awaits any one who wilfully gives false evidence before a Select Committee. The offence is the same, and it is proposed to punish it in the same way. Even in the Bankruptcy Court, where a man may be charged with offences which are certainly not regarded as crimes, three years is the least imprisonment for refusing to disclose his most private affairs, or for carrying on business before he gets a certificate. </para>

                    (Ballarat) [2.36I.-  The Attorney-General is entirely mistaken iri; regard to what was said by the honorable. member for Angas. That honorable mem- . ber reminded us that an examination before a Royal Commission differs materially from the usual examination in a Court of law. Of course, it does. Before Royal Com-, missions questions relate, for the most part, to matters more or less of opinion; they are rarely, in the same manner and in the same form as in a Law Court, direct questions of fact ; and consequently, on the whole, the proceedings offer a much more, confused field in which to find proof of' perjury or deliberate misstatement.
                </para>
                <para>The honorable member further said that, in regard to matters of fact, the circumstances being the same, the same accuracy was called for; in that I cordially agree. One can imagine cases in which a term of five years, although high, is by no means too high for a flagrant breach of the truth. The consideration which weighs with me is that to which the Attorney-General himself referred - that is, the importance and value of Royal Commissions. But if truthfulness is abandoned a Royal Commission becomes worse than useless, it is absolutely misleading; hence we need the absolute assurances of truth required elsewhere. This is not a matter of theory, we require them for good, sound, everyday reasons in all; matters of actuality; we must have Royal Commissions, and the evidence must be within the bounds of truth to be of any: service. </para>
                <para>Personally it seems to me unnecessary to alter the proposal in view of the fact that five years is the maximum. The honorable member for Lang and those who follow him are pursued by an apprehension that the fixing of five years as a maximum will, in some mysterious way, increase the penalties for minor offences. There is no ground for any such apprehension, especi-' ally when we remember that the penalty will be imposed by a judicial officer accustomed to weigh evidence. Supposing a Royal Commission had to decide on its own account if perjury had been committed, and to impose penalties, I should hesitate before assenting to a maximum punishment of five years ; as the circumstances are, I cannot see that five years is too high. The-  apprehensions of my honorable friends are perfectly genuine, but they would soon be removed if they had enjoyed or suffered the same measure of legal experience as some of us. ' Having been members of Royal Commissions as well as participants in the proceedings of the Law Courts, we realize to the full the value of truth to the. whole community, indispensable in all public inquiries and public affairs ; as something on which all our operations depend in our work-a-day life. I do not say there is now any greater or growing laxity ; but we must realize the fact that there are certain dispositions and characters - dispositions more emotional than intellectual,  or  more intent on some purpose they believe to be good, than on adhering to the truth as the best basis, and only basis, of public action - which, without malignant intention, are capable of making seriously and dangerously misleading statements. Persons of that kind require to be sobered, and brought to a sense of responsibility, as well as intentional perjurers. The value of a maximum of five years does not imply that it will often need to be imposed, but in the knowledge of the fact that it is capable of being imposed. This will steady and sober that class of flighty and reckless witnesses with whom we have occasionally to deal. I see no undue cruelty or oppression in this penalty upon deliberate liars, and believe that it is better the maximum penalty should assume such proportions as to exercise a sobering influence than that out of well-meant pitifulness the penalty Should be made lower, and thus rendered less effective upon those whom only the fear of punishment will keep within the bounds of truth. </para>

                    <para>.- I have had experience of two cases of perjury. One was a case in which a wealthy man, who is now dead, and whose name I shall not mention, was known to be undoubtedly guilty  of  this offence. He had sworn that some property belonged to his wife, and when she died he swore that the property had not been transferred, or that he had not received proper consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Wrixon, when challenged in the State House about it, had to admit that the man was clearly guilty. Yet that man, simply because he was wealthy, was never arrested, and never received any punishment. There was another case, in which nearly every witness was guilty of perjury, but they were convicted  of  that offence, and -one, </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I think, of the offence of conspiracy also.  That case has given rise to a widespread idea throughout Victoria that perjury, backed up by money, is more rife in this State than it has ever been. I wonder why certain members opposite should desire to reduce the penalty in view of these facts? In this most infamous case which ever sullied the annals of our Courts, no one was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, and such a term would be rarely imposed. </para>

                    <para>.- I am inclined to agree with the honorable member for Ballarat, that a maximum penalty of five years may have a sobering and deterrent effect on certain people, who might otherwise be inclined to. commit perjury. I am' not, however, in favour of excessive penalties being inflicted, and, as a matter of fact, they are not often inflicted. i cannot call to mind a case of perjury in which a sentence of five years has been passed. There is no doubt that perjury is very often committed, and a high maximum penalty may be productive of some good. There are. complaints from all over the world by Judges of the prevalence of this offence, and  1  should leave the maximum penalty at five years, in order to be able to meet any specially gross case which may arise., I suggest that the Attorney-General might insert a clause to impose five years' imprisonment on some members of this House, who go about the country committing perjury and libelling other people. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta)  "2.52].-  I desire to move an amendment to proposed section 6j, to increase the penalty ?o five years, and thus make it consistent with the decision just arrived at. A man who tries to get another to make a false statement is, surely, equally guilty with the man who makes the false statement. It is proposed to impose excessive penalties for statements made concerning matters which arise out of the clash of opinion - statements made, not deliberately or in cold blood, but under excitement, and under the provocation of examination by Commissioners, who ask leading questions in order to obtain certain answers desired. I distinguish between such cases as those, and cases in a Court of law, where a man, with legal assistance available, wilfully perjure:-;, himself. The honorable member for Ballarat suggested that we had to deal with, light and airy gentlemen, who go about making reckless and false statements, but,, really, what we have to provide for is the case of a man who, brought before a partisan Royal Commission, is baited with some specific object in view, and in a moment of excitement brings himself within' the pale of the law. I see a great distinction.

The honorable member for Parramatta assumes the extraordinary position that a person who makes an untrue statement when he has not been sworn is in the same position ss the man who takes the Bible in his hand and deliberately swears to what he knows is not true. He has sustained the same position in previous remarks. If there is no difference, the use of bibles for the swearing of witnesses might as well be abolished, an extraordinary step for the honorable member to support. </para>

This is not the first time that he has adopted such tactics. </para>

It must be remembered that a Royal Commission is not, like a Bench, constituted of men who hold their positions subject only to the possibility of removal for misbehaviour on the address of both Houses of a Parliament, and who are affected by the restraining influence and <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps</inline> that always attaches to continuous bodies.

One of the wholesomest things that can be brought to bear on Parliament, or even a judicial tribunal, is proper criticism, so long as it does not tend to interfere with the course of justice or the public interest.. </para>

In my opinion, we are dealing with the non-essential in the proposed amendment, and I do mot know why it should be accepted by the Attorney-General, seeing that the words in the clause are those in the Arbitration Act. Of course, by the Arbitration Act, it is a Judge, acting in his judicial capacity, who is concerned,  but he cannot imprison except for contempt, which' must be contempt within the meaning of the Privy Council's decision, and the. fine is <inline font-style="italic">£zoo.</inline> The words which the honorable member for South Sydney proposes, to' insert have no effect, because the protection which he wishes to give is already given by the common law.

                        <para>- Yes ; but if the criticism of a Commission were such as not to obstruct the Commission's investigation, it should not be considered contempt. It is very dangerous to make a man the judge of defamation in his own case. </para>

Supreme Court, or a District Court, he can deal with the contempt at once, and inflict the penalty provided for. This is a suspension of trial by jury. Are honorable members prepared to agree to that? Members of Commissions are only appointed for certain inquiries; they do not hold their positions permanently. Even a Judge may not be perfectly conversant with the methods of eliciting evidence by the investigation of a Commission.  I again protest against the severe penalties in the Bill in regard to the criticism of a body which is not a' judicial tribunal. </para>

                    <para>. - The arguments of the honorable member for Angas have been directed against the clause as a whole. Whatever doubt there may be as to criticism outside, I think that a Royal Commission ought to have the right to commit for contempt in the face of the Commission. " It is entirely impossible for a Commission to carry on its business if it is liable to open and deliberate insult. Every Court, every Select Committee, every body of  inquiry, if its inquiry is going to be anything more than farcical, must have power to secure order, and' to punish those who deliberately flout its authority. The honorable member for Angas has sought to draw a distinction between a Royal Commission and an ordinary legal tribunal in this case, as in others. But in Commissions of inquiry not less than in legal tri.bunals the first essential condition to their very existence must be the power to carry on their proceedings in an orderly fashion, uninterrupted by insult or foolish' or deliberate attempts to disturb them. It is asserted that this clause attempts to stifle criticism. I do not think so. I. do not wish to stifle criticism, but there 'is  a  clear -distinction to be drawn between criticism and abuse. Surely it will not be contended, for instance, that an article appearing in to-day's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is criticism. What is it but abuse? It is simply an attempt to belittle both the fountain from which Royal Commissions spring - the Parliament and the Crown - the <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> and the proceedings of Royal Commissions. That is  not criticism any more than abuse of parliamentary institutions is criticism of them. Every one should welcome criticism ; but I do not think that any one will say that personal abuse of the members of Royal Commissions ought- to be permitted. While we believe in criticism, plain, outright defamation ought not to be permitted. </para>

                <para>It is provided in this Bill that committal by the Court for contempt in the face of it can be exercised by a Commission only when the  Chairman  is a Judge. In all other cases, the charge of contempt is to be heard by an ordinary Court of law.

It has been held recently, however, that criticism of a Court is not necessarily contempt of Court. There must be an interference with the administration of justice. The Chief Justice, in <inline font-style="italic">The King</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Nicholls,</inline> laid it' down that criticism, even going to the extent of bringing the High Court into disrepute, is not contempt of Court. It is not sufficient even to charge the Court with lack of impartiality.

                <para class="block">Justice of the High Court sitting as  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. I am, therefore, in favour of striking out the words " bring the Royal Commission into disrepute " ; but I do most emphatically say that Royal Commissions must be protected, both from contempt in the face of the Court, and contempt and defamation by so-called criticism outside the Court. There is no attempt in this Bill to stifle proper criticism. Criticism may surely be detached from personalities. The High Court itself, subject to its great power to commit for contempt committed outside the Court, has no greater protection than Royal Commissions would have, or ought to have. It appears to me that this provision to. protect (Commissions against defamation is very necessary. A member' of a Royal Commission, as an individual, has ample protection from defamation under the ordinary laws of the country. As an individual, you may not defame him, whether you defame him falsely or not;, but a Commission is a public body appointed for a public purpose, and criticism-, is a public weapon, and a weapon very necessary in democratic communities. It is essential that criticism should be free, and that there should be upon it no limitations other than are imposed by the ordinary decencies of civilized debate, which experience has shown to be absolutely necessary. But there should be no indulgence in personalities, and no imputation of motives. If an imputation- of motives is made, it should be well founded, and any defamation falsely made ought to be punishable. Beyond that, the clause, as amended by the honorable member for Denison, I think will not go. </para>

                    <para>.-^ I trust that the Attorney-General will seriously consider this amendment before he agrees to accept it. It is necessary that Commissions should be given full power to perform their duties and functions, arid anything calculated to obstruct them in their task of getting at the actual facts which they are commissioned to ascertain is to be condemned. That being so, any one who, in the face of such a tribunal, tries to interfere with its proceedings, ought to be subject to punishment. Any one who tries to impede a Royal Commission in its action sought to be punished. According to the decisions of the Courts, Colonial Parliaments can expel persons who are interfering with their proceedings; but their powers to go beyond that and interfere with persons outside are limited. The Attorney-General knows -of the recent case defining the limitations of the Parliament. The power to punish for contempt is a power to preserve order and to control the proper conduct of the proceedings of Royal Commissions. But what does the Attorney-General propose to do by accepting this amendment? He proposes that Royal Commissions shall have power to control proceedings altogether outside those tribunals. Because one or two members of a Commission may be subjected to criticism, and may resent it, we are going to provide this extraordinary protection for Royal Commissions - a protection that is not accorded to any Court of law. Why should a Royal Commission have higher privileges and greater immunities than a Court of law has? </para>

                    <para>With regard to what Lord Hardwicke, L.C., characterized as " scandalizing a Court or a Judge," it was pointed out by my brother O'Connor that in <inline font-style="italic">McLeod</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">St. Aubyn</inline> (2) Lord Morris stated that prosecutions for that class of contempt .ire practically obsolete in England. The article in question in <inline font-style="italic">Reg.</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Gray</inline> (3)  was of a very gross character, and the case might very well have been put under the other heading. In one sense, no doubt, every defamatory publication concerning a Judge may be said to bring him into contempt as that term is used in the law of libel, but it does not follow that everything said of a Judge calculated to bring him into contempt in that sense amounts to contempt of Court. </para>

                        <para>- In that respect, the Government are putting Royal Commissions in a position different from that occupied by the High Court. I say that that is excessive. Let us realize what we are doing. A Royal Commission may be appointed to inquire into the matters which are the subject of heated political controversy. . Men whose interests are, in their opinion, affected, may in the heat of political passion make statements which they would not think of using in their calmer moments. Our judicial tribunals, sitting in a. cooler atmosphere, have the common sense to take those facts into consideration when a case is brought before them. They say, "In a matter of this kind, what we have to remember is that men engaged in controversy, when passion is up, use words which would never be employed at other times. That is a factor, which ought to be taken into consideration." But under this Bill a purely political Commission may -be appointed, and because men in the heat of passion may say things reflecting on that political body they may be cited for contempt. Does the Attorney-General say that a single Commission which has been appointed since the inauguration of Federation has been hampered in the transaction of its duties simply because defamatory statements were made about it </para>

But as to all such matters it should be open to criticism. To resent criticism indicates a sensitiveness which it is not wise for us to display. The honorable member for New England has said that this House is free to criticise anything it likes. Of course it is. But a Royal Commission is not always constituted of members of this House. Frequently persons outside are appointed. </para>

I am asking honorable members to recollect that we are creating a tribunal and endowing it with great powers. It is going to become a part of the permanent machinery of our government. It will remain there till a time when honorable members opposite may not be in power. The weapon they are forging will pass into other hands which they may have reason to regret. When we legislate we ought always to observe the principle that we should not put upon the statute-book measures simply because we want to attain some present political object, but should always have .the future in view. We are not doing that in this instance. We are now endowing Commissions with powers and privileges which are not absolutely essential for the purpose in view. The effect of this amendment must be to prevent that honest, fair, and just criticism which is all for the good of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- I welcome the opportunity to see embodied in the statute-book of this country some power that would limit the pernicious influence which has been used against institutions that have been brought into existence by the action of this Parliament. As far as the clause under discussion is concerned, I admit that I do not altogether agree with it. It does not go far enough for me. I would make the terms . used "either defamatory or false," instead of "false and defamatory." I speak with some experience in these matters. There has never been a case where the utility of provisions of this kind was illustrated more clearly than in the instance of the Commission appointed by the honorable member for Ballarat when he was Prime Minister. That Commission, of which I was a member, was hunted day after day, and week after week, by the press of this country. It was calumniated, libelled, and misrepresented morning, afternoon, and night. Men were paid to produce articles writing it down, and bringing it into disrepute and disrespect. These articles were circulated throughout the country districts with the object of prejudicing the minds of those who might be called as witnesses. They were published wherever some country newspaper could be induced to print them. Extracts from them have been kept by members of the Commission. The honorable member for Darling Downs has alleged that the Government are attempting to suborn some one by means of this Bill. I say that the action of the press at that time had such effect that people were afraid to give evidence. Many persons were so impressed with the continuous attacks of the press in all the States that they came to the conclusion that the Commission was a dead letter, and gave up preparing their statements which they intended to make as evidence. In New South Wales, witnesses, in consequence of press criticism, came to the conclusion that the Commission could not possibly complete its work, and was never intended to complete it. Not only so, but a sort of intimidation was used. It was falsely represented that  members of the Commission were men who had no respect for their fellow men. Witnesses were led to believe that persons who were examined by the Commission were regularly brow-beaten and bullied. It was not true, but the reports were circulated to such an extent that witnesses hesitated to come forward from the fear that they themselves would be so treated. Many of the witnesses afterwards admitted that the reports in the press were calumnies upon the body that had the duty and opportunity of examining them. I admit that such things may never happen again in our history. It is scarcely likely that another Commission will be appointed as was that one by a Government which never intended that it should do any work, and which tried to bring it to an end before it had completed its task. Such a state of things can only be met by creating some power to bring those persons before some tribunal, and inculcate in them some respect for public bodies created to carry out great public duties. We shall, doubtless, have more Royal Commissions than in the past, because, as industrial and commercial life becomes more complex, more inquiry will be necessary ; and some protection must be provid'ed in order that Royal Commissioners may fearlessly perform their duty. I cannot see that the proposed amendment will, in any sense of the word, impede the functions of a Royal Commission. </para>

                    <para>.- Almost the whole of this clause is unnecessary, and most of it injurious. Only the first part is strictly before us ; but, in order to save time, taking the clause as a whole, the second part appears to. me decidedly more objectionable and open to misuse. If it be necessary To protect Royal Commissions against wilful insult or disturbance - against the _ use of insulting language  -  I do not think honorable members would offer any objection ; in fact, if that be necessary, it is desirable that such conduct should be punishable. But, even there, the language of the clause appears ambiguous. For instance, any person who uses any insulting language towards a Royal Commission is to be liable.

The next part aims, and is, apparently, intended to aim, directly at all outside criticism of a hostile character. No matter how well based, how justifiable on principle, how sincere on the part of the critic, or whether in accordance with views always expressed by a person or a newspaper, the effect is to abolish any adverse criticism of a Royal Commission. </para>

                        <para>- No violence of language ought to be encouraged ; but, on the other hand, we all know that a man who feels or thinks strongly is apt to speak strongly. In a community which preserves individuality, and cherishes independence of opinion, it is better to endure some extravagance than to shut the mouths of all who criticise. If we wish to close the mouths of aggressive critics, we should close our own ; and debate would then resolve itself into a mild, benevolent, tea-table proceeding. Such a state of things", however, is not likely to occur in a country with a warm-blooded people like the Australians. </para>

                <para>We all regret our own, and especially other people's, indulgence in violent language; but practically that is an indispensable concomitant of a full and frank discussion of any stirring question. A good deal of language going beyond wisdom and moderation is sincerely used by men strongly convinced of the opinions they express, however erroneous their ideas may seem. This clause also appears to me to promise a series of operations which will not stand to the credit of Royal Commissions in general, or of those who may come into conflict with them. I fear that we shall have no great diminution in the heat, intensity, or force of political comments by either one side or the other. In this country, as in most countries, except New Zealand for a long term of years, there are frequent changes in the colour and opinions of those who occupy the Ministerial benches, and marked changes in the growth and development of the opinions of the people. That being the case, we are confronted by the necessities of some expressing those opinions and others criticising their soundness and applicability to our conditions. If we take away all possibility of those opinions being discussed by men of strong  convictions and of strong feeling, as they will insist on discussing them, we shall be brought to an anaemic political condition such as we have not yet experienced, or are likely to experience, in Australia. I admit that all parties indulge more or less in excesses which it would be well to cure, but this clause, the words of which are extreme, will have the effect of crippling even well-merited censure. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, but this will still mean that not only the press of the country without exception or qualification, but the public without exception or qualification, in Parliament or out of it, will be subject to prosecution and punishment if they use language which is afterwards thought to be false or defamatory. By a mere process of prosecutions you may seriously and gravely limit the freedom of criticism hitherto enjoyed by this community, which, in the hands of newspapers not willing to run the risk of paying costs, even if they escaped punishment, would seriously detract from that full current of enthusiasm which we certainly desire to control, but not altogether to diminish or check. </para>

                        <para>- If it is proved to be false and defamatory in any degree. The comment may have been false, although the man who wrote or uttered it sincerely believed it to be true at the time ; and it may have been defamatory, although, with his information or want of information, it may mot have been defamatory in his intention at the time he uttered it. These words stand absolutely, and carry all these consequences. Even sub-clause 1 is, I venture to submit, unjustifiable unless it be amended in the manner which I have briefly indicated. Sub-clause 2, I have the temerity to say, is in no circumstances justifiable. Although the offences under the provision are committed in the face of the Commission, and although I consider it a perfectly legitimate thing for the  Chairman  of the Commission to have the power to deal with any such offence by way of referring it to another and independent tribunal for its adjudication, I do not think that justifies our making him a judge in his own cause. That is a very unwise departure from sound precedents. </para>

                        <para>- The point is that it should be given to another Judge, not to the same Judge. If there had been any such offence to a Commission or its Chairman the latter should have the power to commit the offender, but the question of the contempt and the punishment, if any required to be meted out, should be determined by another Judge. Very few, if any, Royal Commissions can be conducted by the same methods as a Court of law. They are constantly going far outside its province. </para>

                        <para>- There are many distinctions between any Court of law, even the widest in its jurisdiction, and a Commission which is free to traverse the whole universe, to look at its issues from any point of view. The bulk of its members are without judicial experience, are perfectly free to raise any issues they like, to pursue them in any way. They are not bound by the rules of evidence, or guided by long experience of men and methods. They will constantly provoke, or, at all events, not discourage, attitudes and criticisms on the part of witnesses who do not fully realize the responsibility of the position which the Commissioners occupy. It does not follow that every brush or breeze between a witness and a Commissioner ought to be treated as an offence committed in the face of the Commission, and, certainly, if it did, it ought not to be dealt with by any Judge presiding over the Commission as he would deal with such a matter in the harmonious and orderly sanctity of his own Court. </para>

                <para>The difference in the two spheres is enormous. Even in the very Commission which is in every one's mind, and to which these provisions are particularly intended to apply, there was a case recently when the  Chairman  felt it necessary to offer an apology to the Court for certain language which he had used. That distinguished gentleman has occupied a seat on the Bench of the Supreme Court of a State for many years. Never before in the course of his experience, I believe, has he been induced to use in his Courts a single word which he desired to recall. I use that illustration because it emphasizes the entire difference of atmosphere, of methods and surroundings, before a Commission, compared with the awe due to the responsibility which all men feel who are associated with that solemn transaction of proceedings traditionally sanctioned for the administration of justice in a Court of law. You cannot make a Commission a Court of law by this clause  you cannot create the atmosphere; you cannot induce the deference which is paid in their official character to Judges, and those associated with them in the administration of the law, even if claimed outside by the same men. It is well known that the formalities, the wig and gown, which seem to so many persons idle trappings, count for a great deal in preserving order and good behaviour in Court. It is because Royal Commissions are not, and cannot be, turned into Courts of law that the proposition which certainly ought not to be made in regard to this particular tribunal appears in the second part of this clause. </para>
                <para>I hope that we shall take a division on each of these proposals, but it is especially on the second part that I appeal to honorable members. The liberty of the press is, I freely admit, exercised with great licence in some British communities; but in spite of complaints which public men have to make of the Australian press - and the complaints made by men on both sides of the House in regard to newspapers opposed to them, are made very often, it seems to me, with good reason - I hesitate even to attempt to cure, for this is -only an attempt to cure, that undue severity and partiality of criticism which we too often regret by the sacrifice of that liberty. We Should enable men who feel strongly and honestly to speak strongly their honest opinions through the press, or any other channel open to them.. I say most distinctly and emphatically that it is better to bear the abuses of the liberty of the press than to sacrifice its independent criticism. The first to discover the extent of the sacrifice will be those who are now pleading for the closing down of sluice valves which, although they are opened sometimes unwisely, and not for the clearest water, yet, on the whole, are very often of high value for cleansing purposes in relation to our public life and its varied procedures. </para>
                <para>There is a great deal more to be said on this head, but I shall not detain honorable members, except to point out that a portion of the remarks of the honorable member for Gwydir seemed to me in one sense to require me to call his attention to the facts. I will accept for the purposes of this argument, all the statements he made, although I think that some of them were very highly coloured in regard to the appointment of the Postal Commission, and! the severity of the criticism to which it was exposed. I will even accept for the purposes of the argument his statement as to the unfairness of the criticism directed' against himself and others. He pointed to&gt; this, and demanded its suppression as injurious. On what ground ? Has not every recommendation by the Commission assailed* which could be practically dealt with ire the opinion of the Ministry of the day been dealt with as he desired? Is he not aware that more than three-fourths of the recommendations of the Postal Commission have already obtained indorsement? Has he not therefore gained, and is he not in the way to gain the actualization of the whole of the recommendations, so far as practicable? What, then, has he to complain of, even if he had to face a fierce, or even an unfair, fire of criticism? He has his party with him; he has had Parliament with him legislating in the direction he desired. The cardinal facts on which he relied to prove the notorious abuses and losses occasioned by press criticisms pushed to an extreme only go to show that they had no effect, except possibly to delay the matter by some months or, it may be, a year. He completely disproves his whole case against adverse criticism. We have nothing to fear in this House, and no party has anything to fear when it has a good cause. The suppression of criticism, or the checking of the free expression of public opinion, would create  a-.  tepid and twilight atmosphere, in which criticism in chains would diminish the public interest, already too dull. Under its constraint advance will not be as rapid as under existing circumstances. The present system has its defects, which should be tactfully corrected, but let us not, in the attempt to abolish these, plunge into a worse condition of torpor. </para>

                    <para>.- The anxiety of honorable members to safeguard the interests of wealthy corporations likely to be brought before Royal Commissions is extraordinary. By this clause we aim at preventing the pollution of the press by the wealth of the country. A few months ago large sums of money were spent in this way with the object of misleading the people. In six big Sydney newspapers a full page was devoted to what purported to be a letter, commencing " To the Editor, Sir," and signed, but this statement had been paid for by the inch, as an advertisement, by interested parties. At the same time, leading articles were published supporting the statements made in this letter, and leading articles in the </para>

                    and

                    on the same day were practically to the same effect. There was' also a column of "points" published in the same six papers. These advertisements cost at least £1,000.I understand that similar advertising was done in all the State capitals, so that the total expenditure, if it were all on the same scale, must have been at least , £5,000. One newspaper, I believe - the Melbourne
                    <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>
                    - took an honorable stand in refusing to publish the statement for which money was offered, but it was the only prominent newspaper in Australia that did so. We have heard something of the American methods. In America many thousands of pounds are spent by the trusts and combines in influencing the press, and buying up the columns of the newspapers, or keeping out of the newspapers the statements made before Commissions of Inquiry, so that the public may be misled, or left in ignorance of the facts. If necessary, the wealthy interests in America go to the length of buying up newspapers to secure their ends. Now that we are faced with a similar position in Australia, we find the Opposition fighting with its back to the wall against a clause for the protection of the public interests.

It seems to me that this amendment will mean that a prosecution will have to be instituted in every case in order to determine whether the books and papers that have been withheld are material to the inquiry. This is an unnecessary limitation, and certainly will not, improve the Bill. " </para>

                    <para>. - I wish only to say that the proposed new clause will do. no more than put the law info form. It. will not alter it. No person can be prosecuted for not producing books that are not relevant to the inquiry; and this proposed new clause simply sets forth that fact in plain terms, so that every person in the country will know exactly where he stands. Books must be produced when called for, and the onus will be on the witness to show that they are not relevant. </para>
