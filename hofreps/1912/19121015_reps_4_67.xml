          <para>. - Since the House last met an appalling accident has taken place in a neighbouring State, which, I think, deserves mention in this House, so that we may extend our sympathy to those who have unfortunately suffered, and to those relatives who are bereaved, and at the .same time express the hope that the heroic efforts made by those who have escaped may lead to the rescue of the many men now believed to be alive in the Mount Lyell mine. As a miner myself  I  think I understand the circumstances as well as any one, and I can only say that, if human skill and endurance can effect a rescue it will be effected. The latest information is that the modern equipment asked for to enable the rescuers to achieve their purpose in the most speedy way possible has arrived, and the mining company hope that good results will follow almost immediately. I hope that their highest expectations may be realized ; and it only remains for me to express again, on behalf of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and, I am sure, every member of the Federal Parliament, under the dire circumstances, our sympathy and best wishes. </para>

          <para>. - I  join with the Prime Minister in an expression of our deep concern at the unfortunate occurrence in the neighbouring State. From a long experience I, like the Prime Minister, know just what this occurrence means. It seems, somehow, as if in spite of all that modern science and ingenuity can contrive, these mysterious happenings still come like a bolt from the blue and leave us all aghast. Out of the &#39;gloom of the surroundings we are glad to see these bright gleams of heroism in the efforts which are being made to rescue those who are unfortunate enough to be entombed. It makes us proud of our race to find men from day to day glad to brave all dangers, even to the sacrifice of their own lives, if only they may rescue alive some of those below. I join the Prime Minister in the very earnest hope that those now entombed may all be found alive, and eventually restored to their families - their hearths and homes. In the meantime, we express the deepest sympathy with those who are bereft and those who suffer ; and we can only hope that a kind Providence may assuage their grief and soften the blow which has come so suddenly upon them. </para>

My son, who is only a messenger ic the local Telegraph Office, has invented a contrivance that, if attached to the pillar boxes now in use, will make them safe against such robberies as have recently taken place. The lad is anxious to bring it directly under the notice of the honorable the Minister. I shall be much indebted to you if you ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Frazer</inline> to grant me an interview, when it suits his convenience, in order  that I maV explain the nature of the invention for his information.

Is the honorable gentleman aware, in the first place, that large increases of salaries for the higher officials in the postal service are to be paid from the beginning of the current financial year, whilst the lower paid staff have been told to go to the Arbitration Court? Some sections have gone to the Arbitration Court, and the Court has now been put off for six weeks. Their case will not be considered probably until the beginning of next year. Does the Postmaster-Genera! propose, in the circumstances, to make any compensation to the lower paid men in his Department ? </para>

              <para>- In reply to my honorable friend&#39;s series of questions, I have to say that it is true that some of the officials have been put down on the Estimates for increases of salary, and if Parliament approves, they will be paid the increased salaries as from the 1st July. The General Division Association of the Post and Telegraph Department have at present two cases before the Arbitration Court. One case, that of the postal mechanicians, has been partly heard. In connexion with that case, I gave the employes an .assurance when they were going to the Court that, in  4220 <inline font-style="italic">Personal</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Explanations</inline> the event of undue delay in the hearing of the case, or the giving of the decision upon it, I would see that the award should date hack in order to meet any loss caused by . reason of the delay. Every other case, as it arises, will be dealt with on its merits, but it is my personal view that it is a fair thing to ask Parliament to recognise any undue delay from which officers of the General Division may suffer in securing a decision from the Arbitration Court. </para>

I had intended to move an amendment immediately the amendment of the honorable member for Swan had been disposed of, but, owing to the confusion which existed  4222 <inline font-style="italic">Navigation</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill</inline> in the Chamber, and to the fact that I was intercepted in attempting to cross from one side of it to the other, I did not hear you, sir, put the question, &#34; That the clause as amended be agreed to.&#34; </para>

When we come to clause 5A, which will practically take the place of clause  286,  with the exception of the proviso, he will have ample opportunity of moving the amendment whichbe desired to submit.

          <para>. - The reasons for the proposed amendments in this clause were set out by the Attorney-General in the speech which he delivered when dealing with the question of licences, during the debate on this part of the Bill generally. Whereas the clause, in the form in which it was drafted, provided that only foreign ships should be required to take out a licence, we seek to provide in its amended form that all ships - British, -foreign, and Australian registered - shall take out a licence. That circumstance will entail no new liability on British and Australian ships. The necessity to pay Australian rates of wages will&#39; be dealt with in clause  289,  and the obligation to provide accommodation on the prescribed scale has already been dealt with in clauses  135  and  136.  The duty of carrying officers in accordance with the prescribed scale was dealt with in clauses  11  and  41.  Under the clause, as it is proposed to amend1 it, the Minister may require security that the conditions of the licence and of Part VI. of the Bill will be complied with. The provision follows exactly the lines of a section in the Customs Act, and will insure, especially in the case of tramp steamers which have no owners, and no responsible-. representatives, in Australia, the recovery -of any penalties to which they may be liable by reason of a contravention of &#60;the coastal trade provisions of the Bill. The clause, in its amended form, will place -all ships upon an equality, and will compel them to take out a licence if they engage in the coastal trade. </para>

            <para>- The Minister is taking unto himself a new power, namely, the power of prohibiting vessels from engaging in the coastal trade, because, impliedly, he can revoke their licences if they fail to fulfil any of the conditions imposed in connexion with that trade. In the case of oversea vessels, he is justified in taking to himself that power, because they necessarily pass out of our jurisdiction, but I ask the Minister to seriously consider whether there is any necessity for this requirement in regard to locally-owned vessels. The local vessels, for instance, have to fulfil the wages conditions imposed by awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, or by agreements filed with the Court, and the Minister is therefore secured to that extent. I fail to see why we should require Ahem to take out a licence. </para>

            <para>- I think it becomes something more,  because failure to comply with the formality would give the Minister power to refuse a licence and to lay up a boat. I should like the Minister to give us some reason for this departure from the original Bill, and to explain why it is desirable to apply this provision to limitedtrade and Inter-State trading boats? I can understand its application to foreign ships, because a ship owned by a foreign company, having no assets here, might engage in the Inter-State trade, set the Minister at defiance, and leave our jurisdiction, so that the Minister could not deal with it until it returned again. </para>

          <para>- - The first reason is that it is far better to compel our own people to do precisely what we compel the British and the foreigner to do. As a matter of fact, licences are issued to-day. In every port in Australia, I think, boats are to be seen bearing numbers which indicate that they are licensed for that particular port. I admit that the licence required in this case will&#39; go further, but I do not think that the honorable member for Darling Downs need have any fear that, under this clause, we would compel local shipowners, for example, to deposit a considerable sum of money as a guarantee that they would observe the conditions of the licence. In the case of foreign shipowners, however, we should require some guarantee, because their vessels, after trading here, might leave our jurisdiction.  We  shall be on sound ground if we compel our own people to do precisely what we compel others to do, and I believe that the clause, as drafted, is infinitely superior to that which it has replaced. I would remind honorable members that we have already exempted from these provisions vessels of less than  50  tons burthen. We do not enforce the manning or accommodation scales in their case. Very early in our consideration of the Bill I proceeded to exempt river and bay boats from these provisions, and if any case of the kind has been overlooked, I intend to recommit the clauses affected with a view of dealing with them in the same way. There will not be the same necessity for local ship-owners to provide security as there will be in the case of vessels not owned here, and having no responsible local representatives. </para>

          <para>.- I cannot see any justification for the refusal of the Minister to limit this provision to foreign ships. The Attorney-General, in referring to the clause, urged that, in view of our treaty rights, there should be no differentiation as against foreigners. He thought that the difficulty in that regard would be overcome by framing this clause in general terms so that it would be applicable to all British ships, including those on our own register, and also to foreign ships. That is not necessary for our purpose. I remember at the time declaring that the question of differentiation against foreigners will depend, not upon the mechanical striking out of the words &#34; foreign ship,&#34; but upon the refusal of the Minister in the exercise of the arbitrary power given under this clause to grant a licence to a foreign ship. It. has been slated that there are only a few treaty nations affected, namely, Austria, Egypt, Greece, Honduras, Salvador, and Mexico. Their objection to differentiation will arise, not from the inclusion of the words &#34; foreign ship,&#34; but from the actual refusal of a licence. The real reason given for this alteration is that it is necessary to give the Bill the appearance of equality of treatment, so that it may be kept within the terms of section  736  of the Merchant Shipping Act. But the differentiation, if there is to be any, will arise from the re fusal subsequently to grant licences to foreign ships. In order to secure the appearance of equality, the Minister is actually requiring every vessel plying between ports in Australia to take out a licence, and he will have the power to arbitrarily refuse to issue a licence. The clause does not provide that he must grant a licence on certain conditions. The question whether the Minister has a discretionary or obligatory power on compliance with certain conditions to grant a licence has come before the Courts on several occasions. I think it has been raised within the last six or eight months in connexion with some municipal licences, and that the Court held in one case that the power was a discretionary one. If that be so, the Minister in this case may arbitrarily refuse to grant a licence to vessels that are plying within the ports of a particular State. The reply may be that the Minister has indicated his intention of excepting from this clause limited coastal-trade ships and river and bay boats. </para>

            <para>- If limited coastal-trade ships are not also to be exempted, our objection is made all the stronger. The definition of &#34; limited coast-trade ship &#34; has not yet been altered, nor has the Minister circulated any amendment of it. Under it the Minister may declare a voyage of  50  miles to be the limit of a limited coast-trade ship. There are many vessels engaged in trading within the State of South Australia, travelling for distances of over  300  miles, and some over  400  miles. I believe that in Western Australia the voyages are so long that some outside ships, principally British, actually compete with the local ships for the carrying trade within the limits of the State. I remember that on one occasion the question arose whether we could touch them by the Arbitration Act, and bring them under the local conditions. I doubt it, and I see that the Minister doubts our power to deal with them under the Navigation Bill, because all this part of the Bill is subject to a doubt, expressed by the Attorney-General himself here and by the Minister, as to whether we have power to regulate wage conditions under &#34; navigation.&#34; We are doing it in this clause impliedly, if not directly, because we declare that unless certain accommodation is provided, and certain wages are paid, no licence shall be issued, although we were told a few days ago by the Attorney-General and by the Minister himself that we have no power under the term &#34; navigation &#34; to regulate wages. I ask the Minister, then, if it is wise to bring in a lot of these small vessels engaged within a particular State in purely domestic trade. If they are liable, their liability ought to arise under the conciliation and arbitration provision. That is a matter which has to come on in the High Court. Why put them in a position of doubt as to whether they ought to take out a licence or not? The amendment of the clause was for a reason, in order to obtain equality of treatment of foreign ships with British and purely local ships, but the proposal goes much further, because it actually brings within our control at once the whole of the Intra- State vessels that are not of the river and bay class. It applies at once the prevailing wage conditions prescribed by the Arbitration Court, or generally ruling in that district, to all boats that wish to engage in the coasting trade, without giving them the slightest opportunity of showing, as they could in the Arbitration Court, that those conditions are not applicable to their trade. Under the clause it rests with the Minister to declare, if he has the power, whether those conditions of wages shall apply at once to all vessels concerned, although at present they may be carrying on their trade without let or hindrance from anybody. The clause, therefore, goes much beyond what is necessary. It would be better if the Minister would confine his amendment to striking out the word &#34; foreign.&#34; If the Committee votes to retain the word, I see no reason why the rest of his amendment should not be adopted for the sake of consistency, although some parts of it may be objectionable. The principle of the coasting trade part of the Bill, however, does require, at all events, the substance of the provisions which would be incorporated :in the clause as amended. </para>

            <para>- Why bring in  vessels which have been trading for the last thirty years between Port Adelaide and Yorke&#39;s Peninsula, and whose conditions have been inquired into by the Arbitration Court, saying that, no matter what may be the conditions, they shall not engage in the coasting trade unless they comply with the terms of this measure?

        <para class="block">Court, the power of saying whether the merits justify the application of an award. The course chosen by the Government seems to go far beyond the necessities as declared originally by the Attorney-General when he said that, in order to preserve our treaty obligations, we ought not to differentiate against foreign ships. That, I understood, was the reason for striking out the word &#34; foreign.&#34; The Government are going much beyond that by applying the licensing provisions to Intra- State boats, on condition that they comply, in respect of air space, wages, and everything else, with the provisions of the other parts of the Bill.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HUGHES</inline> (West Sydney- AttorneyGeneral) &#91;3.58&#93;. - I understand that, while the honorable and learned member takes no exception to the proposal to put foreign ships on an equality with Australian-trade ships, he thinks we are going far beyond the necessities of the case in including limited coast-trade ships. How are we to differentiate between a limited coast-trade ship and any other coasting ship for the purpose of this clause? According to the definition, a limited coast-trade ship is a sea-going ship exclusively engaged in making short voyages from and to any port in Australia within a radius not exceeding 400 miles. There is nothing to prevent a foreign-trade ship engaging in such trade. Although generally foreign-trade ships do not do so, there is nothing to prevent them, and they may frequently so engage. What is to prevent them, for example, carrying coal from Newcastle to Sydney or Brisbane, or cargo from Adelaide to any of the Gulf ports? </para>

            <para>- Once you make an exception, and do not apply this provision to all ships equally - that some ships can trade without a licence, while others are prevented from so doing - foreign nations will have a right to say - and will properly say- that this does not apply to their vessel&#39;s. They will say, &#34; We are not on the same footing as all ships, but only on the same footing as some ships; and some of your ships have benefits which are not given to us.&#34; What, then, are we to say to the nations with whom we have treaties, and why should a limited coast-trade ship 4226 <inline font-style="italic">Navigation</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> be given privileges not extended to other Australian-owned coasting ships?

        <para>I admit, as far as the practical side of the question is concerned, that not once in a thousand times would a foreign-trade ship compete with a limited coast-trade ship. But, nevertheless, I see no answer to the objection that would be urged by treaty nations in regard to this matter. Since the whole reason for striking out the word &#34; foreign,&#34; is to meet this line of argument, I cannot see that we ought to make any exception. The only objection that can be urged is that the limited coast-trade ship would be put to the trouble of applying for a licence. But the application would be largely  a  matter of form. The licence would be applied for and obtained as readily as a ship obtains a clearance. I admit the cogency of the objection of the honorable member for Angas, but at the same time I see no answer to the argument that I have been submitting. Therefore, I think that this provision should apply to all ships. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think that the Attorney-General has quite grasped the point which the honorable member for Angas has urged. If any foreign ship were engaged in the limited coast trade, it would come under the provision as introduced, and have to obtain a licence. But inasmuch as all the other conditions are covered by Part II. of the Bill, dealing with masters and seamen, which is made to apply to British ships to a very large extent, the Australian trade and limited coast-trade ships would have to comply with the wages conditions, manning scale, and accommodation regulations. . They would have to fulfil all the conditions which the Bill, as introduced, requires to be the conditions for a licence to foreign ships. The object of the licence is to bring in the foreigner, so as to make him do the same things as we compel our own people to do. That being so, the only object of the licence clause is to apply the conditions to foreigners. There can be no complaint by a foreigner, because all we say to him is, &#34; We require you to fulfil the sameconditions as apply to our own vessels.&#34; There can be no complaint that we are trying to create  a  diversity of conditions. Limited-trade and Australian-trade ships have, under the Bill, to comply with wages, manning, and accommodation requirements. We are going to apply those to the foreigner. But in doing that we are  bringsing  in other provisions, applying them to the Australian ships, and giving power to hold up the whole of a ship&#39;s trade if she does not fulfil certain conditions. Takewages conditions. If there is a little dispute as regards wages there will be power to prevent a boat from engaging in the trade at all. There is no necessity for a power of that description with regard to the Australian ships. The only reason why you want to prohibit a boat is to secure the fulfilment of our conditions generally, and  it  seems to me that the Government are imposing unnecessary restrictions upon our own vessels in requiring a licence. We are practically legislating, as regards wages, for vessels which are already under awards. </para>

          <para>. - I quite sympathize with the Minister in regard to the application of this provision to foreign ships. But we are going beyond that. Instead of saying that vessels coming from abroad to compete on our coasts must comply with local conditions - that is, if the local trade is under a common award, saying to them, &#34; You must pay the awarded rates whatever they are, and if there are no awarded rates, you must pay the ruling rates on that portion of the coast which is  the area of competition &#34; - the Minister has incidentally framed a common rule applicable to local vessels.

          <inline font-style="italic">Navigation</inline>&#91;15  October,  1912.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> 4227  usurped the functions of the Arbitration Court by declaring that all vessels, local vessels included, that enter into the coasting trade, whether they are or are not trading within the area of an award, must pay -certain wages. I do not think that the drafting is correct. What the Minister ought to have done was to see that foreign vessels entering into competition paid the wages prescribed; but he ought not to have gone on to say that the wages prescribed for the future shall be deemed, for all purposes, the ruling rates. What this clause says is that the ruling rates are to be the ruling rates under clause 289 current in the part affected by the competition. If there is an award of the Arbitration Court, that is to be deemed to settle the standard to be abided by. That is right enough as regards competitors from outside. If they enter this trade, they ought, according to the policy of this part of the Bill, to pay whatever wages are current, but we ought not, at the same time, to declare that local vessels which are not subject to the award must comply with its terms. We are framing a common rule applicable to all vessels engaged in the coasting trade of the particular part. I do not want to say any more about the matter, but I hope that the Minister will see if he cannot get a recast of this part of the Bill more consistent with the object, and that is to prevent unfair competiton by outside vessels, and not to frame a common rule, bringing all local vessels within its scope. </para>

          <para>.- Before the Minister moves the insertion of a new sub-clause, I should like him to explain how this clause will work in practical operation. Take, for instance, the case of a British ship trading regularly to Fremantle. Does the clause mean that before the boat comes to Australia there will have to be an agreement made in England with the men coming to Australia to  pay  them the Australian rates of wages, and that the agreement will have to be brought before the Superintendent in Western Australia before the boat is allowed to engage in the coasting trade? Then what is to fix the wages payable in the coasting trade? Are the wages to be those ruling in that part of Australia, or those ruling under an InterState award? What will be the practical procedure ? </para>

          <para>.- We have not very much information&#39; as to the conditions under which licences will be granted, but I assume that what the Minister will do when an application is made will be to see whether all conditions, exclusive of the condition to pay the standard rate of wages, have been complied with - for instance, the condition as to air space is a matter which can be at once observed - and then a licence will be granted to the vessel which will inure in relation to that condition so long as the vessel is in Australian waters. The air space is not likely to be altered on every voyage. When the Minister comes to deal with the wages, he will want to know what the actual wages paid are. In order to bind the vessel to the payment of these wages, without continually asking what the wages paid are as the vessel arrives here, he will see that there is an indorsement on the. agreement with the seamen that the ruling rates, whatever they may be, are to be paid. That indorsement will then bind the owners of the vessel in respect to the seamen who are parties to the agreement. I cannot see how it will bind any other seamen except those engaged at the time. But will the agreement have to be re-signed whenever a new contingent is taken on? Perhaps the Minister will have to consider this matter a little more. I believe that the clause will work properly. As soon as the indorsement has been made, it will amount to a new contract, obligatory within our territorial limitations, between the master and the men. If it is necessary to know what wages should be paid, the ruling rates can be ascertained j and if there is an award, it can be produced. </para>

          <para>. - May not conflicts in the operation of awards be possible? Speaking from memory, it has been held in New Zealand that the awards of the Dominion apply to New Zealand vessels wherever they may travel. If a vessel is registered in New Zealand,, the New Zealand awards are binding upon her wherever she may be, and, of course, follow her into Australian waters, assuming the decision to be valid, though its validity has been questioned.

If a vessel is registered in Australia, and makes a voyage to New Zealand and back, the final port of destination being in Australia, the Australian awards and conditions bind her. This creates the possibility of conflict between the awards of the Commonwealth and those of the Dominion, and it seems to me that we might arrange to recognise each other&#39;s awards. The Minister might consider whether that would not be possible by mutual legislation. </para>

            <para>- While the New Zealand rates of wages might be higher than ours, their manning or other conditions, although considered satisfactory by the Arbitration Court of the Dominion, might differ. I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of establishing reciprocity in regard to standards, so that the Commonwealth and the Dominion may recognise each other&#39;s standards just as we recognise the certifificates of the Board of Trade. Another little matter to which I direct attention is that the marginal references throughout the Bill are to the New Zealand Act of 1903, although there is a consolidating Act of 1908. I suggest that the references be to the Act of 1908, so that it may not seem that we have overlooked it. </para>

          <para>.- I cannot see that difficulty will arise in practice. The only vessels whose seamen are likely to be paid at a higher rate than that ruling in Australia will be New Zealand vessels, and, possibly, United States vessels from the West Coast of America. How can we have reciprocity in this matter? How can we compare things so different as, say, the rate of wages, and privileges, such as holidays? The rates of wages must be the test of comparison. It is suggested that while the rates of wages under other agreements might be lower than those ruling on the Australian coast, the holidays allowed, the payment for overtime, the provision for accommodation, or other conditions, might be more liberal; that a vessel might come here whose crew was being paid less than the Australian rates, but was enjoying more holidays or other benefits than Australian seamen enjoy. Still it would be unadvisable to depart from a test which is easily applied. It is only in respect to wages that a comparison can be made. It could not be said that three weeks&#39; holiday a year, or any other privilege, was the exact equivalent of, say, 10s. a month in wages. I think that the clause should be left as it stands; an amendment would create difficulties. </para>

          <para>. - The purpose of the new sub-clause is to prevent seamen coming to Australia from places where higher rates of wages rule than rule on the Australian coast from being prejudiced; to provide that lower rates shall not be paid while a vessel is trading between Australian ports. I do not think that we can go further than that. If we add to the sub-clause so as to cover a number of conditions, we may be confronted with many practical difficulties. For instance, if we attempted to make provision as to accommodation, it might involve structural alterations, which would mean considerable cost or prove impracticable. For my own part, I think we may very well pass the sub-clause as it is, and, later on, the honorable member for Darling Downs may see some means of accomplishing what is in his mind. </para>

One of the conditions of the Act is that any ship engaging in the coasting trade must pay the standard rate of wages in Australia, and the effect of the clause is to make the master responsible, under a penalty, for the performance of arbitration awards in regard to wages. </para>

            <para>- That is one of the reasons given by the Minister, but I believe there are other reasons for excising the clause. I wish to point out, however, that if we do so, we shall have no provision in the Bill for reciprocal arrangements to cover, for instance, the case of New Zealand shipping. The honorable member for Darling Downs has mentioned that there are provisions in the New Zealand law quite as good as ours. I do not know that we wish to provide for reciprocal arrangement, as it seems to me that all we want is evidence that the rate of wages paid under the New Zealand law is as high as that under our law. There are provisions in Parts II. and IV. of the Bill, under which reciprocity might be arranged for with respect to other conditions. If we wish to apply the ruling rates, or even the rates of an arbitration award, to a vessel coming from New Zealand, we may be met with the fact that the ruling rate of wages, or the remuneration, which is really the important matter, may be expressed differently in a New Zealand award from an award of the Commonwealth. I think that, in the last award made, in the case of the Merchant Shipping Guild, captains are allowed twenty-one days&#39; holiday. They are also allowed, as compensation for being, deprived of certain time outside ports, to five days off per month. Under the award, the captain of a vessel may be entitled to a total of something like eighty-one days off the vessel in the year. In such a case, the wages paid! might be lower than where a captain would not be entitled to more than ten days off in the year. My point is that the benefit derived from a New Zealand award might be substantially quite as great as that derived under a Commonwealth award, though it might be expressed in very different terms. What we wish to arriveat is that the conditions of employment, as expressed in hours and wages, of foreign shipping, are substantially the same as our own. </para>

            <para>- Or if we had to inquire into the conditions of employment on board any vessel, the owners of which desired to engage in our coastal trade. We might  find that the conditions, though not the same as those prescribed by a Commonwealth award, were quite as good, although expressed in different terms. Compensation might be given in hours in the one case, and in higher wages in the other. I wish to know, from the Minister, whether this Bill will permit him, in dealing with foreign shipping, to accept a substantial compliance with a Commonwealth award? I suggest that we ought to define ruling rates, so as to cover a substantial compliance with a Commonwealth award. At present, the term covers merely the rate of wages. </para>

          <para>.- I do not intend to ask the Minister the meaning of any of the extraordinary terms used in this clause. There -is a reference here to the &#34;Receiver,&#34; but I do not find in any part of the Bill a direct power to appoint a Receiver.. It may be that a Receiver under the Customs Act, or the Receiver of a State, may be contemplated by the Minister. Throughout the Bill, it is assumed that a Receiver is appointed, but there is no power to appoint such an official. We take express power to appoint a Superintendent, and in clause 291 we take express power to appoint surveyors. On a question arising as to whether the Minister has power to appoint a Receiver, the fact that an express power is given for the appointment of other officers, and such a provision is omitted in re- .gard to a Receiver, would be relevant to the question raised. The Receiver has very wide powers under this Bill. He has powers of apprehension in the case of a wreck, and it is provided that if there is any resistance to apprehension, and death results, the Receiver cannot be charged with manslaughter. That is an extraordinary extension of the common law provisions. I mention the matter to show that the Receiver will be in a position of very great power, and consequent responsibility. Perhaps the Minister will look into the reason why no express power is taken in this Bill to appoint a Receiver. I believe that, under the Customs Act, the question was raised in the <inline font-style="italic">Pericles</inline> case as to whether the Collector of Customs of a State is a Receiver for Commonwealth purposes&#39;. That shows that it is necessary to be express in these matters. We should provide that the Receiver shall be a Receiver for Customs purposes, or we shoul&#39;d make special provision for his appointment under this Bill. </para>

        <para>This Bill implies that the Minister will appoint a Receiver of Wrecks, but makes no provision for such an appointment, except in the definition of &#34;Receiver.&#34; The Commonwealth Public Service Act provides for the appointment of all officers throughout Australia, and, apparently, the only reason why we  expressly appoint the Superintendent is that, in his case, we create a new office under statute. Although, under this clause, we vest the Receiver with statutory powers, I think that, under our Public Service Act, we have power either to appoint or remove him from office. Further, we do not require to make express provision for his appointment to the office solely, as in all probability an officer who is already filling some other position in our Public Service will be appointed to discharge the duties of the office. </para>

Along the coast of Western Australia, for example, it would obviously be impossible to appoint any one man to act as Receiver, because if we did so, and a wreck occurred there, the Receiver might be 2,000 miles distant. A similar remark is applicable to Tasmania. Whether it is necessary that the Receiver should be a public servant I do not know. But I will look into the matter. </para>

          <para>.- The question at issue is not the ownership of the wreck, but rather the inter-dependence of this provision with the penal clauses of the Bill. A number of penalties attach to persons who interfere with wrecks, and it may be that if we cannot pass this legislation as it stands, the penal clauses to protect wrecks may have to go to the wail. They may be held to be outside our power. If we desire to keep within our power we should declare that this clause, or the whole Act, shall bind the King. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has properly mentioned that this is a matter of prerogative. It is for that reason that it is declared in the Merchant Shipping Act, not that  Her  Majesty and  Her  successors &#34;shall be entitled&#34; to all unclaimed wrecks, but that they &#34;are&#34; entitled. It is one of the old prerogatives of the Crown. If we desire to cut down that prerogative, we can do so by providing that, notwithstanding any prerogative to the contrary, the Commonwealth shall be entitled to all unclaimed wrecks in Australia. The Minister should consider whether it is necessary to declare expressly, as was said to be necessary in a Privy Council decision, that this clause binds the King, because it may be a cutting down of the prerogative. As a matter of fact, the States question this power. I have a letter from a body in one of the States in which it is said that this is an attempt to usurp ownership that cannot belong to the Commonwealth. It is rather significant that some, if not all, of the State Acts make no reference to ownership. They have not attempted to cut down the prerogative. I have not had time to examine them all, but I do not think that any one of them contains a provision like this, declaring that unclaimed wrecks are to belong to the State. They seem to follow the provisions of clause  523  of the Merchant Shipping Act. </para>

          <para>. - I have never heard of an unclaimed wreck. I mentioned just now, by way of interjection, that Berriedale Keith considers that this provision is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> because it is in conflict with the Merchant Shipping Act of  1894,  and also with the Civil Lists Act, which require that the proceeds of unclaimed wrecks shall be paid to the Exchequer. A similar provision, however, appears in section  264  of the New Zealand Act of  1908,  which has been assented to, and the Board of Trade, in their lengthy memorandum on this Bill, have taken no exception tothis clause. I think that we are entitled to any unclaimed wrecks, for, as has been pointed out, the Commonwealth Government would have to bearthe expense of removing them, and, in view of the further fact that an unclaimed wreck is seldom heard of, I hope that the clause will be passed as it stands. </para>

          <para>.- It seems to me that a little doubt attaches to this clause, in which it is declared that every person who takes into any place out of Australia any stranded ship or wreck &#34; and there sells it &#34; shall be guilty of an indictable offence. The clause is almost a verbatim copy of section  585  of the Merchant Shipping Act, and the difficulty I see in regard to it is that we are making an offence the doing of an act outside Australia. I do not know whether the Minister has considered whether we have power to do that. We are saying, for instance, that if a man took a wreck off our coast to the United States of America, and sold it there, that would be an offence. I do not know whether, on the authority of certain cases, the Commonwealth has a right to declare that some act done outside Australia shall be an offence. The same question arises in regard to several subsequent clauses dealing with salvage, and one or two other matters where we have followed the Merchant Shipping Act, and I should like the Minister to consider it. </para>

          <para>.- The point raised by the honorable member for Darling Downs in connexion with clause  314  arises also in respect of this clause. Although there is a like provision in the Imperial Act, the difference between our position and that of the Imperial Parliament is that the latter has power over the subject to an extent that we do not possess, and 4234 <inline font-style="italic">Navigation</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> can follow the subject through the seas apart from questions of territorial jurisdiction. I read a few nights ago, in one of the English papers for September, that the International Diplomatic Conference on Maritime Law was to meet again at Brussels to revise and complete treaties on the limitation of ship-owners&#39; liabilities, and so forth. That Conference met in  1910,  and some very important matters, including new provisions as regards salvage, were then dealt with. I do not know whether those provisions have been incorporated in the Bill as it stands, but it would be a pity if we found later on that our law was not in line with the latest amendments made in England in this regard. The question of salvage received a thorough overhaul at the session of  1910,  and several other questions associated with it were also discussed. Besides this, some very interesting questions were discussed at the Convention of last month, including that of the limitation of liability in respect of loss and damage to property at sea. The conditions of the Merchant Shipping Act on that point are altogether different from those of France, Russia, and several other nations. I hope the Minister, or his advisers, are watching what has been done at the Maritime International Diplomatic Conference. I think that all the amendments recommended by the Conference of  1 9 10  were adopted by a Bill introduced last year into the Imperial Parliament, although I do not know whether the Bill passed. I hope that the draft measure now before us has been brought into line with, at all events, what is best in the recent Imperial provisions. </para>

          <para>. - The amendments which I have circulated, relating to the clauses from  320  onwards, are based entirely upon the Imperial Maritime Convention Act of  191 1.  The Imperial authorities were anxious that we should take those clauses out of the Navigation Bill and embody them in a separate measure. I presume they thought that, as we had been about eight years over this Bill, another eight years might elapse before we passed it. The proceedings of the Convention in question have been watched, communications have taken place between the Board of Trade and the Department, and the Bill has been brought right up to date, in accordance with the procedure laid down at the Convention. </para>

          <para>.- This clause raises the whole question of compulsory pilotage. I do not raise any doubt as to the principle, but one or two general questions require to be considered. In the first place, in a subsequent clause, 352, we are altering the law as regards liability in respect of pilotage. Section 633 of the Imperial Act provides that the owner or master of a ship shall not be answerable to any person whatever for any loss or damage sustained through the fault of a pilot, where the employment of a qualified pilot is compulsory by law. In clause 352 of this Bill, however, we provide that the owner or master of a ship &#34; shall not be exempt from liability for any loss or damage&#34; occasioned by the fault of a pilot, where the employment of a pilot is compulsory. That is to say, we are making a fundamental alteration of the law as regards liability. I am not now questioning that alteration, because possibly the principle may be right, provided that the other alterations suggested be made. It is based, I understand, upon the report of an English Departmental Committee on pilotage, published in 191 1. But the Government have adopted part of the recommendation without adopting the whole of it. I understand that the alteration in the Bill was made in the Senate last year. I will read the recommendation of the English Departmental Committee - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>According to English law, the position of a compulsory pilot is that he is solely in charge of the navigation of the ship. He supersedes the master in all matters connected with the navigation of the ship. He is entitled to have all his orders promptly and diligently carried out, and any neglect of this respect or any interference with him in the performance of his duties, will, in the case of an accident resulting, make the owner liable. The master is not allowed to interfere with the pilot except in extreme cases of the latter&#39;s manifest incapacity to take charge of the ship, and to judge when such occasion  has arisen is a matter of great difficulty; to quote the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, giving evidence before us : - &#34; As the law stands, the pilot being absolutely in charge and over the captain, intervention places upon the captain an almost intolerable responsibility.&#34; </para>

            <para>- If the honorable member will turn to the contingent notice-paper, he will see that we propose to strike out of clause 349 the last half-dozen words, &#34; give the ship into his charge&#34; and to insert in place of them the words &#34;the charge of piloting the ship to that pilot.&#34; That will leave the captain in charge of the vessel. I went into this matter with one of the leading captains in the service of the Orient Company, and I think that the proposed amendment practically meets the views of the captain, because the pilot will only have charge of the piloting - not complete charge of the ship. </para>

          <para>It has been held by the Courts that when a pilot was taking a ship on the wrong side of the river, in distinct violation of the law, the master  o  was not in fault for not interfering, and that he would not be justified in so doing. On the other hand, when an incorrect light was exhibited by the orders of the compulsory pilot, it was held that the owner was liable, as it was a matter in which the master should have interfered. The Courts, as we have seen, recognise the right and the duty of the master to interfere in extreme cases. It seems to us, on consideration of the many decisions upon this point, that they have in effect created what the professed object of the law has been to avoid, namely, the existence on board a ship under compulsory pilotage of a divided authority. </para>

        <para>Then the Committee consider the relations between the master and the pilot at some length, and make a recommendation as to their legal position. This is the recommendation which has been adopted - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We cannot look with favour upon what practically amounts to the total supersession of the master by the pilot when the vessel is in compulsory pilotage waters. We therefore recommend that the&#39; master should at all times be legally responsible for the steering and safe conduct of the ship, and that the pilot, whether he actually handles the ship or not, should be the master&#39;s expert assistant. It should, in our opinion, be the positive duty of the master to interfere ir&#187; cases where he is of opinion that the pilot, through ignorance or inability, is endangering life or property. There must be, in our opinion, at all times, and under alf conditions, one supreme authority on board, and that authority must be The master. </para>
          <para>We do not anticipate that this recommendation will have much, if any, effect on the existing practice on board ship. Pilots in free, as well as in compulsory districts, so far as our information goes, take charge of the actual handling of the ship, though in the free districts they are, of course, only in the position of advisers, liable to be superseded at any moment by the master. When ship-owners and masters have confidence in the ability of their pilots, the pilot will, no doubt, remain in complete control of the handling of the ship ; but we cannot regard with approval that a master of a large trans- Atlantic liner may be compelled, as has happened in one case which has been brought under our notice, to take on board a pilot who has had no previous experience of a ship of that size, and thereupon be entirely superseded by the pilot in the handling and navigation of his own ship. </para>

          <para>If our recommendation as to the relative positions of master and pilot be carried into effect, one of the greatest objections through an alteration of the present law as regards the immunity from liability of a ship-owner whose ship is under compulsory pilotage will have been removed. </para>

        <para class="block">The Government have removed that inclause 352. </para>
        <para>We have pointed 6u&#34;t how productive of hardship is the present state of the law to innocent parties, and how fruitful a source of litigation. </para>
        <para>We are strongly of opinion that a ship-owner should not be released from liability for damagedone by his vessel when a pilot is compulsorily on board. </para>
        <para>We therefore recommend that section  633  of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, and the proviso to section 74 of the Harbors, Docks, and PiersClauses Act 1874, should be repealed, but, in. addition to such repeal, it will be necessary as well to insert a provision specifically declaringthat the owner shall be liable, as his immunity from liability at present does not alone depend&#39; on these sections, but has also been decided independently of any Statute. </para>
        <para>We desire to point out that the Select Committee of 1888 reported as follows: - &#34; Your Committee are strongly of opinion, having regard to the views just expressed, that the time-  has arrived when the exemption of the owner from liability for damage done by his ship when the ship is placed in charge of a pilot by compulsion of law should cease to exist. Your Committee are of opinion that such exemption is indefensible, and is inimical- to the safety of life and property at sea. In their opinion, the master of the vessel, even while a pilot is on bo&#39;ard, should continue to be responsible for the conduct and navigation of the vessel.&#34; </para>

        <para>I am glad that pilotage is to be made a Federal service. The evidence taken by the Royal Commission on Naviga tion showed that at that time the remuneration for pilotage was not uniform, and sometimes not satisfactory. We found that the Queensland pilots should receive more than was at that time paid to them by the Government of the State. The pilotage service must always employ highly expert men of the best character, because of the serious responsibility attached to it, and the trying nature of &#39; the work. In determining the remuneration of the pilots, we should bear in mind the conditions under which they work, and the fact that theirs is a dangerous calling, needing skill, and expert knowledge. The Victorian pilots are not the servants of the State, but possess an organization and equipment of their own, with pension rights. The Commonwealth, in taking over this service with the pilotage service of the other States, will have to recognise these rights and privileges as liberally as it can, so that the men shall not be worse off than they are now. I am sure that the AttorneyGeneral intends that these men shall be fairly and justly dealt with. </para>

          <para>.. - It is proposed that the Governor-General may proclaim the ports at which the employment of a pilot shall be compulsory, and that at any such port the pilotage shall be performed by a pilot in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. In Victoria the pilots, although under Government supervision, are remunerated by fees, and are not Government servants. The principle that the pilots shall be Government servants is, perhaps, a sound one, but it is only fair to point out that it failed when first applied to the Port Phillip pilotage service. . Our pilots were first paid in accordance with their earnings, but afterwards became Government servants, and received a fixed salary. After some years that arrangement was found to be unsatisfactory, and for reasons which then seemed obvious, the present system was adopted. It has proved very satisfactory on the whole. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. Clause 356 provided for the taking over of their plant, but there is another feature in the fact that they have something like ;&#163;60,000 invested in the superannuation and pension fund, over which the Victorian Government have more or less control. We are making an important departure, which involves an interference with a large sum of money, and I desire to know whether the Minister of Trade and Customs has considered to what extent, if any, it is intended to interfere with that fund? </para>

            <para>- They are, I believe, under the Marine Board, and are governed by one of the provisions in the Marine Act. Has the Minister considered what is to be the position of these pilots, or how far their interests are affected? Do the Federal Government propose to make arrangements to step into the shoes of the State Government, in order that the rights of these men may be reasonably conserved ? We are entitled to know exactly where we stand, and how far the vested interests of the pilots will be affected. I am certain that the Minister will see that the rights and interests of the pilots are not prejudiced. I do not know whether the honorable gentleman has made any arrangements with the pilots, or what his intentions are. Does he intend to take all of them over? Will they all have a right to come into the service of the Federal Government, or will this be a matter for the discretion of the Minister? </para>

            <para>- According to the terms of this Bill, the rights of these men are to be taken away; their licences are to be cancelled, and they are to become Government servants. Under the circumstances, it is reasonable to ask whether they will have a right to come into the employment of the Federal Government, or whether the&#39; Federal Government will take over only those whom they may think it well to take over? No indication is given by the Government as to what the status of these men is to be in the future - what their salaries or conditions are to be. </para>

We are taking their employment away by Act of Parliament, and I, therefore, urge that their peculiar, position should not be overlooked. </para>

          <para>In the case of Victoria, the chief difficulty would be in the arranging for taking over theplant of the pilots. It would not be fair to takethis without compensating them for the money which they have invested in it; and another difficulty would be experienced on account of their pension fund. The sum of, I think, ^50,000 is invested in that fund, the interest upon which is utilized for the payment of pensions. The question would have to be considered whether it is advisable for the Commonwealth to take this money and pay pensions out of pilotage rates. Doubtless, if we took over these pilots, we should also be obliged to recognise their pension rights, but we might provide that no fresh pilot entering the service should be granted any such right. I believe that all parties would be glad to cometo an arrangement of that sort. </para>

        <para>As regards future employment, that must be a matter for consideration by the Government, but as regards the existing rights of Victorian pilots, and particularly their pension rights, I think the Minister, if he has had the matter under consideration, should say exactly what he intends doing. I have discussed the question from an old knowledge of the state of affairs, and a desire that what is fair and just, so far as their existing rights are concerned, should be done in taking over the Victorian pilots. </para>

          <para>. - The matter raised by the honorable member for Kooyong hasbeen brought under the notice of the AttorneyGeneral and myself. I think I havereceived four or five deputations from the Victorian pilots, whose position is very different from that of any other pilots inAustralia. They possess their own equipment, and have two rather fine steamers of their own. They bring vessels from 3 or 4. miles outside the Heads right into Melbourne, a distance of from 30 to 40 miles. Their opponents urge that they form a pretty close corporation. I do not wish.for a moment to infer that there are men in the service who are not fully qualified, but it is possible that sometimes the best qualified men are unable to get into that service. In view of their possession of vessels and equipment, and of insurance and superannuation funds, it has been rather a matter of buying one&#39;s way intothe Victorian pilotage service. </para>

            <para>- They are appointed by the Marine Board, and I understand that applications are called for when a vacancy occurs. The last time the Victorian pilots saw me, I made special inquiries to know if many had been appointed within recent years. Honorable members will agree that it would be unfair to have the service loaded up just when we are about to take over the pilots. I find that that has not been the case. The Victorian pilots receive no fixed salary, but their emoluments come to about double the salary paid to pilots in other parts of Australia. Honorable members may rest assured that the Victorian pilots will be treated fairly. When we take over the pilotage service we shall require the vessels employed in it, and we must compensate their owners for them. Their superannuation and insurance funds are administered by themselves under the Marine Board Act, but they can rest assured that their existing rights will be effectively safeguarded. Still, no Minister could guarantee that every pilot entering the service in Victoria in future will have secured to him terms and conditions of employment equal to those enjoyed by the Victorian pilots to-day, because that would involve the raising of the rates paid to pilots throughout Australia, No doubt when the Port Phillip pilots become public servants of the Commonwealth the Public Service Commissioner will consider their position. If, for instance, it be shown that the average earnings of a Victorian pilot for the past three or four years has run up to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;800</inline> a year, that will be taken into consideration in fixing their salaries. The Public Service Commissioner will, no doubt, take into consideration also the work the men have been doing and the work they will be required to do under the Commonwealth. They can rest assured that, as regards their plant and equipment, and their present status, a fair thing will be done by them. Neither the present nor any other Government would seek to deprive them of any advantages they have been able to secure for themselves, and which, but for the passing of this Bill, they would continue to enjoy. Some alteration will, of course, have to be made ; but we cannot, in any case, make the conditions throughout Australia uniform. The work of a pilot who takes charge of a vessel over a distance of a mile or two through one channel cannot be regarded as equal in importance with the work of one who takes a vessel over a distance of 40 miles through a number of channels. No doubt the pilots will be graded by the Public Service Commissioner, just as he has graded the offices of the Post and Telegraph Department. </para>

What I mean is that, for instance, the head of the Melbourne Post Office receives more than the head of the Richmond Post-office, because his work is more important, and his position of greater responsibility.

            <para>- We are not discussing that question at the present time. Honorable members will agree that, though public servants throughout Australia may complain very much about their position, very few of them leave the Service to go outside; and if any do so, most of them move Heaven and earth to get back again. We are not dealing with that matter now, but with the position of the pilots; and! I say that their position will differ in different ports. Their positions differ to-day. A pilot at Port Fairy may have to take charge of a vessel, perhaps, once in a month, and his time is very largely taken up with other work. In New South Wales, a pilot at Twofold Bay will not have the same work to do as a pilot at Sydney. The work of a Port Phillip pilot is very &#39; different from that of a pilot on the Gippsland Lakes. Pilotage will be compulsory under this&#39; Bill, and honorable members may be assured that every -pilot taken over by the Commonwealth will have his rights safeguarded. I am not sure what course will be adopted in connexion with the Torres Straits pilots. </para>

          <para>. - This is one of the most important clauses of the Bill, and great care should be exercised in dealing with it. At the present time, when a pilot boards a vessel - assuming that compulsory pilotage exists - he at once becomes responsible, not merely for its navigation, but for the safety of the shipping through which the vessel must pass ; but although he is nominally in charge of the vessel, the master himself never loses control of his ship. The pilot is practically his chief adviser. If the pilot should lose his head as the result of a sudden illness, the master has a perfect right to interfere. </para>

            <para>- If we enact legislation on those lines, we shall be on perfectly safe ground. Whilst the honorable member for Darling Downs was quoting from a report to the Board of Trade, I asked by way of interjection if there had been any legislation in support of the recommendations which were contained therein. I am satisfied that, whatever the departmental Committee might recommend, the Board of Trade is too shrewd to make the pilot alone responsible for the safe navigation of any vessel. We must recollect that in the old country pilotage is practically in the hands of the Trinity masters. If we take over the pilots in Australia, it is our duty to see that only efficient men are placed in charge of vessels entering, any port. If - we do that, it is all that we can do. But we ought clearly to lay down the lines upon which the Government should act; otherwise, in the near future, we shall have a nice crop of grievances on the part of the pilots themselves. I have very grave doubts whether we should take over the pilots at all. In South Australia, the chief ports in which pilots are engaged are the Outer Harbor, Port Adelaide, and Port Pirie. These pilots are employed to navigate vessels from the high seas into harbors which are under the control of the Marine Board of that State. Seeing that the Commonwealth has no control over Intra- State commerce, I am inclined to think that the States will set up a claim to retain their present system of pilotage as well as their Marine Boards. Consequently, it would be as well to make the clauses of this Bill which relate to pilots as separate as possible. At Port Adelaide and the Outer Harbor in South Australia, the pilots employed are the servants of the State; but at Port Pirie, they are merely licensed. Already, however, they are be ginning to smell fire. Under the South Australian law, they are entitled to continue as pilots, provided their health and efficiency are good, until they are seventy years of age. If the Commonwealth takes them over, the Public Service Commissioner will probably declare that they must retire upon attaining the age of sixty-five years. I do not think that this Parliament wishes to deprive any man of his rights. We must be very careful to guard against that. If the retiring age of pilots is fixed at sixtyfive or sixty years of age, that provision ought to apply only to future pilots. We know that there is always a fair amount of competition amongst our old ship-masters who wish to become pilots, and that for such positions there are always more applications than there are vacancies to fill. Shipmasters, of all men, are entitled io sympathy, consideration, and justice. The shipmaster runs all the risks of navigation in obtaining a living, and if he makes a mistake his employers may be prepared to re-engage him, but the exigencies of insurance nowadays are such that he is blackmarked, and practically loses his means of livelihood. A marine engineer, when he has a row with his employer, can take his tools ashore, and obtain a billet there; and so with the ordinary seaman; but the shipmaster is in an entirely different and less fortunate position. There are not many of these prizes, and I think that shipmasters should have an opportunity to secure them. At the same time, we should take care to obtain the best men for the position. I am speaking now for pilots in my own State, who have been &#34; smelling fire in the distance.&#34; They have questioned me on the subject, and I have told them that I do not think the Federal Parliament will do them an injustice. I do not suppose that one-half of our pilots will be able to continue in the service until they have -reached seventy years of age. For reasons of health, as well as other considerations, most of them will probably retire before they reach that age, but those who are fit to remain in the service until they have reached that age should be allowed to do so. A large number of very elderly men who have followed a sea-faring life display great ability, are absolutely competent, and have a marvellous knowledge of our coast. The constant navigation of our waters gives them a knowledge of the varying currents along our coast, which the new man does not possess. They have an intimate knowledge, not only of the varying currents, but of the way in which those currents vary at different times of the year. I am told by competent men that many wrecks have been due to the fact that the masters in charge have not had a sufficient experience of these changing currents, a thorough knowledge of which is of the greatest importance when ships go by the reckoning. </para>

            <para>- I am urging that if we take over the pilots, and it is found that under the State law their retiring age is fixed at seventy years, we should not alter that retiring age, so far as they are concerned. I am not troubling very much about the men who enter the pilot service in the&#187; future. They will do so with their eyes open, but where men have entered the service under conditions prescribing the retiring age at seventy years, it seems to me that it would not be in accordance with justice or equity to call upon them, other things being equal, to retire on their reaching the age of sixty-five years. </para>

          <para>. - The position, so far as the power of the Commonwealth is concerned, seems to me to be quite simple. Pilotage is an integral part of navigation, ( and to the extent that we may exercise our power in dealing with navigation, we may exercise it in regard to pilotage. Whatever limitations there are to our power in regard to navigation must exist also in regard to our power to deal with pilotage. That being so, we may pass a law with regard to pilotage and prescribe the conditions under which pilotage shall be carried on. That law should be uniform. We may prescribe the responsibilities of owners and of pilots, and we may take over State employes who are engaged in pilotage. </para>

            <para>- That exception will apply to navigation generally. I anr not urging that there are no limitations. What these are we do not precisely know. I have already said that any limitation on our power regarding navigation must extend to our power to deal with pilotage to that extent, and no further. The practical limitation of our powers in regard to pilotage is, of course, to be found in the circumstances. We know that it is the general practice for coastal shipping to be brought in under an exempt certificate. Save in the case of the Brisbane River, and one or two more rivers of the kind, such vessels are generally brought in by masters holding a pilotage exemption certificate. Pilots, therefore, are mainly employed in and about foreign-going shipping, and as our power over foreign-going shipping is not in question, so far as regards the practical application of this Bill, there can be no doubt at all as to our power in regard to pilotage. As to the constitutional aspect of the question, I submit that whatever limitations are imposed upon us in respect of Intra-State shipping will apply also to pilotage to the same extent. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Darling Downs referred to a report, presented last year by a Committee of the Imperial Parliament, in which certain recommendations were made. I believe that all the recommendations of that report have been adopted with one exception, and that the only one that was not embodied in the British Bill is now incorporated in this measure as clause 352. Under that clause, reversing the principle of the Merchant Shipping Act, the liability is cast on the owner and master for damage or loss occasioned by fault or want of capacity on the part of the pilot, although the pilotage is compulsory. I do not know whether that is wise, but the honorable member for Darling Downs appears to approve of the principle. We have before us the fact that it is the very reverse of the principle embodied in section 633 of the Merchant Shipping Act, and that, although a Committee recommended that that section should be repealed, the Home Government did not accept the recommendation. </para>

            <para>- The reason that under the Merchant Shipping Act the owners of the vessel are not liable where the pilotage is compulsory is because the control of the vessel is taken out of the master&#39;s hands. He is not allowed to interfere in any way with the navigation, although there is a limitation to this extent, that if he sees a certain danger which may be avoided by giving advice to the pilot, leaving to the pilot the final determination of what is to be done, it would be negligence on his part to be silent. It is, therefore, thought that if, in the interests, not merely of the passengers and the cargo and the vessel, but of the port, compulsory pilotage is applied at any particular place, it would be unfair to make responsible for negligence the man who is deprived of the control of the navigation of the vessel. Although a recommendation was made by a Committee last year that the English law ought to be altered, the Imperial Parliament, in its wisdom, declined to sanction the alteration, but adopted the other recommendations of the Committee, which were, to some extent, mixed up with the principle of compulsory pilotage. Under this measure we compel a- man to employ a pilot licensed by us, and if the pilot happens to be inefficient or negligent, he is not responsible for more than ^100 in damages, and in order to make up for the rest we fall back upon the principle of making responsible the man who has lost control through our Act. That, I think, is unfair. This will affect principally oversea vessels, because I suppose most of the local vessels are controlled by exempt officers. There is another side of the question. If we exempt the master of the vessel from liability, and at the same time limit the liability of the pilot to &#163;100, we may be doing an injury to the persons who are suffering loss, because there is no fund out of which they can get damages for loss which is due to the negligence of some one. Whatever view we take, therefore, an injustice is put upon some one. Nevertheless, the best course would be to stick to the English law, and if we say that pilotage must be compulsory we ought to find a way out by providing for some fund, by insurance or otherwise, to compensate the persons who are injured. I am doubtful as to whether we can take over the property of pilots. We can acquire any public property of a Department that we take over, but there is no pilotage Department. It is not a specific Department with property, like the Customs and Excise or Post and Telegraph. We can acquire property for any purpose within our powers of legislation, but does that mean that, because we regulate the employment of pilots, we can take over any of their stock in trade, such as their boalts, a class of property, unlike land, capable of being otherwise acquired? It may be so, but it is a fairly wide extension of the provisions of section 51 of the Constitution. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to make a strong appeal <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Government to strike out the clause which makes a pilot liable for pecuniary damage to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> I have been of opinion for many years that a pilot is not liable at all in law. I believe that, on an appeal from New Zealand some years ago, the Privy Council decided that the pilot was not liable, on the ground that he was licensed in good faith by the authorities, who had, to the best of their ability, satisfied themselves as to his competence, and that if anything occurred it was part of the risks of navigation. I hope the Minister will not take what I am going to say personally, because it is not meant in that way, but for downright impudence and refined robbery commend me to the clause that makes the unfortunate pilot liable to .&#163;100 damages. It often happens that the agents press the pilots to move a vessel, and to comply with thenwishes a risk has to be taken when the port is crowded. The pilots are a hard-working body of nien, and have to go out in all sorts of weather. Their&#39;s is not the easiest way to get a living, and accidents will occur. Take, for example, the port of Newcastle, where this sort of thing mostfrequently occurs. It is crowded with shipping, and a vessel may be damaged to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15.</inline> The accident may be just a slight tap, with no real harm done, but if a pilot has to pay for that sort of thing it may practically mean reducing his income by half. It should be remembered that nowadays all these vessels are insured, some of them by their owners, like Holt&#39;s Blue Funnel line. Where you find a company that insures its own fleet, you may depend on getting a remarkably good and safe service. If the hull of a vessel is insured, the insurance people have to pay any damage, whether it is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> or  &#163;3,000.  This proposal means that the unfortunate pilot is to be robbed in order to save the insurance companies a few pounds. I know the history of this clause, which,  I  4244 <inline font-style="italic">Navigation</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> believe, originated in my own State. I am not very proud of it. If there is anything of which we South Australians ought to be ashamed, it is the liability of pilots. It was introduced originally in South Australia by a very ingenious gentleman, when pilots were not Government officers, but were simply licensed, and he thought it would make them more careful. I do not know that it did make them more careful. There is another dangerous thing with regard to this provision. I stated a short time ago what I believed to be the law in the matter. In the English law, care has been taken to guard against liability in respect of pilots. If we make pilots liable, in my opinion we shall be creating a principle which will involve liability upon the Government. When pilots become officers of the Commonwealth, it will be difficult to prove that if a pilot is liable the Government which employs him is not liable also. Further than that the provision is grossly unjust to the pilots, who, as a rule, are poor men. There are not many of them who are so well off as are the pilots of Port Phillip. The clause may involve a tremendous tax on those who have to do with the moving of vessels within the various ports of Australia. I can see no reason for the imposition of this liability, notwithstanding that there is such a provision in the South Australian Act. I have always believed that it was a disgrace to our statute-book. I fought it in South Australia, and intend to fight it again. The provision will be unfair to the pilots in every port in Australia, but in the port of Newcastle it will create greater grievances than elsewhere. Those who know anything of the conditions attaching to shipping in that port will understand how it will operate there. Wherever shipping is thickly congested, and has to be moved about within a narrow compass, the risks are greatest. It is not the fault of the pilots that they have to take these risks. I trust that the Minister will see his way to strike out the clause. </para>

          <para>. - If honorable members refer to the clause relating to the liability of pilots they will see that the penalty is imposed for a specific purpose. It is only incurred where damage is done to a ship as the result of negligence or want of skill on the part of the pilot. While some may be of opinion that <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> is rather a large sum in which to mulct a pilot, it has to be remembered that the maximum penalty would only be imposed in case of wilful neglect. </para>

            <para>- The clause explains itself. It provides that no pilot shall be personally liable beyond the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> for any damage or loss occasioned by his negligence or want of skill. Suppose damage is done to a ship through a pilot being the worse for liquor, in consequence of which he negligently and carelessly navigates the vessel. He may cause damage to the extent of thousands of pounds. Is there to be no check upon him? A pilot is put in charge of a ship, and of the lives of the people on board. There have been cases where pilots, through being in liquor, have navigated vessels with an utter disregard to the requirements of safety, and have taken risks which they had no right to incur. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member must see that a Court would have to determine the amount of the pilot&#39;s liability, and no penalty would be imposed until evidence had been taken. Some safeguard, at any rate, ought to be provided to insure that pilots shall realize that responsibility does rest upon them, and that in the event of their being lacking in nautical skill or caution, and placing the lives of people and the ship in jeopardy, they may incur pecuniary liability. Under the circumstances I do not see that the penalty proposed is too high, seeing that the maximum need not be enforced. A penalty as low as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> might be imposed. </para>

            <para>- I take it that the penalty would be assessed according to the nature and extent of the damage. Fortunately, in Australia, we have been well served by our pilots. But even amongst the best class of men there would be exceptions to the general rule ; and any one of those exceptions may be the cause of a lamentable catastrophe. We certainly ought to make provision to meet cases of that kind. I, therefore, think that we are perfectly safe in leaving the penalty clause as it stands. </para>

The honorable member mentioned the port of Newcastle. In Newcastle generally the shipping is congested. During the last two or three months we have had from sixty to one hundred boats waiting there. After a heavy rain the river is in flood to a certain extent, bringing down trees, and so forth, and no pilot can move a boat without running a big risk of some damage being done. I want to know whether he will be clear under this clause. </para>

            <para>- Very often the Boards which have to deal with these accidents find that there has been neglect, when probably the pilot has not been to blame at all. If we permit a clause of this kind to remain in the Bill, the result will be that in bad weather, in the Newcastle district, the pilots will refuse to shift boats rather than take the risk of having to pay a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100 ;</inline> and, consequently, we shall have many mines thrown idle and hundreds of men unable to get work, because of the harbor being in an unsafe state. It is wrong to ask a pilot to take the risk of shifting a boat with the fear of being mulct in damages to the extent of&#163;100 if an accident happens. A good deal has been urged by the honorable member for Lang in regard to culpable negligence or drunkenness on the part of the pilot. There is a clause which provides for such cases. If a man is guilty of gross neglect or drunkenness in the performance of his duty, he ought to be punished. </para>

            <para>- Under clause 354 a pilot can be indicted, and put on his trial, if certain things have happened through his not being in a fit state to navigate the ship. That is quite proper. But it is quite a different matter when a pilot has to shift a boat in a congested harbor. In Newcastle there have been dozens of accidents, although the pilots have been cautious, skilful men. It stands to reason that the pilots must be skilful men, because a certificate is not likely to be given to a man who has not proved that he possesses the necessary skill. The pilots are all skilful men, and yet, in Newcastle, we have had dozens of accidents, where the damage to the boat may have run into hundreds of pounds. The accidents were not due to the fault of the pilots. The owner might be anxious for a boat to be removed to the crane to get a cargo of coal. Pressure might require that the boat should be got under the crane in order to get a.way from port, and to keep the colliery working. A pilot always does the best he can in such circumstances, but under this clause, if he bumps another ship, he will be liable to a fine not exceeding , &#163;100, because somebody may consider that the accident was due to neglect on his part. </para>

The authorities would be perfectly satisfied if the pilot had not been guilty of any neglect, but under this other clause a pilot would have to stand his . trial, because the charge would be wilful negligence or drunkenness on duty. As the honorable member for Hindmarsh pointed out, if a boat is insured against accident the owner will be fully reimbursed any expenditure which he may have to incur. I do not see why the pilot should be penalized because somebody considers that the accident was due to neglect on his part. I venture to assert that there is not a pilot to-day who does not take every possible care in the performance of his duty, and yet accidents occur, as they do in every walk of life. </para>

            <para>- Just so. If a pilot is guilty of wilfully doing something which he should not do, through being  drunk when he is in charge of a boat, he should be tried in a Court, because no one&#39;s life should be put in danger. If you carry out this principle here, why not apply it to every other walk of life? Take the case of an engine-driver who has lives under his care as he winds an engine. Is any action, taken against him1 because of any damage which has happened to the mine through overwinding? That is never thought of. If, however, he does anything which causes a fatal accident, he has to stand his trial, just as a pilot who is guilty of wilful neglect will have to do under clause 354. No action for damages is taken against an engine-driver because of something which has happened, it may be, to the pulleywheel. The same thing applies in every walk of life. </para>

            <para>- Yes. No matter what class of employment we take, we do not find that men are held responsible for damage which may have taken place owing to certain accidents. For the first time, _ so far as I know, we are asked to penalize men who endeavour to perform their duty in a proper way. If the clause is allowed to stand, and I were a pilot, I should not move a boat in Newcastle harbor from the Stockton side to the crane for any one while there was a big swell. Very often, after a heavy rain, a week may elapse before the current subsides sufficiently to permit the moving of a boat with a reasonable chance of not incurring any damage. Under this provision, we shall at times of flood have the whole of that large district laid idle. A pilot will be amply justified in refusing to move a boat in such circumstances when he is made liable to the extent of  &#163;100  for any damage which may be occasioned to a boat under his control. It is not a fair provision to enact. Pilots do not receive large salaries, and very few of them who have to maintain a home have <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> In these circumstances, they are not likely to take a risk. Surely, if an accident happens in moving a boat, and the insurance company makes good the damage done, the owner can lose nothing. Why should a poor pilot who could not possibly prevent an accident be liable to pay to the extent of ^100 for the damage done? .1 hope that the Minister will take notice of the representations which have been made, and that, after reconsideration, he will see his way to eliminate the clause. In mv opinion, it is quite unnecessary, as ample provision is made in clause 354 to meet the case of a pilot who wilfully does any wrong in connexion with the control of a boat. </para>

            <para>- I wanted especially to draw the attention of the Committee to the fundamental difference which exists by reason of certain limitations in this Bill. When the pilotage system was a licensing system, there may, perhaps, have been some reason for imposing this liability on pilots as was done in the Merchant Shipping Act. In the . Old Country, where the pilots are licensed, they have to enter into a bond, and thereby a recognised liability is undertaken. But under our law the pilots will be Government servants. It is proposed to make them liable to the extent of .&#163;100, thus applying to them a principle hitherto unknown in the Public Service. The Cam.monwealth is not to be liable for any damage or loss occasioned by the neglect or want of skill of a pilot. It is to be protected; but the pilot, who is to be the servant of the Commonwealth, is to be liable for penalities. Of course, if a pilot is guilty of negligence, he can be dealt with like any other member of the Public Service. </para>

The fact that it was under the old licensing system that pilots were made liable to a penalty, has been lost sight of ; and it has escaped notice that, under the Bill, they will be Government servants.

            <para>- But the Victorian pilotage service is carried on under  a licensing system, and, of course, the provisions of the British law apply to it. Under section 620 of the Merchant Shipping Act, a qualified pilot appointed by Trinity House who has executed a bond, is not liable, for neglect or want of skill beyond the amount of the bond and the amount paid to him in respect of pilotage for the voyage for which he became so liable. Apparently, there is a bond for each voyage. The honorable members for Hunter and Hindmarsh are right in saying that it is unreasonable to exact this penalty for neglect or want of skill from pilots who are to be public servants, when other public servants are not similarly treated. A man who is unskilled ought not to be allowed to remain a pilot. Only qualified men should be appointed, and where there is wilful neglect or negligence the pilot must be punished; but there are other ways of punishing him. Clause 354 provides penalties for drunkenness and like offences. </para>

            <para>- That may be. In other services besides the pilot service risks have to be taken in proving the skill of those appointed to conduct them. The skill is often ascertained only by the manner in which a man discharges his duties. I do not understand the alteration that is proposed in regard to the liability of the master. The old Bill followed the English law, which is that the owner or master shall not be &#62; answerable for any loss or damage occasioned through the fault or want of capacity of a pilot when the employment of the latter is compulsory. The Bill makes it compulsory that the master shall take a pilot under certain circumstances; but says, nevertheless, that the owner or master shall not be exempt from liability for loss or damage occasioned by the fault or want of capacity of the pilot by reason of the fact that the employment of the latter was compulsory. It has been suggested that the departmental Committee of the Board of Trade recommended the re peal of section 632 of the Merchant Shipping Act, but that recommendation was made on the basis of the proposals and recommendations of the Committee which were anterior to it.  They altered the relationship of the master and pilot by putting the master in supreme authority, making the pilot merely an expert assistant. The idea of the Committee of the Board of Trade was that the master, who is the servant and agent of the owner, being in supreme authority, the owner should be liable. That is a legitimate and reasonable requirement, because the owner could pro&#39;tect himself by insurance against loss or damage. I think that the Government make a mistake, first, in putting the pilot in supreme command, and then in causing the owner to be liable notwithstanding. My view is that the master should remain in supreme command, and the owner should continue liable for loss or damage, he being able to protect himself by insurance. The English Act, which is a declaration of the common law, makes the owner liable; and if it is followed, as it was by the original Bill, clause 352 should be amended. </para>

            <para>- The Royal Commission went into this question at some length ; and it is perfectly true that there was some evidence showing that the proposal might press hardly on the pilots. But the Commission did not agree with that view. A pilot is an expert engaged for one particular purpose, because he possesses skill and knowledge. This clause provides that when a pilot does not display that special skill or knowledge, and anything happens, he shall be liable; and I am bound to say that I see nothing wrong in that. A pilot is a man who puts himself forward as an expert, and he may be placed in charge of a vessel valued at many thousands of pounds, and with many human lives dependent upon him. If he piles a ship up, and a Court of Marine Inquiry, on the evidence, decides that he exhibited gross negligence and want of skill- </para>

            <para>- Of course he may; nothing can relieve him of that liability any more than an engine-driver or a chauffeur can be relieved. But the position of a pilot is a special one. The master of a ship, in all other respects, excepting the particular skill in taking a. vessel in and out of port, is a thoroughly qualified man ; and if he does anything wrong he may be dismissed and is subject to all the pains and penalties of the law. I really do not see that the pilots have anything to complain of in this clause. They can only be liable when found guilty by a competent Court of jurisdiction ; and human lives and property of very great value depend on their skill and care. The community has to bear the brunt of any loss occasioned through wreck, collision, or fire, though insurance companies may shift it from one individual&#39;s shoulder and spread it over many individuals. And, of course, there are precious human lives to be thought of. If we delete the words referring to want of skill we do not advance ourselves at all, because, in a pilot, want of skill is neglect. A pilot ought not to put himself forward as a pilot unless he has skill, and if skill is not exercised there is neglect. When the Royal Commission made inquiries it was after the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> at the heads of Port Phillip. In that case it was, I think, the pilot&#39;s eyesight that failed. At any rate, he was incompetent. The Royal Commission in their report said - </para>

If not, then the New South Wales Government is liable for all damages caused through negligence or want of skill of its servants.

          <para>.- The case cited by the Attorney-General where a pilot piled a big steamer on the rocks was an unfortunate one in support of this clause. In that case, there was the loss of a ship worth ^100,000 at the least, and the fact that the pilot was liable to be fined ^100 was no compensation to the owner, no satisfaction to the captain, and certainly no adequate punishment to the pilot. The test of skill for the pilot service must be a thorough examination. The Government of the day must be satis- fied that the servants employed by them to do this expert work are competent men, and the fact that a &#163;100 penalty is hanging over their heads will not make them any more careful than they otherwise would be. As a matter of fact, the pilots will carry out their work to the best of their ability, not because they may be liable to a fine of ,&#163;100 if they are guilty of neglect, but from fear of the loss of reputation, and of the power of dismissal, which the Government will always have. That is the penalty which should be imposed on a pilot if he is guilty of the negligence referred to in this clause. I was very pleased this afternoon to have an assurance from the Minister that all rights enjoyed by pilots in the various State services are to be preserved. Whilst I do not doubt the assurance, I should like a guarantee to that effect to be embodied in a clause of this Bill. We have had experience in the past, to which I shall not refer in detail, of persons employed by the various State Governments having been taken over by the Commonwealth, and their State rights not being preserved to them, although they had an equal assurance from the Minister of the day. If there is one thing which this Parliament should guard more sacredly than another it is the honour of the Commonwealth service. We should be prepared to give these men a statutory guarantee that all the rights they at present enjoy in the various State services shall be preserved to them. Such a provision would only apply to those already in the pilot services of the different States, as in the case of other public servants. Any pilot coming fresh into the service of the Commonwealth would enter it subject to any conditions which the Government of the day might impose. </para>

            <para>- There was another point to which the honorable member for Hindmarsh directed attention just before dinner, and to which the Attorney-General did not reply. I mention it now in order that some Ministerial statement may be made upon it. One of the rights enjoyed by pilots in the service of one of the States is that they cannot be called upon to retire until they have attained the age of seventy years. </para>

            <para>- Then the honorable member for Hindmarsh has his reply : On coming into the Commonwealth service the South Australian pilots will have five years taken off their lives as public servants. That is a matter for consideration. We see at once that one right enjoyed by the State servants will not be enjoyed by them when they are taken into the service of the Commonwealth. It is just as well that we should clearly understand the position. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to say a word or two with regard to the preservation of existing and accruing rights of the men who will be taken over by the Commonwealth when this Bill becomes law. Clause  335  makes some attempt to preserve such rights. We must consider, however, that there is a great difference between the services rendered by pilots and those of public servants generally. There is in connexion with pilots a necessity for continual examination and test of their fitness for the performance of their reresponsible duties. Such .examinations and tests are provided for in this Bill, and at present by State Acts. The fact that the retiring age for pilots in South Australia is seventy years would not prevent them being retired at an earlier age because of a defect of eyesight, or any other disqualification due to advanced age. </para>

            <para>- That is so; and that condition of their employment would be preserved. If there is one matter which we should make clear, it is that affecting the rights and accruing rights of- persons now in the employment of the States, and to be taken over by the Commonwealth under this Bill. The Minister says that their rights will be preserved, and then admits that when they are taken over they will be subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act. That is a contradiction. It has already been admitted that, under the Public Service Act, the right enjoyed by the pilots of South Australia in respect of the age retirement will not be preserved to them. I think, with the honorable member for Boothby, that there should be some specific undertaking in this Bill which will remove all doubt as to the intention of Parliament. I am sure that no member of this Parliament desires that any person who is now in the service of a State shall, if taken over by the Commonwealth, be discharged if he is qualified for the duties of his position. The Bill provides that the holder of a licence granted by a State may, subject to the regulations, surrender it for a corresponding licence under this measure. Before the surrender takes place, the person interested may have to undergo a new examination under the Commonwealth Act. We have had considerable trouble in the Commonwealth over the alleged preservation of existing and accruing rights. The Public Service Commissioner found that the accruing rights of certain public servants taken over by the Commonwealth were preserved, and in other cases they were not recognised, with the result that there was discontent and dissatisfaction in the Service. This discontent and dissatisfaction would have been much greater had it not been for the fact that two-thirds of the appeals against the classification were allowed. Under this Bill, the Marine Board will be a Board of Inquiry. </para>

            <para>- The inquiry will be conducted by experts capable of judging the qualifications of men. In that respect, the Bill is better than the Public Service Act, since it makes provision for a Court of Inquiry composed of men who will be competent to judge the qualifications of those employed under it by the Commonwealth. I hope the Attorney-General will see his way clear to insert a provision which will protect the accrued and accruing rights of pilots, especially as those rights, in the case of other transferred public servants, have proved such a fruitful source of trouble. In regard to the proposal of the honorable member for Hindmarsh, it does appear to me that, whenever the Government introduce a Bill to authorize the taking over of any large service, they are extremely careful to protect the Commonwealth itself, whilst imposing upon others a liability which they ought not to be called upon to bear. Clause 351 seeks to impose upon a pilot a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> should any mishap occur to a vessel whilst he is in charge of it, notwithstanding that clause 354 provides adequate punishment for any such offence. Should a pilot be liable to the disabilities imposed by clause 354 for the unskilful navigation of a ship, and at the same time be called upon to pay  a  fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> under clause 351 ? </para>

            <para>- I take it that he could be so punished. For a minor offence, is he to be liable to a penalty of ^100? An engine-driver upon our railways is not liable for damages to the extent of ^&#163;100. If an accident occurs as the result of negligence on his part, he is subject to certain penalties under the law. But I know of no case in which he is liable for damages up to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;too.</inline></para>

            <para>- If it is not provided for in this Bill, a fine cannot be inflicted upon a pilot. This measure will override the common law where it specially provides for the punishment of offences. My contention is that clause 354 adequately covers any case of neglect on the part of a pilot. I think that the Attorney-General might pay some attention to the arguments which have been adduced in this connexion. He stated that he saw no reason why this fine should not be imposed. But he did not refer to clause 354, under which adequate punishment may be inflicted for neglect on the part of a pilot. We are attempting to legislate the Commonwealth out of its liability for offences committed by its servants. We say to ship-owners that our pilots are qualified to take charge of their ships, and we compel them to employ those pilots. </para>

          <para>It has been brought to our notice that it frequently happens that when the owner of a ship, or a wharf which has been damaged by the faulty navigation of a ship, is unable to recover from the owner of  that  ship, he seeks to recover what he can from the pilot. Our attention has been called to cases where the pilots have, in consequence, been made bankrupt. </para>

        <para class="block">The Committee went on to refer to the undesirableness of having liability piled up on pilots in this way. They reported that it was suggested that the bond in the London district, which is &#163;100 should be increased, but they went on to say - </para>

          <para>We cannot agree with this suggestion. We do not consider it in any way tends to add to the care and efficiency of a pilot to place him under a crushing financial responsibility for the damage he may cause. . . . We recommend that at all ports the pilotage authority should have power to make by-laws requiring the pilots to give a bond, and that when such &#187; bond is given the liability of the pilots should be limited to that amount, together with the amount of pilotage payable in respect of the vessel. A by-law of this nature should not be made  unless  it is desired by the majority of the pilots at the port. </para>

        <para class="block">That is to say, the by-law limiting the liability of the pilots should not be made without the consent of the majority.

            <para>- That is true. We desire to have in the service only efficient men, and we want those efficient men to exercise their skill and capacity. They are intrusted with very serious responsibilities, and we ought to have in the Bill whatever safeguards can be provided. If, as has been suggested, we were going to transfer the responsibility from the pilot to the master, there might be some reason for the attempt to remove this liability. If the pilot is to be in supreme command to the exclusion of the master, then the pilot should be made liable, and this clause should remain. If, however, we were going to adopt the suggestion that the master should be supreme, . and that the pilot should act only as an expert assistant to guide him, the relation of the two men would be altered, and there might be some reason for a change in regard to the matter of liability. Under the Bill as drafted, however, the master is to be entirely superseded. A master might arrive here in charge of one of the largest vessels from, oversea., and under this Bill as it stands he would1 have to give way to the pilot, who, because of his exceptional skill and liability in bringing the vessel into port, would be placed in supreme control. If the pilots are to be placed in that position some responsibility should attach to them. The Commission took evidence on both sides, and recommended the insertion of this provision,, which was urged as desirable, not by private individuals, but by competent authorities in the shipping world. </para>

          <para>. - I regret that we are discussing a series of clauses instead of dealing with each individually as we come to it. As I interjected whilst the honorable member for Darling Downs was speaking, clause 351 has been in all the Navigation Bills. The clause limits the liability of the pilot, and I am assured by the Attorney-General that if we leave it out the pilot may be liable for the whole of the damage, and so be absolutely ruined. If proceeded against under clause 354 for an indictable offence, he would probably be suspended for two or three months, while the trial was going on, whereas under this clause proceedings could be taken before the Marine Board, the whole affair would be over in a few days, and the man would go back to his work again after having been lined, if it was decided by the Court that he should be fined. Honorable members speak of the pilot as if Kie were an ordinary public servant, but he is not. He has been compared with the driver of a train, but if !the latter makes a mistake, and is brought before a Board, he may be reduced to the position of fireman or cleaner. A pilot, however, cannot be reduced to any other status ; he is either a pilot or nothing. </para>

Under a provision such as honorable members are asking for, that pilot would have been fined, perhaps, the full amount of the damage, and if that particular section had not been in the Victorian law he would have had to be dismissed. Something might have happened that he could not control. A sudden squall would have a great effect on some of the big liners, which are so high out of the water. </para>

            <para>- It would not be. Perhaps, in that case, there was some such cause for the accident, and possibly the fine was made less for that reason. It will not injure the pilots to leave the clause as it is. I am anxious to do the best for them, and to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth. I would not agree to strike out the whole of the clause. I think we should make the pilot responsible for a certain amount. He should know that there is some pecuniary penalty hanging over him. Without that provision, as one honorable member stated, he would have to be dismissed, and I do not think that would be a wise provision in the interests of the pilots themselves. </para>

          <para>.- The arguments of those who support clause 351 convince me more than ever of its futility. The Minister said that the clause was put in to deal with cases of minor accidents that were due, perhaps, to a mistake in judgment, but Ave contend that for that reason the clause should not be included, because a pilot should not be called upon to pay &#163;100 towards the damage done by a slight mishap of that sort. A case such as the Minister cited just now, where a good deal of damage was done through the fault of the pilot, would really come under clause 354. If the Marine Board decided that the accident was due to culpable negligence on the part of a pilot, he could be dealt with for an indictable offence. We all admit that it is necessary to take some power to prevent carelessness on the part of pilots, but clause 351 makes it possible for pilots to be cast in damages for small accidents which cannot be avoided. Manysuch accidents will always happen in Newcastle harbor, although the pilots there are among the most careful in the Commonwealth. I understand that in Great Britain a man enters into a bond. That is quite a different thing from fining him &#163;100. Fidelity guarantee bonds are common in many positions of trust. A pilot may have the misfortune in flood times to get two or three boats damaged, and mav be fined up to &#163;100 for each, even though the accidents were due to no fault of his own. If the clause is allowed to remain in the Bill, it will hamper operations in Newcastle, because when the river is in flood, the pilots will refuse to take the risk of moving ships. No such provision as this exists in Queensland or New South Wales, where the pilots are in the employ of the State Government. If it is not necessary there, why insert it in this Bill ? Why make the conditions of the pilots in those States worse than they are to-day? Why not preserve their rights, and refrain from imposing further pains and penalties upon them? </para>

            <para>- The Minister explained just now that if the clause were -struck out the pilot would be liable for the full extent of damages. If that is so. it is strange that no action has ever been taken in all these years to recover damages from the pilots in those States where this provision is not in force. It is now contended, that if we strike the clause out, we shall be making the pilots liable for the whole of the damage. There will be some difficulty in making them believe that, seeing that they have not had experience of it in the past. All that we require is sufficient power to deal with men who are negligent in the discharge of their duties, and we ought not to make pilots pecuniarily liable for any little mistake which may occur. A pilot&#39;s certificate might be suspended if the Marine Board thought that there was sufficient evidence to justify that being done. They might say, &#34; We think that this pilot has made a mistake, and consider it necessary to suspend him for a week or a month.&#34; But, under clause 351, we are imposing a money penalty that may mean that pilots will be mulcted in large sums of money which they can ill-afford to pay. The clause will seriously interfere with the trade of one of the leading ports of Australia. The weather at Newcastle is often rough for two or three weeks together. The pilots are always willing to move vessels about when requested by the owners. They are themselves anxious to keep the collieries working. But if this monetary penalty were hanging over them, and if the result of trying to bring a vessel to the crane in bad weather might be that a pilot would incur a penalty of &#163;100, he would not take the risk. It would be better for him to refuse to move the vessel, knowing that his salary would goon all the time. It must not be forgotten that the pilots of Port Phillip are working under a different system from that of the pilots of other States. It has been stated that the Government of Victoria lent them money to purchase equipment, and that it has been repaid, but, nevertheless, they are a private body. Are we to copy the conditions existing in connexion with a private concern, or should we not rather adopt a system applicable to the whole Commonwealth ? The pilots have given satisfaction to the State Governments, whose servants they are, and to ship-owners. Why, then, should the Commonwealth come along with a provision rendering them liable to heavy expenditure which they can ill-afford to incur? We are not justified in taking this course. When we reach the clause in question I shall vote against it unless the Government are prepared to do a fair thing. </para>

          <para>- - It would be well for the Minister to consider these clauses again in connexion with the question of liability. I have a doubt as to whether the master would be liable. We are proposing to change the English law, and we are declaring, by clause 352, that the owner shall not be exempt from liability by reason of the compulsory employment of a pilot. But from what does his liability arise? It arises from negligence. He can only be negligent if he is in charge. If the law takes charge from him by declaring that a compulsory pilot is in charge of the vessel, how can the owner be liable for negligence? If he is not liable for negligence, this clause cannot impose liability on him by saying that he is not to be exempt by reason of compulsory pilotage. In England the owner&#39;s liability for negligence is cancelled if there is compulsory pilotage. He cannot be negligent then. He is not in charge. Can we make him liable by taking charge from him and then declaring that he shall not be exempt? He must be liable before we can say that he is not to be exempt from liability. I am expressing a doubt for the consideration of. the Attorney-General as to whether this clause really does mean that if there is negligence, and it is the negligence of the pilot- as it must be, unless the captain interferes, or does not give advice where he ought to give it - the owner or master can be held liable. If the master is not guilty of either class of negligence - positive interference with the navigation, or neglect to warn the pilot against obvious danger - how can he be made liable for negligence? Does this clause make him liable? ft only says that he shall not be exempt. I am in doubt as to whether the clause does really imply that the master or owner will, in all cases, be liable where there is negligence on the part of the pilot, and no negligence is proved on the part of the master or owner. It is not, I think, a case in which the mere fact of a collision implies negligence. It is not a case for the application of the principle of <inline font-style="italic">res ipsa loquitur.</inline> You must prove, according to maritime law, that there is negligence. If a pilot takes charge of a vessel from the master, how can the master be liable for negligence? The only two classes of negligence, where there is compulsory pilotage, are those which I have mentioned. Tn the <inline font-style="italic">Tactician</inline> case, reported in 7 <inline font-style="italic">Law Reports,</inline> Probate Division, 1907 - a case in which the question of liability arose - Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton said, in the course of his judgment - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>I am of the same opinion, and for the same reasons. I do not think this case raises in any way the question of the duty of the master not to interfere with the authority of the pilot, but I think that, just as the pilot is entitled to the assistance of the master and crew of the ship in obtaining information as to the surrounding circumstances, so, in the present case, he was entitled to the assistance of the master in calling his attention to the fact that the inferences he was drawing from the surrounding circumstances were such as a competent mariner ought not to draw. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Now, <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> rule there is that the roaster ought not to interfere, because the navigation has passed out of his hands. Il it is free pilotage, it does not pass out of his hands, because he can, at any moment, assume the command of the ship. But if it is compulsory pilotage, he cannot interfere with the navigation ; and the duty cast on him therefore is not to interfere, and when there is an obvious misapprehension on the part of the pilot, to draw his attention to it. I think that something of the sort turned up in connexion with the loss of the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> some years ago. If my memory serves me right, the question of the non-interference of the captain was mooted, and it was contended that the obligation upon him was to tell the pilot he was making a mistake. So far then as to the possibility in our changing the English law - I am only saying the possibility - of leaving the master not liable. Clause  352  may not accomplish what we intend. </para>

            <para>- That is the question of the liability of the pilot. What I am pointing out is that clause  352  does not clearly change the English law ; that it does not make the master liable, although it professes to do so. That is one point. Should the pilot then be liable to the extent of  &#163;100?  That is a limitation. If a pilot is guilty of neglect of duty, he will be responsible for damages to the full amount of the liability otherwise prescribed. In England, that liability for all purposes is limited by the tonnage of the vessel; there is a liability of, I think,  _&#163;8  a ton. </para>

            <para>- I have passed on from the first point, and that is the possibility that we are wrong in saying that clause  352  makes the master liable. I think it is almost probable that, under the clause, unless negligence can be proved, the master will not be responsible; and, inasmuch as he is deprived of discretion as to navigation, he cannot be responsible for negligence, except that class referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">2&#39;actician</inline> case; that is, interference with the duties of the pilot, or in not suggesting to him the possibility of his going wrong. These are the two questions. As regards the limitation of the liability, if we do not keep in this penalty of  &#163;100,  there is no doubt that the pilot will be responsible to the full extent of the loss caused, except so far as it is limited by other parts of the measure. The Merchant Shipping Act does limit the liability for damages for loss of property to, I think,  &#163;8  a ton, and for loss of life or personal injury, to  &#163;15  a ton. I do not think that there is any limitation of that sort in this Bill; but the Merchant Shipping Act may apply. Section  502  of that Act reads - </para>

What I wish to point out to the honorable member for Nepean is that, unless this limitation is kept in clause 351, the pilot will be responsible for the full value of the vessel lost, or full damages for the injury to life or limb. </para>

            <para>-  1  agree with the AttorneyGeneral. An engine-driver, for instance, is liable for the full amount of the damage suffered in a collision. So is the Government. You can sue both together, or you can sue either, but you never sue the engine-driver in the case of a collision, for the simple reason that the Government is liable. But here we say that the Commonwealth is not to be liable, ls it right that we should always make the defendant the pilot? That is really the point, because if we say that the Commonwealth is not liable, who else but the pilot can be sued? In every case, therefore, if the master is not liable under clause 352, the person to be sued will be the pilot. I think it is just as well that we should consider this matter a little more. The Attorney-General is sure that the master is liable, but I think that there is some doubt about it. </para>

        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>It has been brought to our notice that it frequently happens that when the owner of a ship or a wharf which has been damaged by the faulty navigation of a ship is unable to recover from the owner of that ship, he seeks to recover what he can from the pilot. Our attention has been called to cases where the pilots have, in consequence, been made bankrupt. Both on the Clyde and in London it is a growing practice, we are informed, for pilots to be held liable for small amounts of damage. In the London Trinity House districts, and at some other ports, the liability of pilots is limited to the amount of a bond given by the pilot. In the London district the bond is ;&#163;roo. The suggestion has been made to us that the amount of the bond should be increased. We cannot agree with this suggestion. We do not consider it in any way tends to add to the care and efficiency of a pilot to place him under a crushing financial responsibility for the damage he may cause. If the pilot is negligent, his licence can always be dealt with by his Pilotage Authority, and it is, in our opinion, wrong in principle that pilots should have, in addition to the responsibility of their work, the danger of financial ruin, just because lae profession which they follow entails the handling of property of great value. The fact that owners of property should have been driven to look to pilots for the damage done to a ship or wharf emphasizes the unsatisfactory state of affairs produced by the present state of the law. We recommend that at all ports the Pilotage Authority should have power to make by-laws requiring pilots to give a bond, and that when such a bond is given the liability of the pilots should be limited to that amount, together with the amount of pilotage payable in respect of the vessel. </para>

        <para class="block">There you have a clear declaration of the state of the English law on the subject, which imposes no statutory limitation on the pilot&#39;s liability. If you strike out this provision, the pilot&#39;s liability, and that of the Commonwealth, will be limited only by the amount of the damage. No doubt in many cases the Commonwealth only will be sued, but probably the pilot will be often joined. If the honorable member for Hunter desires to exempt the pilot from liability for pecuniary damage, <inline font-style="italic">he seeks</inline> to do it in the worst possible way. It is better for a pilot to save himself from the consequences of his act by the payment of a pecuniary penalty than for him to be liable to suspension or dismissal. The honorable member referred to the New </para>
        <para class="block">South Wales Act. Under the regulations provided for by that Act, it is prescribed that a pilot who is guilty of negligence or carelessness in the discharge of his duties, whether damage to property has been caused or not, may be forthwith suspended by the Superintendent, or, in the case of a pilot at Newcastle, by the  Deputy  Superintendent, who may require him to produce and deliver up his licence pending inquiry. The Superintendent may settle the matter, and the pilot may be dismissed, suspended, or degraded. Under the Merchant Shipping Act the liability of a pilot appears to be unlimited. At any rate, it is such that pilots have been made bankrupt. That is regarded as an unfair liability by the Pilotage Committee, from whose report I have been quoting. This Bill provides for a limitation of &#163;100. The honorable member for Hunter takes the worst view of the position. I have not heard of an instance where a penalty has been exacted in Victoria, although the pilots here are liable. </para>

            <para>- In practice, a pilot would take out a policy in an insurance company doing this kind of business, and insure himself against the enforcement of the penalty by the payment of a yearly premium of, perhaps, 30s. or &#163;2. A pilot will be liable to the penalty only if found guilty of want of skill or neglect, which must be proved before a Court of Marine Inquiry. It would be for that Court, or some other Court of competent jurisdiction, to say to what extent, if any, the pilot should contribute towards making good the damage resulting from his want of skill or neglect. </para>

            <para>- The Department will have power to make regulations, but the report of the Pilotage Committee, which I have read, shows that it is not the practice to punish pilots other than by exacting this penalty. It is not suggested that their licences are forfeited, or that they are punished in any other way than by having to pay a pecuniary penalty. </para>

          <para>The action is brought, on the Admiralty side of the City of London Court, by the owners of a barge against a licensed pilot who was the compulsory pilot in charge of a ship. The action is brought in respect of a collision which took place between the ship and the barge, and which, it is alleged, was caused by the pilot&#39;s negligence, and for the purpose of this appeal we must assume that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the pilot. The question is, whether the City Court, on its Admiralty side, has jurisdiction to try the action. That it would have had jurisdiction if the action had been brought on the Common Law side of the Court cannot be denied ; the question is, whether it has jurisdiction to try the case on the Admiralty side. </para>

        <para class="block">That goes to show that the pilot&#39;s liability at common law is undeniable. Clause 351 limits that liability to &#163;100 where there has been neglect or want of skill. It would be a monstrous thing if both the liability of the pilot and that of the Commonwealth were taken away. Some one must be responsible. </para>

            <para>- A pilot would not be required to pay a money penalty if the damage were merely trivial. I do not think that the insertion of the word &#34; serious &#34; would make any difference. It appears to be feared that the clause might be used to oppress and harass pilots in cases where the damage was trivial, say, the mere rubbing the paint off a boat; but I do not think that that is at all meant. If the Minister of Trade and Customs has no objection to die amendment suggested by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, I have not ; but beyond that I think clause 351 should stand. </para>

            <para>- But do they come under the clause at all? I do not think it is fair that these pilots should.be left out, as the intention seems to be. They have an association, and all the earnings are pooled and divided every quarter, or. every half-year, as the case may be. They are receiving poor payment as compared with the services they render. The fees are based on the class of ship which travelled along the coast more than twenty years ago. Since that time the vessels have increased in size; and, under all the circumstances, I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to give this matter careful consideration. Not only have the ships increased in size, but the passenger traffic has also increased, together with the cargo freight. Most of the pilots, whose services are absolutely necessary, are taken on board at Sydney, and travel with vessels to Thursday Island, from whence they get a return journey south. </para>

          <para>. - The Torres Strait pilots are in a different position from that of any other pilots in Australia. Clause  331  specifically lays it down that the GovernorGeneral may proclaim the ports at which the employment of pilots shall be compulsory. In the Torres Strait it is not a matter of piloting from Cooktown to Thursday Island, but throughout the passage, and pilots are carried because they are necessary to enable vessels to travel night and day, instead of lying up at night. The case of the Torres Strait pilots has been considered, but it has not been decided whether they shall be taken over. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to know how coastal pilots will stand under this clause? There are pilots licensed by the Marine Board of South Australia who are very aged men. I understand that a coastal pilot is a pilot who can take a vessel, say, from Adelaide to Newcastle. Sailing ships frequently make use of the services of such men, because the agents or owners are of opinion that the captains do not know the coast very well. Are all these men to lose their livelihood when this Bill becomes law? I know of a case of a coastal pilot who is competent to take a ship to England. He left the pilot service in South Australia, and is now doing the work of a coastal pilot.

          <para>.- The honorable member for Hindmarsh has properly displayed some anxiety as to the position of pilots licensed under State Acts when this Bill is passed. It seems to me that by proclaiming certain ports as compulsory pilotage ports the Minister will take away the licences already granted. I do not know what the policy of the Government in this matter may be. There are some ports which are compulsory pilotage ports at present. The policy of the Bill is to have compulsory pilotage ports proclaimed where necessary. We may, I think, assume that immediately upon the passing of this measure such a proclamation will be issued in respect of all ports that are compulsory pilotage ports under State laws. That, it appears to me, will mean that in respect of all such ports the existing licences will be of no use. </para>

            <para>-  The case cited by the honorable member for Hindmarsh was that of a pilot taking a vessel from Adelaide round the coast, and calling at the various ports right up to Brisbane. A pilot could do that under this Bill provided he had a licence. Such a pilot would be engaged where the captain would not have an exempt certificate. </para>

            <para>- But I am referring to ports that are proclaimed compulsory pilotage ports. Of course, a master who has an exempt certificate will not require a pilot, as his certificate puts him in the position of a pilot. We are making in this clause express provision that no existing licences shall apply in respect of any port declared under this Bill to be a compulsory pilotage port, and all the compulsorypilotage ports under State laws will be proclaimed compulsory pilotage ports under this Bill. </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that they will have to apply for licences under the Bill. I do not suppose that they will be very difficult to obtain, or that the Minister will, by regulation, prescribe additional qualifications. But I point out as the effect of the clause, that in respect of compulsory pilotage ports existing licences will be gone altogether. As regards ports that are not declared compulsory pilotage ports, will not the States pilotage laws apply? If they do, the retiring age for pilots will be seventy years in South Australia. </para>
