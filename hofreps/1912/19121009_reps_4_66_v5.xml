                    <para>.- I do not desire to occupy the time of the Committee at great length, but I must confess that I was very disappointed last night with the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister in regard to the question raised by the honorable member for Darling Downs as to the position of the sugar-growers at the present time. I was very much surprised that the right honorable gentleman should have announced, as the definite policy of the Government, that nothing whatever is to be done to assist the growers of sugar at the present juncture. As this subject has already been debated at great length in the House, it is not necessary to recapitulate the whole of the disabilities under which the growers of sugar are labouring. Honorable members must be well aware of the state of affairs existing, and no one is in a better position to judge of the peculiar disabilities under which the growers are labouring than is the Prime Minister himself. It is for that reason that I am unable to understand why he is prepared to sit down and do nothing. It must be known, not only to him, but to every representative of the sugar-growers - or, perhaps I should say, of a sugar-growing district, because I think it would be a misnomer to say that certain honorable members represent the growers - that their condition is a very parlous one. It is more than likely that unless something definite is done, this industry, to which we have contributed so much- </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Trade and Customs has the reports of his own officers to the effect that the sugar-growers find themselves in such a position that it is impossible for them to go on planting. I can only enter my protest against what has been done unless this Parliament is prepared to go further and render, in the meantime, some assistance to the growers. The Prime Minister expressed the opinion last night that it was not reasonable that the superstructure, which we had built up by the operation of the Excise and bounty, should last for ever. The time had come, he said, when we must consider its total abolition. In speaking to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Ballarat, when the Sugar Bounty Bill was before us a week or two ago, the right honorable gentleman said that the time was not  yet ripe for the abolition of the bounty and Excise. I am strongly of opinion that it is, and that they should be immediately abolished. In advancing reasons why we should not immediately adopt that course, the Prime Minister said last night that we ought to be in a position, first of all, to insure that the industry would still remain white. I strongly hold that view. Having brought the industry into a condition where it is practically controlled by white labour, we should maintain it in that state. But the Prime Minister went on to give as the second reason why he had always advocated this superstructure, as he called it, that, by the operation of the bounty and Excise, the growers received their money, so to speak, in two parts - one part from the Government, and the other from the manufacturers of sugar - with the result that in that way they got more in the aggregate than they would otherwise do. If the Prime Minister holds that view, he is more sanguine than I am. I have heard the honorable member for Capricornia express the same opinion. </para>

                        <para>- I represent something like 900 growers. I have lived for a long time in close proximity to a number of them, and have heard this question discussed by many of them  on various occasions. Whilst I know there is a small proportion of the growers who hold the view expressed by the Prime Minister, I do not think that it is the view of. the majority. </para>

                        <para>- Taking the market price as the basis, and arranging for a fluctuating price in accordance with it over the period,- that might be done. We have had ample evidence brought before us of the feeling of the growers of sugar in this matter. They have held meetings and passed resolutions asking this Parliament to abolish bounty and Excise once and for all. The reason for that is that they operate as a tax upon themselves. When the Prime Minister says that the industry must be kept white, I should like to ask whether he or the Attorney-General have seriously considered our power under the Constitution to legislate differentially in regard to the employment of Asiatic labour. </para>

                        <para>- Our knowledge and experience of the Constitution was not then as extensive as it is to-day. I have no legal knowledge, but I suggest that, in view of the condition in which the sugar industry is to-day, the point I have mentioned should be seriously considered. If we have the power as suggested,. I ask the Prime Minister not to lose a single moment in endeavouring to deal with the whole question. We have had to deal with all matters connected with the sugar industry for some considerable time. We should test our power, which, I believe, would be found to be effective, to directly legislate to exclude Asiatics from employment in the sugar industry. There is every reason why we should immediately take steps in that direction, and abolish the Excise and bounty. There is a certain amount of cane being grown by black labour in cases where Asiatics own the land on which the cane is grown. It would no doubt be necessary for this Parliament to take some such step as that contemplated by the Parliament of Queensland, and provide for the compensation of those growers whom we should necessarily deprive of their means of livelihood. </para>

                        <para>- I have never said that the wages fixed are too high. I had a letter from a large grower in my district, in which he says that he does not object to the rate of wages <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> but that what Parliament has to realize is that the grower is at the present time carrying the whole industry on his back. He says that if that state of affairs is continued, the burden will crush&#39; him, and if the grower is crushed the industry will be crushed. That is the position, and if we have the power, as I believe, to directly legislate for the exclusion of Asiatics from employment on sugar plantations, we should exercise that power. It would mean the sacrifice of a certain amount of revenue which the sugar-growers are at present providing, and, I have always contended, most unfairly. They should never have been called upon to make this contribution to the Consolidated Revenue, which robs them of the effective Protection on their product to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per ton. The sooner this Parliament realizes the parlous condition of the industry - that cane which would otherwise have been planted this year has not been planted, and that the production next year is likely to be less than the production for this year - the better it will be for Australia and for the sugar-growers. </para>

                <para>I am sorry the Postmaster-General has been absent so much this session. through ill-health, and that, as a consequence, we have not been able&#39; to deal as fully as we should desire with a number of postal matters. Under the circumstances, I wish to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister the perfect state of chaos in the Construction Branch of the Post and Telegraph Department, which has been going from bad to worse for a considerable time. Last session I asked the Postmaster-General how many telephone lines in New South Wales were now approved for construction, how many others were under consideration, and how many the Department expected to construct last year. Speaking from memory, the reply given to me was that there were forty-eight telephone lines which the Department expected to construct in the current twelve months, that there were 132 under consideration, and ninety-two actually approved. It must be very evident that if -this state of affairs is permitted to continue, we can never hope to catch up with the demand for telephone lines in country districts; and since that date matters have not improved, but have got steadily worse. A number of the lines which the Department hoped to construct last year are still unconstructed ; that is to say, there are yet 132 under consideration, most of which, I suppose, have been approved since, and there are still ninety-two approved, while the forty-eight have not been constructed. </para>

                        <para>- That may have been the experience of the honorable member, but is such a state of things creditable to the Department or to Parliament? What can the system of management be that allows this branch year after year to drift more and more into chaos? Last session this Parliament . granted to this Department a sum of money that was simply staggering, and, in common with a number of other honorable members, I hoped that  there would be some reasonable expedition in the provision of telephone lines. I may here say that, so far as the actual consideration and approval of applications go, I have nothing to complain of. The Department is always willing to consider any fair proposition on its merits, and to approve of lines ; but of what possible use is that to the settlers who are struggling to get those connexions? A great deal of trouble might be obviated if there were anything like ordinary common-sense business methods adopted. There are some seven lines approved in my electorate, some of them in the time of my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, and&#39; others since I have had the honour to represent the constituency. I hoped sincerely that every one of these lines would be constructed during the present year at least - and I think that such an expectation is only reasonable after the lapse of three years. I have here a report forwarded to me by the Electrical Engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hesketh,</inline> from the Electrical Engineer in Sydney, and in this it is shown that these lines are Murwillumbah-Crystal Creek, Kyogle-Ettrick, Tabulam-Tenterfield, Mallanganee-Bonalbo, Casino-Coombell, Acacia Creek-Legume, and Murwillumbah-Tweed Heads. The report states that the material for the first four lines was called for in February last, and is expected to be soon available - the report does not say when. Then we are told that the material for the other lines is included in the schedule for which tenders closed on the nth September, and as this is not expected to be available until January next, &#34; all the preliminary action will be taken so that everything may be in readiness for the work to be proceeded with when the material comes to hand.&#34; Is it not fair and reasonable to expect, when Parliament votes huge sums of money for the benefit of the people of Australia, and particularly the people in the country districts, that the Department should lay in a sufficient stock of materials to be able to carry on the works expeditiously, and not rely on a hand-to-mouth policy? What sense is there in ordering material in little dribs and drabs? </para>

                        <para>- The time will, no doubt, come when a great deal of the material will be manufactured here. But I am given to understand by responsible officers that there are only some five or six manufacturers, or, at any rate, only a very limited number, who turn out this particular class of wire, and, further, that owing to the regulations framed by the Government for the guidance of the Department, the officers are hampered in the calling for tenders. It is said that if the officers were given a freer hand a great deal of the difficulty would disappear. I do not know whether that is so; I am simply stating what I have been told. </para>

                        <para>- I forgot that honorable members opposite were not familiar with the term. For their enlightenment, I may add that I was referring to the new standing order which imposes a time limitation upon speeches. As a result of its. operation, I had to eliminate some remarks which I desired to make last evening. In the first place, I proposed to make a few observations in respect of the Northern Territory. The more I reflect upon the matter the more I am convinced that in that Territory we have a big white elephant, and that the want of a policy on the part of the Government in regard to it is not calculated to inspire confidence in the ability of the party now in power to solve the problem of development. The figures relating to the expenditure to which we are committed in the Territory are assuming alarming proportions. During the years of administration of it by the Fisher Government we have incurred a dead loss of ,&#163;618,408, which is made up as follows : - Interest on loans for the year 1910-11, ,&#163;13,977, for 1911-12, &#163;159,662, and estimated interest for the current year, &#163;131,500, making a total under this heading of &#163;305,139. To this sum must be added contributions to the sinking fund under the South Australian Act. The figures in this connexion are as follows: - For the year 1910-11, &#163;4,600; for 1911-12, &#163;^8,869; estimated contribution for the current year, &#163;8,600, making a total under this heading of &#163;22,069. I think that we ought to have a quorum present. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed.)</inline> These figures make a total of &#163;327,208. To them must be added the resumption of Treasury ,Bills under the South Australian Act of 1904, in connexion with .which the sum of &#163;273,700 has been paid, and &#163;17,500 by way of interest on account current for the year 1910-11. These amounts make up the total to which I referred at the beginning of my remarks, namely, &#163;618,408. That is the amount of dead loss which we have sustained on three years&#39; administration. I come now to the question of expenditure. That has amounted during the period I have outlined to &#163;848,431, and is made up as follows : - For the year 1910-11, &#163;325,730; for 1911-12, &#163;248,316; whilst for the current year the estimate is &#163;274,385. Deducting such items as interest on loans, contributions to sinking fund, &#38;c, there still re- . mains an expenditure of &#163;238,000, for which we can show practically nothing. What can be shown in the way of the development of the Territory since it was taken&#34; over by the Commonwealth ? Certainly, we have agreed to a Bill authorizing the survey of a railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River  -  a railway which will lead to nowhere when it is completed. It will open up no lands for settlement, it will tap no industrial centre, and will serve no useful purpose whatever. It will not give access to cultivable lands, and, even if it did, there is no population to take up such lands. There is nothing in the Government policy which suggests that they have any serious intention of attempting to people this great empty space. Yet one of the main reasons for its transfer to the Commonwealth was that the South Australian Government were unable to finance it, that that State had sunk huge sums of money in an endeavour to deal with it, and was saddled with a heavy annual loss upon it, apart from the large capital expenditure which, it had incurred, and which, in addition to the annual loss on the administration of the Territory, had to be shouldered by the Commonwealth. On these grounds it was urged that it was imperative in the interests of Australia for the Commonwealth to take over the Territory, the Commonwealth alone being in a position to deal with it adequately and promptly. One of the main arguments advanced was that whilst the Territory remained in its then condition it was a constant menace to the safety of Australia, and offered a constant invitation to the land-hungry hordes of Asiatics who were our close neighbours in those seas. It was urged that we could not expect to hold it unless the Commonwealth took it over, and started an effective developmental and settlement policy. What has become of that policy ? We have heard nothing in the House of it. So far as we can see, no provision is made for it in anything that has been put before the House, either in the Estimates or the Budget. The place only serves at present, apparently, for the creation of billets, and as a happy hunting ground for a number of people, chiefly defeated Labour candidates and other hangers-on to the party in power. We are gradually getting ,a small army of civil servants up there, who do not appear to be doing anything very special. From all I can learn, the actual work is being done, not by the higher officials, but very &#62; largely by the constabulary and others in subordinate positions, who were already there. Let us examine how a great deal of the expenditure is allotted. Going through various subdivisions, I find that very little, if any, is left for developmental purposes. Salaries, contingencies, and expenses of administration absorb a great deal. </para>

                        <para>- I desired only to point to the character of the expenditure, and not to go into details. So far as I can find, no expenditure is for developmental purposes, but a large amount of the money is involved in various official Departments. About  117  officials have been appointed up there, with probably many more to follow, and what their duties are nobody seems exactly to know; but that their salaries are very high for the work they are doing seems very evident from a glance at the various amounts that make up the totals. It seems to me that this is a haphazard and useless method of procedure. We seem to have in the Territory an army of officials who are really doing no practical good. All the expenditure on the place seems to be for their benefit for the time being, and the only thing that may be regarded by some honorable members as an item in a developmental policy is the establishment of a Socialistic steam laundry, also solely for the benefit of officials. It seems ludicrous that that should be the only tangible thing on which we can lay our hands, unless we refer to one or two embryonic experimental farms or matters of that kind, which do not seem likely to give any good results. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, so far as I can see, it is only a place for officials - people drawing very fair salaries from the Commonwealth Government in a little State community, which has nothing particular to do, but is costing the country a huge sum. It would be much cheaper, so far as the country is concerned, if all those officials were pensioned off, The Government are only fooling with the question, and have not yet informed the House whether they have in their minds any schemes for the development of this important portion of Australia. We are still exposed to the same &#34;risks of invasion from our Asiatic neighbours, which were alleged to be so serious when the Commonwealth was urged to take the Territory over. The want of population there is just as serious a menace to-day as it was then. The whole thing seems to show that the Government have not the capacity for proper organization, or for formulating any developmental scheme for the population and settlement of the country. What steps, for instance, have been taken, in all that large expenditure that we have incurred annually during the last three years for advertising Australia, to make known that there is such a place as the Northern Territory, and that we want settlers for it? We are spending large sums of money in advertising the resources of Australia with the declared object of attracting settlers. I have -not seen, in any of the advertisements, any special reference to this great Territory, or the advantages that it offers as virgin country for the settlement of a rural population, and even of an urban population to supply their wants. No mention seems to have been made of the special advantages which it is supposed to offer to prospective settlers. I have previously made a suggestion - and make it again now, especially to this Government, seeing that they have a declared policy of Socialism - that the Territory offers an unlimited field for the demonstration of what a Socialistic community can really achieve. Here we have a huge empty continent, as large as several countries in Europe put together,  There are something like 6,000,000 Socialists in the world. Seeing that at the last Labour Conference it was accepted as a fact that the Labour party was a Socialistic party - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> mentioned the matter, and it was carried without a dissentient voice as far &#39;as I can learn, that they believed in the principles of Socialism - here is a fine opportunity for them. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that there are  117  officials there, but there are 6,000,000 Socialists yet to be satisfied. Here is the opportunity for which they have been hungering. They want a land where they will be untrammelled by the ordinary conditions of civilization, where Socialistic Governments have not got ahead of them, and made laws especially in favour of the capitalists, as they say. Here they can have a virgin country. Land can be taken up, not by the acre, but by the square mile. There are 6,000,000 Socialists hungering for such an opportunity, and here is a hungry land waiting for them to come and develop it. No&#39; one need interfere with them. The Commonwealth Government can make a separate State of the Northern Territory, and leave the Socialists to make their own laws from A to Z so that there may be none of those inconveniences of civilization which the Socialists look upon as barriers to the success of their cause. They can have a great divide there. Each man can produce for his own needs. The whole production can be distributed in the interests of the whole community, not for profit, but for the equal benefit of every member of it. Here is an opportunity to show to the rest of the world what a Socialistic settlement can achieve. I ask the Prime Minister and the party sitting behind him why they do not take advantage of the chance now afforded in this Territory which they say is so magnificent? </para>

                        <para>- Why do they not, indeed? Why, for instance, does not the honorable member for Capricornia go there? Why do not the Government make him Governor-General of the Northern Territory? They could commission him to formulate a scheme, and carry it out. There they could have their caucuses, and their collective meetings, and everything could be done according to the true Socialistic principle, with every man a captain of industry, and the equal of the Governor-General in all things. Why bother any longer about the capitalistic centres, such as Melbourne and Sydney, in which all the old capitalistic barriers exist to mar the progress of their beautiful ideals ? Why fight for them in those places where capitalism is so deeply rooted, when they have before them this magnificent opening untrammelled by any of the limitations which the bloated capitalist places in the way of the realization of Socialistic principles ? My suggestion is a serious one. I lay it before the Prime Minister for his consideration, but he does not seem to take the slightest interest in it. If I were as enthusiastic a Socialist as some of my honorable friends opposite are - the Prime Minister and the Minister of External Affairs, for instance - I should be only too glad to get possession of this Territory, where I might put my schemes into operation. But my experience of our Socialistic friends shows me that they always want &#34; the other fellow &#34; to do the pioneering and developmental work. They only want to share after he has made a success of things. They do not want to bear the heat and brunt of the troubles of the early pioneer. They want to come in when the capitalist has preceded them. </para>

It must be remembered that the late leader of the Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> on the floor of this House, was very particular to point out that the party did not become Socialistic until the year  1907.  I was one of the originators of the Labour party in Australia.

                        <para>- I do not know that they have any definite ideals now, but their practical methods are restriction, slavery, coercion, intimidation, the very antithesis of its original ideals. I suppose that is one of the reasons why they are not game to tackle the development of the Northern Territory on Socialistic doctrines. They believe those doctrines to be all very well in theory, and very good things to talk about from the public platforms, especially from the safe vantage point of the snug positions which many of them now enjoy. It is a sure winning card in the majority of cases to appeal to the self-interest and cupidity of those who have nothing else to appeal to. It is very pleasant to those who dream of enjoying wealth without earning it to hear them talk about the great Utopia which is to be developed under Socialism. And some of our friends do very well for themselves by their advocacy of their Socialistic principles without attempting to carry them out in practice. Some of them have come to recognise, notwithstanding all their diatribes against the bloated capitalist, and all their humbugging talk- about the tyranny of capital, that it is a good thing to obtain possession of a little capital on their own account. At any rate, as far as I can learn, some of them are trying to accumulate as much personal capital as they can, and some of the wealthiest men in this House are to be found among the Labour members. They find that they cannot carry on without capital any of the enterprises in which they find it personally profitable to engage. Consequently we find them striving to become capitalists themselves, while denouncing capitalists as the enemies of Labour. Such inconsistency would scarcely be believable, if we had not the evidence before us. .They are gradually learning the lesson that great achievements and developments are impossible without, capital, unless they resort to the most primitive methods of production. But they still continue to denounce capitalists as robbers. They find that if they only tickle the land with a bit of stick the stick is capital, and that they cannot cultivate without capital unless they are prepared to use their fingers - and I do not suppose that they are ready to resort to such primitive methods. I offer the suggestion to the Prime Minister in all seriousness. Here is his opportunity to invite the 6,000,000 Socialists of the world to leave the capitalistic countries in which they live, and go to the great Utopia provided for them in the Northern Territory. They can develop it, and show to the world what can be done as the result of Socialistic effort and combination. There will also be this advantage, that those countries which have not accepted the Socialistic doctrines, and which do not believe in the Socialistic ideals - those countries that still believe that every man has a right to accumulate as much wealth as he can as long as he concedes equal rights to other people to do the same thing - will be able to get rid of their Socialists, and be glad to see them doing well under the conditions in which they profess to believe. The ordinary flow of industry &#39; and capital can then proceed ir&#187; its uninterrupted course as it has &#34;done for centuries, and people can go ahead on individualistic lines, on those lines of freedom which we have been taught by theory and experience to believe are those upon which true progress is to be achieved. </para>

                    <para>Our mineral resources are limited in quantity and cannot be increased or reproduced. With the rapidly-increasing rate of consumption the supply will be exhausted while yet the nation is in its infancy unless better methods are devised or substitutes are found. Further investigation is urgently needed in order to improve methods and to develop and apply substitutes. </para>

The matter was brought under the notice of the Commonwealth Government of which I was a member, and with a desire to assist the Imperial Government, and to secure the proper representation of Australia, we approached the States, but their reply, I am sorry to say, was not sympathetic. Still, that is not a reason for declining to consult them now. </para>

                        <para>- My reading convinces me that that cannot be done in a short time. It is most important to us that the Empire should be made aware of our resources. The obtaining and publishing of information about them will lead to their realization by Australians, and to our understanding of the seriousness of wasting them, and in this way a policy may be developed for their conservation, preservation, and proper utilization. I presume that the Commission will take evidence. </para>

                        <para>- One Commissioner sitting across the sea cannot be expected to do everything. He has to consider, not only the Australian problem, but also the Dominion aspect of the problem, and, further, the international aspects of the Empire elsewhere. If I judge the nature of the duties aright, I believe that our own representatives will be keenly alive to the Australian position, and that a great deal of his time will be so taken up. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the right honorable gentleman not to merely depend upon State documents and tables which are already in existence, but to represent strongly to the States the nature of the Commission and its importance to Australia as a whole, and suggest that special attention be directed by them to the different resources which they possess. I shall cite a case in point. When the Iron Bounty Commission was appointed, at the instance of this House, to inquire into the coal and iron resources of Australia, we experienced the greatest difficulty in getting complete and detailed information. We considered some reports and departmental papers, but when we came to investigate our problem we found that that information was inadequate. We found it necessary to go to the individual States and get special documents prepared by the various officers concerned, in order that we might be able to truly realize what the resources of the States were. I believe that when the present Commission&#39;s report on the resources of Australia is presented it will call forth the same admission as was evoked by the publication of the report of the Iron Bounty Commission. Persons outside Australia admitted that they had not the slightest conception of the .enormous deposits of iron ore, or the magnificent deposits of coal that we had in Australia until the facts were tabulated and presented in a consolidated form, by the Commission which sat under the presidency of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline></para>

                    <para>.- Considerable time has been taken in rediscussing the past, the present, and the future of the sugar industry. The Opposition have failed to throw the slightest light, or to evolve any new ideas, on the subject, while, on the other hand, they have repeated and reiterated their former arguments and betrayed an amount of ignorance of the matter which is regrettable, or an amount of political jaundice which is still more regrettable. The position is very clear and distinct to those who are anxious to know the facts. While I have no wish to repeat what I have previously stated, I think it is necessary to point out briefly what appears to me to be the actual position of affairs. Over twelve months ago there was a strike, or a lock-out, amongst the sugar-workers. A year&#39;s notice was then given to the growers that agreements would be required to be entered into for the present season. Wherever agreements have been arrived at between the workers and the growers in regard to the rates of wages, there has been no difficulty, and the regulation which the Minister has promulgated has not, as honorable members opposite admit, settled what the rates of wages are to be, but has simply imposed upon the growers of sugar cane a certain liability, which incidentally deals with the rates of wages. The point I want to get at is that as soon as the sugar-growers are prepared to come to agreements with their workers as to the rates of wages in their districts, as soon as they can secure an award from any industrial authority in the district; the regulation of the Minister will automatically cease to operate. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that soon. What is aimed at is that whatever may be considered, rightly or wrongly, fair and reasonable in a district shall operate in regard to this industry. I am not one of those who take a light view of the importance of the sugar industry. Only those who have not visited Queensland or studied the importance of this industry can lightly waive it aside. At the same time, it must be said in regard to not only the sugar industry, but any other industry, that the rates of wages to the employes must be the basis of any consideration as to the right of the industry to exist. What the industry may be able to afford is not by any means the first consideration. Every industry in Australia, we contend, must be established on such a basis as to be able to pay every employ^, whoever and whatever he may be, a sufficient and reasonable remuneration for his services. No honorable member on the other side contends that the rates of wages in the sugar industry are too high. No one has yet stated that the growers themselves object to the rates of wages, and yet the growers are complaining of the regulation, and asking for some relief which, as far as I can see, can only result, not in the present rates being maintained,  but in relief being secured for the workers, whereas my contention is that if the growers were to make common cause with the workers, and secure from those who are reaping the fruits of the industry in an unequal degree, something like a reasonable basis would be found. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that any honorable member of the Opposition has yet suggested that that is not so. It is a matter of common acceptance that the industry is quite capable, even at the present time, of paying a much higher remuneration to the sugar-growers and the sugar-workers. Whilst in Brisbane last week I was asked how the growers could protect themselves - how they could secure to themselves a sufficient margin to enable them to pay increased wages. The wages are not too high, yet the growers are unable to pay them. That I frankly admit. I am quite ready to recognise that the return which the growers are receiving for their cane at the present time is not sufficient either to reasonably compensate them for their work or to enable them to pay increased wages to the  workers.  Then what are they, to do ? In my opinion they should do exactly what the workers do. The sugar- workers say, &#34; We demand a certain price for our labour ; we insist that we shall obtain a certain return for our exertion, and unless we get&#39; it you cannot have our labour.&#34; If the sugar-growers had the courage to adopt the same attitude to those for whom they work, and to say to them, &#34; Unless you give us a fair price for our cane - a price that will enable us to live in reasonable comfort, and pay fair wages - you cannot have our cane,&#34; they would overcome the difficulty. I should like to see the sugar-growers go on strike, and join forces with the workers to devise a means by which the profits could be more reasonably distributed. </para>

                        <para>- They have not gone on strike. But they are trying to create an artificial difficulty by locking out the workers. If they think that they are going to settle this question in that way, they are making a great mistake.  If  they think that by ruining themselves they are going to ruin the workers, let them -make the experiment. But what is needed, in the interests of both the growers and the  workers, is that they should combine against those who are above them, and whom I style the &#34; crushers &#34; - a name that is applicable not only to their methods of milling, but to their treatment of those with whom they deal. If they combined against the millers and the refiners, the trouble would be solved without difficulty. The position in regard to the bounty and Excise is also, to my mind, very clear. The Prime Minister has stated the policy, of the Government : that the Excise and bounty, being an artificial superstructure, and designed to be only a temporary expedient, might well be abolished under certain conditions. Honorable members opposite seem to try to throw upon the Government the option of accepting or disregarding the very condition which, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, is the one essential to the abolition of the Excise and bounty. They must realize, however, that the Government and their supporters are naturally somewhat sensitive with regard to that very condition. We cannot overlook the fact that whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham&#39;,</inline> on behalf of the Queensland Government, has expressed his intention to introduce a Bill to prohibit coloured labour in this industry, we have been misled so often by specious promises of reform in this regard that we may be naturally credited with the exercise of reasonable care if we say, in reply, &#34; Make your move, and then we shall act.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The remedy is very simple. If the Government in Queensland brought in a Bill to prohibit the employment of coloured labour in the industry, fits constitutionality could not be questioned. If such a Bill were passed, then from what I have heard of the Prime Minister&#39;s own views in the matter, and I believe that he speaks for the party behind him in this particular, the barriers which we now have in existence, and which have served their purpose, will be quickly removed. </para>

I wish to show that the care with which we are moving in regard to this question of coloured labour is fully justified. The coloured labour party in Australia is by no means dead, although we hear honorable members opposite declaring emphatically that they are in favour of a White Australia. </para>

During the last few days honorable members have received copies of the Papuan <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and I have here its issue of nth September last the leading article in which is entitled, &#34; Will Australia deny us the franchise?&#34; From that article I desire to make two quotations.

                <para>If the Mother of Parliaments, with an unexampled and world-wide experience of Colonial Governments, finds it a wise and just policy to confer the franchise on the Spanish-Carib half-breeds and negroes of the West Indies and on the mixed Eurasian populations of Cyprus and Malta, it is impossible to believe that the Labour Ministry of the Commonwealth will any longer deprive us of our citizenship in spite of the influential opposition of our Lieutenant-Governor.  . . . We claim that we are law-abiding Australians engaged in developing Australian territory, and Commonwealth legislators cannot legitimately deny us all political rights and citizenship. </para>
                <para>We cannot, and do not, believe that the Australian Parliament will any longer refuse us these civic rights that we would have undoubtedly obtained if we had remained a Crown Colony. </para>
                <para>We therefore confidently appeal to our fellow Australians to grant us this simple act of justice and remove from us the shame and the stigma of being classed along with the natives of Papua as a subject race. </para>

But danger creeps in, in connexion not only with the sugar industry, but with all means adopted for the development of Australian tropical regions, and we must be very careful about the course we pursue.

                <para>We are numerous enough to make our voice heard now if we only pull together and organise to make the few in power see things as we see them. As the local governing machine appears to have lost all sense of equity, let us band together and appeal to the Australian Government. Let us all sign a monster petition asking that the native be taxed to use his land or forfeit it, as in our case. This will be the first step towards equality. A good many more steps will have to be taken before Papua becomes a land of British justice. </para>
                <para class="block">What is behind all that? The introduction of coloured labour into Papua to compel the natives to work, whether they will or not, at a rate of wages that is simply a disgrace to any company employing even a native population. </para>

                        <para>- Only a few months ago the same party in Papua, who declared that sugar and tropical productions could not be grown successfully without black labour in the northern portions of Australia, wanted to introduce Javanese into Papua, a proposal diametrically opposed to the best interests of the Papuans. I make a quotation here from an issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Papuan Times</inline> of June last year, which was put into the hands of the Parliamentary party on the day we landed in Papua. I do not know whether what I propose to read was inspired for the occasion, but here is a little piece of poetry which appeared in that issue - </para>

                <para class="block">If there was one thing of which I was proud in connexion with the administration of Papua by the present Minister of External Affairs, it was his refusal to permit the introduction of Javanese into Papua. The proposal made would have been only the thin end of the wedge, and, -if agreed to, would have led to such an introduction of an alien population as would have been absolutely disastrous, even to the native population of the Territory. In the issue of 25th September, the <inline font-style="italic">Papuan Times</inline> goes a step further. There is an article in that issue on the introduction of aliens. It is peculiar that the writer should have used the <inline font-style="italic">nom de plume</inline> of &#34; Don Quixote,&#34; because in this case, I think, he will find that he is tilting at windmills.

                    <para>For my own part, I would prefer that the requisite coloured labour should be obtained from among our fellow subjects in India, but failing, this it could easily be obtained from Java, a small island with upwards of 33,000,000 of people. . . . Sooner or later it must be done here as this territory advances. We have vast areas awaiting the pioneer, and when the time comes for him to go forth, the labourer must be available to supply all that is necessary- for cultivation and development...... </para>

Even now if we had two or three good seasons there would be a dearth of labour. There are two courses open - (1) The hut tax, which practically would compel the native to leave his paradisiacal slough, or, in the event of our legislative philanthropists declining such a course of hardships (2) the introduction of races who will carry out all classes of work and open a new day in the annals of Papuan, industries. </para>

                <para class="block">These quotations are sufficient to show that there are still people in Australia, and they are by no means few in number or weak in influence, who are determined, at all costs, even to the extent of the abandonment of the White Australia policy, to introduce coloured labour from southern Asia. The writer of this article suggests the introduction of some of the people of Java, 33,000,000 of whom are within a short distance of our northern coast. I know of no greater danger to the advance of Australia, and certainly no graver menace to the development of our interests, than to allow Javanese, or even Hindoos, to get a footing in any part of Australian territory. If I am any judge of the temper of the Labour party on this question, any Minister of External Affairs, who would for a moment listen to any suggestion of the kind from the planters of Papua, or from the planters of NorthernAustralia, would have a -very warm time of it in the party, and probably a very hot time in the House. Therefore, when we see such suggestions coming from responsible authorities, and when we  heaT  so many repeated requests for the removal of the barrier of the Excise and bounty,&#39; which is the only protection we have against the introduction of coloured labour, honorable members must understand that we are not going to take any steps without carefully ascertaining the probable result. In the past we have had some very serious experiences in connexion with coloured labour. There are whole pages in the history of Australia alone that are not very much to our credit, in regard to our dealings with the native population. I am particularly -anxious that, whatever the control by Australia of Papua may be in regard to the -development of the possession as a country, there shall, at any rate, be one thing said to our credit, namely, that this Parliament never, by any action, vote or suggestion, -did anything that would hinder or obstruct, or be detrimental to the interests of the Papuan. The Papuan must be our first consideration, as, I think, is absolutely admitted by every man. Those who have visited Papua know that&#39; the Papuan is teachable, adaptable, clever, and reasonable if he is treated well, and there is no need for the introduction of any other coloured labour into a country that is capable of producing many of the tropical plants now grown in Northern Queensland. When we remember that the Papuan is a mere child -of nature, just emerging from the stone age - that he scarcely knows the meaning or use of a steel tool - and is incapable of understanding our ideas in regard to his control, education, and development, it is necessary to remember the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lawes,</inline> than whom none knew better Papua and the Papuan character, when he said that three things were necessary for the development of that country, namely,  patience, patience, patience. &#39; &#39; I am quite certain that, if we listen for one moment to those who desire the introduction of cheap labour, or more servile labour, into Papua, we shall be doing to that possession a cruel wrong that will react on us as a nation in the very worst way. I hope honorable members see the connexion between these remarks and the suggestions made in regard to the sugar industry in Queensland. By no action of this Parliament should we make it possible or probable, or even in the least degree to be suspected, that coloured labour will be again introduced to develop the industries of Australia. We &#34;have white men able and willing to do the work. There are hundreds and thousands of people coming into the country who can find nothing to do; and it will take years to profitably absorb those here now. Why there should be this intense desire to bring people here and leave them stranded - to find work, beg or steal as best they may - I am at a loss to understand ; and, under all the circumstances, we ought to exercise the greatest care in dealing with the future of the sugar industry. </para>

                    <para>. - I confess myself quite unable to appreciate the evident feeling of annoyance which the Prime Minister exhibits as member after member rises to address himself to this motion. The right honorable gentleman must know that, when we have granted Supply, we have to a large extent lost control over his actions. It is when we have control of the purse strings that we can most effectively attack him in the interests of the  people, and, therefore, I think he stands condemned in the eyes of the Committee for desiring to push through a Supply Bill covering an expenditure of something over ^2,000,000, as he intended to do last night, in the space of three hours. The whole thing is preposterous, and must strike the imagination of honorable members as a dangerous precedent. There are two or three matters of importance to which I desire to refer. I have frequently called attention to the regulation which has been applied to Victoria in regard to charging late letter-fees at railway stations. This does not commend itself to the Department as a matter of urgency ; and yet it is urgent. I have suggested before, and I suggest again, that, if the object of this regulation was to equalize conditions between Victoria and other States, that equalization should have been attained by creating in the other States the conditions that previously prevailed in Victoria. Only this morning I received a letter from Cobram, in my constituency, pointing out the serious inconvenience to which the residents there are subjected bv this regulation; and this case is only typical of that of other towns. This letter asks me to see if anything can be done in the matter, because, owing to the outward mail being made up before the arrival of the inward mail, there is no opportunity to reply to correspondence by return of post. By some attention promptly given the Government could confer considerable advantage on large numbers of people. Unfortunately the Postmaster-General is to-day conspicuous by his absence, as he often is. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General receives a very big fee to be here to attend to the business of his Department, whereas the Leader of the Opposition is not in such a satisfactory position. The Prime Minister was good enough to make me a promise that he would attend to this matter, but he has not done so yet; and, therefore, I urge on the Minister now leading the House to see that some satisfactory settlement is arrived at in the public interest. Yesterday I raised the question, but the Prime Minister treated it as one not deserving consideration. I asked whether the coming referendum was to be treated purely as a party matter - whether the Prime Minister had confessed to a correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that that was the attitude of the Government. If ever there was a matter of importance, this . is one. The electors should know whether a big issue which is to be submitted for their decision is submitted by the Government as a party question, or whether it is one which is to be viewed from the stand-point of the interests of the general community. </para>

By refusing to answer the question which I put to him yesterday, he practically gave his assent to the proposition which was laid down by that journal. Do honorable members perceive how far-reaching is the referendum question? We observe the power which the Minister of Trade and Customs has exercised in regard to the sugar industry. By an edict which he has issued he has arbitrarily fixed the rate of wages to be paid in that industry - a rate which is killing the sugar industry. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has. The effect of the edict which he has issued has been to stifle the sugar industry, and if the referenda proposals of the Government are carried, he will have power to stifle all other rural industries in the same way. There will be just the shortest possible interval allowed between the carrying of those proposals and effect being given to the rural workers&#39; demands. The enormous influence which the granting of these demands would have on the producing industries of Australia simply staggers the imagination. Our wealth is built up by our great producing interests, yet the Government seem determined upon bringing into operation conditions which will make the carrying on of rural industries unprofitable. The honorable member for Brisbane has taken up a most illogical position. He is always in favour of strikes. He was recently amongst the rioters and law-breaking strikers in Brisbane. He is on the side of the lawbreakers every time. He was on the housetops leading them in Brisbane. He is in favour of strikes amongst the workmen who are engaged in the sugar industry, and yet he declares himself in favour of the sugar producers, and anticipated that the sugar-growers would also . go upon strike. It appears that what he commended as the right thing to be done has been done. The growers are not planting sugar cane. The honorable member now says that their action is prompted by a desire to penalize the workmen in the industry. As a matter of fact that is not so. They are not planting sugar cane because the rate of wages and the conditions of employment which have been laid down as applicable to the industry, are such that they cannot comply with them, and consequently they have gone on strike. They say that under such conditions the industry cannot be profitably carried on, and they decline to continue operations solely for the benefit of the workmen. </para>

                <para>I come now to another matter which <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> of importance. Some time ago I moved for the production of a return showing the amounts which have been drawn by Ministers by way of travelling allowances. When that return was presented it contained quite a mass of figures. As will be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the  19th  December, of last year, page  4871,  the Prime Minister, in introducing this matter, said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I wish to intimate to both Houses that the Government think it would be fair for the Prime Minister, while on official visits only, to be allowed 40s. per day, and other Ministers holding portfolios to be allowed 25s. per day when on similar visits. </para>

                <para class="block">After a few irrelevancies, the honorable member for Bendigo interjected - </para>

                    <para>What assurance have we that Ministers might not engage in party business? </para>
                    <para>To that the Prime Minister replied - </para>
                    <para>I said on purely official business. If Ministers went on party business, they would, of course, not draw any allowance. </para>
                    <para class="block">The value of the return produced lies in the fact that it discloses that three Ministers have done the very thing which the Prime Minister said they would not do. It was upon this assurance that the House allowed the proposal to pass. Yet three Ministers have practically taken out of the Treasury a certain sum of money which the House has never consented to them drawing. The Prime Minister has no more interest in the Queensland State elections than has any other citizen of the Commonwealth. He had no official connexion with them whatever. But while the election campaign was in progress,, he visited Queensland. He was in that State from the 9th April to the 29th April. Deducting seven days, which he spent in his own electorate, there were thirteen days during which he was fighting a political battle for his own party in the Queensland State elections. He was fighting on the side of the Queensland Labour party in the election, and, contrary to his declaration and promise to this House, he was drawing his <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a day while doing so. If I find a man ready to put his hand in my pocket in one way, I am always careful lest he should do it also in another way. The return further discloses that the Vice-President of the Executive Council, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, was also in Queensland fighting the party battle. He was there for twenty-three days, for which he drew every day his 25s. He was giving expression to words that ought never to have been uttered by a responsible Minister of the Crown, and it is a scandal that this money should have been drawn by him. The third Minister who transgressed in this way was the Postmaster-General. When the Tasmanian election was on, it became necessary from the point of view of the Government, for Ministers to go there to help the party. The Postmaster-General did so, and gave utterance to words dangerous to the welfare of the community, and especially dangerous coming from a Minister of the Crown. During the time he was doing so, he was drawing his 25s. a day. In spite of the promise of the Prime Minister that if Ministers  went on party business they would, of course, not draw any travelling allowance, Ministers did draw the allowance, although they were engaged in party business. There is one other Minister whom I wish to mention. I regret that he also is absent, but none of those to whom I have been referring are in the House to hear me state the facts. As a matter of fact, Ministers are conspicuous by their absence, and ought to be here more frequently than they are to listen to what members of the House have to say. The Minister of .External Affairs was the leader of an expedition that went to the Northern Territory. According to the Prime Minister, the object of the travelling allowance was to cover Ministers&#39; legitimate travelling expenses. </para>
                    <para>The Minister of External Affairs was on a trip to the Northern Territory from 8th April to 18th May - forty days. During the whole time he drew his 25s. a day. There was no possibility during that time of his incurring personal travelling expenses. He was on the ship going and coming for a considerable portion of the time, and while in the Territory he was the guest of  His Excellency  the Administrator,&#39; Professor Gilruth. The whole of the expenses of members on that trip were paid by the Government. Unless the Minister of External Affairs chose for his own pleasure to put his hand in his pocket and spend money, there was no call for him to spend a single penny to cover his own expenses. They were paid by the Government, and, in those circumstances, a sense of moral responsibility ought to restrain Ministers from taking out of the Treasury money which they have never been called upon to expend, and calling it a reimbursement of travelling expenses. It is an unfair position for any Minister to put himself in. It is unfair to the country, and sets a bad example. Honorable members of this House ought to aim at a high ideal, and set a high and noble example of upright conduct. Whether this is upright conduct or otherwise I leave to the reflection of the Ministers concerned, and trust that in the future, when the Prime Minister, or any other member of the Cabinet, makes a distinct promise, having a direct personal effect upon his pocket, he will in no way violate it, because its violation means a degradation of the high office which these gentlemen hold as Ministers of the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- To charge this side of the House, or the sugar-growers of Queensland, with any attempt to introduce coloured labour to carry on the industry, is very unfair. There is no foundation for such an attack, and I could not connect the references of the honorable member for Brisbane to Papua with anything existing in Australia to-day. I am satisfied that the sugar-growers of Queensland are determined to give the White Australia policy a fair trial. It has proved a success up to the present time, and there is no reason why it should not be continued. It was a Liberal Government that brought in the measure in the first instance, and there has been no attempt on the part of any one to introduce coloured labour into the sugar industry since. I very much regret that that important industry is to-day being strangled merely for electioneering purposes, and in an endeavour to keep alive the cry of a White Australia policy, which, as a fact, has never been in danger. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour party must be about bankrupt for election cries, seeing that it is now raising the White Australia bogy. Its insincerity in regard to the White Australia policy has been shown by its refusal to accept the overtures of the Premier of Queensland, who proposed a system which, if carried into effect, would put the sugar industry absolutely under white labour conditions. The protection of Australians from the competition of coloured labour is an urgent matter, because we have as near neighbours the peoples inhabiting Japan, Java, China, and India. They number nearly 850,000,000, and are a menace to us industrially as well as politically. </para>

                <para>Coming to another matter, the honorable member for South Sydney would have the Committee believe that the bounty on wool tops is advantageous to the people of Australia. I am perfectly open-minded on the subject, and some time ago asked the Minister of Trade and Customs if he had made inquiries as to the effect of this bounty on our wool industry. He replied that he had,, and I hope that before further action is taken the report or reports furnished to him; in the matter will be made available to honorable members. At first sight the granting of the bounty appears to be opposed to the platform of the Labour party and to the policy of Protection. There has been, a great outcry against the exportation of.&#39; butter, wool, meat, and other produce,, while local prices are abnormally high, but we are paying a bounty for the manufacture of wool tops for export. We spend&#39; &#163;10,000 annually in encouraging this industry, but our woollen manufacturers who make their own tops get no advantage from it. It is foreign manufacturers who are benefited by the bounty. </para>

                        <para>- We could do without the bounty on sugar if the Excise were abolished. Why should we pay a bounty on wool tops made for export? There are rumours regarding the effect of this bounty about which inquiry should be made. I do not accept them as true, but they may be true. Our industries should be self contained. We can breed and rear sheep,, produce wool, make tops, and manufacture the best cloth in the world, and why should we give a bounty of&#189;d. per lb. on wool tops made to be exported for the benefit of Japanese and other foreign manufacturers ? </para>

                <para>The Government, in the Bill which they wish to introduce, ask for Supply for three months, an unprecedented request, the sum which we are asked to provide amounting to ,&#163;2,250,000. Apparently, Ministers wish to strangle criticism. Supply must be granted, but it is unreasonable to ask for three months&#39; Supply. At the present time grievance day - coming once in three weeks - provides the only opportunity that we have for the ventilation of grievances, -except when Supply is asked for, and on grievance day before the . last the Minister of External Affairs applied the &#34;gag&#34; to the discussion by moving the adjournment of the debate.  His  notion is also without precedent. Since then the time usually allotted to the consideration of private members&#39; business has been taken from us, and on the last grievance day - three weeks since - the honorable member for Robertson tried to count out the House when the honorable member for North Sydney was speaking on a very important question affecting military matters. It appears, therefore, that there has been on the part of the Government a determined attempt at every opportunity to block criticism from this side of the House. They now bring down a Bill providing for three months&#39; supply, and say, in effect, to the Opposition, &#34; You must dispose of it in about four hours. That will close your mouths absolutely for another three months so far as grievances are concerned.&#34; We do not feel inclined however, to take these things sitting down. It is not very often, that I address myself to a matter of this kind, but the occasion justifies my action, and when my rights are trampled on or interfered with, I shall be found to be just about as hot a man as there is in the House. I regret that the Minister of Home Affairs is not present, because I desire to criticise certain action on his part. If he did not know how to &#34;run the earth &#34; before he reached the important position he now occupies he is learning fairly fast, if not exactly how to run the earth at least how to&#39; fool people, and make them believe that he is running the earth. Recently I endeavoured to obtain from him some information. I do not, as a rule, ask questions to serve as mere political placards, nor with a desire to harass Ministers. I do not think that any Minister will accuse me of having asked questions for mere party purposes. When I&#39; address a question to a Minister, it is with a desire to obtain information, and it was because I desired to obtain information from the Minister of Home Affairs with regard to  the Electoral Act that I recently put to him three questions,  the first of which was - </para>

I do not suggest for one moment that we as citizens have not individual responsibilities. We are supposed to have at our fingers&#39; ends the laws of the country; but, unfortunately, everyone does not know that, and although we are not, in duty bound to do so, we should, at least, recognise some moral obligation to make people acquainted with their responsibilities in this regard. If, as- I understand, the Act distinctly provides that every person who does not send in an application for an electoral claim card is liable to a penalty not exceeding  &#163;2,  and the Minister, through his officers, simply transfers the names from the old rolls to the new, what will be the position ? Persons looking at the new roll, and seeing, their names appearing on them will come to the conclusion that everything is all right,, when, as a matter of fact, everything is alt wrong. That was the information that I1 sought to extract from the Minister, and which he tried to avoid giving me by quibbling in this way. </para>

There is another matter to which I desire to refer. Some time ago I received a telegram from the council clerk at Ipswich asking me to obtain from the Minister of Home Affairs permission for the council to try some lighting experiments in connexion with the Ipswich post-office clock. When I saw the Minister he did not know exactly whether or not the matter came within his control, and he advised me to see the Postmaster-General. I did so. The Postmaster-General treated1 me with every courtesy, and on  17  th July last wrote to me saying that the Department was quite agreeable to the experiments being made, provided that the- council undertook all responsibility.

                <para>It has struck me that it is. necessary that we should understand exactly the Administration to whom we are granting Supply. I find that there are possibilities of a rift in the lute so far as my honorable friends opposite are concerned. I find, for instance, sitting opposite to me the Honorary Minister, whose skill in debate, especially where the facts are not commonly understood, is admitted in this chamber. I usually see also on the opposite benches the Minister of Home Affairs, whose skill in debate is not so recognised, although a&#39;s a phrase-maker he occupies a very high position, and his works, I understand, are very well worth watching. If we grant this , &#163;3,000,000 in the present circumstances, there is some possibility of . there being a trifling disagreement between my honorable friends to whom I have just referred. I have here a report of a speech made in the Masonic Hall, Yarraville, by the Minister of Home Affairs, which seems to reflect in a most unfortunate way on the Honorary Minister. I invite the attention of honorable members of the Labour party to it, so that when they hold their next conclave - I understand that it is out of order to say &#34; caucus &#34; - they will be able to deal with the Minister of Home Affairs for being so disrespectful to the Honorary Minister.

                        <para>- What I have read is a very serious reflection for one Minister to pass on his colleague. So far as the spoils of office are concerned, the profits are &#34; whacked up &#34; amongst those with portfolios. Is it a fair thing that the Honorary Minister should be paid nothing, because he is said to be only a talker and not a worker ? It is not a fair way to deal with the honorable gentleman, and I take up the cudgels for him, for, no doubt, on a question affecting his personal merits, he will be as bashful as only he can be on occasions. It is not a fair statement to make of a colleague, who, though he may be only an &#34; orator,&#34; is not useless to his party on occasions when the facts are not generally known. </para>

                <para>I hope that the Government, before the session concludes, will find it possible to do tardy justice to the municipalities of Australia. I have a motion on the notice-paper dealing with this question, and shall, therefore, not touch on the details now, but merely say that the principle is now receiving ready recognition throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, that the Government should pay for services received from the municipalities. If there is not time to do this work this session, let us begin early next year, because, in the interests of sound finance, as well as fair dealing, every Government agency should be credited with its proper income and debited with its proper expenditure. </para>

                <para>I should now like to refer to a little matter on which I have spoken on a previous occasion, though only in the most sensitive and feeling way. It will be remembered that, during the Werriwa byelection, the Minister of , Home Affairs gave some instructions in regard to the use of the old roll at Crookwell. I do not wish to make party capital out of the matter, or suggest that the honorable member recognised that the work of his Department in collecting the new rolls was inefficient and in a hopeless tangle, and that, therefore, it was better to use the old roll. But I do desire him to give some explanation whv he should personally step in and direct his officers to use a roll which, under the law, should not be used, in preference to the roll on which his Department had been busy for some months. </para>

Generally speaking, the Minister of Home Affairs has to bear most of the kicks to which his party are justly entitled. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the Minister ought not to bear the blame for all those things which the party do secretly. We found out that what he did openly had been done secretly by his colleagues for months previously. The action was either good or bad - I do not wish to traverse it at the present time. If it was good, or if it was bad; - as every man will say it was who does not belong to the aristocracy of Labour - the Minister was not solely responsible; he only made himself the standard-bearer of the principle. A number of his colleagues had begun to find that there was something seriously wrong, with the health of the Minister of Home Affairs, and seemed to deplore the necessity for his resigning his portfolio. I rejoice to know, however, that he was never in a better state of health than he was then, and is now, and that his brain was never more acute or active than when he made himself the standard-bearer of preference to unionists in the Government Service, and so, incidentally, made it compulsory that he should retain his place in the Cabinet. I do not always attack the Minister of Home Affairs, because I recognise that he, on occasions, displays the good quality of openness and candour.  His  efforts at secrecy resemble those of a whale in an aquarium - however he may try to hide himself we must see some part of him. The Minister of Home Affairs should tell us what grounds he had for believing that the new roll was so defective that it was necessary to use the old roll. </para>

                        <para>- The new distribution is much nearer to that ideal than was the old distribution. I have 47,000 electors in my electorate, and it would obviously be very unfair to ask them to vote for merely one member, when some other electorate, with, perhaps, some 20,000 voters, will have a member to itself. We owe it to the principle of Democracy to rectify our electorates at the earliest possible moment. </para>

We do not legislate for inanimate matter, but for flesh and blood; but the heresy is creeping into the Chamber, and we should put our foot down. A vote is a vote, from whatever part of Australia it comes.

                    <para>.- The position I put forward last night in respect to the land available was to some extent challenged, so I took the trouble to inquire this morning of the Lands Department of Victoria, and found that in addition to large areas of Crown lands which might be obtained on application, the Department has 450 allotments available under the Closer Settlement Act. </para>

It is not to be supposed that the Victorian Government are going to provide thousands of allotments of land for people, and have them on their hands. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite willing to admit that any land bought for closer settlement purposes in any part of Australia is certain, owing to the variable quality of the soil, to contain a certain number of allotments that will not be very attractive to people. These allotments, however, are spread over various parts of Victoria, and the great bulk of them are eminently suitable for the purposes for which they are offered. Some of them are in areas as low as 20 acres in the middle of good irrigation districts. </para>

                        <para>- All I can say is that the land is made available for the applicants, so far as the Government are able to get applications. We know that there always is a difficulty in every country in inducing people to leave the excitements of city life and brave the difficulties of early pioneering settlement. We have that difficulty to face, not only in connexion with a large number of the immigrants that come to Australia, but especially with many of our own residents. </para>

The honorable member knows something about the Swan Hill district, and so do I, but I doubt if he knows very much about any other district. It is an exceptional district, with a very limited irrigation area. When the honorable member chose a block, he went to the Swan Hill district, into what I consider to be one of the very best irrigation centres in Victoria. So good is it, and so limited the area, that the whole of the land there was snapped up as soon as it was made available. </para>

                <para>We are falling behind in the race for population as against Canada. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> about six months ago, published a very interesting table showing the immigration to Canada, and comparing the progress of the United States with Australia in the matter of the increase of population. In a hundred years the population of the United States grew from 8,000,000 to 91,000,000, largely through immigration from Europe, but to-day, it is stated, &#34; The influx of immigrants into Canada is greater in proportion to the population than ever it has been during all that century of remarkable progress in the Republic. The tide has set towards the Dominion. During the fiscal year ended March, 1910, no fewer than 208,000 settlers arrived. Of these, 59,700 came from Great Britain, 45,000 from the Continent of Europe, and 103,000 from the United States.&#34; We saw recently some remarkable figures in respect of the growth of the population in Canada. The gain in that country during the last ten years has been about 2,000,000; and 1,250,000 have migrated to and settled in the western portion of the Dominion. Our increase for a similar period has been less than half that number. It was stated last night by the honorable member for South Sydney that there was a prospect of an increase of population in Australia this year of about a quarter of a million. I can only discover that we have, so far this year, obtained about 70,000 to 75,000 immigrants, and in view of - the limited shipping accommodation the probability is that if we gain 100,000 people for the whole of Australia this year it is all that we shall do. Now is the golden time for the present Government to act. After many years of representation in Great Britain, and often very slender advertising on the part of the Commonwealth and the States, we have now reached a period when the eyes of the British emigrant are turned towards Australia. I believe that a certain improvement could be made in the direction of the class of immigrant that is coming to, Australia from Great Britain. A more searching scrutiny and investigation should be made into the character of the persons who are desirous of coming to this continent. If any complaint is to be made, as was made last night by one of the Honorary Ministers, to the effect that a large number of  immigrants coming to Australia are physically unfit and not desirable, the fault lies at the door of the present Government. If they had taken in hand the work of selecting the immigrants in Great Britain, and also providing shipping accommodation, as was their bounden duty, the Commonwealth would have controlled the whole of the immigration policy of Australia. The Government, however, being pledged against any form of immigration which would enter into competition with the local labour market, have not only neglected their duty in regard to the selection of the class of immigrants most fitted to develop the resources of this continent, but have failed lamentably and inexcusably to provide the necessary shipping accommodation to enable those people to come to Australia. That is accommodation which can be provided only bv the Commonwealth Government. </para>
                <para class="block">I regret that the Minister of Home Affairs is not present to make a statement as to the intention of his Department with regard to the status of the Chief Electoral Officer for Victoria, and the Commonwealth Statistician. It is high time that those two officers were raised to a judicial status that would make them free from the influence of Ministers, and also of Parliament. A bi-monthly digest of the statistical data of Australia is being issued in connexion with the pamphlet circulated by the Minister of Home Affairs to give members information regarding the progress of public works in the Commonwealth. I fail to see the relevancy of that mass of data to a plain schedule of works. Some very pertinent questions were asked in regard to this matter by the honorable member for Richmond a little while ago. The Minister of Home Affairs is using the public money to publish data, supposed to be compiled by the Commonwealth Statistician, in order to bolster up the policy of the present Government. It is time this misapplication of public money was ended. The pamphlet is supposed to be an impartial, plain business document, detailing the stages reached by our public works from month to month, but in the same publication is a large mass of tabulated information, and also a list of Bills passed by the present Government, and replies to various criticisms - all supposed to be compiled as judicial documents with the approval of the Commonwealth Statistician - the sinister as well as the ostensible object of which is to bolster up the policy of the Government. Public money should not be used for that partial and political purpose, and the sooner we raise the Commonwealth Statistician to a judicial status, in order that he may resist any pressure brought to bear upon him by the Minister in charge of his Department, the better it will be for the safeguarding of the public money. It is also time the Government brought down a proposal to raise the Chief Electoral Officer to a similar judicial position, making him completely independent of Parliament, as are the Public Service Commissioner and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Of recent years this House has passed a most reprehensible form of legislation, taking away the postal vote from women who are unable to go to the poll - from the men and women who are unable to reach the polling booth because they are ill, or too old and feeble to go there. We have not had a word of guidance as to the operation of this provision, and the only person able to make a reliable statement on the subject, free from party bias, is the Chief Electoral Officer. But he is under the control of the Minister of Home Affairs, and has not been asked to report on the subject to Parliament, so that honorable members cannot ascertain his opinion. If his office were raised to an independent status, like that of the Public Service Commissioner, and it were the duty of the occupant to periodically furnish Parliament with a review of the working of the electoral law, so that we might provide the best means for conducting elections, it would greatly facilitate legislation, and enable us to create the most efficient machinery possible. </para>
                <para>I draw attention to the absence of a definite statement in regard to an all-red cable and telegraph line of communication between Australia and the United Kingdom. The Pacific Cable Board controls a cable stretching from Brisbane to Vancouver, and the overland telegraph line across the Dominion of Canada ; it remains to provide an independent cable across the Atlantic. </para>

                        <para>- I wish now to refer to another matter which has already been discussed, but which is of so much importance that I should be recreant to my duty if I did not bring it under notice on every possible occasion, that is, the neglect of the great rifle club movement. It is very unsatisfactory that, whilst our defence expenditure has increased from about &#163;1,000,000 at .the inception of Federation to about &#163;5,000,000, the rifle clubs of the Commonwealth, which, in 1905, numbered 770, in 1911-12 numbered only 1,120, the full strength of their members having increased in that time from 37,000 to 50,000. The greatest increase in our defence expenditure has occurred since 1908, when the rifle club membership was 57,000, and it is now only 50,000. It is surprising that this House, which contains so many representatives from country districts, who know the value of rifle clubs as an auxiliary to the main defence force, and the need of skilled marksmen, should permit the neglect of which I complain. We know how readily the bulk of the adult population of the country districts would support the rifle club movement if reasonable encouragement were given to it by the Minister of Defence in providing and equipping ranges where required, and in giving free ammunition. If Australia had a large number of skilled marksmen, it would go a long way to remove the stigma of ineffectiveness from our land defence. Were the rifle clubs encouraged, and made an integral part of our land defences, their membership would increase by leaps and bounds, and we should soon have three times as many effective riflemen as we have now. But it seems to be impossible to galvanize this Government into action in the matter. However much the Minister of Defence may have devoted his time to the other branches of the Defence Force, he has neglected the rifle clubs, leaving them to the mercy of his Department. Although the Defence Department is the biggest spending Department of the Commonwealth, it is not represented in this House by its Ministerial head; so that members cannot get any direct reply to their questions, and find it impossible to secure a redress of grievances. I hope that even at the eleventh hour this matter may be rectified. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Brisbane this morning said that the trouble in the sugar industry is due entirely to the exorbitant profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. He advanced the questionable contention that we should have nothing to do with an industry which could not give a fair remuneration to all connected with it. He went on to say that the growers of sugarcane do not get enough for their produce, and that &#39;the wage-earners are insufficiently paid, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s shareholders taking all the profits.  His  contention is the sort of statement that goes with the crowd, but it will not bear examination. However, I ask whether he or those who repeat statements similar to his have ever set about ascertaining the actual profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company on its Australian business, and the effect of distributing those profits among the cane-growers and wage-earners. I find that the total profits of the company last year amounted to- &#163;228,357. </para>

                        <para>- That has nothing to do with the argument I am now presenting. My case is that if the whole of the profits of the company were distributed among the cane-growers and wage-earners connected with the industry, their position would not be materially improved. According to the last Budget figures, the cane-growers number <inline font-style="italic">5,561,</inline> and if &#163;20, which is not a very large amount, were given to each of them out of the company&#39;s profits, the sum of &#163;111,220 would be absorbed. If the balance were divided amongst the 31,554 workers, apart from the growers, who are engaged in the industry, it would allow them &#163;3 14s. per annum each. If each grower were allowed a little less than 10s. per week more, and the wage-earners were granted about rs. 6d. per week more than they now receive, the whole of the profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company would be in that way disposed of without materially affecting the position of any one else. On these figures, it was sheer nonsense for the honorable member for Brisbane to talk as he did today. After all, supposing that the-profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are too large - I do not know whether they are, but we shall be able to judge when we receive the Sugar Commission&#39;s report-!- - </para>

                        <para>- The point that I wish to emphasize is that, if the whole of the profits of the company were divided amongst the growers and workers in the industry, they would not materially alter their position. Allowing fair interest on the actual capital invested by the company, which runs into very large figures indeed, we could not deduct from the total amount of profit which they make more than about &#163;70,000 to &#163;80,000, and that, split up amongst all those engaged in the industry, is neither here nor there. Therefore, whatever is wrong, the members of the Government must look somewhere else for the actual cause of the trouble. I have been asked many times to give some definite evidence of the fact that I have stated here over and over again, that the Excise is paid by the grower, and also for definite evidence of the fact that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the other millers have agreed, if at any time the Excise and bounty are abolished, to pay an additional amount per ton to the growers. I have just received, through the courtesy of the Farmers&#39; Association, of Hambledon, a copy of a memorandum of agreement made between the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and Frederick Charles Patrick Curlewis, of North Hambledon, sugar-farmer, who has a farm of 80 acres, which is a registered area for bounty purposes. The agreement -is duly signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curlewis,</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> on behalf&#39; of the company, and in the schedule of payments it is set out that the farmer can be paid either a definite rate per ton for each year, or that he can receive payment on the percentage of obtainable cane sugar. It is further provided, under Scheme &#34; B,&#34; that- </para>

                        <para>- My opinion is that it is worth a great deal. I have no desire to labour the question, but unless the Ministry choose to take it into consideration, and deal with it at once, the results are going to be very serious. Growers cannot carry on under existing conditions. There are two or three courses open to the Government. They may, first of all, equalize the bounty and Excise. That would assist the growers materially at the present time if the Government did not wish to touch the other legislation. I believe that the Government have the power under paragraph xxvi of section 51 of the Constitution to pass legislation excluding black labour from the sugar industry. If they do not choose to exercise that power, but prefer to rely upon the promise made by Mr. Denham, well and good, but they should take immediate action in one direction or the other. </para>

I do not know who supplied the Minister with the figures, and for my purpose it does not matter by whom they were supplied ; but the statement read by the Minister is only one more addition to the many instances afforded in this Chamber of - I was going to say the absolute ignorance of the persons on whom the Minister relies, to deal with these questions </para>

What is more, if they had not been challenged in this House they would have led to a most erroneous impression. No one who had any knowledge of the industry, unless he deliberately intended to produce a wrong impression, would have selected the months covered by the return. The Minister has either to acknowledge that the persons who supplied him with the figures knew nothing whatever about them- </para>

                        <para>- The Minister was asked to give a statement showing the comparative prices of meat and butter here and in the Old Country. These prices were calculated at a time when there was practically no butter exported. I have received a letter from a representative of the Gippsland and Northern Co-operative Selling Company, enclosing some very useful figures, which I should like to place before the Committee as showing that the comparison of which I complain is a very unfair one. My correspondent gives me the actual figures of one typical factory. He says - </para>

                    <para>The last few shipments arrived at a time when the market was depressed, owing to the threatened industrial troubles which came later, and&#39; you will notice that the prices are under Melbourne parity. The factory gained by sending their butter to London over <inline font-style="italic">&#163;800</inline> more than if they had sold in Melbourne. Furthermore, if the butter had not been shipped, but sold on the Melbourne market, the additional butter would have had a depressing influence here; also, if the London market towards the end of the season had remained normal, the factory&#39;s profit on the butter sent Home would have been well over&#163;1,000. </para>

                <para>You will notice from the list we are giving you that the quantity shipped from Victoria to the United Kingdom for March was very little, only totalling 630 tons, so that, as far as we can see, no Australian butter has been landing in London for some months now. It is possible that during the month of May London buyers purchased on the weak market which was prevailing at that time (prices then being about 106s. to 108s.) and cold stored, with the idea of making a profit, and this is the butter that is now being disposed of. </para>

Taking the London and local prices over the period embraced in the return to which I have referred there were only three or four shipments on which the London prices did not show a profit to the factory. It stands to reason that no factory will knowingly ship butter to London when it is known that a loss will be made. </para>

                        <para>- It is only done when there is reason to suppose that the London price will be above the local price; otherwise, the butter is stored here and sold during the winter months. These are matters of common knowledge in the trade ; and yet the Minister quoted prices when we are not shipping any butter, and during the period which the Minister selected to give the comparative prices here and in London, although the price here is governed entirely by local supplies and conditions, he compared the local trade with the few boxes of butter - a mere bagatelle - sent during the winter months and sold in London. Such a comparison is sheer nonsense ; and nobody would make it who had any desire to do a fair thing by the industry. I should like to know who is responsible for the figures. If it be the man on whom the Minister relies for all his information, we can thoroughly understand why it is that we can never get any satisfaction. The man is either an utter ignoramus, or he deliberately intends to mislead the country in regard to the position. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wonder at some time being taken over Supply Bills, because they represent the only opportunity left to honorable members to ventilate questions outside the ordinary Government programme. The Government have not only decided to take away the time previously devoted to private members&#39;&#39; business, but are calling upon us to sit early and late. Under the circumstances it is excusable if honorable members take whatever opportunities present themselves for ventilating questions in which they are personally and particularly interested. I should like to call the attention of the Honorary Minister to some very hard cases in the Defence Department. There are quite a number of warrant officers and sergeant-majors who, almost every day, are expecting their marching orders, owing to the fact that they have reached the age limit. These men have grown old in the service ; and, I suppose, the cases brought under my notice in New South Wales are representative of similar cases in the other States. One of the men I have in my mind has twenty-eight years&#39; service in the Australian Forces, or forty-five years altogether, including his Imperial service; a second has thirty years&#39; service; a third twenty-seven years&#39; service; a fourth twenty-two years&#39; service; and a fifth twenty-nine years&#39; service. Under the regulations these men will shortly be asked&#39; to retire, and they will have to go out into the world without a penny. I should like the Minister to see if he cannot obviate this trouble in some shape or form. These men have never received more than a living wage, and a very bare living wage at that ; indeed, the highest pay given is very small in view of the responsibility and the work done. In every other defence service in the world, so far as I know, there is some sort of retiring allowance; and it seems to me that the Government ought to take steps, and quickly, to alter the present condition of affairs, because, otherwise, we cannot hope for an efficient army. We are face to face with a very serious problem. We turn out a number of these men year by year; and if we take it that there are something like twenty-five in New South Wales, we see that this means quite a large number throughout the Commonwealth who are thrown out on a cold and cruel world in their old age. I suppose, of course, that some of these men will be kept on j and I -confess that I hope they will. I &#39; never could bring myself to believe that it is right to turn these men out without any prospects in their old age; and I trust the cases I have mentioned will be brought under the notice of the authorities with a view to softening the blow. If it means that some technicality of the Department has to be violated, I think the House would be glad to be behind the Minister in condoning anything of the kind. These men ought to be treated justly and kindly. One has had fifty-one years&#39; service, including his Imperial service; and he is one of the finest old men I know. I see that the Pacific Cable Board have published their balance-sheet again this year. Various items are set out, including one of &#163;30,000 a year for renewal; but I see no mention of interest. I should like to ask the Postmaster-General if it would be possible for us to learn whether that cable is becoming payable or not. My own impression is that something ought to be done, very seriously and earnestly, to induce the British Government to come to reason about the cable on the Atlantic side. I have not heard yet whether anything was done at the late Imperial Conference. </para>

                        <para>- I should not let the matter rest. That modicum be tween the price now charged and what it would cost us to run the thing would turn this into a paying proposition. I arn not so anxious about making it a paying proposition as about increasing its utility. I have long thought that whenever the Government could save a little money, it could be very well utilized in increasing the facilities given by the Pacific Cable. T do not see why it should not be possible to get a column of closely-printed news  day  by day over a cable of that kind. It would lead to a little more competition with the other cable, and, therefore, to more efficient service, although I think the service is efficient enough now ; but our isolation ought to lead us to multiply to the fullest extent possible every means of bringing us into closer daily touch with the great affairs of the world outside. </para>

                        <para>-  It is about thirty years. By the way they are financing it now ; they are paying all expenses, and will have enough money to get a new cable at the end of thirty years. We are not only paying for the cable, but are paying for a new cable for posterity, which, I think, is absurd. </para>

                        <para>- If the item for renewal does not include interest or sinking fund, then the original debt remains. Either there must be an item for interest and a sinking fund to wipe out the original debt, or it is all included in the &#163;30,000 a year for renewal or amortization. No one could tell from the statement I saw published this morning, actually what is being done. It is  only  a single cable, after all, and may go wrong any day. if the teredo finds a weak spot in it, it is good-bye to your cable. Another peculiar difficulty is that the Pacific Cable is in deeper water and on more difficult ground than any other. I remember  the reports I used to get many years ago from the engineers in New South Wales who were opposed to it. They said it was so deep, and so risky to have only one cable, that I was advised strongly to have nothing to do with it; but I pushed on in spite of the expert opinion of those days. </para>

                        <para>- I have always been in favour of that sort of Socialism. In the early days of this Parliament I tabled a motion in favour of the Empire owning all its cables, for defence purposes among other things. It was on the paper for one or two years, but I could never get to discuss it. I worked wholeheartedly to get the Pacific Cable going; but we could not make any headway until we induced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Chamberlain, at Home, to cast his weight into the scale, and then we got it, and a consequent reduction of charges over the Eastern Extension Company&#39;s line. I see the honorable member for Adelaide smiling. I do not wonder, because the. South Australian representatives fought like Trojans to get every bit of advantage for the Eastern Extension Company. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. He was the originator of the whole scheme. I take a keen interest in the Pacific Cable, because of .the battle we had to get it going, and the undoubted advantages that came, both then and since, to cable users throughout Australia. All I want the Minister to do is to see that the balance-sheet is put on the table, so that we may see exactly how the undertaking comes out. I should like to deal with the Sydney Government House matter, but the Prime Minister is not here.. I cannot acquit him of blame in this regard. The State Government have acted with ineffable meanness over the whole question, even from&#39; a business stand-point.. We are paying New South Wales now &#163;150,000 a year, at least, for interest on. transferred properties alone. One would think the State Government would throw, a little matter like the interest on Government House in. Whatever view we may take, the Government of New South Wales cannot be commended for what has happened. On the contrary, its action is to be strongly reprobated. But this Government should take steps to see that the Governor-General is able to continue to reside in Sydney during; the remainder of his term of office. The State Government, having turned him out of Government House, Sydney, this Government should see that he does not: suffer. This is the more important, because the people of New South Wales are not behind its Government, and if the State were polled to-morrow the electors would say that the Ministry misrepresents them on this question. The Commonwealth Government as well as the StateGovernment stands for the people, and it should say that during the term of office of the present Governor-General, at any rate, no change should be made regarding his residence in Sydney. What, after all,, is per cent, per annum on the cost of Government House, Sydney? That sum, should not have stood in the way of an agreement. The Imperial authorities treated us very differently in another connexion. When we decided to build a Fleet Unit, consequent upon which the Australian Squadron was to be withdrawn, from our shores, the Imperial Government said, &#34; We have &#163;1,000,000 worth of property at Garden Island, in Sydney Harbor; you can take that.&#34; There was no condition attached to the offer except that the property was to be used for the maintenance of our Fleet Unit. Therefore, we should not stand at a trifle in. connexion with the housing of the Governor-General, who represents the King, and is chosen for us by the Imperial Executive. </para>

                <para>There is an apparent show of reason in the contention that one State must not be treated differently from another, but there-  is not much in the argument when examined. In the first place, the Governor-General has always hitherto had a residence in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- If the matter is to be dealt with on a purely business basis, there are several things to be taken into consideration. For instance, New South Wales contributes to the Commonwealth revenue more per head than any other State, with the exception, perhaps, of Western Australia. Then, she has a population equal to per cent, of the total population of the Commonwealth, and it is safe to say that she provides at least 38 per cent, of the total revenue of the Commonwealth. In the last year of the bookkeeping system, New South Wales was the only State which was at a disadvantage. On the basis of that year she receives , &#163;450,000 less than is due to her on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, while all the other States receive more, Victoria making a profit of &#163;120,000 or&#163;130,000. These facts must be considered when an equitable hard cash arrangement is talked of. </para>

Honorable members opposite are desirous that the Governor-General shall have two residences, because he is not a Labour man, but, should the people of Australia ever elect to that high position &#39; a man sympathizing with the Labour policy, they would not merely object to him having two residences, but would wish to make him pay his own rent. When there was a possibility of a Labour member being chosen  President  of the Senate, it was proposed to reduce the salary attaching to the office, but honorable senators generally were willing to increase it if one of their own party continued in the position. The honorable member for Parramatta says that the Government of New South Wales does not represent the public opinion of that State, but, in my view, it represents the public opinion of Australia. The idea of having two residences, each containing about 120 rooms, for one Governor-General ! </para>

                        <para>- A similar argument has been used in regard to the Royal Family, which costs about . &#163;500,000 a year. It is said, &#34; Look at the money spent on fine dresses, flowers, champagne, &#38;c. What a fine time that gives to the shopkeepers.&#34; I believe that it is contended that the visit of the Governor-General to Sydney is of great benefit to the poulterers of that city, where you cannot get a fowl for less than 4s. 6d. or 5s. during his term of residence there. If the Governor-General is provided with a residence in Sydney, he should also have one at Brisbane, another at Rockhampton, and another at Townsville; and I am pleased that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is placing a branch office of the bank in the capital of each of the three great divisions of Queensland. Let us have a residence for the Governor-General in every big city in the Commonwealth, so that the absurdity of the present proposal may be exposed. The contention that the Governor-General should have a residence in Sydney is merely pandering to the jealousy of a certain few people of that city, who think that it is of great advantage to the people of Melbourne to have the Governor-General residing here, and that their city would take a back seat if he did not visit it. The original arrangement grew out of the jealousy between New South Wales and Victoria, which is fast passing away, and now remains only in the minds of those politicians who years ago used to wrangle about the virtues of the two States. I hope that honorable members will cease to beat the big drum about this question. I trust that they will cease suggesting disloyalty on the part of Messrs. McGowen, Holman and other members of the New South Wales Government merely because they wish to set apart that magnificent building, Government House, Sydney, for public purposes. The people of Sydney have too few public spaces and public buildings; and I sincerely trust that honorable members of the Opposition will refrain from suggesting any further that, because Messrs. McGowen, Holman, Beeby, and other members of the democratic Labour Government of New South Wales propose to set apart Government House, Sydney, for the use of the people, that they are wanting in loyalty. The honorable member for Illawarra has been beating that particular drum -for the last two days. I do not think that he paid the Governor-General a very high compliment when he suggested that  His Excellency  went to Sydney and did certain work which this Government was not prepared to do. He made that the text of his speech, and the newspapers, strange to say, gave him an extraordinarily full report, elevating a petty question of this kind to the level of a matter of great national concern. The Labour Government of New South Wales represents public opinion, and is, in my judgment, perfectly loyal to the interests of the people of Australia. If ever&#39; Australia were in danger, the New South Wales Labour party and its supporters, who were challenged by the honorable member for Illawarra and others, and who have been held up to the public view as being disloyal, would be the first to&#39; take up arms in its defence. That is the best test of loyalty. Loyalty is not put to the test when we are making after-dinner speeches, waving flags and wrapping the Union Jack around us. The time to show our loyalty is when we have to fight for our country; and the Labour party and their supporters will be the first to shoulder the rifle when that day comes. </para>

                        <para>- They certainly stop a lot of poultry. Those who are making such a song of the alleged disloyalty of the Labour party of New South Wales might have been physically fit at one time to do something in defence of their country, but they are not to-day, and it ill-becomes them to talk of disloyalty on the part of our party. I shall not refer further to this subject save to inform honorable members that a glance at the statistics will show that the cost of Government House, Melbourne, and Government House, Sydney, is really enormous. The expenditure, I think, is unnecessary. I am looking forward to the time when we shall have appointed as Governor-General of Australia a man with Australian sympathies. I am looking forward to the time when it will be deemed quite proper for the Governor-General to be approached at certain times of the year by any good citizen, and for him to shake hands with him just as the people can shake hands with the  President  of the United States of America. The very people who are making this outcry in Sydney are those who desire that the Governor-General shall reside there in order that they may have entry to Government House. I desire a different state of affairs in Australia. If I were not a member of Parliament, I should not so to speak, &#34; get a look in &#34; at Government House. The idea of maintaining these institutions in Australia is that they shall be kept for a certain select few - for the rich or the friends of the rich. Such a view sets up a wrong standard of excellence and erroneous ideas in the community. It leads people to spend a lot of money in trying to keep up a position which they cannot properly maintain, and I therefore object to my honorable friends of the Opposition raising this outcry. </para>

                        justification for the purchase of another motor car by his Government is that a man receiving over &#163;500 a year should not have to spend his time in tram cars and cabs when getting about the city or suburbs. With only -one car available for general use that was compulsory, and it is urged, for the benefit of -doubters, that the new car has been obtained with the sole object of expediting the business of the Commonwealth. The suggestion that it -might be used for other purposes is resented.

                <para class="block">I was a good deal surprised when I read this paragraph. I was astonished, in the first place, to learn that the Government were proposing to employ the money of the electors to provide a third Ministerial motor car ; and I was surprised at the suggestion conveyed by the remarks of the Prime Minister, as reported in the paragraph, that these cars were intended solely for the use of officials employed by the Commonwealth in order that they might be enabled to move from place to place with more rapidity than had been the case. The business of the Commonwealth was carried on for ten years without it being found necessary to employ motor cars or any other luxurious means of locomotion. Shortly after this Government came into office, however, we had, first of all, one motor car purchased; in a little while a second was secured, and we are now to have a third. It appears to me that it is only a matter of time when each Minister will have a motor car for his own use, and probably two or three, in addition, to provide &#34;joy rides&#34; - that, I believe, is the correct term - for friends and supporters of the. Labour movement. </para>

                        <para>- The Government evidently think that they have  a  right to luxuries at the expense of the electors, and as this is about the last opportunity that we shall have of considering and challenging this action on their part,. I think it well to take advantage of it. I intend to give the Committee an opportunity to say whether this luxury for Ministers is one for which the country ought to pay. We  all  know very well that these cars are not used exclusively by Commonwealth officials. As a matter of fact, they are used to  a  much greater extent by members of the Government. So far as my experience goes, it is very rarely, indeed, that I have seen any officials using the cars, with the exception of the magnificently-clad chauffeur, who has, I presume, to attend at the behest of Ministers, and wait on their convenience generally. </para>

                        <para>- I see no reason why Ministers should not also have their own cars. They are paid at  a  rate which ought to enable them&#39; to have motors - not, perhaps, of the magnificent dimensions of those at present employed, but sufficiently modest to escape the condemnation of many of their supporters. I cannot understand why this Government did not avail themselves of the opportunity- presented of proving their democratic tastes, and their desire to show the people who support them that they are not anxious to spend money unnecessarily on luxuries for themselves. Just imagine what a very great advantage it would have been to the Labour movement for Ministers to have been seen, careering up Bourke-street to their duties in Parliament, on the democratic bicycle, perhaps, on  a  very hot day, the perspiration dropping from their Ministerial noses, and their portfolios, like the Minstrel boy&#39;s harp, slung behind&#34;. Instead of that, however, we have Ministers sitting in luxurious motor cars supplied by the country, the said cars driven by luxuriously dressed chauffeurs - also, I suppose, supplied by the country - with luxurious rugs on their knees, presumably bought out of the money of the electors. We all have the advantage of railway passes, which enable us to travel on the railways, and Ministers could use those passes if it pleased them to do. so. They have other methods of locomotion if they are anxious to get about their duties. If they desire to do something in a hurry, which requires a journey in a vehicle, there is no earthly reason why they should not ring up for a taxi, or even an ordinary car, and have it at their -disposal just as soon as the Ministerial car could be brought round. The only difference is, of course, that the cost of taxi-cabs would probably appear in detail; whereas, once the Ministerial car is provided, there is an end to general criticism by Parliament as to the expenditure. The same remarks apply even to the officials. I cannot see that the running about of either officials or of Ministers is of such a continuous nature as to justify the use of three motor cars. I feel certain, from my own experience, that a good deal of the travelling of those motor cars is of a kind that the country has no right whatever to pay for. </para>

                        <para>- It applies to the cars I am now discussing. It is no argument whatever to remind me that State Governments may have motor cars, and use them. There are many duties performed by State Ministers that necessitate their taking somewhat long journeys frequently into the country ; but such duties do not have to be performed by Federal Ministers. </para>

There were many who supported the Labour movement in the belief that it was to be the introduction of higher and better things in public life. I did so myself for many years, and only surrendered the position very unwillingly, indeed. Now that the Labour Government are in power, I think it has been proved that a great deal of that fine talk was only intended for the purpose of beguiling the electors, and directing their votes towards Labour candidates. The party has certainly succeeded in beguiling many, but I believe that the other process of disillusionment is now taking place; and circumstances such as I have indicated are the best proof of the whited sepulchre that the </para>

                <para class="block">Labour movement really means.  I have not kept a very close eye on the working, of the Ministerial motor cars, but it has been my chance to see them used on different occasions, not by Ministers, and not for public duties. I saw one of the carson one occasion loaded up with ladies,, evidently shaping for a nice trip into the country ; and, on another occasion, I saw a car, when Parliament was not sitting,, used by a Minister for shopping purposes. I take it that those chance instances which, have happened to come under my own observation quite accidentally, are an indication that those cars are not used altogether and entirely in the service of the country, but that they are there for a variety of purposes, one being to supply Ministers with a luxurious method of getting to and from their homes. I fail to see that it is the duty of this Parliament, or Government, or of the electors, to provide motor cars to enable Ministers to drive between their offices and their homes. I take it that they have the same right as we ordinary members have to pay their way about in this respect, without taking more than the privilege we have in the way of a gold pass to travel on the&#39; State railways. I feel quite sure that the cases I have mentioned represent many other occasions when these cars have been utilized, not for the purposes of government - not for furthering the welfare of the country, or in order that some journeys may be more rapidly performed than otherwise they would be- but simply because they are found to be very convenient in a variety of ways for those Ministers, who, perhaps, have not that keen conscience in the employment of public moneys that many of them on the public platform profess to have. The expenditure, perhaps, involves an odd thousand or two only, but the principle is a very important one, and for that alone I am contending. The provision of these motor cars amounts to a misuse of the public funds, and, as an indication that the Committee does not approve of such expenditure, I move - </para>

                        <para>- We have very clear evidence, this afternoon, of the truth of that statement, and I am very glad indeed that this matter has been raised, not by an ordinary member of the Opposition, but by one who has &#34; ratted &#34; from the party on which he is now endeavouring to cast a slur. No one, except in bitterness, would deny that in these days it is necessary, not only in the country&#39;s business, but in ordinary business, that motor vehicles should be used. It is all a matter of saving time. There were no cars available for the Federal Government ; and some time ago .one was purchased and placed at the disposal of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. This car, when it was not required by the Prime Minister for public business, was at the disposal of the other members of the Government when engaged on public business. Then the Minister of Defence found that, in travelling about on business connected &#62; with the saddle and harness factory, the cordite factory, and other Commonwealth institutions, much of his time was taken up in using and waiting for tram cars; and it was felt that his time, if he was at all fit for the position, ought not to be wasted. A car was, therefore, provided for the Minister of Defence in order that he might more expeditiously get about on his work of supervision. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, there are; but I venture to say that if these public vehicles were hired, the cost at the end of the week would prove more than that of the Ministerial car. That car is used almost exclusively by the Minister of Defence, although, when he does not require it, it is at the disposal of other Ministers. The Minister of Defence has stated, in private conversation, that this car has enabled him to do one more day&#39;s work a week than previously. The first car that was purchased for the Prime Minister&#39;s Department was put to such constant and &#34; hard use that it has practically broken down, so that, practically, there are now only two cars at work. </para>

                    <para>.- Some time ago, the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Victoria consolidated the whole of the rules of the High Court. He did it entirely in his own time, but I understand that the remuneration paid is quite inadequate, being much less than was offered by a private firm for the work. I believe this gentleman .did the work very well, and to the satisfaction of the Justices of the High Court. In addition, the Prothonotary has done a good deal of honorary work for the Commonwealth. I see the Attorney-General is not present, but I should like to ask that the matter be reviewed again, with a view to some slight additional remuneration being given. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee is entitled to some information from the Minister as to what he intends to do with the Ordinance that was before the House some time ago regarding the disposal of land under the leasehold system in the Northern Territory. The question seems to have been put very much into the background, but I understand that the Ordinance has all the force of law until rejected by the House, and that, however strongly the House may object to the perpetual-leasing system, applications for land may be made and granted. Some honorable members seem to be under the impression that the question of leasehold <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> freehold was settled by this House when the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill was passed, but the Ordinance to which I have just referred was made under the Northern Territory Administration Act, section 11 of which is as follows - </para>

                        <para>- It is in force, but I have issued instructions to the Administrator that no leases shall be granted under it, and none will be granted under it. A new Ordinance is now being prepared, and I hope that before the month is out it will be placed on the table . of the House, and  an  opportunity given for its discussion. No leases will be granted until a vote has been taken on it. There is no delay in the matter, so far as the Northern Territory is concerned, because for, perhaps, two or three months it will be impossible to allocate any leases. It will be necessary to have the land surveyed and advertised, and so on. The work is going on in the Territory, but no leases, either agricultural or pastoral, will be issued until the new Ordinance is placed on the table of the House, and opportunity has been given to the House to deal with-it. </para>

                    <para>. - Why an Ordinance? I thought the Minister withdrew the Ordinance to consider whether he would not proceed by an ordinary Land Bill in the usual way. Why should there be a Land Ordinance for that huge Territory ? Ordinances are generally associated with some . forms of government with which responsible Governments are not familiar. They are usually associated with the government of an inferior by a superior representative body. I could understand the Minister proceeding by Ordinance in the case of Papua, where they have not representative institutions, but the Northern Territory is part of our own Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps not yet, but the Minister hopes to give them some shortly. Surely he is not going to treat this as an -outside territory? It is part of Australia, and is  only  called a Territory because we have not yet named it a State. It is really as much a State as any other, although not so populated. It is under our own laws, and will be regulated by our own conditions, and ultimately by the same representative principle as any other part of Australia. Why, therefore, perpetuate the Ordinance principle? I strongly urge the Minister to bring down a proper Land Bill. </para>
