                    <para class="block">An order was yesterday made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in the Federal Arbitration Court directing the cancellation of registration of the Australian Actors Union, his Honor remarking that in making the order he was &#34; compelled to do a stupid piece of injustice.&#34; Although a number of grounds were submitted on behalf of the applicants -  the theatrical managers -  in support of the application, the one mainly relied upon related to proceedings by the deputy registrar in Sydney. It appeared that the notification of the application for the registration of the union was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> on16th December,1911, and on11th January the deputy registrar granted the certificate, forwarding a notification of the fact to the principal registrar in Melbourne. Subsequently the mistake in issuing the certificate before thirty days had passed for the receipt of objections to the registration was discovered, and the certificate was finally issued as of date 7th February last. </para>
                    <para>Counsel for the union argued that the issue of a certificate on11th January was a mere nullity, and did not affect the valid act after the lapse of the required period. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>
                        Honor, after remarking that he was compelled to do a stupid piece of injustice, said the mistake had hurt no one, but he was obliged to give effect to the objection, because it had been taken. At one time he had a discretion in matters of this sort, but the last amended act said that if an organisation were registered erroneously, or by mistake, the registration must be cancelled. He had drawn up a certificate of registration.

While it would be congenial to myself and ray colleagues to do what is suggested, it is doubtful whether the work comes within bur constitutional powers. I think that, as- the. Commonwealth has undertaken the responsibility of. providing invalid and old age pensions, the- States might &#39; themselves look after cases of the kind referred to. </para>

Will the right honorable gentleman take steps to have the fines remitted? i <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FISHER.</inline> - I am not acquainted with the facts. It is most undesirable that parents should be sent to gaol for the offences of their children, and I shall, ascertain what can be done to prevent that ; but, if the defence system is to be of any value, the law must be obeyed. </para>

                        <para>- I have before me the paragraph from which the honorable member has been quoting. It would, apparently, bear the construction that it is a reflection upon the Courts, but I&#39; do not believe it was the intention of the  president  of the Chamber of Commerce to reflect upon the Courts. There is no ground at all in the measure to which he alluded to justify such a statement; and there is certainly no. reason to believe that the Courts of the Commonwealth or of the States are not in every way calculated to inspire confidence in the people of this country </para>

If the money voted can be spent, and all the works started, you will have them dovetailing in, so that everything will move like clockwork. </para>

                            <para>- Has the Prime Minister forgotten the fact that last session, although the Government, in the first place, took the responsibility of fixing the site for the Naval College at Jervis Bay, they afterwards met the views of some honorable members with regard to it? Will he take similar action in a broader way on this occasion, and let the House consider where the Commonwealth Woollen Mills ought to be situated? </para>

                    <para class="block">I think all honorable members will agree that one of the greatest problems with which the Commonwealth has to deal is the settlement of the Northern Territory. We all realize what a vulnerable spot it is in the defence of Australia, and the great necessity, if we are to keep this country, as we hope, for the white races of the world, for filling that empty space at the earliest opportunity with people of such a class, and settled under such conditions, that they will form a contented population, developing the Territory and becoming our bulwark so far as the defence of that portion of the continent is concerned. Many honorable members have visited the Northern Territory, and know the condition of affairs there; while those who have not had that privilege have had the fullest opportunity, by means of reports, and of speeches made in this </para>

All of us, myself included, who have been through the Territory, realize that in that great empty space there are magnificent opportunities for the settlement of a prosperous people. The experiments which have been made there in tropical agriculture have shown that many tropical products can be grown with great success ; and I understand that the present Government are establishing experimental farms, with a view to show whether there are any further possibilities in that direction. While we are all satisfied that there are many potentialities in the rich soil of that country, we must remember that settlers who go there to take up land and develop it, especially in the coastal regions, must labour under serious climatic disabilities as compared with people in the southerly portions of Australia. Time after time, even in the more favoured portions of the Commonwealth, and in other parts of the world, the leasehold system - the basic principle of the Ordinance which I am moving the House to disallow - has been found insufficient to bring about that permanent residence on the soil, and that proper development of the country, which it is so eminently desirable that we should do our utmost to encourage . in the Northern Territory. I presume that honorable members read this Ordinance, which has been drawn up in accordance with the principles of the Labour party. It is well known that that party throughout Australia are absolutely in favour of the leasehold as against the freehold system of land tenure. Doubtless they regard its adoption as the first step towards the realization of another plank in their platform which provides for the nationalization of the land. We have evidence in the press from time to time, however, that they are not in favour of the application of the leasehold system to their own private dealings, and, what is more, the Government were not at all anxious to secure a lease of the site selected in the Strand, London, for the Commonwealth offices. They would be satisfied with nothing less than the freehold of the area in question. The basic principle of this Ordinance is that of perpetual leasehold. It is set out in section 15 that - </para>

                            <para>- It does, and that to me is one of the remarkable features of the Ordinance. Great pastoral areas are to be taken up under the system of perpetual leasehold. It may be necessary for us in the not far distant future to resume all or portion of such areas, and when the day does come, we shall have to pay practically as much for the resumption of such land for closer settlement purposes as if we had parted with the freehold. When I say that I object to this Ordinance, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have in mind only its application to areas that may be suitable for agricultural, dairying, and closer settlement purposes. I certainly do not wish to advocate the adoption of the freehold system in regard to the great pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. It is the application of this Ordinance to areas that may be classified as suitable for dairying, agricultural, and closer settlement purposes to which I object. It seems to me that the House should have had an opportunity to consider the system of land tenure to be adopted in the Northern Territory before this Ordinance was issued. I recognise that it is in accordance with an Act introduced, if I remember rightly, by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor,</inline> when Minister of External Affairs, which absolutely prohibits the selling of land in the Northern Territory in fee. The Minister in issuing this Ordinance is merely following the system embodied in that Act. The Ordinance provides for the classification of land in various areas which are set forth in section  7.  In the case of pastoral lands, the maximum area that may be taken up under class1. is  500  square miles ; in class  2, 1,000  square miles; and in class  3, 3,000  square miles. These areas may be taken up under a system of perpetual lease, subject, of course, to reappraisement from time to time. Division  2  deals with agricultural lands, and provides for the issue of leases as follows: - </para>

There is, for instance, the proposal to which reference has just been made to grant perpetual leases in respect of large pastoral holdings which, in time to come, may be partly, or wholly, required for closer settlement purposes.

                        <para>- The Minister says &#34; Tommy Rot,&#34; while one of his supporters indorses my view. Any one who has travelled through the northern part of the Territory must agree with the honorable member for Corio. Owing to the proximity of that part of Australia to the equator, it is hot there, not only in summer, but in winter. I visited the Territory towards the end of July, and throughout my stay the thermometer, I understand, never registered less than 96 degrees in the shade. The heat was very trying, and one could not indulge in any physical exertion, except at great inconvenience. Notwithstanding the Minister&#39;s interjection of &#34;Tommy Rot,&#34; we know that owing to the heat and the presence of mosquitoes, and other drawbacks, the Northern Territory will have to fee developed under difficult conditions. </para>

                            <para>- That being so, instead of seeking to impose, as is done under this Ordinance, the most harassing conditions, we should give people the fullest encouragement to take up land there. Honorable members of the Labour party claim that they take a special interest in the wellbeing of the wives and children of the people. I would remind them that, under this Ordinance, it will be difficult for a man to make provision for his wife and family. It is a well known principle of law that a system of trust cannot be established under a leasehold - that in respect of a leasehold you cannot carve out a life estate for your wife with remainder for your children. Notwithstanding that a man may hold a lease in perpetuity our system of conveyancing makes it impossible to do that. Let me quote from a speech delivered by one of the most experienced gentlemen in connexion with land matters in Australia. Speaking in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, on 20th March last, on a Bill proposing to do away with the right to obtain&#39; in that State any more freeholds from the Crown, he used these words - </para>

                        <para>But the objection to a leasehold tenure is that directly you attempt to carve out of it estates under your will, or under a deed of settlement for the protection of your wife and family, you are confronted with all the rules of conveyancing, which will not allow trusts or life estates to be carved out of a leasehold. That is to say, it is held that a life estate is an estate in freehold, and you cannot carve a life estate - that is, a freehold estate - out of a leasehold tenure. How is the honorable member going to get over the difficulty for the people who hold that tenure? That is what I always had to regard in respect of perpetual leasehold, if I called my old tenure perpetual leasehold. </para>

It is founded on the wisdom of centuries, and you cannot carve a life estate out of a leasehold estate, although the life estate may be only in practice for five, ten, or fifteen years. And yet the leasehold estate out of which you are trying to carve it may be for ninety-nine years. Then you have to get a lawyer and go into equity to get round the difficulty. </para>

                    <para class="block">Considering the difficulties and dangers of pioneering work in a. country like the Northern Territory, the leasehold system will press very much on people who go there, inasmuch as they will not be able to make provision for their wives and families out of the property on which they have spent their labour. These are not imaginary difficulties, but are well known to the law ; and I should be very glad to hear from the Minister how he proposes to surmount them. I have consulted other lawyers, some of them members of this House, and I am told that what I have read is absolutely good law. The people who go to the Northern Territory ought to be given the fullest opportunity to do well, not only for themselves, but for the wives and families they leave behind ; and to assist them in this, should be the desire of all who have the interests of the country at heart. This leasehold system, like a good many other experiments which are proposed from time to time by honorable members opposite, is as old as history. It has been tried in all quarters of the globe from the time of the Roman Empire downwards, and has proved deficient in every instance I have been able to discover. If honorable members will take the trouble to refer to the well-known historian Mommsen, they will find that the leasehold system proved a serious hindrance to the welfare and prosperity of the Roman Empire. The two Gracchi, who were the means of abolishing the system, were assassinated for what they did; but the fact remains, as graphically told by Mommsen, that the institution of the freehold tenure was the means of placing 80,000 peasant proprietors on the land, and of saving the position. </para>

                            <para>- That is a &#34;gag&#34; which may suit a large proportion of the electors at the present time, but it will be for the Minister to show how much truth there is in it when he stands up to defend this Ordinance. I should now like  to  bring members down to the time of the French Revolution. It has been said time and again, and will doubtless be said many times in the future, that the lasting work of that Revolution was to end the feudal system and to initiate freehold peasant proprietorship in France. There is no difference, in my opinion, between  a  leasehold system under a landlord and leasehold under the State, except that, under the Ordinance, the land held under leasehold in the Northern Territory will be subject to reappraisement every fourteen years; whereas very often, under private tenure, the reappraisement does not come in the leaseholder&#39;s lifetime. France so progressed under this system of peasant proprietorship that, at the conclusion of the Franco-German war, the French people were able to pay the tremendous indemnity of&#163;280,000,000, and to remain in quite as sound, and probably a sounder, position than that of their victors. This was entirely owing to the freehold system of peasant proprietorship. Then, again, the development of the great Republic of America has not taken place under the leasehold system. The Constitution gave Congress the sole ownership of the public domain, and it was wisely decided that all prairie lands between the Ohio River and the foot of the Rocky Mountains could be disposed of in sections of 160 acres, half-sections of 60 acres, and quarter-sections of 40 acres, according to the quality, with  a  freehold title, on payment of  7  dollars an acre. The result was that 5,500,000 freehold proprietors were placed on the domain. What has been the result? </para>

                            <para>- That may be; but I am not concerned with that.I am concerned with the establishment of a system which brought about in the United States of America a prosperity unequalled in any other part of the world. I should now like to refer for a few moments to a country which, so far as its land laws are concerned, has been under the notice of the world for many years past. I refer to Ireland, and the painful history of that country&#39;s agrarian strife. It is well known that Michael Davitt was the real author of the Irish land system, and that it was he who formed the Land League with the object of placing the land&#39; in the hands of the cultivators of the soil. History tells us that Michael Davitt was always a land nationalizer ; and his idea was for the State to purchase the land from the landlords and let it out to the cultivators on leases of 999 years. However, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Wyndham, Chief Secretary for Ireland, carried through the Imperial Parliament the Irish Land Purchase Bill, he gave the people of that country the choice between leasehold and freehold. Although the tenants of Ireland, north, south, east and west, idolized Davitt, they declared in favour of freehold, adding that they had had enough of landlordism, and that they did not see the difference between being the tenant of a private proprietor and the tenant of a State. </para>

                            <para>- In any case, the people preferred the freehold system; and we are told that&#163;210,000,000 for the general purchase with &#163;12,000,000 besides was advanced at 3 per cent. interest by the Government. The&#163;12,000,000 was voted to finish the purchase where the tenants would be unwilling to give the full price the landlords demanded, and this sum bears no interest. The tenants are now paying their instalments, which are one-third less than the judicial rents they paid before the scheme came into operation. They will be the real owners of their homes after sixty-eight years&#39; payment. The result of this legislation has already created a revolution so far as the prosperity of Ireland is concerned. Honorable members who, like myself, have had the privilege of travelling in the Old Land, must admit that, when in Ireland, there can be seen signs of a great revival of prosperity amongst the people. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member; and I must say that Ireland furnishes a painful chapter in the history of the Old Land. At any rate, the freehold system has, to a very large extent, relieved the position; and the result to-day is that the trade of Ireland is increasing, and, I think, now stands very nearly as high as that of the Australian Commonwealth. Let us now turn our attention to land tenures in New Zealand, where the difficulties to be encountered at the beginning were similar to those met with throughout the States of Australia. Land legislation and administration in New Zealand forms a very interesting history, in view of the Ordinance issued for the control of the Northern Territory. About twenty years ago, the two questions in New Zealand were whether the State should sell or lease the lands, and what would prove the most effective means of preventing land monopoly and breaking up big estates. The perpetual leasehold system was propounded in New Zealand by such well-known public men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rolleston, Mr. Ballance,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McKenzie, men of advanced democratic ideas. So far back as 1882 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rolleston,</inline> who was then Minister of Lands, introduced into the Lower House a. Bill to dispose of Crown lands on perpetual lease, the rent being fixed at 5 per cent. of the unimproved capital value, with re-appraisement after thirty years, and, subsequently, at intervals of twenty years. The Council, however, favored freehold tenure, and amended the treasure to give lessees the right of purchase at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> an acre when they had fenced their land and cultivated one-fifth of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rolleston</inline> fought the amendment hard, but as the Council remained obdurate, it remained in the measure. Between 1882 and 1802 1,188,071 acres were taken up under this law, the tenure being more popular than the conditional purchase or deferred payment system until then in vogue, because the rent was lower, and there was the right to convert. This right to convert was availed of so largely that, in 1909, there were only 87,000 acres still being rented, and I have reason to believe that at the present day practically the whole area taken up under the Act - 1., 188,071 acres - has been converted into freehold. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ballance,</inline> a politician of very advanced ideas, succeeded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rolleston</inline> as Minister of Lands in 1885, and his attempt to carry out the policy of his predecessor brought about a long and memorable struggle between the two Houses of Parliament, but the Upper House again prevailed. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McKenzie, who was not then knighted, became Minister of Lands and Agriculture in the Ballance Cabinet, he proposed leases in perpetuity. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McKenzie was a practical farmer, and a Scotchman of very strong convictions. He was determined that there should not prevail in New Zealand the system which had brought such disastrous consequences upon the small farmers of Scotland, and, being of opinion that when land is alienated in freehold, it is only a matter of time before all the land of the State gets into the possession of rich men, he determined that the land of New Zealand -should be held under perpetual lease. This form of tenure was designed to give the leaseholder the same interest in his holding as &#34;is possessed by freeholders. The leases were for a term of 999 years, but were &#39;&#39;called leases in perpetuity. A man could take &#62;up 640 acres of first class land arid 2,000 acres of second class land, the rental equalling 4 per cent, on the capital value, residential and improvement conditions being insisted on. The lessees were prevented from taking up more than one block each, &#34;and there could not be conversion at any time. A measure embodying those provisions became law in 1892. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rolleston,</inline> who was bitterly opposed to the McKenzie Act, because it did not provide for re-appraisement, and, in effect, deprived &#39;the State of its share of the unearned increment - which is what the Minister of </para>

It will not require more than two or three years before the people will rise against the persecutions, limitations, vexations, and annoyances such as appear under this. Bill. There is no unearned increment to come in, no provision for revenue in aid of local government, no aid to taxation in the future. This Bill, as it must be carried out, will destroy the land revenue. It fosters evasion, gambling,, and speculation. </para>

                    <para class="block">From 1892 to 1907, owing to the great prosperity of the country, land values ir* New Zealand increased enormously. There was a great development of the dairying&#39; industry, and a. great increase in the exportation of lambs. When those who had taken up land under the perpetual lease system became prosperous and numerous and knew their political strength, they clamoured to be permitted to convert to freehold, and their agitation was so strong that they ultimately acquired the right of purchase, and are now practically all freeholders. A similar thing has happened in South Australia in connexion with what are known as homestead allotments.1 in New South Wales, in Victoria, and elsewhere. Men -are not satisfied with leasehold tenure. There is some magic : about the idea -of ownership that makes us all desire to own what we possess. This is shown by the Minister and his col leagues in private life time and again. Our very children playing on the floor show a desire to grab all that they can get.  </para>

                    <para>He had been specially requested by his leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holman)</inline> to deal fully and clearly with the position of the Labour party with respect to the Conversion Act. It was true that the Labour party intended to repeal the Conversion Act this year, but in consequence of the resignation of Messrs. Home and Dunn, a meeting of the caucus decided that the repeal of the Act would not apply to those who so far had taken up holdings, and the homestead selection and conditional lease tenures. The future land policy of the party, he went on to say, would be perpetual leasehold with re-appraisement of values for rental adjustments. The capital value would be based on the value of adjacent private lands. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is similar to the system which the Minister has adopted in this Ordinance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby,</inline> speaking at Millthorpe on 24th September, was reported, in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> to have said, in regard to the Labour party&#39;s land tenure proposals, that- </para>

                    <para>I am indebted to the Minister of Lands in Victoria, and to the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia, for particulars regarding the freehold system in those two States. The Victorian Minister has furnished me with the following memorandum with regard to the perpetual leasing of Crown lands in Victoria - </para>
                    <para>When the reclaimed area known as the &#34; Koo-weer-up Swamp &#34; was made available for occupation, a considerable number of the applicants was impressed with &#39;the apparent advantages of perpetual leasing, and preferred that tenure to conditional purchase leasehold, which conferred the exclusive right to freehold ; but, in a limited time, the holders of perpetual leases arrived at the conclusion that conditional purchase lessees are in a better position, as the freehold can be acquired by the latter at any time after six  (6)  years from date of lease, and! consequently a conditional purchase lease in the seventh year is recognised as a good commercial security. </para>
                    <para> Crown lands have been available since 1st </para>
                    <para class="block">July, 1899, for selection under perpetual lease, as well as under a title under which the payment of the first and subsequent rent goes towards the purchase of the fee-simple; but in rare instances has a perpetual lease been preferred. It must, however, be mentioned that a perpetual lease of a selection carries with it an exclusive right to the holder to acquire the fee-simple by change of title, and although it. practically rests with him to determine the date on which occupation under perpetual lease shall cease, with a view to his acquisition of the freehold, yet even this privilege, together with other concessions, does not create any general desire for perpetual leases. </para>
                    <para class="block">I quote this to honorable members to show that if we are to induce people to go to the Northern Territory, we must, under existing conditions there, offer them something equally as good as, and if possible better than, is being offered in the more favoured portions of Australia, yet in those more favoured portions we find that people, so far from being satisfied with the system of perpetual leasing, prefer to get the freehold in every instance where it is offered. The memorandum continues - </para>
                    <para>In a few cases of encumbered holdings in the Mallee country, where the lessees are not in a position to discharge the mortgages or to obtain agricultural allotment leases, perpetual leases are accepted as a temporary expedient, as the mortgages can be transferred thereto, and the freehold can be acquired at a later date. On. the establishment of the township of Wonthaggi, which comprises the State coal mine, it was intended to restrict occupation to continuous leasing, but to limit the term in the first instance to thirty-three years; and although it was subsequently decided to seek the authority of Parliament to increase the term to fifty years and  to review the rentals every ten years, yet the lessees are not satisfied and press for the freehold. </para>
                    <para class="block">That only adds to the other instances to which I have referred to show the desire of all those who settle on the land to&#39; obtain the freehold in preference to the leasehold. The rather lengthy statement which I have received from the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia also bears out my contention. I shall not take up time by reading it, but I should like to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Handbook</inline> of South Australia for 1908, page 184, the following passage : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In 1898, in order to meet the growing demand for land, an Act was passed providing for the purchase of freehold lands for closer settlement. These were to be let on perpetual lease at a fixed rental of not less than 4 per cent, on the amount paid for purchase money, together with any expenses incurred in connexion with the purchase. Subsequent legislation provided for lands so purchased being disposed of on agreement with covenant to purchase, the purchase money being payable by sixty half-yearly instalments, with interest at the rate of not less than 4 per cent, per annum. </para>
                        <para>During the 1903 session of Parliament an Act to consolidate the Crown Lands Acts became law. This Act re-enacted the provisions for Crown lands being let under perpetual lease at a fixed rental for all time, and not subject to revaluation or disposed of under agreement with covenant to purchase by sixty half-yearly payments, with interest at not less than 2 per cent, nor more than 4 per cent, per annum. The  purchase  may be completed at any time after the first six years of the agreement. In1 the case of lands repurchased by the Government and subdivided for closer settlement, more recent legislation (1905) provides for payment of interest only at 4 per cent, per annum for the first five years, after which interest and principal become payable as in the case of ordinary Crown lands. Provision is also made for those holders of repurchased lands let on perpetual lease surrendering and obtaining agreements with covenants to purchase in lieu of the  perpetual  leases. The purchases of closer settlement land may obtain the fee-simple of their holdings at any time after the first nine years on payment of the balance of the purchase money and interest up to date. Up to the 30th June, 349,802 acres - including 14,716 acres of leasehold - have been purchased at a cost of ,&#163;883,150, and disposed of to suitable purchasers, most of whom are successfully occupying their holdings. In place of comparatively few persons on the land at the time of purchase there is now a population of 3,945 adults and children on these repurchased lands. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>This shews that the South Australian Government repurchased lands for closer settlement purposes, and offered them under a system of perpetual lease, but in 1905 they did away with the perpetual lease system, and, in order to get the best work out of the settlers in developing the land, gave them the right by purchase to obtain the freeholds for themselves. The system which it is proposed to adopt in the Northern Territory is part of the Socialistic scheme of honorable members opposite. The Minister of External Affairs, speaking at Broken Hill, said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>This then is what the Labour movement means.. In one precise pregnant word it means Socialism. Well, Socialism is your scheme as apart from all other schemes. He was speaking, of course, to the Labour leagues and the workers, to whom he was appealing for support. It is based on social growth. It is the common holding of land, and the means of production and exchange, and the holding of them for the equal benefit of all. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The leasehold system is, therefore, only a portion of the programme designed to bring about the nationalization and Socialism advocated by the Minister of External Affairs at Broken Hill. The first step is leasehold, and the second is land nationalization, but although the Labour Government in New South Wales had professed to be in favour of leasehold, and boasted at the general election that if given a majority they would immediately bring it into operation, it was found when they got into power that the only man amongst them who was game to carry out his principles was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neilsen,</inline> the then Minister of Lands, and he was forced to resign. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the honorable member&#39;s chief objection to the land ordinances of the Northern Territory is that in them we lay down the fundamental principle of the leasehold  as  against the freehold system. Before entering upon a defence of the leasehold system - if a defence of it be necessary  - I  think it right that I should briefly explain the particular kind of leasehold system  that  we have adopted. The honorable member for Illawarra will be prepared to admit that in this case we have not merely  to  consider the question of freehold <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> leasehold, but to direct special attention to what we intend to convey by the use of those terms. There are certain kinds of leases which no sane man would accept in respect of land in the Northern Territory. For instance, leases might be issued with a currency _ of one year or twenty years, and subject to arbitrary conditions  as to reappraisements at the end of that period. To that class of lease in respect of the Northern Territory most men would object. Then, again, we might have a freehold system subject to certain conditions to which even the honorable member for Illawarra would not agree. I take it that he does not think that the freehold system should be applied to the big pastoral areas of the Northern Territory. </para>

                            <para>- That being so, he himself has proceeded to suggest modifications in the application of the freehold as against the. leasehold system of tenures. The mere granting of land under a freehold system is not in itself sufficient to bring about settlement. That is clearly demonstrated by the fact that, although the Northern Territory was under the control of South Australia for forty years, during which time it was possible to obtain freehold areas there- </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Freeholds could be obtained in respect of land in the Northern Territory, with the exception of pastoral areas, while it was under the control of the South Australian Government, yet settlement there to-day is practically no more advanced than it was forty years ago. So far as a white population is concerned, fast tracts of country in the Northern Territory are as uninhabited to-day as they were when Captain Cook first set foot on Australian soil. We as a Government recognise that in adopting the leasehold system we must take care to associate with it security of tenure so that people may have some inducement to take up land. Consequently, we have provided under this Ordinance for the granting of leases in perpetuity. In some cases there will be a reappraisement at the end of fourteen years, and in others at the expiration of twenty-one years, but we have provided that those reappraisements shall not be of an arbitrary character. A leaseholder will have the right of appeal to the Judge of the Northern Territory if he is dissatisfied with the re- appraisement of his land. </para>

                            <para>- The Classification Board, at the end of the periods named in the leases, will reappraise the land, and if any leaseholder thinks that the rental then fixed is too high he will have the right to appeal to a judge of the Northern Territory. Thus it will be impossible for rentals to be fixed merely to meet the. exigencies of the Treasury. They will be dealt with on just and equitable lines. Under the system we have adopted, a man who complies with the conditions of his lease will be able to hold his land for all time. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; if a leaseholder does not comply with the conditions of his lease that lease may be forfeited. Then, again, the leases carry residential qualifications, and provide that certain developmental work shall be done in connexion with them. As long as he observes the conditions of his lease, the holder cannot be removed from his land without compensation, should it be found necessary at any time to resume it in order to meet the advancing population. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We consider it is useless to grant leases in respect of land in the Territory unless we insist upon residence. Without such a condition we cannot hope to settle the Territory. Honorable members will recognise that as long as the conditions of a lease are complied with the area to which it relates will practically belong to the holder, so that it will be seen that we have made full provision for security of tenure. I think it only fair, in pitting the leasehold against the freehold system, to take these points into consideration. If we were to adopt the freehold system in connexion with the lands of the Northern Territory we should, of course, have to alienate lands from the Crown, and I should like to ask honorable members what price that land would fetch at auction today. I say advisedly that most of the land suitable for agricultural purposes in the Northern Territory is to-day practically unsaleable, not because of any deficiencies in the matter of soil or climate, but because of it&#39;s inaccessibility to a market, and because at the present time, with few exceptions, land there could not be profitably devoted to agricultural purposes. That being so, if we proposed to part with the freehold of such land at its present value we should have practically to give it away. </para>

                    <para class="block">There would be a rush for the land in such circumstances, especially if there were no conditions as to residence. It may be said that we could part with the freehold and attach to the land, not its present, but its prospective value - that we should take into consideration the added value that will be given to it by the construction of roads, bridges, and railways. To do that, however, would be to ask the people to pay for something that did not exist, and that is not the policy of this Government. Our policy is to lease the land under conditions that will enable a man to apply to the development of his holding whatever capital he possesses, whether it be large or small. </para>

                            <para>- I am not so pessimistic as to hold that view, but this constant tinkering with the land laws of the States shows conclusively, I think, that there must be some flaws even in the freehold system. Does it not show that the system must be based on a wrong foundation? No one would be so presumptuous as to say that every land administrator in the States has proved incompetent, but that is the conclusion to which we should be forced if we did not agree that the freehold system itself was based upon a fundamentally wrong foundation. I shall not endeavour to bolster up the case for the leasehold as against the freehold system - if it needs any bolstering up - by--- </para>

Let  me  say, for the information of those who think that the conversion will not be availed of, that the popularity of the homestead selection system has been demonstrated beyond dispute. I have thrown open in Riverina, where there has been the greatest demand for land, special areas which have not been taken up. I have thrown open there land for ordinary conditional purchase, but there have been no conditional purchasers. The moment the tenure of the land has been changed to homestead selection there has been a rush for it. The homestead selection areas which have been thrown open in Riverina have been eagerly snapped up. ..... The honorable member for the </para>
                        <para class="block">Murray introduced to me a delegate from a large number of Victorian farmers, who subscribed together to pay his expenses so that he might interview me. It transpired in the course of the interview that he represented a large number of families and of men who were waiting for land to be thrown open, some of them being encamped on the Murray. I said that I should be declaring certain land open for selection under the old law, and his answer to me was characteristic of the feeling which is very strong on the part of those who understand the law&#39;. &#34;Do not do that; we do not want that; we have not the money with which to pay the deposit and to meet the initial expenses of ordinary conditional purchase. Give us the chance of taking up homestead selections; we can pay a fair rent for the use of the land ; that is what we want, and have been waiting for.&#34; This has been my experience in other parts of the Colony where land has been thrown open by hundreds of thousands of acres under ordinary conditional purchase, and has not been taken up. In the majority of cases where land has been thrown open under this rent system, a demand has immediately set in. People are beginning to recognise that the value of land is not its speculative value, but the value of the product you can get from it. As soon as people understand the difference between these holdings and the old freeholds, with their fictitious values, we shall have a larger demand for this particular class of tenure. </para>

                        <para>I most heartily approve of the opening up of the Northern Territory, and of the conditions of settlement. It is an opportunity for working men which has seldom been afforded them. I, for one, shall be more than pleased to take advantage of it. I might add that I am an Englishman, and that I came to Australia two years ago with the intention of taking up land. I have hitherto met with more difficulties than I had anticipated from the statements of Government officials and circulating literature in England. The cause of this difficulty, I believe, is that I am a man of small capital; but in the Territory, it appears to me, I shall be able to meet your requirements, and, as regards character, I shall have no difficulty in furnishing you with references. </para>

I admit that there is a considerable difference between land in the Federal Capital site and land in the Northern Territory, but, in view of the remarks of the honorable member for Angas, and of the fact that it was carried on the voices that no land should be alienated in the Capital area - that members of all shades of political opinion were agreed on that point - I do not think the Labour party can be blamed for acting on the same principle in the Northern Territory.

                            <para>- I understand that the chief objection to the Ordinance is that it provides for leasehold instead of freehold tenure. The honorable member for- Illawarra has shown that in New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, when opportunities have been given and availed of for the taking up of land .on lease, the lessees, have subsequently brought pressure to bear to get freehold tenure, and that this movement has been successful. Let me point out what has happened in South Australia. Some years ago, the Labour party of that State, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson,</inline> desired that there should be no further alienation of Crown lands. After a good deal of discussion, areas were set apart to be taken upon lease; and,: among others, an area of land was provided)-, near Adelaide for what were known as blockers; and the blockers&#39; settlement became one of the sights of the place. Just as a visitor to Sydney is asked, &#34; Have you seen the harbor?&#34; a visitor to Adelaide was asked, &#34; Have you seen the. blockers&#39; settlement?&#34; and the Minister, with great pride, would drive you round, it. Had it not been for the leasehold tenure adopted, the men who were put on that land, who were men without capital, could not have got on the land at all. At first they worked for two or three days a week to earn -money to keep themselves going, employing the rest of their time in improving their holdings, until finally they were able to devote the whole of their time to the care of their blocks. Having begun to make money, and having got on to their feet, they clamoured for freehold tenure, wishing to secure the unearned increment, and ignoring the fact that but for the leasehold tenure they would never have got on the land. Does that make leasehold&#39; tenure a wrong tenure as compared with freehold tenure, or does it prove it the better tenure for the settlement of the country ? The large area taken up in New Zealand under the leasehold tenure shows how beneficial that tenure was in settling the Dominion. Directly people realize that there is something to be gained by acquiring the unearned increment, regardless of the interests of those who have no land, they clamour for freehold tenure, and use political pressure to obtain it. That happened in South Australia. As the honorable member for Boothby knows, men who obtained possession of land because of the efforts of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Price acted with the basest ingratitude towards him, and tried to bring him down because he would not give them freehold tenure. </para>

                            <para>- It will be a long while before there are enough settlers in the Northern Territory to bring sufficient pressure to bear on the Commonwealth Parliament to secure the adoption of freehold tenure. The increase in the settlement there to an extent enabling it to sway the National Parliament would be the strongest evidence of the success of the leasehold tenure in populating the Territory. Unless people&#39;  take up land in the Territory, they cannot bring pressure to bear on this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- We are prepared to deal with the pastoral leases in the same way as with the agricultural leases, because there will be a reappraisement every twenty-one years; and, when population demands it, the leases can be resumed under the resumption provisions. We must give special inducements to get people to go to the Northern Territory, and are doing this in regard to pastoral holdings. </para>

Once we have attracted population to the Territory, we can see that the land is put to the best use. We say to those who wish to take up pastoral leases : &#34; You must comply with certain conditions, such as the spending of a certain amount of capital and the making of certain improvements; and every twenty-one years your lease will be re-appraised ; and, on giving two years&#39; notice, the Government will be able to resume any part or the whole of it.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- If the lease runs out we shall not have to pay compensation for anything, I suppose, except what has been done upon it. Until this moment I had an idea, because that was quite understood, as far as I was concerned, that the resumption clause enabled us to resume, not only for public purposes, but for any purposes if we so desired. </para>

                            <para>- If need be. Now the question is raised that the compensation would be too high. We say that if a man goes there and we resume his land for public purposes, or for any other purpose, it is only fair and legitimate that we should pay him for the improvements he has made. I have never had one of these big pastoral leases myself, and do not profess to talk as one who has had great experience in pastoral matters, but if you are going to grant a man a lease for twenty-one years, and, at the end of the period, to pay him no compensation at all because his lease has expired, personally, I should not think that he would lay out a great deal of capital upon it. </para>

                        a man is to have the land for forty-eight years, and at the end of that time he is absolutely to receive no compensation, will he lav out the same amount on it as he would if he had the land for all time? Whenever we want to resume a lease, we pay the lessee on  a  fair and legitimate basis for what he has done. A fair basis of compensation would be to pay for any work the lessee had clone and any improvements he had made, but  to pay him absolutely nothing for any improvements brought about by the development of the Territory by the community. That is to say, he would get absolutely nothing of the unearned increment. We provide that -when we resume land for any purpose, whilst we have to compensate the holder for it, if the value of the remaining portion of the lease has been increased by anything that has been done by the Government or the community, that increase shall be deducted from the compensation which we give to him.

When I was in the Northern Territory a little time ago a deputation waited on me at Pine Creek and asked that that railway should be built. It represented a mass meeting of thirty people. They could not pay for that railway if it was built, and the people who would build it would be the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- There is an appeal t&#174; the Judge of the Territory if the owner thinks we are not paying enough. The honorable member is referring to a man who took up land in the Northern Territory twenty or thirty years ago, and has done absolutely nothing with it during all that time. Now that we want to resume the land, he&#34; asks us <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> an acre, although he gave only 7s. 6d. an acre for it, and has done absolutely nothing with it. To my mind, &#39;the very great advantage of leasehold as against freehold is, first, that the selector is not asked to pay anything for the land that he takes up. </para>

                            <para>- He is not asked to pay anything whatever, so that practically his whole capital can be put into the land for its development. When resumptions are_ needed, the Government resume on the basis of the value that the selector himself has put into the land, and not upon the value that has been given to it by the community. The Government pay fully, and I hope generously, for the improvements and for the work and capital put into the land by the occupant, but do not pay a single penny of unearned increment. I venture to say that that is the crux of the question as between thea leasehold and freehold principles. Men are anxious for the freehold because, if the time ever comes for them to sell their land, or for it to be resumed, they want to be paid, not only what, they themselves have put into it, but also what the community has put into it. Men are to be induced to go to the Territory, according to the argument of those who advocate freehold, not so much for what they can earn out of the soil, as for what they may possibly be able to  get out of the added values given to the land by the community. No man has a moral right to this, and, as far as this Government are concerned, we do not propose to give him the legal right. In the leasehold system, we are not parting with the land. We compel the occupier to use it, and we say that no man has a right to own land merely for speculative purposes. The ownership of land must carry with it the utilization of the land. We give every facility to people to settle upon the land, but we demand residence. We say it is necessary for those who obtain land in the Territory to go there to live. It. is of no good to the Territory that &#34;persons should purchase or obtain land without settling on it. Leasehold gives the Government the opportunity of offering to the present occupier every possible advantage, without bartering the rights of posterity. Freehold, which admits the &#34; sacred rights of property,&#34; to use the words of the honorable member for Parramatta, has cursed every community. We desire to save ourselves and save this Parliament from the curse of future generations, and so we have nailed our flag to the principle of leasehold. On that we stand or fall. </para>

                            <para>.- In the remarks that I made on this subject yesterday, I think I showed conclusively that the presence of free moisture in butter is not adulteration. I tried also to show why the presence of free moisture was a necessity, and endeavoured to explain the technical reason why 16 per cent, has been accepted by all the great butter-producing countries as the best percentage of moisture to allow, with a view of securing the greatest quantity of first class butter. I have no desire to elaborate the arguments that I put before the House yesterday, but I wish to refer to one or two replies made by the Minister of Trade and Customs to questions put to him in this House - replies which show conclusively that the information at his disposal is faulty, and based upon what, to my mind, are mere prejudices, having no real foundation in fact,&#39; A few days ago, the honorable member for Maranoa asked the Minister whether he was aware that 16 per cent, of moisture was that allowed under the regulations of the British Board of Trade for butter imported into the United Kingdom from any part of the world. The Minister replied to that question - </para>

                        <para>Yes ; but as the standard of 16 per cent, in Great Britain was determined merely to meet the trade in Irish firkin butter, heavily charged with water, it has little application to or influence on the Australian standard, the object of which is to encourage the manufacture of pure high class butter. . . . </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In that answer, we have a mis-statement,&#39; due, probably, to the fact that the Minister is not acquainted with the true situation of the butter trade in England, and two absolute misconceptions. In the first place, butter carrying 16 per cent, of moisture, which is the standard in Great Britain, is not &#39; &#39; heavily charged with water. &#39; &#39; Fourteen per cent, is recognised as the standard for absolutely superfine butter, and no one will contend that an additional 2 per cent, would make a butter heavily charged with moisture. </para>

If the honorable member had heard my statement in the House yesterday he would know why 16 per cent, has been adopted as a standard; by all the great butter producing countries.

                            <para>- That is one of those questions which makes one feel that it is utterly hopeless to try to convince some honorable members of the true position. It is a question which, if I may say so without desiring to be offensive, shows the honorable member&#39;s ignorance of this matter. If he had the technical knowledge which I and other honorable members possess he would not put such a question. There is a percentage of water in everything we eat and drink, and, as I have said,  16  per cent, has been found all over the world to be the best standard to fix in order to secure the greatest proportion of good butter under varying conditions of manufacture. The Minister of Trade and Customs said that the standard of  16  per cent, fixed by the British Board of Trade had been determined upon solely to allow of the introduction of Irish firkin butter into England. That is an absurd statement. British trade statistics show that the quantity of Irish butter introduced into England is a mere drop in the bucket compared with the enormous quantity imported from other parts of the world. In the last year for which statistics are available,  ^25,000,000  worth of butter was introduced into the Old Country. </para>

The Minister, in reply to the question to which I was referring when interrupted, stated that the object of adopting as the Australian standard  15  per cent, is to encourage the manufacture of pure high-class &#34;butter. I think I have shown that the presence of water in butter is not adulteration </para>

                            <para>- I willingly admit that there is a percentage at which the presence of water would amount to adulteration ; but so far as moisture in butter is concerned, one of two things is inevitable. You must either have buttermilk or water in butter. If you choose to have buttermilk, you will have bad butter; if you have water you will have good butter. </para>

                            <para>- That is another  of  those fallacies which are just now obsessing the mind of the Minister. I showed yesterday afternoon that there is a point beyond which you cannot press water out of butter without producing an article that will not keep as well as if the water had remained in it. Let us take the case  of  two samples of butter, each containing 8 per cent, of water. In one case the butter, in grain and general appearance, might be all that could be desired, whilst in the other it might be so overworked that it would not keep. One must be aware  of  these facts in order to be able- to express an opinion on the subject. The Minister&#39;s contention that the less water you have in butter the better it will keep is mere nonsense. Everything depends on circumstances. I impress on the Minister of Trade and Customs, as I stated in my opening remarks yesterday, that the method of Denmark, our greatest competitor in the London market, is to draw together the whole of those engaged in the industry, and to associate them with the Government in the making of regulations, some of which, I willingly admit, are necessary. The Minister of Trade and Customs has a grand opportunity, if he will avail himself  of  it, to so associate himself with the dairymen of Australia, who have now, practically, complete control of the industry in this country through the co-operative channels. They .have appointed their own agents in London to assist in the sale  of  their produce at the other end of the world; and if the Minister is really desirous, as I believe him to be, of framing regulations which will assist the industry, I suggest that he take steps in the direction I have indicated. There is now in Australia a body which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of butter, and which, I believe, would be only too ready to offer the Minister every assistance possible. For a number of years, the dairymen of Australia have been gradually drawing their interests into one common centre; and, without any assistance whatsoever, they have, during the last twelve years, brought this industry from its infancy to the position of being of the third largest, apart from mining, of the industries on which Australia is dependent for its existence. It will readily be conceded, under the circumstances, that the dairying industry is entitled to the fullest consideration at the hands of the Minister; and he ought to hesitate long before he makes any recommendation or regulation which is diametrically opposed to the opinions of the dairymen who have done so much for the producers, and for the country as a whole. </para>

                            <para>.- I have no experience as a farmer ; but, with other honorable members of the Labour party, I claim to have a great deal of sympathy with farmers in their struggles to make a living. They have all kinds of difficulties in the first place to obtain their land, and, after they get it, much labour and money have to be expended ; and, when their improvements are made, they are confronted with all sorts of risks from fire, pests, and so forth. </para>

                                <para>- The attitude of the Labour party towards this question is that, while we do our duty by the farmers, we have also to protect the general public, the consumers. I do not believe there is a single honest farmer who would object to the efforts which are made by the Commonwealth Labour Government to protect the consumers, and see that they get the goods they pay for. The honorable member for Richmond, in the course of his remarks, used the phrase &#34; commercial butter.&#34; What is &#34;commercial butter&#34;? Apparently &#34; commercial butter &#34; is butter which is sold in a market, in which an agreement has to be come to like that of the two card-players, who were cartooned in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> many years ago, and who, as a prelude to the game, had to decide the question, &#34; Shall we play fair or all we know?&#34; The honorable member&#39;s attitude is, &#34; I am willing to play fair in regard to the butter produced and sold in Australia, but I want to be allowed to play all I know when I go into the London market.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member states that  16  per cent. is the standard which has been accepted by all the countries in the world for export butter. That standard, however, has been fixed, in the majority of cases, because some dishonest people in some country decided to export butter containing  16  per cent. of water. When one country starts watering its butter, other exporting countries very naturally desire to be allowed to do the same. </para>

                                <para>- We shall see. I do not ask honorable members to accept the opinion of one who has not been engaged in the butter industry, but to accept the opinion of experts in the dairying industry in New South Wales. The proper course for the honorable member for Richmond would have been to ask the Government to make such representations to the Imperial Government as would result in the standard of moisture permitted in the Old Country being reduced. The Imperial Government are, not protecting consumers in the Old Country as they ought to protect them, and as we protect them here; and I venture to say that 2,000 infamous quack preparations have not, as in Australia, been prevented from entering England during the last two years. </para>

                                <para>- That is to treat the question frivolously, although I admit that, when the honorable member was speaking I interjected, perhaps rudely enough, that he himself, considered chemically, represented go per cent, of water. However, that is not the point. According to expert evidence, so far as we have been able to gather, it is not necessary to have more than  8  per cent, of water in butter, the other  8  per cent, being left in for various reasons; and the standard of 16 per cent, is desired with a view to extracting from the general public more than they ought to </para>

It is the duty of Parliament to protect the general public, who are not experts in butter, tweed, and a variety of other commodities that are sold. In spite of all our efforts, there are corresponding efforts on the part of individuals who are dishonest enough to make the public pay for what they do not get. What are we here for, if it is not to protect the public? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer,</inline> the Controller-General of Customs, reported in 1910 on the butter export trade of Australia. </para>

                            <para>The Committee came to- the conclusion, after hearing a vast amount of evidence, that_ the amount of water which might be present in a properly-made butter need not exceed 8 per cent. ... I think that every member of the Committee was prepared to consider a report fixing the amount of 8 per cent, as being the fair and proper amount. </para>
                            <para>Proceeding, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thorpe</inline> states that formerly the average moisture of butter imported into the United Kingdom did not exceed 11 per cent. ; that, in considering the fixing of a maximum of 8 per cent., the question arose as to whether some margin or working allowance should not be provided for. Lastly, special consideration was given to the trade in Irish firkin butter, &#34; which is made by comparatively poor farmers, often with very small herds, one or two cows at most, and which was heavily charged with water.&#34; </para>
                            <para>He concludes - &#34;We ended up by putting it at 16 per cent. The effect has been unfortunate. New Zealand and Australia had prided themselves in sending us butter very dry; they do not wish to carry water all the way from Australia or New Zealand to England. The Danes had seldom exceeded 11 per cent. Those great butter-producing countries, when the law stepped in and made 16 per cent. the legal limit, said there was no obligation on them to furnish dry butter; the law would condone an amount of water up to the extent of 16 per cent. I am sure that the amount of water in butter now is larger than it was when we took up the question, and the consumer would have been better off if we had never handled the question of water in butter at all.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- When they have a full franchise, they may be able to do so. The House of Commons will then pass legislation giving the necessary protection. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thorpe</inline> says that there is no doubt whatever that the effect of the limitation as to the amount of water which may be in butter has worked out to the detriment of the consumer. In Victoria, since 1906, and in New South Wales, butter cannot be sold locally which contains more than 15 per cent. of moisture, and, during the past three seasons, the percentage of moisture in the butter exported from the Commonwealth has been considerably below 14 per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crowe,</inline> the Government dairy expert of Victoria, is of opinion that the  15  per cent. maximum has been of considerable benefit to manufacturers, as it has been found that the lower temperature necessary to keep the moisture within the standard assists in recovering more butter fat in the churning, and thus compensates the factories for the extra trouble taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Callaghan,</inline> the New South Wales dairy expert, has pointed out that butter with a low percentage of moisture is of undoubtedly better quality than butter with a high percentage. The mover of the motion said that increased moisture did not deteriorate the quality of butter. </para>

                            <para>It is a well known fact that if we increase the percentage of water in our butter to any thing like 16 per cent., we shall, without a doubt, cause a falling off in the quality of our manufacture. The keeping quality is bound to suffer to a considerable extent, because the process of fermentation which is brought about by bacterial agency will be carried on much more rapidly in the presence of 16 per cent. of water than of 12 per cent. ... A salted butter containing 16 per cent. of water, unless the maker is a very good artist, will undoubtedly be of a weak texture, and will show a lot of free moisture on being tried with the butter borer. Thus the intending purchaser is prejudiced, and will not feel disposed to buy at top prices. . .  The more one looks at this question in detail, the more one is inclined to ask the question - &#34; Is the gain that is possible by the manufacture of a butter on the border line of the moisture boundary worth the risk of the bad advertisement which any factory, or country, is sure to gain, if its produce is frequently found on its arrival in England to contain an excessive amount of water?&#34; </para>

                                <para>- I am sorry that so many members of the Labour party apparently back up the commission agents, who regard themselves at a disadvantage in having to sell butter in London whose moisture contents do not exceed 15 per cent. Let me quote some of the leading authorities in Europe regarding moisture in butter. Professor Storch says that the moisture in well-made butter will average 13.03 per cent.; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Barthel</inline> says, writing in 1910, the moisture in a well-made butter will average 13 per cent. ; Professor Fleischmann says that the average will be 12.5 per cent. ; and Professor Vieth, who recently analyzed a number of . butters for the Aylesbury Company, London, found water present as follows: - English, 11.54 per cent.; French, 12.05 Per cent.; German, 12.24 Per cent.; Danish, 13.42 per cent. ; Swedish, 13.75 per cent. At the World&#39;s Fair, Chicago, the average moisture contents of butters submitted for competition was 11.57 per cent. The evidence goes to show that there is no need for adding an extra ton of water to the butter that is sold. </para>

He had more land on his feet then than I have ever seen him carrying in his hands since I have known him. That is the only work I have seen him do on the land, but he knows that I have been connected with the land in Queensland ever since he has known me. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, my wife had a dairy  when I was working, and she earned more money with it than I did with my work. So that, if I did not know anything about it, she had experience of it. The honorable member for Capricornia has accused the honorable member,, for Richmond of wanting to put water in the butter. I can assure the honorable member that he is making a false accusation in that regard. All that the honorable member for Richmond asks for, and all that the cooperative dairymen in the Maranoa electorate ask for, is that their product shall be allowed to enter the Old Country with the same percentage of moisture as is allowed in butter from other countries. AH they want is fair, square, open competition. Why the Minister of Trade and Customs should want to make Australia the real white lily of the whole of the butter trade of the world is beyond- me. The honorable member for Capricornia made great capital out of the report of the Victorian expert. Any one who has had to do with making butter by the old hand process knows that the more you mix it the more you reduce it in weight. The oftener you work it, the more you bring the percentage down until you get absolute butterfat, and then you might as well have suet. He talks about protecting the Australian consumer. I venture to say that every man sitting with him in the Labour party is prepared to protect the consumer to the utmost of his power, but surely the honorable member wants to give our producers the same square deal as is given to the people in other parts of the globe, with whom they have to compete? I wish the honorable member was engaged in the butter industry, and then he would have a little more feeling on the question. I have one or two extracts that I wish to read. In the first place, I desire to read a little further on in the letter from the Co-operative Dairy Companies&#39; Association of Queensland than where the honorable member for Capricornia stopped. I may say that the honorable member is as artful and wily a politician as is our old friend, the honorable member for Hume. The honorable member just read one part of the motion, which is as follows - </para>

                            <para>No fault to be found with Queensland butter this season, and we have not had a single case of excessive moisture; this trouble seems to have ceased as regards Australian butter. The increase in imports from Australia is 45 per cent. and 10 per cent., taking Australian and New Zealand butter imports together. With the improvement now seen in butter imports into this country, the public, finding a better quality available without any increase in price, are buying greater quantities. Give the masses a thoroughly food and reliable article, and a greater consumption may be expected from the same number of people. </para>
                            <para>Queensland butter holds its own well on this market. The relative positions as regards average prices of the various descriptions of Commonwealth butter are this season the same as they have always been, though Queensland brands made a great advance a couple of seasons ago. </para>

                            <para>A large proportion of Australian butter is used by distributers for blending and milling purposes. The butter that the public buy at a shop is, to a very great extent, compounded of several different descriptions. This practice is perfectly legal and justifiable, assuming that the moisture limit is not exceeded, and that only pure butters are mixed. </para>

I wish to get back to the basic principle that induced the honorable member for Richmond to bring forward this motion - that is, we do not want our products to enter the Home market at a disadvantage compared with those from other countries. We are not asking for any favour. We want a fair and square deal from the Minister in this matter. Why does he want to reduce the standard for moisture in Australian butter to 1 per cent. below that at which other countries send their butter into the London market ? </para>

He has the interests of the industry at heart, and wants to see the right thing done by it, both here and in the Old Country.  His  firm, who are exporters of butter, are not anxious that the moisture standard should be increased, except to put them on the same footing as exporters from other countries. He says - </para>

                        <para>I think if you were to make inquiries at the offices of our Department of Agriculture, you will find that the average percentage of moisture in butter exported last year from Queensland is less than 144 per cent. At first glance it would appear that if the average is only <inline font-style="italic">i4i</inline> per cent, why object to 15 per cent, maximum, but it was 14^ per cent, because the factories do not care to run any risk at all of being fined for excessive moisture at 16 per cent. If this reduction to 15 per cent, maximum comes into force, the factories will pay the dairy farmers 1 per cent, less for their cream, consequently the dairy farmers are 1 per cent, worse off. </para>
                        <para class="block">That is another consideration that appeals to me. We want to benefit the consumer, but the man who is going to lose under this regulation is the man who sends his milk to the creamery. </para>

                                <para>- I  do not pose as an expert; but my own opinion is that inferior butters, manufactured in, or imported into, Great Britain, and containing a large percentage of moisture, are mixed with the good butter obtained from Australia, so that the moisture contents of butter sold as of Australian production are thereby increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mant</inline> continues - </para>

                            <para>The present chart by which cream is purchased from the factories is worked out on the basis of 84.01 per cent, butter fat for 1 lb. of butter, and it is proposed now to prepare a new chart for 84.85 per cent, butter fat, in other words, pay the dairymen the same price for 84.85 per cent, butter fat as against 84.01 per cent, in the old chart. I hope you will induce the Minister not to bring the new regulations into force on the 1st July, but get the matter put off until it can be thoroughly threshed out, if. necessary, in Parliament, because it means a tremendous loss for possibly a small gain. During 1909-10 season the imports of Australian butter into England were, say, r, 150,800 boxes, at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> ros. - ^2,877,000, which, at 1 per cent., means ^28,770. A fairly tidy sum to be taken out of the pockets of the dairymen. This season it would be over ^40,000 if the present rate of export continues. Then, besides this, there were some 46,000 boxes exported from Queensland to other places during the 1909-10 season, say, another ,&#163;1,150, at 1 per cent., at a very low valuation, also all the butter that is consumed in Australia as well as the quantity exported to other places by the remaining States. You will observe from these figures that it is rather an expensive matter to the dairymen, and it is in no wise a certainty that the butter will bring a higher price by having the moisture reduced. The Federal Government may also argue that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meares,</inline> of Sydney, stated that the co-operative companies were prepared to accept 15 per cent, moisture (he did this as the Government in the first instance wanted to make it 14 per cent.) thinking, no doubt, that &#34; half a loaf was better than no bread,&#34; but he did not speak for everyone, and had the&#39; matter been put in the light that I have tried to put it, surely the Government would have agreed to 16 per cent. I fancy the arguments used by the Federal Customs are that they wish the quality of Australian butter to be raised to a higher standard by reducing the maximum moisture to 15 per cent., and they say this ought to assist their object. As far as Queensland is concerned, when the Agricultural Department have any butter submitted for export giving over 16 per cent, moisture, the factory is fined, and the butter must be re-worked and brought down to the correct percentage before it can be exported, and I understand that in only very few instances in England, Queensland brands of butter are fined for excessive moisture, but I believe that the State laws in the South are somewhat different. As far as conveniences of checking the moisture by the Government are concerned, in Queensland the churn marks are put on all the boxes, but in the South I believe there are no churn marks put on. The consequence of the latter is this, a consignment of 800 boxes may come in from a factory, the owners do not want it grade marked, so the Government officer picks out 80 boxes, they may only be from five (5) churns (he cannot possibly tell) and they may be found to be right as far as moisture is concerned, and he puts the &#34; approved for export &#34; stamp on the whole lot, whereas, there may be some of the&#39; churns that contain excessive moisture, which latter are all exported. In Queensland one box is taken from each churn and the moisture carefully checked. The result is that in Queensland butters the fines in England can be practically  counted on your fingers, whereas, I understand that there have been hundreds of fines imposed in connexion with Southern butters. Possibly this is another argument the Federal people may use for reducing the moisture to 15 per cent., but I should think it is rather rough on Queensland to have to suffer until the present system in vogue in Queensland is given a trial as far as the other States are concerned. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is the opinion of an export agent, and I am satisfied that it is a fair and unbiased one. When T received this letter I made inquiries, both on the Darling Downs and up in the Maranoa, as to the accuracy of the statements which it contained, and every one to whom I spoke - both factory managers and dairy-farmers - assured me that they were absolutely correct. Here is another statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mant</inline> - </para>

                            <para>We certainly think that, as far as Queensland is concerned, at any rate, 16 per cent, maximum is necessary. We fail to see why it should be altered, considering that this standard passes the London market, which practically rules the world. If the moisture limit is reduced to 14 per cent, the buyers in London are more likely to reap the benefit than the producers, and there is no doubt about it that butter containing 16 per cent, moisture can be of excellent quality. 1  have no desire to labour this question, as I know that honorable members are anxious to proceed to a vote. I hope that the House will recognise the need for some revision of the regulation. As&#39; a matter of fact, if J. were the Minister, I would not allow the motion to proceed to a division. The dairying industry ranks third among the industries of Australia, and its exports to England in  1909-10  were approximately of the value of  ,&#163;2,877,000.  Surely that is worth some consideration. I ask the Minister now to agree to the motion. </para>

I urge him to give the dairy farmers of Australia the same treatment as the Old Country extends in the matter of its imports to the butter producers of the world. We are not going down on our knees to him. We are not supplicating any favour. </para>

Every one of our Ministers is tied up with red-tape, and I am one of those who are ready to come along, not with a pair of scissors, but with a big pair of shears to rip off the red-tape and set them free. I ask the Minister to come out of his shell ; to do away with officialdom in this matter, and to agree to this motion. </para>

                            <para>. - I have no desire to pose as a dairy expert, but I may say that I have learnt everything relating to dairying, from the milking of the cow to the manufacture of the butter, and the placing of it on the market. As a matter of fact, during the last forty years I have spent my whole energies in the manufacture of butter, so that anything I say to-day will describe my own experiences and express my own opinion. I have no desire to quote the opinions of others, except, perhaps, for the purpose of refuting them. The honorable member for Capricornia quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Callaghan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crowe</inline> as dairy experts who he contends have recommended 15 per cent., but if the honorable member will look at the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Agriculture of Victoria</inline> of 12th June, page 380, he will see, under the heading of &#34; Butter </para>

                        <para class="block">Analysis,&#34; a table showing the difference in results between butter containing boric acid and butter without any, together with the composition of each. It is shown that in sample numbered 19, the butter contained 83.92 per cent, of fat, 14.50 per cent, of moisture, .43 per cent, of salt, 1.06 per cent, of curd, and .092 of boric acid, and that the points awarded were 90 per cent. This means, I suppose, points awarded either by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crowe</inline> or by some of his experts. In another sample, numbered 37, the fat contents were 88.68 per cent., the moisture contents 9.00 per cent., the salt 1.55 per cent., the curd .77 per cent., and the points awarded were 87 per cent. It will be seen from this that butter which contained 14.50 per cent, of moisture was awarded three more points than butter which contained only 9 per cent, of moisture. Points may be awarded on the taste and smell of the men who judge the butter, but analysis is the only sure way of ascertaining the amount of moisture. I know from long experience that there is nothing &#39;more deceptive than the moisture contents of butter; it is almost impossible for any one to judge by looking at the butter, or by sticking the trier into it. I am surprised to see the evident anxiety of the honorable member for Melbourne to curtail the moisture percentage, and I think such views come with bad grace from a member of the medical profession. I remember, some time ago, I paid a medical gentleman 7s. 6d. for a prescription made up of 1 oz. soda hypo, and 15 ozs. <inline font-style="italic">aqua pura,</inline> and I paid a chemist 2s. 6d. for making up that prescription ; but I can believe that the water was the better part of the medicine. Some twelve months ago, when a deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs from the Co-operative Companies, he said he would give the 15 per cent, regulation at least twelve months&#39; trial, although experience all over the world has fixed 16 per cent, as reasonable. In order to show that the industry is an important one and deserves some consideration, I may point out that the figures for 1910, which are the latest available, show that there was in that year exported from Australia 87,894,943 lbs., valued at .&#163;3.951, 131- Charges have been made in this House and outside by some of our friends on the Ministerial side, to the effect that moisture in butter puts money into the coffers of the manufacturers or middlemen; indeed, the honorable member for Capricornia hinted this afternoon that it is the commercial men who benefit. 1 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs.</inline> - I believe the commercial men will get more of the benefit than will the dairy-farmers. </para>

Some years ago the middlemen  got  all the advantage out of the dairying industry ; but there was an awakening amongst the farmers, who united for the purpose of doing their own business. At present, in the three leading dairying States, the greater proportion of the manufacture and distribution are conducted by the farmers themselves. </para>

The honorable member for Richmond has made out a very good case, and  &#39;has  given us a let of expert opinion as to how butter should be manufactured, and so on. It is absolutely necessary, in order to make good butter, to wash it thoroughly, and the next question is - How much moisture should be taken out, or how much should be left in, good butter? Of course, what the honorable member for Capricornia desires to  pump into  the ears of the people of Australia seems a terrible indictment, but may T remind him that every ton of bread which is consumed contains half a ton of moisture? Vet nothing is said about that  matter.  I think that this new regulation will confer no benefit upon the producers; but, in time to come, it will undoubtedly lead to more adulteration than exists at present. Its only object is to protect the consumer on the other side of the water, who, I am quite sure, is well able to protect himself. It simply means allowing blenders oversea to manipulate our  dry butter  to their own advantage.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs.</inline> - How can it be manipulated ? </para>

That butter will be bought up by blenders on the other side of the world, and milk, and probably water, will be pumped into it. Every ounce of moisture that we take out of it here merely affords an opportunity to blenders oversea to put exactly that much more into it.

I do not think that tHat is the case. It is a well-known fact that during the past year the Department which has charge of this matter has paid a great deal more attention to butter than it did previously. During the past twelve months more samples have been tested by it than were tested formerly. Here I may be permitted to interpolate that it is not the sample that shows the most free moisture which contains the most moisture. The honorable member for Richmond was a little mixed upon this aspect of the question, but with the remainder of his speech I am in entire agreement. When I refer to &#34; free &#34; moisture, I mean moisture which will run away from butter or shows itself freely.

He further says that the Western District averaged  14.12  per cent., the Co-operative factories showed a percentage of  14.9,  and the proprietary of  14.15.  In Gippsland the average was  14.06;  Co-operative,  14.12;  proprietary,  13.89.  In the north and northeast, the average was  14.01  ; Co-operative,  13,96  ; proprietary,  14.16.

It is extraordinary that a man should be set upon in this way, apparently because he happens to be a unionist. First of all, I see no reason why free labourers should be employed on work of the kind where equally competent union labour is available. I notice that the right honorable member for Swan is willing to cheer an assault on unionists. </para>

                <para>Although I have often had good grounds for complaint against the press, this is the first time in over&#39; eleven years in this House that I have risen to resent a misrepresentation. I happen to know sufficient about the inner workings of newspapers to enable me to discount their criticism of my conduct. My experience on the press as a reporter warrants me in saying that I know what is expected from a reporter. And I doubt whether any decent newspaper expects its representative in this Parliament to take up a partisan attitude, or would knowingly allow him to gratify in its columns his personal bias. It certainly was not expected of journalists in my time on the press.  I never object to what a newspaper says about me if it represents fairly what I have .said and1 done. I think that the position of politicians generally &#39;is this - that newspapers can say whatever they like about them, as long as they report them fairly, and give the public an opportunity of learning the true facts on which the journals comment. Unfortunately, however, that is not the experience of honorable members in this House. For instance, I hold in my hand a copy of a report sent to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about the debates in this House last week. Of course, this is not the first time that the creature who is responsible for these reports - and I say, as an old newspaper man, that in my opinion he is utterly incompetent for the position in which, he is placed- </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that any one is in doubt about the identity of the person referred to. Speaking of die division on the redistribution of Queensland electorates, this individual writes to the effect that the Labour party only considered &#34; the welfare of the sitting members.&#34; He speaks of the action, of the honorable member for Herbert in opposing the adoption of the Queensland scheme as being a &#34; pitiable appeal to his fellow-members to get him what he called a fair deal.&#34; Then there is an implication that Ministers were insincere in voting in favour of the report of the Commissioners, and that the whole thing was a put-up job. The real truth is, of course, that Ministers took a very high stand, quite different to that of the late Government in similar circumstances. If our Ministers had followed the precedent established by honorable members opposite, they would have voted for the rejection of the Commissioners&#39; report. I think, personally, that Ministers acted under a mistaken sense of loyalty to the Commissioners. The . latter - are fallible human beings, liable to err like the rest of us; and if the House thinks they have made an error, there is no . reflection on them in sending their report back for reconsideration. That is all that the House did ; and these charges about gerrymandering in which the right honorable member for Swan indulged were so much moonshine, as he himself well knows. </para>

Moreover, thirty-six electors in the Kimberley constituency returned a member to the Legislative- Assembly, and thirty-two electors returned another member. That is. how the honorable gentleman kept in. power. Yet in a burst of well-simulated indignation he speaks of some one else :S having gerrymandered. </para>

He is the great dictator, and anything done for him is done because of his great merits, and is only what he deserves ! There is no reciprocal obligation on his part towards those who treat him with respect and forbearance. He would not acknowledge that anything was done out of good feeling, or because of the courtesy which should exist in the relations between gentlemen. He regards every concession made to him as a tribute to his greatness and eminence. I am putting a certain amount of restraint on myself in regard to his utterances, though I admit that he is giving me great provocation. </para>

Surely it is permissible to approach one&#39;s fellow-members in regard to a matter like this, on which they have no local knowledge. It is better to do that than to take them up backstairs, and give them a dinner. I do not dine and wine people in order to win them round ; I put the facts fairly before them, and if they think that I have made out a good case, I expect them to vote with me with a good conscience. I do not get my way by taking persons up back stairs, seating them behind screens, and giving them champagne. </para>

                        <para>- There is an old saying that there is no necessity to put the cap on unless it fits you. I have nothing to withdraw regarding the right honorable member, and, as I said the other night, I hope we shall be as good friends as ever. I trust that his wonderful geniality will enable him to extend to me, if I have trespassed, his usual forgiveness. I rose today for the specific purpose of correcting the mendacious inventions of a newspaper correspondent whose effusions show that his partisanship and personal bias unfit him for his position. I did not intend to make any reflections upon the right honorable member, and he has really brought the matter on himself. There is a general implication throughout the whole article that the Labour party, in voting against these divisions, endeavoured to gain a party advantage. Although all the members of the Labour party, outside the members of the Government, with the exception of the Whip, voted against the scheme, I point to the remarkable fact that every member of the Opposition, to a man, was whipped up to vote for it. If there is any party movement on one side, there certainly is a party movement on the other. Another remarkable coincidence is that, for the first time this session, every Oppositionist in another place, with one exception, was to the fore the other night when the Western Australian divisions came up to be dealt with. </para>

Well, I feel no apprehension about my &#34; farmer friends.&#34; I hope I shall have as many farming friends as I have always had.

                    <para>.- I wish to ask the Attorney-General when his Department will be in a position to announce the best way of giving effect to the policy of the Minister of Defence on the question of the fining of cadets for non-attendance at drill ? Injustice seems to have been meted out in a number of these cases in New South Wales. The lads are called up before stipendiary magistrates, and bundled through without any consideration being given to their cases. In Several instances it could have been shown, if the boys had been allowed to state their case, that it was impossible for them to attend the drills, but the magistrates, as I have often noticed in Police Courts, have the lads simply bundled up and charged, no statement of the case is allowed, the cases are run through as fast as possible, and a fine or imprisonment awarded. I understand that the Minister of Defence has decided to adopt a policy of fining the lads 2s. for each hour lost at drill, and compelling them to make up their lost time. He stated that the matter had been referred to the Attorney- General&#39;s Department on 25th July, so that the necessary steps could be taken to enable the Governor-General in Council to give effect to his ideas. I wish to impress on the Attorney-General the urgency of inviting the officers of his Department to go into the matter immediately, so that the cases of injustice which are occurring under the law as it stands may be remedied. </para>

                        <para>- The Legislature of the United States took practically a whole page of a Bill to define a monopoly, -and in an American case, the record of which I saw, the Judge decided that the combination concerned was not a monopoly. It is very desirable that we should have a memorandum prepared by the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, to supply us with precise information as to the extent of the proposed transfer of powers from- the -States to the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>There is another matter to which I refer, which concerns the Minister of the Department for External Affairs. As the honorable gentleman is not present at the moment, I hope that he will see the report of my remarks later on, and will make inquiry into the matter. In the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> during last week, an article appeared from the pen of Harry S. Gullett, dated from London, 21st June, in regard to the immigration policy of the New South Wales Government. I quote the following paragraph from that article - </para>

                    <para>Tas Family Scandal. </para>
                    <para>Another point about which the emigration agents are concerned is the almost absolute refusal of New South Wales to accept working men with families. Lately I have heard of .a number of cases of farm labourers of the best kind, and also of small farmers possessed of a little capital, who have been refused assistance to New South Wales. They are told that they cannot be accepted because of their children. One recognises the difficulty of placing such mcn in country employment. Obviously the farmer who wants a labourer fails to sec why he should be obliged to support the labourer&#39;s wife and half-a-dozen youngsters too young to be of any assistance. But, while admitting this, it is most unfortunate that the immigration movement should find it impossible to include the very best material that is on offer. </para>
                    <para>The proportion of ultimate failures among child emigrants would certainly be much lower than that among adults. It is extremely difficult to explain to the British people that an immigration scheme which is really sincere can find no room for the healthy growing child. New South Wales has been especially hostile to children ; Queensland has been far more sympathetic, and so has Victoria; while Canada has also had an open door for them. They are carried cheaply by the shipping companies, and it is a great pity that the State Government  cannot  devise some means to receive all that are on offer. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not know whether that statement is correct, and I should be very sorry to think that it is. I refer, to the matter because this Parliament cannot altogether escape responsibility in connexion with the question of immigration. It is one of the matters over which we have authority under the Constitution. If we find that the State Governments are carrying out an unsatisfactory immigration policy, if is, in my opinion, our duty to exercise our authority. I suggest that the- Minister of External Affairs should make inquiries from the New South Wales Government with respect to the matter to which I have directed attention. </para>

                    <para>.- I rise to correct the honorable member for Coolgardie. He stated that at Ashburton there were sixty-four votes. That is not accurate, because, as a matter of fact, there were only fifty-four electors enrolled there. Later on he made a slight error with respect to Grey. The total number of electors enrolled there is sixty-six. Strange to say that at Irwin there are only ninety. </para>

                        <para>-I take it that, in common with other members of the Government, the Minister of Trade and Customs has a messenger to attend to his Department, but he has no courier. I do not think that any member of a Commonwealth Government has so far been so ridiculous as to employ a courier. Such a statement as I have referred to should be corrected at the earliest possible moment. Another statement which could only emanate from  a  lady of not very high intelligence, but vast imagination, was that we shall have to spend &#163;50,000,000 in the next two years because the Labour party occupy the Treasury benches. The publication of such ridiculous statements throughout the country can only bring contempt upon the people responsible for them as soon as they are disproved. </para>
