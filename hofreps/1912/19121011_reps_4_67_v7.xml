                            <para>- As a misunderstanding seems to have arisen in connexion with the grievance debate yesterday, I wish to make a personal explanation about the matter. It seems to be thought that I entered into an arrangement for a certain course to be taken, my remark that I would not be long, being interpreted to mean that I was making an arrangement binding others. I did not intend, and had no right, to make any such arrangement, the deputy-leader of the Opposition being within the precincts of the House, and I am sorry that a misunderstanding arose. I am sure that the Minister of Trade and Customs was under the impression that an arrangement was made, but I say now that that was quite a misunderstanding. </para>

                            <para>- I was the senior Minister in the chamber when the grievance motion was called on. As honorable members had for two days been discussing grievances upon a Supply Bill, an honorable member on this side at once moved the adjournment of the debate. The ex-Treasurer, the right honorable member for Swan, then said that if the grievance discussion were permitted to go on it would not continue for more than half-an-hour - at least that was the impression which I and some of the members of his own side received from his remarks. I therefore asked the honorable member who moved the adjournment of the debate, to withdraw his motion, which he did on the distinct understanding that the grievance debate would not continue after one o'clock, and I informed the Prime Minister of the understanding arrived at as the result of what has been said by the right honorable member for Swan. </para>

Seeing that the State Governments have been expending money for the conveyance of nominated and assisted immigrants, and the High Commissioner thinks it necessary that an assurance be given that immigration will be assisted and encouraged for four or five years to come, will the right honorable gentleman bring the matter before the Governments of the States, so that there may be some arrangement between them and him by which such assurance can be given, and a continuous flow of immigration made certain? </para>

                        <para>My object just now is to show the extent to which our power over corporations is impaired, and how little power we have to deal with corporations. In the Huddart-Parker case, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> Vol. VIII., page 330, the decision, so far as corporations are concerned, was that the power does not extend to enable the Commonwealth to control the conduct of corporations in respect of internal trade. The dicta of the Court indicate that the power does not extend to the creation of corporations, but only to corporations already formed; that it extends to the status and capacity of such corporations, but not to their behaviour, the ambiguity on this point being resolved in favour of the narrower construction in view of the implied reservation to the States of internal trade. The "case leaves the extent of the power in great doubt, but it appears clear that it does not enable the Commonwealth to pass a comprehensive Companies Act providing for the creation, control, and dissolution of companies. </para>

                        <para>It follows that the power does not extend to trade and commerce within a State, and consequently, that the power to legislate as to internal trade and commerce is reserved to the State by the operation of section 107 to the exclusion of the Commonwealth, and this as fully and effectively as if section 51 (&gt;) had contained negative words prohibiting the exercise of such power. ... In other words, I think that paragraph 20 empowers the Commonwealth _ to prohibit a trading or financial corporation formed within the Commonwealth from entering into any field of operation, but does not empower the Commonwealth to control the operations of a corporation which lawfully enters upon a field of opertaion, the control of which is exclusively reserved to the States. </para>

                    <para class="block">These words are perfectly clear. They are free from ambiguity. There is not the shadow of a doubt that we cannot pass a general company law. As to my honorable and learned friend's statement that the decision means that we have the same power over companies as over persons, so far as I know that is not so. To the extent that our powers go, we have power over persons ; wherever we have power over their status we have power over their behaviour. In regard to companies, we have power over their status in some respects, but no power at all over their behaviour, and since it is with the behaviour of companies that the public is chiefly concerned, we really have no power over companies, and therefore no power to make a general company law. </para>

Did not the <inline font-style="italic">Huddart Parker</inline> case decide that our attempt to exercise, under the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906, greater jurisdiction over companies than over persons was not founded upon any constitutional power? In other words, did it not decide that we could do in respect of companies exactly what we could do under our power in respect of persons ? Does the Attorney-General say that we have not the same power to control the operations of companies in relation to Inter- State trade and commerce that we have to control the operations of persons? </para>

I' shall, however, give one answer to the honorable member's question. Where our power is clear, as it is, for instance, in respect of defence, there is no limit, inside that sphere, to its scope over persons or anything else. We may, therefore, legislate in respect not only to status, but also to behaviour. In short, our power is plenary. But our power, under section 51, stops very far short of this.

                                <para>- Yes ; I may  say  that so far as stations on the Queensland coast are concerned, the Brisbane station is working most satisfactorily. The constructing engineer, with apparatus, is now on his way to Papua, and it is hoped that at the end of November, at the very latest, we shall be able to communicate by wireless between Brisbane and Port Moresby. The construction of the Townsville station has also reached a stage that leads us to anticipate that it will be working by  30th  November next. </para>

                        <para>- I made a brief reference yesterday, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman's</inline> statement. I prefer not to discuss the matter, but the facts may be briefly mentioned. The Government of New South Wales informed us that they desired the use of Government House, Sydney, for State purposes. Subsequently, we represented to them the desirableness of continuing its use as a residence for the Governor-General during Lord Denman's term of office. The State Government then proposed to allow us the use of Government House itself with portion of the grounds, and to use the remaining area for public purposes. The Commonwealth Government were agreeable to the adoption of that course, and were prepared to pay for the maintenance and upkeep of the grounds that were left for the use of the Governor-General. The </para>

                    <para class="block">State Government, however, demanded payment at the rate of 3½ per cent. on the capital value of the land and building occupied by the Governor-General. We felt that we could not accept that proposal. It was tantamount to paying rent to a landlord by way of interest on his property, and usually where rent is paid the landlord has to provide for maintenance. We had proposed to keep the grounds in fair condition, and the house in repair, and we thought that that was the extreme limit to which we could go. I deplore the whole business. I have taken more pains, and shown more courtesy and consideration in this than I have ever done in connexion with any other matter, and I have done so simply because the question involved another with whom we are all associated, and who cannot speak for himself. </para>

                    <para>. - I urge on the Committee the necessity for maintaining the clause as it stands. Rightly or wrongly, we are carrying out the established policy of Australia, namely,, the maintenance afloat of the same standard; of comfort that we have decided shall be maintained ashore. I have no complaint to make of the tone of the discussion of this measure by honorable members opposite, but I impress upon them that, just as in the Mother Country there are some questions, like that of foreign policy, above party considerations, there are questions here which should be similarly regarded.. The standard of comfort of living in Australia should be discussed quite apart from any party leanings, so that successive Governments, and all contracting parties, may understand what is the settled policy of the country. </para>

                        <para>- There is no necessity for any party conflict on questions of the kind. The honorable member for -Swan has urged that the conveyance of passengers by the mail steamers on the Australian coast is a great convenience to the people of Western Australia and the other States, and that any prohibition would do a great injury to the people of the State he represents. That, however, is not, in my opinion, a fear for which we should have any regard; we should realize that unless this clause be accepted great injury would be done to the shipping interests of Australia - that it will mean sacrificing the Shipowners Federation of this country for the shipping combines of the Old World. If honorable members opposite are prepared to do that, I am not. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly; my -desire is to bring the debate to close quarters. It may be a matter for amusement to honorable members opposite; but the standard of living in Australia is a serious matter for us on this side. In what I am going to say I am speaking on the -authority of one of the leading members -of the Shipowners Federation; and, while I shall not mention his name publicly, I -am quite prepared to give it privately to any honorable member opposite who desires it. Although on questions affecting labour and capital I have differed from this gentleman, I have always found him perfectly truthful and upright; and I should be almost prepared to take his word before that of any other man in Australia. We all know of the great rush of passengers there is from March to June in order to reach London in time for " the season." There is a whole army of Australians who live mainly on cutting coupons and signing receipts, and who are deeply "interested in travelling round Europe. I do not say that all the travellers are of "that class, but it is the latter, and not the hard-working people, who are making the most noise over this question. The Shipowners Federation have striven with some marked success to place at the disposal of the public a type of steamer that is quite sufficient for all the requirements of the ordinary person who is not educated up to the standard of the English " Johnny." When the rush on the mail boats is over they are patronised by people who wish to travel luxuriously, to the detriment of the Inter-State steamers ; and I am informed that in the future there will be a tendency to lay up the latter. The Australian vessels are not built for cargo, but for cargo and passengers, and unless they can get a full complement of both, the companies, which are not benevolent societies, will have *o put them out of commission. The tendency of certain people is to use the mail boats when they can, and thus there &gt; are not full passenger lists for the first class ships built by the Ship-owners Federation. The local ship-owners are doing the best they can to give every comfort and convenience, according to modern standards, to Australian travellers. If a good case is made out the Government can : grant an exemption from the coasting-trade provisions, and there is no doubt that whatever Government is in office when the Bill becomes an Act, will have to use great tact and judgment in administering it. I urge honorable members to understand clearly that we are simply studying the interests of our own shipping trade. The argument I used last night has never been refuted. The Australian Ship-owners Federation is not the only shipping combine in the world. The owners are all in combines and shipping rings so far as oversea shipping is concerned, but they cut the trade out to suit themselves. If they can do that as capitalistic combines, surely we in the Parliament, of Australia can cut the trade out to suit Australia, and will not be doing any injustice in doing so? There is no prohibition against oversea vessels. They can come into the trade if they like by getting a permit, and they ought to be in a position to do so. It ought to pay them better than it would pay the Australian Ship-owners Federation,, because, according to the arguments of the right honorable member for Swan and other members of the Opposition, their passenger rates are higher than those on the InterState vessels. That fact must mean more profit to the two companies in question, which ought in the very nature of things to be able to bear the burden of higher wages better than their competitors, the Ship-owners' Federation of Australia. There is, therefore, no excuse for the attitude of those two shipping companies, and the Opposition are simply bolstering up their interests. We have heard a good deal about loyalty to England over this matter; but there are two kinds of loyalty. In one way loyalty is very much like grief. We have all witnessed exhibitions of grief of such a noisy character that they are a nuisance to everybody. On the other hand, with some human beings there is an absence of outward manifestations of grief, although the square-set jaw shows that they are affected ten times more intensely than are those who make a great noise. The same applies to loyalty. We hear a good deal about loyalty from members on the other side, but let me tell them that they have not secured a monopoly of loyalty to the Mother Country. They exhibit a species of loyalty which consists of drum-beating and flag-waving, and noise-making, and humbug generally. They are quite welcome to any amount of that kind of thing, but there is quite as much real loyalty on this as on the other side of the House, although we do not parade it. We are prepared to respect our English brothers, and cherish the English connexion. We are as proud of speaking the tongue of Shakespeare and Milton as is any honorable member opposite, and if the Old Country were in trouble, we should be prepared to spend every shilling, and offer every life to uphold her integrity. But we can do all that without making a parade of it. Perhaps I have a right to speak on this matter as one who represented this Parliament at the Coronation. I would give place to nobody in loyalty to the Crown and respect for the wearer of the Crown as an English gentleman. I would urge those noisy loyalists in the Opposition ranks, when recognising the Queen of England as the first lady in the realm, to make themselves acquainted with the manner in which she dresses herself and her children. If then they, and those connected with them, imitated her in that regard, they might be doing something of practical value on this side of the world. After all, this is not a question of loyalty to the Mother Country, so much as a question of loyalty to the ship-owners' combines of the Mother Country. I refuse to go out of my way to display a great amount of loyalty to them, merely in order to enable them to secure plunder in Australian waters. I consider that the right honorable member for Swan is doing everything he can to benefit the Peninsular and Oriental Company and the Orient Company to the detriment of the Shipowners' Federation of Australia. That is the plain issue, and the right honorable member cannot burke it. Members of the Opposition speak of the producers of Australia with their tongues in their cheeks. Their purpose is simply to throw dust in the eyes of the Australian people. I have always understood that our wheat, wool, and apples did not go in the mail boats alone, but are also carried by the Ocean Steam-ship Company and other companies. After all, what is the Inter-State trade to the producer? When there happens to be a scarcity in some States of chaff and products of that character the produce becomes the subject of Inter-State trade ; but that is a mere bagatelle in comparison with the great oversea trade with, which the Bill does not interfere at all. There is, therefore, nothing in that argument. The producer does not suffer, and honorable members opposite know that he does not; but, of course, if they can get the people to believe that the producing interests of Australia are suffering, the game is satisfactory from a party point of view. I think, however, that we should get a little above party in discussing questions of this character. The right honorable member for' Swan referred last night to myself and others as defenders of the shipping combine of Australia. I have nothing to do with that combine, and am totally opposed to allowing any combine to operate injuriously to the public interest. If we secure the necessary powers for this Parliament, the Ship-owners Federation and other combines will have to toe the mark, so far as I am concerned. The right honorable member for Swan quoted last night from <inline font-style="italic">Fair Play</inline> to show that the ship-owners of Australia had made plenty of money, and so had the shipping companies of Great Britain. I do not think the ship-owners of Australia have made more money during the good times than have the squatting and other interests. There has been a good time all round, and the ship-owner has possibly done as well as his neighbours, but certainly no better. I could not help remarking the fact that the right honorable member quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Fair Play</inline> to show that the profit of the Ocean Steam-ship Company was  30  per cent. I should think that was rather above the mark. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to think that the proper name is the Ocean Steam-ship Company, which is generally known here as Alfred Holt's Blue Funnel Line. The remarkable fact is that that line pay higher wages than do any of their competitiors, and, in addition, give a bonus to all their servants from the captain on the bridge to the trimmer in the stoke-hole. Their ships are better found, and in every way superior to those of all their competitors in the Old Country, proving that it is possible for a company to give good conditions to their employes, without compulsion, and at the same time to make money. Every one who has dealings with&gt; the Blue Funnel line either as an employe or as a traveller can give them a good name. </para>

                        <para>- I urge honorable members to get away from their prejudices on this matter, because the main issue is : Are we going to allow our standard to be maintained? If we are, we must extend to the Ship-owners Federation of Australia an amount of protection that will enable them to keep up the standard that the Commonwealth requires. There is no necessity to drag the British Government into this matter, because, after all, our policy is very simple. It is to enact a law that is in the best interests of Australia. Our controversy with the British Government on the subject need not be carried on in any way offensively and I am certain that if Australia is firm and frank in the matter those who are in the counsels of the Mother Country will recognise before long that what the oversea Dominions are demanding for themselves is, after all, only fair and reasonable. </para>

                    <para>.- I am certain that if honorable members on the Ministerial side of the House had to come by sea from their constituencies to this city they would be supporting us, especially if they had had a few trips across the Australian Bight on a boat which was only partially loaded - and the coasters usually have to return from the west with very little cargo. I can assure those honorable members who come to this House in a nice sleeping car that it is a different proposition to spend five or six days on the water. They should therefore have at least a little consideration for others, and it is only asked for until the railway is completed. When the people of Western Australia joined the Federation they little thought that they would have worse facilities for getting to the Eastern States, and this clause would certainly give them worse facilities than they ever had before. We ask the Committee to allow the old. system to remain in vogue until the railway,  which has been unanimously agreed to by the House, has been completed. Surely that is not too much to ask, in fairness to the people in the West. There never was a time in the history of this country when there was more need for a quick and good service between the western and eastern States than there is at present. The population of Western Australia has grown enormously, and the business of the State has increased in every direction. Big pub- flic works are under consideration, and there is a large and constant traffic of public officials, business men, and others to and fro between the eastern and western States, The increase in the travelling public is so great, compared with the position of things at the beginning of Federation, that an increase, and not a decrease, of facilities should be talked of. Had not Australia been prospering of recent years, the railway would not have been provided for. Another point I wish to make is that the proposals of the Government place the people of Australia in a worse position than visitors. Those who come to Australia from other parts of the world have the right to break their journey at any port. Arriving by a mail steamer at Fremantle, they can stop off there, go on by another mail steamer to Adelaide, and thus travel by various mail boats from port to port right round to Sydney or Brisbane. Passengers going to Great Britain from Australia would have the same privilege, but we who live here, and have to travel about the coast for business or pleasure, are to be debarred from the opportunity of using the mail boats. This will be a serious matter for many people, and will often create great inconvenience. It will also interfere with a good deal of travelling for pleasure which would not take place if the mail boats were not available. Many Western Australians obtain much pleasure and profit by taking the mail steamers from Fremantle round to Sydney, coming back in the apple season by way of Hobart. On the mail boats this is a luxurious trip, the travelling being under the most comfortable conditions. Why should our people be deprived of this opportunity for getting pleasure and health? The local steamers do not make any trip that compares with that which I have referred to. I have been asked by the Premier of Western Australia, and by the Mayors of Perth, Fremantle, Albany, and other influential and important towns, to support the amendment, which only asks that things may remain as. they are until the Western Australian railway has been finished. It is an aggressive act towards Western Australia to propose to take from her people facilities for travel which they need and enjoy. To deprive them of the travelling conveniences which they could make use of freely before Federation would be a very unfederal thing. Instead of assisting the east to shake hands with the west, and cementing the union, the Government aim at something tending to separation. It must not be forgotten, too, that our oversea mails are carried under contract, made on the assumption that the right to convey passengers from port to port which was then, and is now, possessed by the mail companies, would continue. If that right is taken away from them, they will surely have a claim to compensation. The outgoing steamers which trade between Great Britain and Australia are often crowded with Indian passengers as far as Colombo, but from that port to the final port of destination there is generally plenty of room. The knowledge that on. the Australian coast a certain number of passengers could be picked up to fill the empty cabins must have weighed with the companies in fixing their claims to subsidies. </para>

                        <para>- That is a silly interjection. What preference is it proposed to give to them ? They charge higher rates for their second saloon than the coastal vessels charge for their first saloon. The honorable member forgets that the oversea companies which carry our mails have not the same chance as the local companies of making the Australian public pay for any additional expense to which our laws put them. When we increase the wages of the seamen on the vessels of the Australian registered companies, and require those companies to provide more accommodation, and thus increase their working expenses, they make the Australian public repay the increased cost to which they are put. We are not under any compliment to assist them, because the public pays them for what we require them to do. All their charges fall on the Australian public, because the whole of their trade is done in Australia. The mail steamers are not in the same position. All they could do would be to increase the mail subsidy, and they would have the right to claim more for the carriage of mails if we took from them their right to carry passengers on the coast. But the point which I wish most to make is that we have no right to deprive Western Australia of the travelling facilities which she enjoyed before Federation and is enjoying now.

All we ask. is that the present arrangement shall be allowed to continue until the railway to Western Australia has been built.

                    <para>.- I agree with a good deal of what was said by the honorable member for Hindmarsh about the need for protecting our local shipping. Those who have been in the habit of travelling up and down the coast for years past must be proud of the steamers now in the coastal trade, when they remember the cockleshells that they have replaced. Once we had to use the <inline font-style="italic">Governor Blackall,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Balclutha,</inline> and other small steamers, perhaps not exceeding  300  tons, but now we have large, first-class steamers. We have imposed on the local shipping companies the obligation of paying good wages and providing good accommodation, thus increasing their working, expenses and handicapping them in competition with the oversea companies. But while we must, therefore, protect them, and see that they are not put to a disadvantage, we must not reduce in any way the facilities for travelling on the coast and oversea, nor interfere .with our oversea commerce. At the present time, the farmer has to pay is.  3d.  a bushel to have his wheat .conveyed from Melbourne to London, which is more than  25  per cent, of what he receives for it, and, in the immediate future, he is likely to have to pay more, rather than less, because freights are rising. Shipping people say that this is because they have to pay more for their ships; but, in any case, there is this increase in view, which is a serious thing for our producers. They cannot pass on any extra charges that are put on them. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; we should remember, too, the big tourist traffic that the apple boats going to Hobart in the summer season are building up, which is doing so much for the health of our community, and is so good for commerce. The honorable member for Hindmarsh said that he thought it was the functions which take place in the Old Country about the middle of the year that cause the big rush to Europe in March and April. He must have enjoyed his stay at Home last year much more than I did. The people of the Old Country entertained us magnificently, but anything more dreary than having to turn up at some function at half-past 10 at night, and to stay in a crush until 2 o'clock in the morning, leaving more dead than alive, I cannot imagine. It seems to me that no one would travel half-way round the world for that kind of thing. I would sooner be out with a billy of tea any day. The real" reason why people rush to England in March and April is to enjoy the summer there. For an Australian needing a good rest there is nothing better than a trip to the Old World, but people naturally desire to travel during the most favorable part of the year. They desire to secure the best weather in the Old Country instead of arriving there to suffer the fogs of winter. This, therefore, is responsible for the rush. In dealing with this matter we must be careful that our own shipping is not placed at a disadvantage. Our Inter- State steamers have been, greatly improved of recent years, and our desire is that still further improvements shall take place. At the same time, we are anxious that the shipping of the Commonwealth shall be carried on with reasonable and proper competition. We have no desire that our shipping companies shall be placed at a disadvantage, but we do desire to see proper competition so that shippers of fruit from Tasmania and our producers generally may be able to secure freights at the lowest possible rates. Shall we achieve that object by shutting out the oversea mail steamers from the coasting trade ? I think hot. If we allowed them to participate in that trade without restriction we should make it very difficult for our own shipping companies to carry on - or, at all events, to expand - but we should be able to devise a scheme to overcome the trouble. The mail steam-ship companies have hitherto been very considerate to local shipping. They seem to have recognised that Australian shipping engaged in the coasting trade requires some consideration, and they have always charged higher fares than have been charged on the Inter- State boats. The cost per mile of travelling from Melbourne to Fremantle on a mail steamer is 1.23d. first class and -97d. second class. On the other hand, the cost per mile travelling first class on an Inter-State steamer is i-9d. and second class .82d. It will thus be seen that the passage rates on the mail steamers are considerably in advance of those charged on the Inter- State vessels. Then, again, we desire, I am sure, that our producers shall have the best shipping, facilities that it is possible to afford them, and since local shipping companies have to pay increased wages and observe better conditions than are provided for in the case of others, could we not insert in this measure a clause requiring the oversea mail steamers on which these high wages and improved conditions have not to be observed, to charge higher fares and freights than are levied by local companies? Such a scheme would, I think, enable us to secure the twofold object of protecting our own shipping whilst at the same time allowing shippers ample facilities. It would be very much in the nature of Tariff protection. </para>

We should thus protect our own shipping, while at the same time we should not curtail facilities for oversea trade and commerce. The suggestion I have made is worthy of the consideration of the Minister. The United States of America attempted the class of legislation for which this clause provides with rather disastrous results, and if we follow in its wake we may seriously curtail our shipping facilities, which, after all, are almost the life blood of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to discuss this matter at great length, because it has been debated exhaustively on several occasions in this Parliament. On each occasion, I am very pleased to say, the small modicum of special treatment which the representatives of Western Australia have demanded has been always conceded. I am hopeful that the modest amendment submitted by the right honorable member for Swan will have equally favorable consideration. If it does not, the people of Western Australia will draw a conclusion that will not be favorable to the supporters of the present Government at the next general election. There can be no doubt that the electors of. Western Australia regard this question as one of vital importance, and the granting of the request which we make will be viewed by them as indicating a willingness, on the part of the Federal Parliament, to recognise the special conditions of that State - its isolation and the necessity foi affording it the best possible means of communication with the rest of the Commonwealth. If the facilities afforded by the mail steamers are withdrawn without anything more than a mere pretence at a principle which, after all, is not involved, then I feel sure that a considerable amount of resentment at the action of the Government and its supporters will be felt and expressed in Western Australia. I have yet to learn that any of the Australian shipping companies have made the demand embodied in this measure for the total exclusion of the oversea mail steamers from our passenger trade. I do not think that iri a single instance the request has emanated from the Australian shipping interests. I, therefore, express my surprise that the present Government has seen fit to bring down a proposal to abrogate the consideration that has been extended to Western Australia by all previous Commonwealth Administrations. It is well known that the Inter-State shipping companies are remarkably prosperous. It is well known that they have developed, from the Western Australian trade, a degree of wealth which could hardly have been excelled in the same time in any other part of the world. From very small beginnings some twenty years ago, these Inter- State companies have reached their present prosperous dimensions. They have not had to turn back since they started with the first development of the Western Australian goldfields, and the little passenger trade that has been carried by the mail steamers to Western Australian ports is so insignificant that I do not think that the InterState shipping companies are in the least concerned about it. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports last night gave us some figures showing the increase that has taken place in the passenger trade of the oversea mail steamers between certain Australian ports. There is no doubt that there has been some increase, but the honorable member forgot to tell us of the increase that has also taken place in the passenger trade of the Inter- State steamers. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. Of recent years we have enjoyed in Australia a measure of prosperity that has developed a very great degree of travelling, and not only the railways, but all the shipping companies, have participated in this prosperity by carrying a largely-increased number of passengers. The percentage of passengers carried by the mail steamers is insignificant compared with the passenger traffic of the Inter-State boats. After all, only a certain few, who must of necessity travel by these mail steamers from Western Australia, take advantage of them. The bulk of the passenger traffic is carried by Inter-State boats, and will continue to be as long as the fares of the two services bear the proportion that has existed up to the present time. The people who travel by the mail steamers* are usually those to whom time is of primary consideration. Travelling between Melbourne and Fremantle by the mail steamers, as compared with the Inter-State boats, means a saving of a couple of days, and, accordingly, we find that it is largely the commercial man and the representatives of commercial firms who use the mail steamers, because of the saving of time thus effected. I have used the mail boats myself for the same reason. The Inter-State boats spend, perhaps, a couple of days at Adelaide, half a day at Albany, and then go round to Fremantle, whereas the mail steamers do not call at Albany and spend only a few hours at Adelaide. Another important consideration is that the mail boats travel with almost as much regularity as a mail train, while the Inter-State boats, which carry cargo to be taken on and discharged at the various ports, are not able to keep a time-table with' anything like the same accuracy. Consequently, those to whom time is a valuable consideration, and who do not desire to be detained unexpectedly for a day or two in any port, choose to travel by the mail steamers. These facts are, I think, generally recognised by the Inter-State snipping companies, and, therefore, they make no bones about the little passenger trade carried by the mail boats. I sincerely hope that the Committee will not, without good grounds, do away with the privilege, or right, as I regard it, of the people of Western Australia to the maximum amount of communication with the eastern States by sea. As soon, of course, as the railway is constructed, I admit that the particular conditions on which we base this claim disappear. I should now like to quote an authority, which ought, I think, to have some weight with honorable members opposite. This is not a matter which has interested only the nonLabour section of the Western Australian representation in this Parliament. Up to the present, all the Labour members from Western Australia have taken up the attitude that I now occupy; and I am very much surprised to find a representative of that State, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> giving his consent to a measure of this kind in view of his own utterances in past years. I shall quote from a speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> some of the reasons which he gave, and which still hold good, for the continuance of this privilege to Western Australia. Speaking on 14th April, 1904, on a Navigation Bill that was then before the Senate, he said - </para>

                        <para>- There is no question whatever about that; the shipping companies of Australia have rapidly improved the service, and this is largely due to the development of the Western Australian trade. Still, there are conditions regarding the passenger traffic between Western Australia and the Eastern States which I contend justify us in demanding that the mail steamers shall not be cut out of that trade - conditions which I have already tried to indicate. The honorable member for Fremantle submitted a consideration which has a good deal of weight with .those who have been unfortunate enough to undergo the experience. The Inter-State boats travelling eastward are generally empty, and if any honorable members opposite have had to travel, as I have done, across the Bight in stormy weather, in a bouncing boat with only a few tons of water ballast to prevent if capsizing, I feel sure they would not willingly repeat the experience. Although I am a pretty good sailor I must say such conditions make me very uncomfortable, and, witnessing the misery of many others, I have felt very strongly indeed that we have a right to demand that the maximum amount of comfort shall be at the disposal of Western Australian Inter- State travellers. I hope that the Committee will carefully consider the question before it rejects the amendment of the honorable member for Swan. It is, as I have said, a very modest proposal ; it asks nothing more than that which this Parliament has always conceded to Western Australia up to the present time. In view of the fact that the transcontinental railway will be in active operation within some period of years, and I hope not a great many, we on this side think that the privilege now enjoyed by Western Australia should not be rudely disturbed till then. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to say a few words in support of the amendment and generally in support of the appeal which has been made by the honorable members for Swan, Fremantle, and Perth, as representing the views and interests of the Western Australian people. One can hardly listen to the earnest and reasonable arguments submitted by those three honorable members without being deeply impressed, and, in fact, moved by the appeal on behalf of their State. As already intimated the appeal is not by any means extravagant; on the contrary, it is extremely moderate, and ought to find a sympathetic response from honorable members who are friendly disposed towards Western Australia and Western Australian interests. It is impossible to regard the distance and isolation of the Western Australian people from the seat of Government without recognising the fact that that State has special grounds for the appeal that is now being made. Those special grounds have been recognised ever since the establishment of the Commonwealth, and every effort ought to be made to reconcile the people of Western Australia to the Federal Union. They ought not to be allowed to feel themselves, so to speak, outside the sphere of influence, cut off from all special means of communication which other parts of the Continent enjoy. Perth is even more distant from the Commonwealth seat of Government than is Wellington in New Zealand. No one can contemplate that wild waste of 1,000 miles of sea which divides the seat of government of the Commonwealth from the seat of government of the Western State, without being impressed with the urgent necessity of making as many concessions as possible in favour of maintaining those lines of communication which have been in existence so long. Certainly, we ought not, as a federation, to reduce facilities for communication between western and eastern Australia. We ought at least to maintain, and, if possible, increase them. This amendment does not propose to increase any existing facilities; it merely proposes to sustain them. </para>

The first limitation is that the privilege should be confined to mail steamers only ; the second restricts it to the carrying of passengers ; and the third limits it to the time preceding the construction of the Trans- Australian railway. These limitations certainly ought to free the proposal from the objections urged by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment embodies a proposition so limited that it will not interfere in any way with the substantial protection of the Inter- State shipping trade. The honorable member for Hindmarsh went to the root of the objections to the amendment, when  he  said it was believed that it would sacrifice Australian shipping interests. I fail to see how it will sacrifice them. It is not intended to alter the practice that has obtained for years. It does not take away anything from the Australian shipping interests. It merely aims at maintaining temporarily the privilege of participating in the .coasting trade hitherto enjoyed by the oversea companies, and it is only intended to allow them to exercise the privilege <inline font-style="italic">sub modo,</inline> or, in the case of Western Australia, until the construction of the transcontinental railway. Another objection submitted by the honorable member for Hindmarsh was that the amendment might interfere with the standard of living contemplated by the Act. The mere retention by the oversea .companies or  Tight  to participate in the Inter- State trade will not interfere with the standard of living, or wages imposed by law on Australian shipping. The provisions of the Bill, as they stand, do not amount to an absolute prohibition. The Bill .does not say to the oversea ships, "You shall not be allowed to participate in the coasting trade." It says, " You shall not be allowed to participate unless you comply with certain conditions in regard to wages and accomodation." </para>

                        <para>- But supposing the oversea shipping companies decided to comply with the conditions, they might come in and share, not only in the passenger, but also in the cargo trade. The competition then resulting would be more injurious to the Australian shipping trade than the participation for a limited time contemplated by the amendment. Therefore from the Protectionist stand-point this limited concession is not calculated to injure Australian shipping so much as it would be injured if the oversea ships did comply with the conditions imposed. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, why do the Government reserve to themselves power to declare by order that the carrying of passengers between specified ports in Australia by British ships shall not be deemed to be engaging in the coasting trade? There is in the Bill itself, as framed by the Labour Government, a recognition of the necessity of reserving some power to the Government of the Commonwealth to allow oversea ships to participate in the carrying of passengers along the coast. I drew attention on the second reading to the anomaly of that power. Why should such a power be reserved to the Executive? If it be right to reserve to the Executive power to make an exception, it would be far better to make the exception within the four comers of the Bill. Parliament should define the specific cases in which the carrying of passengers shall not be deemed engaging in the coasting trade. The Bill places too much power in the hands of the Executive. The discretion may be exercised in a manner prejudicial to individual cases. The question ought to be dealt with by legislation, and not by administration. We should know definitely in what cases and under what conditions the oversea ships may be allowed to carry passengers between Australian ports. Why should Parliament abrogate its right to determine that question ? </para>

If they intend to exercise it, we should at least be given some indication of the conditions and circumstances under which it will be done. The amendment of the honorable member for Swan amounts to a declaration that within certain limits oversea mail ships shall be allowed to carry passengers without being deemed to be participating in the coasting trade. It would be best from the Government stand-point, as well as the stand-point of the interests of Western Australia, to put that provision in the Act itself. What benefit will it be to the Australian shipping interests to impose upon oversea ships the necessity of having air space for men's quarters greatly in excess of that required by the Board of Trade? It will impose a very heavy burden oil the oversea ships, which may amount to a prohibition of their participation in the coasting trade, and will not substantially benefit Australian shipping interests. Another condition involved is the paying of higher wages than those specified on the ship's articles, and a third is the position of the space for crews, that many of the recently-built steamers are not fitted to provide. Let me point out the hardships imposed by making those conditions retrospective. Are they to apply all round to Australian ships already constructed and engaged in the trade? Are all those ships which are not able to comply with them right off to be prohibited from engaging in the coasting trade, or are exceptions to be made in their favour? If Australian ships engaged in the coasting trade are to be excepted from the accommodation conditions, is it not reasonable to contend that the oversea mail ships which comply with the Board of Trade conditions should also be excepted? </para>

                        <para>- Under the permit system contemplated by the Bill we may have an uncertainty of decision and practice amounting in many cases to a suspicion of favoritism and discrimination, which ought not to exist in a great system of commerce such as that of the coasting trade of Australia. The House certainly should have some assurance as to the extent to which exemptions are to be made. We should know also whether the demands in the direction of space and accommodation are to apply all round. Are there to be exceptions in the case of Australian ships and none in the case of the ocean liners? With all due regard to the interests of Australian shippers, shipping companies, and sailors, I submit that the mail steamers which are under contract, one line with the Commonwealth and the other with the British Government, for the conveyance of our mails, are entitled to what I may call the "most favoured treatment." In treaties and conventions made with foreign countries, there are often clauses providing that the contracting parties shall allow each other " the most favoured nation" treatment, and I think that the mail steamers, which are under contract with the British Government or with this Government, should be given similar treatment. We should not be too exacting in regard to them. We should not impose conditions not demanded by reason and fair play. </para>

                        <para>- It cannot be denied that Australia benefits considerably by the enterprise of the shipping companies that send vessels here from overseas. The Orient Steam-ship Company and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company have established a magnificent system of communication between Australia and other parts of the world, without which we should be at a great disadvantage. We should encourage them to spend their capital in maintaining and improving this communication and not assume an aggressive or hostile attitude towards them, refusing to make small and temporary concessions. All that the amendment asks for in regard to Western Australia is a concession pending the construction of the transcontinental line. The concession asked for by Tasmania in regard to the tourist traffic during the apple season would be permanent, but the granting of it would not interfere with the Australian shipping companies. </para>

Thousands travel yearly by the big oversea steamers during the apple season, and it is for the Government to show that anything would be gained by preventing them from doing so. Were it not permitted to travel on those steamers, the tourist traffic to Tasmania would be greatly reduced, in all probability, because many persons who now travel would cease from doing so. </para>

                        <para>- The probability is that if the opportunity for making the trip by the big boats were taken away, many persons who now go from the mainland to Tasmania for their holidays would cease to do so, spending their holiday time somewhere else. As I have pointed out, there are three limitations in the amendment : the concession asked for is limited to passenger traffic, excluding goods; it is limited to the big mail liners, and, in the case of Western Australia, it is limited to the time antecedent to the construction of the transcontinental railway. I presume that the. proviso enabling the Governor-General to declare that the carrying of passengers between specified ports shall not be deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade was inserted in the Bill to meet the difficulty which has been referred to in the debate as certain to arise should all coastal passenger traffic by mail steamers be prohibited. If that be so, why not accept the amendment ? By accepting it, the Government would relieve itself of responsibility for an Executive act in making exceptions. I hope that Ministers will favorably consider the strong appeal which has been made on behalf of Tasmania, and the even stronger claim for sympathetic consideration that has been advanced on behalf of Western Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not take exception to the length of this discussion, although I hope that we shall be able to finish to-day the part of the Bill which we have before us. I realize that members of the Opposition have assisted us in the consideration of this measure, but it is not our intention to accept the amendment. The honorable member for Bendigo asks us whether it would not be better to accept it than to act on the proviso that the Governor-General may declare that the carrying of passengers between specified ports in Australia by British ships shall not be deemed to be engaging in the coasting trade. He says that that proviso takes power from Parliament and hands it over to the Government of the day, but every Government must act in conformity with the desires of Parliament or leave office. No doubt occasions will arise when this permit will have to be granted, but it is not contemplated for a moment that it shall be made permanent. </para>

It seems strange that while the ordinary steamers from Sydney cannot carry the tourist traffic to Hobart, they are quite able to convey it back again; because the mail steamers do not return from Hobart to Sydney. </para>

He might well have said that it is intended to grant an exemption so far as Western Australian ports are concerned until the completion of the transcontinental railway. Although he has not said so, I think that the position of Western </para>

                <para class="block">Australia accounts for the insertion of the proviso to which he referred. The Committee generally accepts the coastal provisions of the measure as a whole, indorsing, the principle that if vessels from overseas desire to compete in Australian waters with Australian vessels, they must submit to the same conditions. The amendment does not ask the Committee to depart from that principle. What the honorable member for Swan says is that a sympathetic attitude should be adopted towards Western. Australia because of its peculiar conditions ; and it has been very properly claimed in regard to other parts of the continent that they, too, are entitled to consideration for the same reason. The Bill of  1907  contained this provision - </para>

Whilst allowing that, we must admit that we ought to give the people of Western Australia facilities for travelling by other boats running at different times. The residents of that State may have urgent calls to visit the eastern States of the Commonwealth; family sickness or urgent business may necessitate quick transit, and it seems rather harsh to say that if there is a mail steamer leaving port on a day when no Inter- State steamer is timed to depart they shall not have an opportunity to travel by it. </para>

                        <para>- We know exactly how far this proposal goes. Let me remind the honorable member of a recommendation made by the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill, which inquired very carefully into this question. Some of the members of that Commission had the advantage of travelling to the west by an Inter- State steamer and of returning by a mail boat, and the majority report, signed by the present Attorney-General, Senators Guthrie and de Largie, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> and myself, contained this recommendation - </para>

                        <para>- They said that there should be still further exemptions. As a matter of fact, as the Bill of 1907 shows, the problem of extending exemptions in the case of the northern ports of Western Australia and Queensland, as well as the Northern Territory, came before the Government of the day, and we took a favorable view of the policy of allowing limited exemptions. </para>

                <para>I would remind the honorable member for Hindmarsh that the general tenor of the recommendations made by the Commission was that everything possible was done to improve the conditions of Australian seamen, and to encourage the Australian marine. I think that in this respect we went further than had ever been travelled before in the field of Australian politics. So far as the improvement of the conditions of our seamen are concerned, we went far ahead of the Imperial law, and the Imperial authorities in the Act of 1906 adopted some of the recommendations made by us. Notwithstanding that strong desire on our part to improve Australian conditions, we felt that, having regard to Western Australia's peculiar situation, we ought, if possible, to extend her sympathetic treatment. We felt that on the evidence submitted to us by the people of Western Australia, they were entitled to consideration, and I think we ought to listen to the strong and earnest plea that has been made by the right honorable member for Swan and other representatives of that State. We ought to support this amendment. Western Australia is entitled to as much consideration in this respect as we can give her. Until the trans- Australian railway is completed, she must remain as isolated as if she were an island in the Indian Ocean. We ought to try to make it possible for the people of Western Australia to realize that she is really part and parcel of the Commonwealth. Surely we can be sympathetic in our treatment, especially when we are not asked by this amendment to sacrifice any principle that has been adopted by this Parliament. The proposed exemption cannot injure the Australian shipping companies in any way. The business of the Australian shipping companies has been increasing by leaps and bounds, and we hope that they will continue to prosper. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill will undoubtedly encourage them, because it imposes conditions with respect to all that substantial trade between Australian ports, save in the case of the mail steamers travelling between the eastern States and Western Australia. There is a suggestion that this special treatment should also be extended to Tasmania, but at present I am speaking only of the position of Western Australia. As a matter of fact, the granting of the claim made by Western Australia will expose our Inter-State shipping companies to the competition of the mail steamers in the carrying of passengers between Adelaide and Perth for only three or four years. All other vessels will be debarred from entering that area of competition unless they conform to Australian conditions. I certainly support those conditions, and hope that the time will come when Australia will have its oversea, as well as its Inter-State, shipping. The only way in which we can ever hope to induce Australians to go to sea is by enforcing such conditions as will make sea life attractive to them. By granting the request of the representatives of Western Australia in this regard, we shall not violate any of the fundamental principles of the Bill. Whilst sympathizing with those fundamental principles to which we all subscribe, we say that we should extend to the people of Western Australia such sympathy and encouragement as will enable that State to participate to the full in the advantages and prosperity of the Australian Union. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that we can extend some consideration to Western Australia in this regard, and also some consideration to our oft-vaunted ambition for a wider union of the Australasian people. We hear a great deal from the Prime Minister, when he is posing under the limelight as a statesman, about the necessity of bringing New Zealand and the Commonwealth more closely together; but here we have a Bill which, by one stroke of the pen, so to speak, will drive the people of the two Dominions further apart than they have ever been. We are also driving the people of Western Australia further away from the Federal Union than they were before the Union took place. Why did the people of Western Australia come within the Federation? Was it not because they recognised that we had a common end in view, and that we ought to try to draw closer together in defence of that common end? Now that we have been brought closely together, the Government are doing that which we declared it would be necessary not to do. Is it not a fact that under this Bill we are giving Western Australia a worse communication with the eastern parts of the Commonwealth than she had before she entered the Union? Is it not a fact that when she entered the Federation her people had open to them every steam-ship line trading round the Australian coast to enable them to meet' their cousins in the east? The Government, however, are now proposing to take from them that privilege. We have not yet given them railway communication with the east, and the Government are proposing to prevent them using any other, service than that of the Shipping Ring, which they have always loudly denounced on the public platform, and have occasionally helped in the High Court. I ask honorable members to remember that this will be only another link in the chain of circumstance which they are forging against themselves. </para>

                        <para>-  It has nothing to do with coloured labour. The point is that the Shipping Ring" says that it is very unfair that oversea shipping companies should carry passengers between Australian ports, at very much higher rates than they charge. It is a scandalous thing, they say, that the oversea companies . should be so considerate to them, and give such good service that the travelling public of Australia, in order to travel on their steamers, are prepared to pay a great deal more than they would have to pay to travel by one of the vessels of the Shipping Ring. Behind the ring most conveniently stands the whole cohort of my honorable friends opposite, who say, " We shall see that all competition, with this beneficent institution is done away with." </para>

They are referring to some outside ring that has no vote or influence in Australia ! </para>

                        <para>- The sugar industry is not a combine at all, but one large company with a few small competitors. Our friends opposite stampeded about the country denouncing trusts and combines, and appealing for greater powers to deal with them, and yet they have all the powers that are necessary in order to deal with the Shipping Combine. But the way the Government propose to deal with it is to give it, at the expense of the public, something which it does not require, and for which the public will have to pay. Is there not some extraordinary inconsistency here? Or does it simply mean that honorable members opposite are sincere in their general attitude, but that the Tobacco Trust and the Shipping Combine are on sacred ground ? </para>

It often happens that, when a wife and family are going from Australia on a trip, the husband will accompany them round the coast as far as Adelaide or Fremantle; but the moment this Bill becomes law that will become impossible. </para>

                        <para>-  Such a salary would not satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> now. I mention these facts merely to show that one's views of what constitutes a fair thing vary enormously. I submit that some exception ought to be made in the case of persons travelling in the mail boats with relatives under such circumstances as I have indicated. I should also like to see an exception made in the interests of persons who are travelling solely for health or pleasure. The " apple trips," for instance, are of great importance to Tasmania, especially to Hobart, and they mean a certain amount of revenue to the Victorian railways. Many persons use these trips who otherwise would not go to Tasmania, and some of them return by rail from Melbourne to Sydney. </para>

                        <para>-  I do not suggest that the people come from Tasmania to Melbourne by rail ! All the people who take part in these trips spend money both in Tasmania and in Melbourne, and their expenditure means a great deal in a small place like Hobart. If the present facilities were not afforded, these people, as I say,, would not travel at all. </para>

                        <para>- I hope they will in some way or other. But where there are large monetary interests involved, it is better that such matters should be settled by Act of Parliament than provided for by regulation. Nothing I say has reference  to  the present Government ; but there is always the possibility, if we get into the habit  of  dealing with these matters by the mere mandate of one man, of the financial interests exercising a pressure which is certainly against the public interests, should it ever be brought into the sphere of administrative work. </para>

                        <para>- I thought the Labour party were that gentleman's warmest supporters. I know, at any rate, that they kept him and his Government in power for many years. Honorable members will see, therefore, the necessity of putting everything in the Statute, where we are dealing with large financial interests, and placing as little as possible within the discretion and under the sole dictation of a Minister. I can give an instance that happened in this very Parliament. I can remember when we passed an item in the Tariff putting a duty of 25 per cent, on  supercalendered paper. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> approached the Minister, and the Minister deemed that super-calendered paper to be newspaper and admitted it free, although it was specially mentioned in the Tariff, and the revenue was robbed to that extent. We are asked to allow the Minister to say what trade shipping companies shall be allowed to do along the Australian coast, and for how long they shall be permitted to do it. Is it fair to place any Minister in that position? Is it not better to place the whole thing in the Statute and let us know what we are doing? Let us keep clear of the mere suggestion that such things are possible. If a Minister, in the exercise of his duty, feels that he must grant an exemption, why should we make it possible for anybody to think, or even hint, that he has been moved by some powerful interest? If the honorable member for Denison wants the apple trade to be exempt, I claim his vote for a straight-out honest exemption in the Bill itself. If that is not what he 'wants, let him say so, and let the people of Hobart understand that their member thinks that the large tourist traffic, that has done so much for Hobart in the past, and will do a great deal more for it in the future if given a reasonable chance of growing, is of little importance. </para>

                        <para>- It is subsidizing black labour for a man to pay more than he would have to pay on an Inter-State ship, in order to travel on a Peninsular and Oriental liner, but when the leader of the whole party goes to South Africa and employs black labour for the private profit of a number of honorable gentleman in this Parliament, it is a very noble and useful avocation for a Labour leader ! If the Government do not want to " subsidize black labour," let them specifically exempt ships travelling round the coast of Australia and employing only white labour. Will honorable members opposite allow the Orient Company to carry passengers on the apple trip and to Western Australia? </para>

                    <para>.- This is a proposition that cai ls for the exercise of " sweet reasonableness " on the part of the Legislature. There is .a danger, in attempting to do what some of my honorable friends desire to do, of going a little too far, so that the balance of disadvantage may be rather against the people of this country. When the Australian States united there was a general impression that union- would be for the advancement of the people generally, and make for the extension, rather than the removal or denial, of facilities. That, at any rate, was the feeling we had in the West when we responded to the invitation of the other States to join the Federation. It appears now that, in addition to the natural disabilities which the people of the western State have to contend with, they are to be denied the privilege of travelling by the best and readiest means from one side of the Commonwealth to the other. I may recall a not uncommon case, so that my honorable friends may understand the position. The incident to which I refer may be repeated at any time if we restrict facilities for travelling. A gold-field's resident received a telegram that his wife, then in one of the eastern States, lay dangerously ill. He left the gold-fields in time to catch the Inter-State steamer advertised to leave Fremantle on the Saturday; but, to meet the convenience of the shippers of cargo, or for some other reason, the company declined to send their ship out of the harbour on that day, and he was left kicking his heels in Fremantle, until the Monday or Tuesday. </para>

                <para>Is this Committee going to put in the Bill a provision which will prevent a man in Western Australia, who may have urgent family or business reasons for travelling to this side, from catching a steamer for a week? Is he to wait in Fremantle and see an ocean-going liner go out, and be denied the opportunity of returning to his wife and family, or to his business? If we had the alternative of a railway, such as the other States have, a clause of this kind would be defensible ; but, in the circumstances, seeing that we are absolutely dependent on the ocean for means of access to the eastern States, it would be an &gt;insupportable hardship if it were made "law and strictly enforced. </para>
                <para>I believe the Minister of Trade and Customs intends to give the Governor-General power under the Act to make exemptions of certain ports. Let me point out to him and the Government, that that is a much more dangerous provision from his point of view than would be the excision of the word passenger " from the clause. What I propose is that the word " passenger " be omitted, and that only steamers carrying cargo should come under the section relating to the coasting trade. A general power of exemption vested in the Government of the day may be all right while the present Government are in power, but it is quite possible that if another Government came into office, a good many exemptions would be made that my honorable friends on this side would condemn very strongly. It is safer to put in the Statute what we mean to do, than to leave it to any future Government to exempt any and all ports. That consideration is worthy of being thought over. </para>
                <para>I suppose we cannot expect the representatives of the cities and thickly settled portions of the east to feel all the disabilities that the people of pioneering communities undergo, but the prosperity of the cities and settled communities generally depends a good deal upon the development of the at present unsettled portions of Australia. I therefore appeal to honorable members who represent large city and suburban constituencies, to have a little consideration for the pioneering population in the out-of-the-way places of Australia. These have many things to contend with, about which others in the more settled portions know little, and this Parliament should be the last to withdraw or restrict any of the privileges of travel which they now enjoy. Honorable members who support the clause appear to forget that, although by excluding oversea shipping companies from the coasting trade we shall penalize them, we shall penalize our own people still more. Those who live in the outlying districts of Western Australia, and wish to travel from the north-west coast to Fremantle, and thence to the eastern States, will be sorely aggrieved by the operation of the measure as it stands. </para>
                <para>Why should we prevent the mail steamers from carrying passengers? Are the Australian shipping companies bo hard pressed by the competition of the oversea companies that they need this protection? On the contrary, will any one say that they are not in the most prosperous condition? The other day shares in Huddart Parker and Company were offered to the public, and were subscribed for several times over. That indicates that the company is doing remarkably well, and other local shipping companies are doing still better. Their profits enable them to pay the ample wages that Australian seamen demand, and the carrying of  passengers by the mail steamers will not in any way prevent them from continuing to pay these wages, or from providing the conditions which we have prescribed for the advantage of the seamen. If it were not so, I should not support the amendment. As it is, I fail to see why a man desiring to travel to the eastern States should have to dawdle around a seaport waiting for an Inter-State steamer when a mail steamer was on the point of departure. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but I am confining my remarks to the conditions of that part of Australia with which I am most familiar. I suggest that if the Government cannot accept the amendment, it should consent to strike out the word " passenger," so that the exclusion from the coasting trade may apply only to the carrying of cargo. While in this matter we are not so much bound to consider the interests and convenience of those who travel merely for pleasure, for whom the honorable member for Wentworth spoke, we should study the requirements and needs of those who travel from business or domestic necessity. Disabilities should not be imposed on them needlessly. Instead of limiting the facilities for travelling between ,the eastern and western ports of Australia, we should do all we can to improve and increase them. </para>

                    <para>. - The arguments used against the proposals of the Government and in favour of the amendment ignore fundamental principles embodied in the Bill ai\d in the fiscal policy of the country. The question we have to answer is, shall the Australian coasting trade be conserved to our own people, and built up? It may be said that it does not need building up, and does not deserve protection, the acts of the local shipping companies being such that they ought to be repressed rather than encouraged. Statements have been made in support of those views. The honorable member for Franklin complained that it is impossible for Tasmanian exporters of fruit to use any steamers but those of the Inter-State Steam-ship Owners Association, whose charges are excessive. The High Court, after a lengthy and exhaustive inquiry, declared that it is not a fact that there are no other steamers available, but personally I am inclined to think that what the honorable member for </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Franklin said is true. I have been surprised during the debate to see certain honorable members blow hot and cold. While they usually adopt, a certain attitude towards the fiscal problem now presented, in this instance they take quite another one. I decline to believe that the Shipping Combine, <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> is worse than any other, and, as it is the settled policy of the country to encourage native industries, the shipping industry ought not to be singled out and penalized for the specious and unsatisfactory reasons put forward. </para>
                <para>The right honorable member for Swan contrived to introduce into this purely fiscal and economic discussion some totally irrelevant references to patriotism and Imperialism, alleging curiously enough, that those who voted against the amendment would thereby declare themselves to be disloyal. It is sufficient, by way of answer, to point out that the right honorable member asks for a concession for the vessels of the Nord Deutscher Lloyd, the Messageries Maritimes, and every other foreign company doing business on our coasts. The vessels of nations whose very existence is a menace to Great Britain, and who, while we speak, may be perfecting plans for bringing about her downfall, would, under the proposal of this patriotic and Imperialistic gentleman, obtain privileges assisting them to destroy the shipping of Australia. A more miserable attempt to drag a sacred principle into the mire I never heard of. </para>
                <para>The principle of the Bill, which is supported by the party to which I belong, is that the coasting trade of Australia should be kept for Australians. As the Royal Commission on Navigation declared some years ago, this is a principle which has been adopted by many foreign countries - Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Guatemala, Italy, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela are mentioned. I have here the American law relating to domestic commerce. By it the vessels of foreign nations are prohibited in set terms from engaging in the coasting trade of the United States, and it has been held that a vessel voyaging from a port on the east coast of the United States right round Cape Horn to a port on the west coast, thus circumnavigating nearly a fifth of the inhabitable surface of the globe, is engaged in the coasting trade. That trade is confined to vessels registered and licensed by the United States, and flying the flag of that country. </para>

                        <para>- American foreign shipping has diminished almost to a negligible quantity, but American coasting shipping is in a satisfactory state. I challenge honorable members to show why the policy of protection should be applied to our other industries and not to the shipping industry. It cannot be said in regard to the protection of some of these industries that the convenience of the public has been studied. I should like to hear the honorable member for Parramatta on the subject. He would say that it has not been consulted in any instance. </para>

                        <para>- I consulted the interests of the country in every tariff vote that I gave, my votes illustrating the admirable discrimination which I trust will always characterize them. I voted for the proposals which were proper, and against those which were improper. It is not proposed under this Bill to follow the example of America, and to discriminate between shipping and shipping. It is not proposed to give to local shipping, as the fiscal policy of this country does to other local industries, any advantage over foreign shipping. All shipping is to be placed on the same level. There is a sensible and very real distinction to be drawn between the two proposals. In the one case we had the right honorable member for Swan, whose patriotism was so visible last evening, and whose inconsistency was not less so, cheerfully voting, when the Tariff was before us, to penalise Great Britain to the extent of 20, 25, and in some cases 30 per cent., and giving her the puny advantage of 5 per cent, over Germany and other countries. If that is Imperialism - if that is the way to help Great Britain - God forbid that she should have many helpers of the kind. What we are proposing to do is not to assist her in that way, but to place her ship-owners in the same position that Australian ship-owners occupy. As long as her ships observe the same conditions they will enjoy the same privileges as are extended to Australian ships. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that point. Subject to the Constitution, we may impose upon the local ship-owner what onerous conditions we please. We may say to him, " You must employ on your vessels so many men, and pay such-and-such a rate of wages." When that rate of wages runs from five times down to twice as much as the rates paid on British and foreign ships, the competition of those ships must be unfair. The Anti-Trust Act was aimed at unfair competition; but I am not going to say one word about the local combine. I believe that it is very well able to look after itself, and that, having regard to recent events, it has a great deal for which to be thankful. Whilst I say this, I am not blind to the fact that the shipping industry is the most important in Australia. I do not even except the wool industry. </para>

It is proposed to place the local ship-owner in exactly the same position as the other man. I come now to the point referred to by the right honorable member for Swan. First of all, I wish to say straight out that I quite agree with the principle which he, supported by the honorable member for Coolgardie, enunciated - that the convenience of the people in this wide-flung continent of ours ought to be regarded, and that we must pay regard to it. The question is, how, bearing in mind the principle of which I have spoken - the preservation and encouragement of our native shipping - this can best be done. The right honorable member proposes to secure it by means of the following addition to the clause: - </para>

                <para class="block">First of all I doubt whether that provision is. constitutional. The right honorable member may refer the matter to the honorable member for Angas. But I say again that I doubt very much whether the amendment is constitutional, although in the present state of the law and the decisions under it, I am bound to say that I am just as likely to be wrong as is the honorable member for Angas.  1  doubt whether the amendment is constitutional.

                <para>The practical object at which we are all aiming is the perfect convenience of the public. The right honorable member proposes in his amendment to set forth in so many words the limits of the exemption. Whatever might be desired in the way of exemption could not go outside his proviso. The objections to his amendment are obvious. First, it goes too far, and second, it does not go far enough. It is suggested by the honorable member for Coolgardie that the word " passengers " should be omitted, so that the carriage of cargo would alone constitute engaging in the coasting trade. I do not think that is fair. Vessels in order to pay must cater for both passenger and cargo traffic. How are you to build up a fleet of steamers that can compare with the ocean-going steamers in the convenience and comfort they offer the public, if you are not able to compete for the most remunerative side of the trade on fair terms? You cannot expect people to invest money in an unprofitable enterprise, and honorable members may be reminded that the basis of this enterprise, after .all, is that of pounds, shillings and pence. It is not contended by the Opposition that this clause will prohibit oversea steamers from carrying passengers and cargo. It is merely suggested that it will make it unprofitable for them to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I have been engaged for some time in an effort to prove to the satisfaction of the highest tribunal in this country that the position is as the honorable member says, but I have lamentably failed. I feel a little disheartened in the matter, and his voice seems like an echo  from the grave. So far as I am concerned, I do not think there is anything in it. If there is a Shipping Combine here, there is certainly a combine elsewhere, and it is a very powerful one. The British Shipping Ring is the most powerful combine in the world. We had an example of its power some little time ago. Ships cannot be obtained, even now, to bring immigrants to this country, except upon the terms that the ring like to dictate. We hope to have power to legislate in regard to local combines. We can do nothing at all in regard to foreign combines. The inference seems obvious. To exclude the carrying of passengers from this provision, and to make the carrying of cargo only the condition that will bring vessels under the coasting-trade provisions of the Bill, would not be fair to the local shipping companies. They ought to be allowed to carry both passengers and cargo. Some of their vessels are a magnificent tribute to their enterprise. I know that there is a prejudice in the minds of some people against everything local, and that their professions and practices in regard to the protection of local industries and everything that is Australian differ very vitally. I think the convenience of the people ought to be consulted. Their convenience ought to be the first consideration. But it is proposed by the Government, in this Bill, to consult the convenience of every person in the country by giving the Governor-General power, by order, to exempt from this provision vessels plying between specified ports. In so doing, power is taken to deal with each particular case on its merits. I submit that that is an elastic provision, capable of almost indefinite expansion and application. It will cover all those cases which the right honorable member has put forward, and all those indicated to-day, as well as during the discussion of other amendments. Anything more than that ought not to be agreed to by the Committee. We propose to confine the coasting trade to Australian shipping, or to shipping that complies with the conditions to which Australian shipping, has to conform. We propose to place Australian shipping, British shipping, and foreign shipping on the same level. This is the fundamental and equitable principle underlying our proposition. Further, we propose to give the Governor-General power to exempt vessels plying between specified ports from these provisions where the occasion seems to justify it. I do not deny that there are many occasions when it ought to be done, but to specify them would be unwise and) inadvisable. It is impossible to cover all, and it might be thought that . to specify some would be to exclude others. I hope the amendment will not pass. </para>

                    <para>. - As we are all anxious to proceed to a division before the train hour arrives, I propose to make only a few remarks regarding the drafting of the amendment submitted by the right honorable member for Swan. I regard it as being, on several grounds, much better than the proviso in clause  286.  I do not think that we ought to vest this power in the Executive, and leave them open to be importuned by bodies outside. I very much doubt whether the Government can issue this proclamation. As the Attorney-General has raised the question of the constitutionality of the amendment, I may point out that section  99  of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce - and we are proposing to base this Bill on the commerce power - give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. As a matter of fact, this power in the American Constitution refers to preference to one port over another, as did the first draft in the case of our own Constitution, but the intention is the same. The construction is that we cannot, by any law of commerce, give preference to one port over another, and, if that be so, a proclamation in reference to ports of different States, or even to ports in a State, will be open to challenge, and, perhaps, successfully. The amendment of the honorable member for Swan is framed in general terms, arid, though I do not say that it is not open to some extent to the objection I urge against the proclamation, it comes nearer to fulfilling the conditions laid down by the High Court in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's case some years ago. I would sooner rely, as a matter of law, on the amendment of the honorable member for Swan than on the proposal of the Attorney-General, which, I think, is open to challenge on the ground of differentiation. May not the whole of this part of the Bill be open to challenge? Section  92  of the Constitution says that, after the passing of uniform duties, trade and commerce between the States shall be absolutely free. In an American case many years ago, it was held that this meant trade free from artificial or political obstacles ; and it may be that, if we, by our laws, restrict the intercourse by restricting transit, the whole of those coastal clauses may be open to challenge. However, I do not offer more than a suggestion on the point. On both sides there is a legitimate desire to protect our local industries. I do not use the word "protect" in the fiscal sense, but in the sense of protecting the higher conditions of social life which are our common aim, however different our methods may be. That being so, it may be that, in preventing unfair competition, we may give larger profits to the capitalists, but in doing so we are enabling the " wage fund " - if I may use a cant term - to be enlarged. If this be a matter of substance, why have we not statistics before us to show the true position? We have no figures showing the volume ot cargo affected; and the amendment of the honorable member for Swan does not appear to touch the question of cargo. </para>

                        <para>-  Would the Minister say that it is the passenger traffic that gives the larger volume of profit to the InterState boat? I confess that I cannot find out whether that be so or not ; but, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn's figures, the largest profits are from cargo. When I was discussing whether our navigation powers extend to the fixing of wages, there was an expression of opinion from honorable members opposite that they did not, but, at the same time, we are fixing wages by this Bill. If we can do that successfully by law, it practically means that we may impose the conditions of the Arbitration Court upon Intra- State vessels. Any vessel trading in a gulf of South Australia, crossing from Port Adelaide, will have to be managed by men and officers paid, by virtue of this Bill, the wages prescribed by the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but whether we can regulate wages may be a matter of doubt. If we can, we are giving a very large concession, because it practically means, applying the conditions to every vessel plying. With that tremendous concession, why should we object to allow ocean steamers, whose conditions are prescribed by the great-venture voyage, and not by the local voyage, to carry passengers ? The concession proposed is a temporary one, and people will resent this legislation if it be found that they are not permitted to board an ocean steamer at Fremantle at any price. </para>

                        <para>- We know that many of the schedules of the Bill have been framed in conjunction with various bodies outside; indeed, the manning and engineers'  scale  was very largely suggested in this way. If a time should come when there is an increasing passenger traffic, the first thing will be pressure from, it may be, a capitalistic body; and why should we throw on the Executive such temptations to go askew? As to the question of subsidies generally, the chief authority is the Subsidies Commission of 1902, and, though that Commission did recommend some limitation of the coastal trade, they never recommended that it should be on compliance with local conditions. What they said was that the occasion had come when the question of the qualified reservation of the British Imperial coasting trade should be considered by the Government, with a view to reserving the British and Colonial coastwise trade, and the Imperial coastal trade within the British Empire to British and Colonial ships, and to vessels of those nations which threw open their coast trade to British ships. There was no talk about local conditions ; all that was asked for was reciprocity. I should be sorry to depend our case on what occurs in America, the policy of which, I think, no country in the world approves. As to the necessity of this class of protection, I am pleased to find that the supremacy of the British shipping does' not depend on such things; it can weather the gale of commercial storms without resorting to protection of any sort. This Commission, which was, as a whole,, in favour of some limitation, says - </para>

                    <para>.- On general principles we should hesitate to limit transit between the States, particularly in regard to individuals. The Attorney-General has said that the question is whether we should do anything or nothing in regard to conserving our coastal trade to Australian shipping companies; but I should say that the question is. rather - whether we should do more than is necessary. I am in accord with those who desire to conserve the cargo trade for Australian boats, and, of course, as far as possible, the passenger trade; but it seems to me that with a coastline such as ours, we should give every facility for personal transit between the States I can imagine some of my honorable friends being left on the Fremantle pier for a day or two because they were not permitted to travel by -i mail boat. This is the sort of legislation which brings us into disrepute. It seems to me that the amendment is a very reasonable one, simply proposing that, until all the States are connected by railway, Australians shall have facilities to travel on the mail steamers. These liners do not travel every day, but it does occur that the individual may wish to travel on  those  steamers. I am told that the Attorney-General is providing for permits to be granted to certain companies, and that these may be given to the very companies covered by the amendment. If that be so, there could be no harm in accepting the amendment, and we, as a House of Parliament, would then know what we were doing, and not be condemning our fellow citizens to great inconvenience, simply in order to carry a principle to an absurdity. If it were vital to the interests of the shipping companies that all should travel by them, I might understand the attitude adopted; but it seems to me that we are doing ourselves great inconvenience and injustice. I intend to support the amendment. The exemption, 'so far as Western Australia is concerned, was once recommended by my honorable friend himself, amongst others. </para>

He has brought to bear upon this question that common sense which has been sadly lacking in this debate, and which would have assisted this measure to be more popular than it otherwise can be if it is pushed through with all these restrictive provisions in it. I have listened to the Attorney-General many a time with greater pleasure than to-day. He does not talk the new language well yet. It is a new <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> for him to begin to play, when he has to talk of the necessity for protecting our industries. He has not learned the language well, but he is getting on, and will do better by-and-by. He is trying to side track this question altogether when he attempts to ma"ke it a fiscal matter. It is no such thing, as he himself proceeded to demonstrate in his very next sentence. He said, " All we propose to do here is to put them all on the same footing." Is that fiscal protection? </para>

                        <para>- No doubt we are all in it to some extent. The Attorney-General just now, in a wonderfully self-revealing sentence let the whole cat out of the bag. He showed us how hollow were all their protestations against the shipping combines and other trust-like institutions. He said that these coastal shipping combines had not been to the Opposition at all. He said, " They do not go to the right honorable member, they come to me." He has been fighting the trusts in the Law Courts for some weeks past, anathematizing them in every possible way, declaring that they must be dealt with, and thinking hard every moment of his life how best to deal with them; but it seems that they come to him on the quiet and pour all their complaints into his ear. I congratulate him on his confidential relationships with the trusts, which he affects to be so anxious to destroy. It is really most touching, and I am glad to have this official statement from this . powerful member of the Government that when the trusts outside have any difficulties they pour them into his ear and not into ours. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member began his speech by saying that we did not know where we were. I am sure I do not since hearing the honorable member. I am beginning to wonder what the new economics are, and what the propaganda is to be in the near future. Ful.minations come from the honorable gentleman on the platform against these predatory trusts that are raising prices and eating up the substance of the people. At the same time, he is making every effort to tighten the cordon round them, to protect them from outsiders, to build up their monopoly, and make it more complete and perfect than ever. I do not understand these ethics, and do not profess to know how the Labour party reconcile their varying attitudes. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member says we are emphasizing in this legislation the principle of confining our coasting trade to our own ships. He says they do this in America. The destroyer of the trusts takes us off to America, the home of the trusts, and tells us how they build up their trusts there. He wants to do the same thing in Australia. I decline to go to America to learn how they do these things, because America has sheltered and cultivated these combinations until to-day they are bringing serious damage to the great Republic over the sea. </para>

                        <para>- Is that why the honorable member put his signature to it after considering the matter for six or seven years? What we have to determine is whether Western Australia shall be deliberately cut off from the rest of the continent to a greater extent than she is by the reduction of the facilities for travelling to and between the western and eastern States. This is not merely a question of principle ; mere neighbourly concern should prompt us to make such prudential arrangements as will remove as much as possible the difficulties under which those living in the west now labour. </para>

                    <para>The business for next week will be the Navigation Bill, which we hope to complete before the end of the week. For the information of honorable members, and of the public generally, I wish to make it known that the Maternity Allowance Act was proclaimed yesterday, and that the allowance will be paid to applicants in all cases where they are entitled to the allowance under the Act, in connexion with births on that day' and thereafter. It has been impossible to get the machinery for paying the grants ready, but accrued rights will be recognised, and payments made on the  1st  November next. The necessary forms and all information will be available at the public offices as soon as possible. While the delay in paying may inconvenience some a little, we thought it best to bring the measure into operation as soon as we could. We look to the future to prove the benefits of this measure, which was passed by a larger majority than most people expected. </para>

                        <para>.- Certain good people in Australia have recently been advancing the theory that the millennium is approaching, while others have been asserting that this is a played out belief. I am coming to the conclusion that there is a good deal of evidence in support of it, more especially in view of that brought forward by my friend the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> told us last week that the sensation of the week was the fact that the Leader of the Opposition had given the Maternity Allowance Bill his blessing, on the motion for the third reading, whereas he had previously given it  his curse. We now find members of the Opposition so anxious that the Bill shall be brought into operation at once, that they are asking where they can obtain forms.

                            contends that the Maternity Allowance will not reduce the independence of the people. In this assumption he flies in the face of - history. How can self-reliance and independence of spirit - virtues which lie at the root of all national greatness - be inspired by a policy which scatters half-a-million without any proved necessity, on the plea of relieving distress which does not exist.
