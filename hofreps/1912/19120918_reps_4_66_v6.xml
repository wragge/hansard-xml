                            <para>.- I make no apology for having taken this course, because it is the only one which enables an honorable member to bring forward matters of public importance; and that to which I wish to direct attention is of the greatest importance. All will admit that we have in Australia the right material for the making of an ideal army. There are not many nations whose youth would show so much keenness and intelligence in training themselves for the defence of their country as ours have shown. There are not many nations whose youth would be ready to drill at night in the light of a miserable lamp, a non-commissioned officer following at their heels with a lantern in order that the commanding officer might see whether they are or are not in step. But, in spite of their keenness and intelligence, our compulsory scheme of training is becoming more and more hopeless. I cannot imagine any body of legislators framing laws compelling boys to register and to attend drills without making compliance with these laws compulsory. </para>

                                <para>- The Prime Minister did not make any apology for taking from private members the time allowed for the discussion of their business. At the beginning, there were very few absentees from cadet drills ; and, had an example been made of those absentees, the present state of affairs would not exist. But there was a laxity displayed by the Department which, to say the least of it, was very culpable.&#39; </para>

                                <para>- No doubt.. The Government was afraid of losing the votes of the parents of these youths, with the result that it has come to be generally understood that a cadet&#39;s attendance at parade is practically voluntary. When the parents of one boy saw that another boy absented himself from parades and received no punishment, they naturally asked why their own boys should attend. Things went from bad to worse, until at last there were 20,000 defaulters. This disclosed a very serious state of affairs, as such a number of defaulters means that the scheme is breaking down. Instead of these first defaulters being punished, they were threatened by the Area Officer, for instance, that if they were not efficient for the year, it would be entered against them in their books, and they would have to complete another year&#39;s service after the age of twenty-six. Imagine the effect of a threat of that kind upon a boy of fourteen. When I was fourteen, I looked upon the age of twenty-six as something in the far distant future. </para>

                                <para>- As a matter of fact, this was under the regulations. Under the Act, the boys who are defaulters are to be handed over to the custody of a military officer. This means that a boy is supposed to report himself to a military officer to carry out the drills that he has missed. In some training centres, three defaulters may turn up to do four hours&#39; drill. No instructor can drill three boys for four hours. The sergeant-major, who is the instructor, has his clerical work to do in his office, and the result is that he sets the boys to clean out the office, or to clean rifles, or something of that sort, to put in their four hours. This does not make for efficiency. In many training centres, there is perhaps only half a company of boys, and in that there might be only one defaulter. That boy has to undergo four hours&#39; drill. The non-commissioned officer is supposed to go to the training centre - and it might take him two days to get there - in order to drill one boy for four hours. The thing is absolutely preposterous. </para>

                        <para>The summons should be served by a member of the Battalion or Area Staff, thereby affording such member a better opportunity of getting into touch with the Cadets on his strength as well as to save, in most cases, a sum equal to the cost of the summons, which is generally charged if an officer of the Court serves same. </para>
                        <para class="block">This means that the unfortunate noncommissioned officer, who is the drill instructor in the area, is supposed to deliver the summonses himself. Let me point out what this means to him. I have taken one country area, and the summonses which were actually issued in it, as an example. With this as a basis, I propose to show the distance that the sergeant-major would have to walk to deliver them. The distance from a training centre is a limit of  5  miles, and we may take it that the boys who made default would most likely be those living furthest away. There were four training centres in this one country area, and if the sergeant-major had to serve the summonses from those centres to the residences of the cadets who actually had summonses served on them, he would have had to travel from No. 1 centre, 13 miles ; from No. 2 centre,. 8 miles; from No. 3 centre, 18 miles ; and1 from No. 4 centre, 27 miles. That make* a total of  66  miles which he would have had to walk ; and, at the same time, carryout the many duties he has to perform. The non-commissioned officers are overworked as it is, many of them now having to perform the work of two men each. Imagine one of them having to walk  66  miles to serve these summonses. </para>

That is the only way in which he can serve the summonses. A very important order has been issued in connexion with musketry. It is absolutely incomprehensible to me that such an order should have &#34; emanated from the military authorities. I do not say that the Minister of Defence is personally to blame, though he is nominally responsible. He must, of course, rely upon his professional advisers, who are supposed to understand their business. </para>

                                <para>- I think they do not. At all events, whoever was responsible for the promulgation of this order did not understand his business. The difficulty is to find out w&#34;ho is responsible. I take this particular order out of a number which I consider to be wrong. It must be recollected that these cadets were served with rifles only in November last. There was a month&#39;s interval from drill during the Christmas holidays. Of course, musketry is absolutely the most important part of a soldier&#39;s training. Even amongst adults a great deal of time is needed for musketry training. Before a man can be called a trained soldier, and can be regarded as proficient in the use of the rifle - that is to say, in its use under all the conditions which may pertain in war - he has to go through a protracted course of training. First of all, the recruits&#39; course takes from six weeks to three months of continuous, training in the use of the rifle. After the recruit is to that extent qualified, he has to go through the trained soldiers&#39; course, which will take probably six months of continuous training. So much training is necessary before a soldier is permitted to engage in field practice. But, in connexion with these cadets, an order was issued which required them to engage in battalion competitions with the rifle before they were anything like proficient in its use. There is no getting away from the meaning of the order, which was distinct and definite, and was promulgated from Head-quarters, Sydney to the District Commandants, and from them to the Brigade Majors and Area Officers. In one paragraph, the order says - </para>

I have already pointed out that the rifles were only issued in November, and these competitions were supposed to take place in April. The boys had not gone through a course of musketry. Many of them hardly knew what a rifle was. They did not know what the trigger was for, or how to hold the weapon. If I had had a boy in the cadets, I should have absolutely refused to allow him to take part in any competition under such conditions. </para>

                                <para>- I certainly would not allow a boy of mine to risk his life in this way ; because it would absolutely be a risk of life for boys who had had only a few hours! drill with the rifle to engage in field  practice with ball cartridge. The thing is absolutely ridiculous, and any one who knows anything about military matters will recognise at once that it is so. I do not know what the results would have been if the order had been carried out. Probably, there would have been loss of life. But the order was absolutely ignored by the Brigade Majors and Area Officers engaged in carrying out the compulsory training system. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know who should be sacked, but something will have to be done, or the scheme of training will absolutely break down. Things are becoming more hopeless every day. What I have said is known to be absolutely correct by all military men, and especially by the instructors engaged in carrying &#39;out the scheme. The reason why the order was not carried out is that the officers realized that it would mean disaster to attempt it. Imagine boys of fourteen years of age, who had had only a few hours&#39; experience of the rifle, engaging in field practice with ball cartridge ! The Department evidently did not realize that a mistake had been made; in spite of the fact that at a school held in July, in Victoria Barracks, Sydney, including all the Area Officers and all the Instructional Staff in New South Wales, a Conference was held, and a resolution passed dealing with this very question. The Minister took absolutely no cognisance of the resolution. To show that there was no recognition of any blunder having been perpetrated, I propose to quote from the report by the Minister of Defence on the progress of universal training for the year ended 30th June, 191 2. In paragraph 52 we have the statement - </para>

There were no teams from the areas. The officers dared not carry out the orders given. This state of affairs is subversive to all discipline. Is it not absurd that printed orders issued from headquarters should be absolutely ignored? Such, however, is the fact. To show that the Minister did not realize that any mistake had been made, and that he took no notice of the representations made by officers possessing expert and local knowledge, I am quoting this paragraph, which continues -  but this can perhaps be accounted for by the fact that many of the officers and instructors considered that their companies had not attained a sufficient degree of efficiency to enable them to compete with any likelihood of success. </para>

                                <para>- The officers are told that if they do not send along teams in future an official entry will be made against their records. I should like now to refer to a question affecting the pay branch of the Department. Area Officers and members of the Instructional Staff are subjected to very great annoyance and inconvenience and, in many cases, to great loss, in connexion with this branch of the service. Let me explain the system adopted in financing areas. In connexion with each area there is what is known as a contingent fund, made up of ,&#163;15 granted for each training centre in the area, and is. per head for every cadet within that area. Out of that contingent fund disbursements have to be made by the Area Officer for rent of office, storerooms, and drill halls, purchase of stamps and stationery, for the payment of markers where there is a local range, and for train faxes to convey lads to ranges when there is no local range available. Under the universal training regulations, each Area Officer is supposed to receive a sum of ^10 to meet disbursements, and when he has expended that amount, he is required to forward vouchers and receipts to the Department, which will then&#34; make him a. further instalment. The unfortunate Area Officer, however, has to wait three months, in some cases, for his money. This first instalment of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> is not given to him at the beginning of the financial year. Sometimes weeks, and even months, elapse before he obtains it, and by that time he has spent, perhaps, from  ^10  to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;20.</inline> He sends in his vouchers, and is then kept out of his money from seven weeks to three months. I know of instances where an Area Officer has been out of pocket for the time being to the extent of  ^40  or  ,&#163;50.  The money, of course, is eventually refunded, but owing to departmental red-tape this delay takes place, and great annoyance and inconvenience is caused. Some of the officers have private means, and can afford to wait for the money, but all cannot do so. This delay in making payment has the effect of causing increased rates to be charged for drill halls, store-rooms, and so forth. Tradespeople, for instance, who conduct a cash business do not care to wait three months for their money, and, as a result of the system, the Department has to incur additional expense. The matter requires very serious consideration. The Area Officers cannot afford to wait for their money, and members of the Instructional Staff are in an even worse position. The sergeant-majors, when travelling, have to provide for their own board and lodging, and have then to send in to the Department what is known as a &#34; route &#34; showing what they have expended, so that they may be reimbursed. They are supposed to get the money so expended returned to them- </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for North Sydney has justified his action in moving the adjournment of the House on the ground that the compulsory defence system is so lax that the lads neglect to drill, and that this neglect is due to the attitude of the authorities. It appears to me that the real object which the honorable member had in view in bringing forward this motion was to give publicity to some imaginary grievances on the part of the officers themselves relative to our military system. Having regard to the fact that the compulsory training system has just come into operation, we need to be very careful and guarded in our actions. There is at the present time a good deal of aversion to the system, and the present smouldering fire may easily be fanned into a flame. Once public dissatisfaction with the system is aroused, we may be sure that within a very short time the whole system will disappear. The people are masters of the situation, and they are not going to agree to any system that is not conducted on satisfactory lines. The question is whether the Government have been honestly endeavouring to carry out this system in a satisfactory manner. </para>

                                <para>- It is raised. If the honorable member had been present, he would have heard it brought forward. The Government &#34; have endeavoured during the last few months to meet the position with which they are confronted, and the honorable member who submitted this motion complains very strongly that the failure of the Government to prosecute the cadets - that is the main point of his indictment - has led to laxity in the matter of drill. In my opinion, the Government did everything in their power to meet the position as it presented itself to them and to the public. No one could have initiated any prosecution before such a time had elapsed as would enable the Department to ascertain exactly what number had not complied with the statutory requirements. Taking into consideration the fact that the scheme is in its infancy, we should extend as much consideration as we can, realizing that a scheme&#39; of such magnitude cannot be put into operation in six months, and every one expected to comply. To my mind, the compliance with which the Act has been met is marvellous. Honorable members, in urging that the laxity is due to an absence of a more rigid observance of the Act, lose sight of the fact that there is another side to the question. We have to give some attention to the convenience of the lads and their parents in the fixing of the drills. I do not wish to say a word against the officers, but it must, not be forgotten that, very often, drills are fixed at times which are not suitable for those engaged in industrial callings, and the lads have to decide whether they will lose a day&#39;s work or strictly comply with the Act. Very often, both parents and boys may come to the conclusion that it is not fair that a day&#39;s work should be lost. In my own district, the absence of half-a-dozen wheelers practically lays a mine idle on a </para>

                        <para class="block">Saturday. Under such circumstances, do honorable members contend that the officers should have power to strictly enforce the law ? If the House once takes up that position, we may say good-bye to compulsory training - its death-knell will be struck. The officers should make it their business to get into touch with the lads and their parents, and consider their convenience as much as possible by fixing the drills in such a way as to cause the minimum interference with employment. Unless this is done, we must expect more dissatisfaction. In my own district, I hear complaints every day, and some of these I have voiced here as occasion permits. In the mines there, the work is divided into two shifts, and the drills are fixed for the Saturday, generally when the boys have to go to work in the afternoon. It will be readily understood that a mine manager,&#39; in the absence of a number of wheelers, both under and over eighteen years of age, may practically have to lay the mine .idle, while some of the boys may lose as much as 9s. for the day. It is the duty of the &#34;officers to ascertain the local conditions, and consider these in fixing the drills ; but, up to the present, that has not been done, and I see no justification for blaming the Government. It speaks much for the administration of the Act that it has been possible to bring it into operation with so little friction up to the present. The honorable member who preceded me contended that the sergeant-major should not be compelled to deliver summonses personally. I do not know whether the sergeant-major should be compelled to do so or not, but the system initiated by the officers, before central control was exercised, was very unsatisfactory, and, in New South Wales, cadets were dragged up before the Courts even after an order had been given by the Minister that there were to be no further prosecutions. The officers themselves are endeavouring to too rigidly apply the Act. I realize, of course, that there must be discipline, but .we ought to be very careful how we proceed. We cannot expect all at once to instil into the mind of the young, especially, the necessity of complying with every comma in the law ; this can only be done in course of time, when I have no doubt that with wise administration we shall get the people of Australia to cheerfully adopt the system. The lads who expressed strong objection to compulsory training are gradually disappearing ; but, if there be attempts made here to have the Act more rigidly administered, and motions moved with the object of taking the control from the Minister and giving it to the officers themselves, it will prove bad for the system. It appears to me that the complaints emanate from the military authorities, or some of them. Who is responsible for recommending the regulations ? lt must be the head of the Military Forces ; but if the system is to live, we shall have to be careful to endeavour to meet the convenience of those concerned. In the case of the Citizen Forces, there is not that necessity for rigid discipline that there is in the case of a standing army; and, while there must be discipline, we ought to display a little humanity. If we do so, it is probable that, in the space of a year or so, the system will become so popular that there will be no difficulty, and the rising youth of Australia will look forward to the opportunity and privilege of drilling for the purpose of becoming efficient to defend their country if necessary. If, however, we begin at the present juncture to find fault, and endeavour to make it appear that there is great laxity, we cannot have satisfactory results. As to the 20,000 defaulters, these were only for certain drills which the lads were unable to undergo j and that diminishes very considerably the significance that might be attached to that large number. Very few of the young fellows neglected to attend drills generally, but only certain drills ; and the question they had to decide was whether, in order to attend, they should neglect their occupation, and possibly throw hundreds of men out of employment. In a new system, we can make some allowance for the youth in such a position, who feels that it is preferable to go to work and keep the wheels of industry moving, believing that he is committing no great crime. Now, however, that it is known that all must comply, I believe that there will be no further trouble ; but the officers should understand that they should fix the drills at convenient times, so as to interfere as little as possible with the ordinary employment of the lads. </para>

                            <para>.- One would imagine, to listen to the honorable member for Hunter, that the honorable member who moved the adjournment of the House had urged on the Government the more rigid enforcement of the Defence Act. It is amazing to any one who heard the honorable member for North Sydney that any such deduction can be drawn from his  speech. It would be still more amazing, if we did not know better the histrionic powers of some honorable members, to see the extraordinary earnestness with which the honorable member for Hunter sought to break down and repudiate a position which the honorable member for North Sydney never set up. As a matter of strict fact the honorable member set out to show that Departmental methods within the areas are faulty, and I think he proved his case. The honorable member for Hunter told us that we must have some discipline. What sort of discipline are we likely to have in future if the sergeant-major is to personally serve summonses upon every person who should be served with a summons in the whole of the military area in which he is employed ? The whole system, under such conditions, will be farcical, and must break down. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for North Sydney drew attention to another matter which is of the greatest public importance. It is of more importance to the cadets themselves than to honorable members who may be seeking to secure support in connexion with matters of this kind at the next general election. The honorable member for North Sydney clearly showed that in the present stage of cadet musketry the proposals with regard to firing practice are not safe. It is not from any lack of a desire on the part of members of rifle clubs to co-operate in the training of cadets in musketry that this unfortunate state of affairs exists. Over a year ago the Department was approached by the rifle clubs of Australia, the members of which were all anxious to co-operate, and their co operation would be invaluable in the country districts for the training of the cadets,, many of whom are the sons of riflemen and&#39; marksmen of the different rifle clubs. Speaking from memory, I believe that their desire to co-operate with the Department was, in the first place, fostered by the Department, but as soon as the members of the clubs decided to carry out the work in the country districts their proposal was relegated to the pigeon-holes., and has since been lost sight of.  </para>

                                <para>- A complaint in this regard was made to me about two months ago, and I understand that the difficulty has all occurred within the last eighteen months. This matter of the training of our cadets to shoot is one of very great importance, and it should be dealt with in a business-like way. We cannot frame ideal regulations for cadets who are marksmen, and expect them to be carried out by cadets who do not know how to handle a rifle. That is all the honorable member for North Syd-&#39; ney contended, and he is deserving of the thanks of the House for bringing this matter under the notice of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>Another matter to which the honorable member referred was the extraordinary length of time it takes to provide Area Officers with the money necessary to meet their obligations within their areas. It must be within the knowledge of many honorable members that the statements of the honorable member for North Sydney in this connexion are absolutely accurate. In these days, when a number of the members of this House are constantly advocating extensions of Government enterprise, it is a curious reflection that we should find so many signs of the incompetence of Government methods to deal with the simplest business transaction. Here we have the simple matter of paying over money on the receipt of vouchers, and it cannot be done on the nail. What ordinary business firm could expect to carry on its business for a week under such procrastinating methods? What chance would we have to run a great industry, if, before we began the payment of accounts on receipt of vouchers, we allowed them to be three months overdue? Some of our honorable friends are now proposing that the State should do everything. They suggest the nationalization of most complicated&#39; industries; and really the matter opens a vista  of opportunities for sarcasm which I do not propose to follow at* this moment Here we have the simplest operation which it is possible for a clerk to perform, the mere payment of money already in the till to some one entitled to it on the production of vouchers; and, although the vouchers are produced, the money is not forthcoming for three or four months, or until some sleepy Department has made up its mind to do what its duty required it to do months before. This practice of defaulting, on the part of the Defence Department, will, if persisted in, lead to the unpopularity of the cadet movement throughout the Commonwealth. It does not make the movement popular with tradesmen, or with those who are responsible for its efficiency in their respective areas, that the Government should not meet their obligations as they become due, and that Area Officers should be exposed to the badgering which the present system exposes them to, and possibly to loss which occasionally results from it. I think that the honorable member for North Sydney has performed a public duty in bringing these matters so prominently before the attention of the House and the Minister representing the Minister of Defence. </para>

                            <para>. - If there are no other complaints to be made, I propose to offer a few remarks in reply to honorable members who have uttered what, according to them, are complaints against the administration of the Defence Department. I particularly regret the remarks of the honorable member for Wentworth, because they constitute a charge of incompetence against practically the whole of the officers of the Military Forces, and the administrative staff in particular. As a matter of fact, some of the remarks of the honorable member for North Sydney constitute an attack upon the ability and military knowledge of officers whose duty it is to advise the Minister of Defence in many particulars. </para>

In the circumstances, I might almost leave my reply at that, as the honorable member for North Sydney will understand that he has been complaining because some trifling mistakes have been made by some exceptionally good men. As, during the honorable member&#39;s excellent military career, he no doubt made a mistake now and again, he might now see his way to withdraw his remarks, and agree that these trifling mistakes by exceptionally good men may be overlooked. </para>

                                <para>- I am accepting the utterance of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, who, as an ex-Minister of Defence, is almost as well up in these matters as is the honorable member himself. Seeing that the honorable member for Parramatta had much to do with the passing of the Defence Act of 1909, and that he even put his signature to some of the regulations which are still in force, it is to be presumed that he knows almost as much about them as does the honorable member for&#39; North Sydney. Honorable <inline font-style="italic">members</inline> will, I am sure, recognise that there are such persons as barrack-room lawyers, just as there are fo&#39;cas&#39;le lawyers, and I suppose that there was never a junior officer either in the Military or Naval Forces who did not think that he knew more than his seniors. Similarly, there never was a citizen who, having passed through either arm of the defence service, and subsequently entered Parliament, did not consider that he knew more than did all the officers who had adopted the military or naval profession as their life&#39;s calling. </para>

                                <para>- I include myself. There may be times when I may think that I know more about these matters than do the senior officers who have devoted practically the whole of their lives to matters military. But during the period that - as the result of the good-will of my colleagues - I have represented the Minister of Defence in this Chamber, it will be conceded to my credit, I think, that as far as possible I have refrained from touching military matters. Prior to assuming my present position, my own military efforts were chiefly under active service conditions, and I am not ashamed of the fact. May I take it that the honorable member for North Sydney spoke for the Opposition when he complained of the administration of the Defence Department in matters military ? </para>

But if he spoke merely for himself, and if the utterance of the honorable member for Wentworth is to be regarded in a similar light, the position, of course, assumes an entirely different character. </para>

                                <para>- So far as his remarks in regard to Area Officers receiving payment for petty expenses are concerned, it has to be remembered that the compulsory training scheme is an entirely new one, that the Area Officers are new to their duties, and that many of them are so unfamiliar with administrative work as to occasionally make more than ordinary mistakes. I suppose the honorable member will be surprised to learn that some of them have yet scarcely a grip of how to make out a return of the expenses which they have incurred. If a claim be wrongly made out by one of them, it is scarcely to be supposed that the paying officers, regardless of the consequences, will immediately liquidate it. It must be recollected that we are dealing with public moneys. If the Department were a private institution, the person who was running it would be at liberty to do just as he chose. But public moneys have to be dealt with either in accordance with regulations which have received the indorsement of the Legislature or in .accordance with an&#39; Act of Parliament. However, every effort is being made to put the scheme into operation with the least possible friction, and to educate the different officers in the work which they have to perform, so that in the early future it may run with that smoothness which is essential to perfect success. I do not suggest that mistakes are not being made in many directions. I do not wish it to be understood that the Minister of Defence considers that the scheme is running perfectly, or that anomalies will not require to be removed, or that regulations, nay, even the Act itself, will not need to be amended as the result of more experience. But when we consider that during the last year or so a change has been made from the old system, which, in spite of the laudable enthusiasm of some  20,000  or  25,000  of our citizens who had enrolled themselves as volunteers, was quite inadequate for the defence of this country, to a system which is not only infinitely larger, but the principle of which is entirely new to Australian thought, I venture to suggest that it is being put into operation with comparatively little trouble and with little cause for complaint. </para>

                                <para>- I am not objecting to criticism except so far as the honorable member for North Sydney failed to make himself acquainted with certain conditions with which he could have become familiar had he chosen to visit the Defence Department, or to ask for information in this House. I hope that honorable members do not regard my observations as indicative of any objection on the part of the Government to criticism. On the contrary, the Government court the fullest possible criticism, and will be glad indeed of every possible assistance in order to enable them to put this non-party scheme into practical effect for the welfare of our country. I do suggest, however, that more responsibility attaches to the criticism of a member of this Parliament than attaches to that of other citizens, and particularly does this remark apply to the criticism of the honorable member for North Sydney, who has had many years of excellent experience in connexion with military matters. I am sure he will recognise - as I facetiously remarked at the outset - that there are persons holding junior positions in the Defence Forces of this country who invariably believe that they know more than do their seniors, and it is just possible .that whilst we are passing through a period of transition in connexion with our defence scheme, criticisms such as those to which the hon.orable member gave utterance, if indulged in too publicly, may prove more harmful than helpful. I need scarcely add that it is criticism of a helpful character for which the Government will feel grateful. The honorable member referred to military order No. 497, which he said had been disregarded by the officers who had to put it into effect. He thus inferentially accused them of having been guilty of disobedience- </para>

                                <para>- Before the date on which it would have been put1 into operation, in accordance with the general conditions pertaining to field firing practice. The honorable member might have ascertained that fact for himself. Had he chosen to visit the Defence Department for half-an-hour, or to ask a question in this House, the whole thing might have been settled. In the circumstances there would have been no charge against officers for disobedience, nor would there have been criticism of a severe character of the officers who promulgated the order to which, according to the honorable member, effect could not be given. Notwithstanding his reference to boys of fourteen, and others, who had only a few hours&#39; knowledge of the rifle, careful perusal of the order would have shown him that the teams which were to compete were to be teams of picked lads who had not missed. drills, who had been passed as efficient, and who, in the opinion of the officers immediately responsible - not those at head-quarters - were competent to engage in the tests. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, but they are tried under circumstances and conditions which, as far as is humanly possible, prevent anything in the nature of an accident. Therefore, in my opinion, the honorable member&#39;s criticism falls to the ground. The order was suspended, but even had it not been, the competition would have been between picked teams, and the officer against whom the honorable member made a charge in regrettable terms is not responsible. According to the honorable member, certain non-commissioned officers, in serving summonses for staying away from drill, must travel over 60 miles, and he spoke of them as &#34;padding it&#34; on foot, or words to that effect. The distance travelled is not important if sufficient time is given for the journey ; moreover, travelling expenses are paid, and where that is necessary, horses and buggies may be hired. The honorable member could have known that had he cared to make inquiry.  His  statement about &#34; padding the hoof &#34; and &#34; Irish tandems,&#34; though calculated to tickle the ears of the unsuspecting electors, were not based on facts. </para>

                            <para>. - The Honorary Minister usually makes a very clever reply, which has nothing whatever to do with the facts. One can never pin him down to the facts under the consideration of the Chamber. </para>

                                <para>- I shall give an illustration in support of my statement. It has been said that non-commissioned officers walk 60 miles in the delivery of summonses. The astute Minister replies that travelling expenses are allowed. But the honorable member for North Sydney says they are not allowed to non-commissioned officers ; it is to the Area Officers that they are allowed ; so that the statement of the Minister is a total misrepresentation of the facts. </para>

                                <para>- The reply to that statement is that officers who do the travelling do not get the allowances. I hope that the Honorary Minister will tell these men that there is a lot of money owing to them by the Department which they may get on application. We have it on his authority that these men have for months been kept out of money to which they are entitled, and the sooner they send in their claims for it the better. That is the statement which the Honorary Minister has practically made to the House. One of the amusing things in the debate was the attitude of the honorable member for Hunter, whose speech practically amounted to this : &#34; You fellows on the Opposition side must not complain about the Department. You are all wrong when you criticise it. Leave it to me to sail into the Minister.&#34; He deprecated all that the honorable member for North Sydney had said, seeing all sorts of sinister motives in his action, and then made an attack on the Department of a quite different kind, warning the Ministry what it must and what it must not do When the honorable member for North Sydney makes a suggestion, it is, according to the honorable member for Hunter, quite wrong. With him everything seems to depend on the side on which a member sits. The honorable member for Hunter must be reminded that he does not possess a monopoly of the right of criticism. He professes himself to be the opponent of monopolies, and while voluble in his complaints against the Government from day to day, I hope that he will not believe that he has a monopoly of the right to criticise, but will allow the honorable member for North Sydney to make a complaint now and again. That is only elementary fairness. He must not impute sinister motives to those on this side who bring facts before the Minister concerning the administration of a very important piece of legislation. The Honorary Minister has told us that a good deal of the trouble has arisen from the fact that many of the Area Officers scarcely know how to make out a return. </para>

                                <para>- I hope, sir, that you will call the Honorary Minister to order a little later when a similar incident occurs. It is his custom to sit there and say that no statement made from this side is correct. We shall see how the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report reads. We are all unfortunate over here, because we all understood the Minister to say the same thing. If there is any difficulty in making out a simple return of that kind, it is a sorry commentary on the Area Officers. If after fifteen months&#39; occupancy of their position, they do not know how to make out a simple elementary return of expenses, it is a very striking reflection on them. I should like to ask the honorable member for Hunter if it is an unjustifiable complaint to make against the Government that these cadet officers after fifteen months have still no uniforms ? If the honorable member knows anything at all about the matter, he knows that nothing is more subversive of discipline and authority than that a man should not have the requisite uniform when dealing with lads who- have uniforms. One of the first things that should be done by the Department is to see that these officers are properly clothed when they are in positions of authority. It all comes back to this - and this is the moral I want to point - that the Government are not officering these areas in the way they ought to be officered. It is an old complaint of mine, and the results are being seen every day. The very man who should be the king-pin of the whole system is being treated in the way alleged. He has to foot it round delivering summonses to boys who do not go on parade. We are told he has to walk 60 miles in delivering batches of summonses. Is that what he is supposed to do ? He cannot train the army if he is doing that kind of thing. He is, or was intended to be, the man responsible for the efficiency of his area, but, of course, he is not so today, and the Government cannot hold him strictly responsible. It would not be right for them to do it while imposing these conditions upon him. They could not expect him to do it all in three days of his time,  and pay him a sweating wage of &#163;150 a year. That is the secret of all this trouble. These complaints will multiply as time goes on until a remedy is found for staffing the areas by men who can give the whole of their time to their work, and who will be paid adequately for the work they do, and the ability they place at the disposal of the Department. </para>

                (Ballarat &#91;3.55&#93;.- This short and relatively simple measure has reached a point at which we ought to deal with it in a simple and direct fashion. After listening to the statement made by the Minister in charge of it, and the debate since, it appears evident that the passing of the Bill at this time is not justified even by the Minister himself. As he looks rather surprised, let me refer him at once to the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                report of his speech, at page 31 13 of this session. There he mentions the Prime Minister&#39;s suggestion that a reforming policy on a considerable scale would probably be best dealt with in the next session. Then, after an interjection, the Minister himself said, &#34;I am prepared to consider it &#34; - meaning the policy involved in such a radical Bill - &#34; at any time, because my desire is that the workers shall be safeguarded in this industry, as well as in every other.&#34;
            </para>
            <para>The Minister himself, then professes himself prepared to deal decisively with this question ; but his Bill is not a proposal to deal with it effectively at the present time. It is merely a postponement, an extemporized means of dealing with it for a short time, until another and more searching measure is introduced, probably largely based on the findings of the Sugar Commission. In the circumstances, this Ministerial proposal is not only reduced to the slenderest proportions and intended to be extremely short-lived, but is open, as the debate has shown, to sundry very serious objections. In point of fact, the Bill is hard to defend, either as a practical measure, or on the ground of its legal validity. If it be challenged in the Courts, as rumour indicates, it will mean simply another considerable outlay of money and a long postponement. Why, then, does not the Minister take the action now which he foresees that he will, be called upon to take before long ? No doubt the receipt of the report of the Sugar Commission may qualify him better for coping with it more explicitly in some directions; but, at the same time, the proposition which appears to find more favour with the Minister himself, and, probably, with his colleagues, would give this Bill another character - enabling both the bounty and Excise to disappear. This we cannot do in Committee. That would leave us simply with a Protectionist duty on the sugar industry. All questions relating to the sufficiency or excess of that impost would, of necessity, be exhaustively considered in connexion with the report of the Sugar Commission, now resuming its work. </para>
            <para>By this means we should avoid the continuance of what honorable members representing the sugar districts evidently consider a serious practical injustice. Indeed, I think the figures, not challenged, quoted by the honorable member for Richmond, speak for themselves. They will come with a shock of surprise to the general public. These show that, since the initiation of this policy, the Excise levied by the Government amounts to . &#163;5,879,000, while the bounty which has been paid, or as some say, returned to the growers amounts only to &#163;3,778,000. Plainly then, the bounty and Excise system, which was intended to serve the double purpose of maintaining the sugar industry, and maintaining it by white labour only, has so far failed, that the growers of cane, who are practically employing white labour only, have been mulcted in the sum of over &#163;2,000,000. Of course, it will be pointed out that there is an import duty of &#163;6 per ton ; and that they pass it on by increasing the price of their product. Still, these figures, if they mean anything, imply that although we have achieved one of our objects, we have so far failed in the other branch of our endeavour. That is to say. we have succeeded in securing to white labour the employment given in this industry, and practically in extinguishing coloured labour ; but we have not assisted the growers who have been employing white labour to the extent that they deserve, nor have we developed the sugar industry to the anticipated proportions which would allow it in most seasons, if not in all, to supply the wants of Australia. To-day we have an opportunity of dealing with this problem in a simple, direct and practical fashion, by relieving the growers of the . undue burden of which they complain, contenting ourselves with the operation of the Customs duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;fi</inline> per ton. Of course, we first rely upon the undertaking which has been given by the Premier of Queensland, that if this measure be put aside, he is prepared to introduce legislation into the Queensland Parliament securing adequate rates of payment to all white labour engaged in the industry, providing tribunals to which workmen could appeal as to wages and hours, and taking the further step of excluding coloured labour altogether from employment. If those three conditions are fulfilled, it would be hard to say what else we have to ask or could hope to receive. The Minister looks forward with considerable confidence to the operation of this Bill until next year. But why wait for next year, when the proposals which are to be submitted by the Queensland Government can be legalized this year, so that we can put a stop to this levy upon the growers of the very considerable difference between the bounty paid to them and the Excise which they are called upon to pay? That is the whole situation. </para>

Of course, I am speaking after the event, and in the light of what we all know; but looking back upon what occurred, an error of judgment appears to me to have been committed no more and no less.

                <para>Personally, and without trespassing on subjects which are not before us, I believe that this Parliament will not cease the pursuit of knowledge in the sugar industry until it is completely satisfied, and has probed its operations to the bottom, and in every direction. Let no mistake be made. Concealment in this matter must be rendered impossible. This is a question into which the Government of this country is fully entitled to inquire, and to push an inquiry to its extreme. The sooner that task is completed the better for every one interested. It is undesirable to discuss a case which is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and therefore I make no comment affecting the merits. The members of the governing body of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company may be, for all I know, angelic personages absolutely above reproach. I know nothing for or against them, and assume nothing. But the honorable member for Capricornia is in error if he thinks that I would lift a finger to prevent a full investigation of the whole of the circumstances involved in this case. </para>

                <para>I do not desire to prolong this debate, but do ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether it is not desirable that he should reconsider this question with his colleagues. I believe that there would be a unanimous response in this House if the Minister proposed to take advantage of the offer of the Queensland Government, so as to insure the maintenance of white labour and white labour conditions, and the creation of Arbitration tribunals to which all disputes relating to the sugar industry in Queensland could be promptly referred. The acceptance of that offer would meet the present situation much better than this proposal of the Minister&#39;s, which has already been pronounced by pretty high authority to be unwarrantable and unconstitutional. It may possibly be challenged in the Courts, and, if challenged, may involve us in another legal tangle in which we have no desire to be engaged, however much it may profit the legal profession. </para>

                        <para>- They are entitled to challenge anything which they believe to be unconstitutional. That is the reason why I urge that the matter should be dealt with in a form of which the constitutionality would be unchallengeable. Here we have a means of settling disputes which are only expected to last a year or so. Oh the other hand, we have the means offered by the Queensland Government which should be permanent and unchallengeable at law. Their Act can be brought into operation at once, so that we may have the sugar-growers relieved, at least a year earlier than the Minister promises, of the Excise they are called upon to pay in excess of the bounty they receive. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary, the proposal of the Queensland Premier is to create Arbitration Courts, to which there is to be an appeal on those very questions of wages and hours for the workers. Before those Courts, these questions can be settled in the light of experience already acquired. It is claimed that experience shows that the present wages are insufficient ; and they certainly appear to be open to challenge. The promise is that the Courts will be established in the State where the industry is conducted, where all the circumstances are known, and investigated far more successfully on the spot than by tribunals afar. Hence, it seems that it would be a reasonable and a nationally profitable thing to put aside this measure in its present shape for the time, so as to allow both the Excise and bounty to go. On the State legislation, to which reference has been made, being passed by the Queensland Parliament, before our present session closes, surely the Minister would have every guarantee for the policy he desires to see introduced free from the risks, vexations, and possible legal costs involved in this proposal. New South Wales would follow suit. There is a good deal more to be said in regard to this matter, but I have no desire to detain honorable members. To bring the matter to a point, and in order that this suggestion may be discussed, I move - \ </para>

                    <para>.- I have just been looking through the debates on this subject which took place in the House in 1902 and 1903, and I find that the question of whether the bounty and the Excise should be retained was then discussed. I have always taken the stand that if we abolish the Excise and bounty we must take care that the public are not too much burdened by the rate of the import duty. I am therefore pleased that the honorable&#39; member for Ballarat has mentioned that the amendment which he has submitted is to be incidental to the consideration of what ought to be the import rate, in the light of the information supplied to us by the Commission. I do not wish to say that the present protection goes to the grower or the miller, because we are at present somewhat in the dark as to who gets the bulk of the money that the sugar consumers of Australia and the Treasurer are giving to some persons connected with the industry. </para>

                        <para>- The fact remains that we have no imports of beet sugar. The duty of <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;io</inline> per ton must absolutely exclude its importation, &#34;except at times of famine affecting the production of cane throughout the world, and we have not yet been faced with such a situation. We seem to be somewhat in the position of the man described by Locke in <inline font-style="italic">The Human Understanding,</inline> inasmuch as we are differing not so much about facts as regarding statements that we do not apprehend alike. The import duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;,6</inline> a ton is that&#39; which concerns the consumer, but the question of whether the producer or the miller, pays the Excise rate is a matter that concerns themselves. It does not concern the public very much, save that the people like that class which does the work to share the benefit of that which we give up. If there is a combine or a monopoly in a particular industry which results in very huge profits, it is much more satisfactory to us in our legislation, whatever may be our view regarding these duties, that the grower or the men connected with the primary production should get the benefit of that which we are surrendering. I suppose that the Royal Commission was appointed for some purpose, and the members of that Commission may understand the bearing of the figures ; but I am rather- puzzled by the conflicting statements made on both sides of the House.&#39; It was asserted in  1905  that one company was making  10  per cent, before  1 901,  and that its profits &#34;in  1905,  under the operation of these duties, amounted to something like  70  per cent. I hope that the Commission will inquire into these matters, and I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it should be the aim of both parties to see that the Commission is armed with whatever power is necessary to enable it to deal expeditiously with the  questions that have been submitted to it. On the whole, it seems to be a rather precipitate act to challenge the validity of a measure which has yet scarcely had an opportunity to be put into operation, and the validity of which may not be questioned at all if the proceedings under it are temperately conducted. We know, of course, that there is always a chance of the validity of an Act which imposes a penalty being challenged, but one does not usually look for such difficulties until they arise in the ordinary course of administration. If we are going to abolish the Excise and the bounty, we ought, perhaps, to provide that they shall cease on and after such-and-such a date. That is usually the way in which we deal with an alteration in the Tariff. Meantime, why should not the Premier of Queensland bring in his Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- They have been talking for some years of protecting the men engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland. About twelve months ago it was pointed out in the Conciliation- and Arbitration Court that, in some cases, there was absolutely no protection for the worker. It was said that on one side of a roadway in a town in North Queensland the wages of a particular class of operators were  7s.  or  8s.  per day ; while men doing the same kind of work on the other side of the road were receiving  10s.  or ns. per day. One set&#39; of men was under a Wages Board, the other was not. I believe that an Act has been passed by the Queensland Parliament dealing with the establishment of Wages Boards in connexion with the sugar industry. </para>

                        <para>- That renders possible what I would suggest. If we adopt the policy of ultimately abolishing the Excise and the bounty, and allowing an import duty to remain - that was the policy adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, and it is referred to in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell&#39;s</inline> report - it will be possible for us to carry it out if the Queensland Government pass with expedition an Act providing for fair rates of wages in the industry. That, however, does not close the question. I am pleased, therefore, that the Leader of the Opposition has said that, when we get the full facts, we should take care to see that the rate imposed is one that is justified by all the conditions, one condition being the fair position of the consumer. In fruit production, the price of sugar is a very important element. It was pointed out a few years ago that the duty of <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;6</inline> per ton meant something like 130 per cent, off the value of the plum crops. That is to say, the men who had to pay the duty paid 128 or 130 per cent, less for the crop than they would otherwise have done. On some crops it represents something like 70 per cent., and so on; and no doubt it is a very large addition to the cost of production in manufactures, such as those carried on by confectioners and brewers. It has been stated that the addition is something like 40 per cent, in connexion with the sweetened milk industry, and, therefore, we ought to take these matters into consideration when we have the interests of the people at heart. Sugar has been regarded, I think, by the Labour party as one of the necessaries bf life on which import duties ought to rest rather lightly. That used to be part of the policy of the South Australian Labour party. </para>

                        <para>- Of course - that is very considerate; the Minister would put a tax on a man who does not exist. There is nothing in abolishing a duty that is inoperative. A duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> a ton is a very heavy pressure on the consumer. If it is proposed, within a reasonable time, to establish a Wages Board in Queensland, there is scope for the adoption of the policy recommended by the honorable member for Ballarat; but, in the general policy, there are considerations which we must not overlook. We have to consider, for instance, what is the external price of sugar. I do not know what the price is at present in the world&#39;s market. </para>

                        <para>- It is rather unsettled, because there was a dearth of sugar in the last two years or so, and that led to a request that Russia might be relieved from the obligation of the Sugar Convention and allowed to export some of its surplus. The conditions of 1901 will, I believe, be brought about again shortly, owing to the Sugar Convention having been abandoned by some of the principal countries ; and, if that is so, we should have cheap sugar again, as we had ten or twelve years ago. We ought to know what is the external price, and what it is likely to be for the next twelve months, and also what is the internal price, so that we can see to what extent our policy may be leading to a higher rate for local sugar than is justified by the world&#39;s market. What the producers are paid is one of the matters to be considered. The question of who pays the Excise I shall leave to others ; all I know is that the Excise is ultimately paid by the consumer. Then there is the question of what is the difference in price between crude and refined sugar. It was stated five or six years ago that the difference was only 25s. in Europe, but that it was much more here. </para>

                        <para>- A difference of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> is somewhat significant, and I hope the Sugar Commission will tell us something about the matter. I should like the Minister, if he can, to help us to find out what is going on in Japan and some of the other eastern countries in sugar production. A good deal has been written on the subject, and I believe that Japan is developing her refineries very much. If so, I am confident, from what I have seen, that the export market will hot exist for us. </para>

                        <para>- Not now, of course; we cannot even meet our local consumption. In an article in, I think, the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Re view,</inline> it was pointed out that there are labour difficulties in the sugar industry of Japan, but that, if some of these are got over, the sugar industry will develop largely. The position is that any hope of export to the East may be affected by the fact that the eastern countries are themselves manufacturing. I mention this because I stated yesterday that at present we are producing only a very small proportion of the total possibility of production in Australia. The Northern Territory might give many times over the Queensland production if we once start the industry there under any  fostering we may give it,- &#34;from the Tariff or otherwise. Then arises the difficult question of export; and I would like the Minister to assist us in finding out whether likely markets in the East exist. </para>

If, by an import duty, we offer an inducement to large production, surely I am entitled to information as to the possibility of placing the product ; or, otherwise, we shall be placed in the position of Europe, where full prices were paid in the producing country and the sugar sold elsewhere at a low price. Before the Convention, many industries in England were flourishing because they took advantage of the sacrifice of revenue and consequent lowness of price caused by the bounty given in exporting countries. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member apparently agrees with me.  When we talk about our great sugar industry, we cannot say that the limit has been reached that will satisfy us; and if we do develop the industry under a mistaken policy of excessive fostering, we ought to know where we can place the product. Independently of that, we ought also to know what is to be the rate of duty in order to cover the addition to the wages paid at present. It may be a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6,</inline> a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4,</inline> or a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> duty. </para>

                        <para>- That is very improbable, but it might be. Knowing what the industry is, and the number of people engaged, it is very unlikely that even a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> duty is required on our present consumption in order to enable fair rates of wages to be paid in Queensland. We do not desire to get from the import duty alone the money necessary to pay a fair rate of wages. Surely the wages are not to be made up altogether by the import duty. The difference between a fair rate of duty and the rate that is actually paid might be covered by a shrinkage in the profits to some extent. If we find that one branch of the industry is receiving undue profits, let us understand to what extent those profits are caused by our import duty ; and, if the producers do not surrender the proportion that is necessary to keep labour in a proper condition, it is our place to correspondingly reduce the import duty. I hope that on this point we shall be given some information. In Canada, they deal with some monopolies by reducing the duties. They deal with patents, for instance, in that way. </para>

                        <para>- They have. We hear a good deal of talk about combines and trusts, but I might remind honorable members opposite that it was part of the policy of the last Government, as is shown in a memorandum which was printed by the present Government, to introduce machinery which has since been adopted in Canada in order to investigate combines and trusts, without the necessity of the delay and expense of litigation. An Act has been passed by the Dominion Parliament of Canada, to which I may subsequently refer in a debate in this House, which is acknowledged to be working very effectively to control combines. What is required is done simply by a thorough investigation as a preliminary to any judicial proceeding. A body of experts is appointed for the purpose, and its powers of inquiry have been found to be ample. </para>

                        <para>- That does not touch the question. Where there is an Inter- State combination, we have ample powers under our Constitution. If our Act is not as wide as the Constitution enables it to be, we can amend it. We have not properly decided the full effect of our legislation on this subject. There is a test case before the Court on which a judgment may be delivered this week, but if that judgment should be adverse to the Crown, it will not follow that we have not the power to make our Act more effective. As a matter of fact, one part of the Act was amended in 1909. I think I secured the amendment myself, and the present Attorney-General declared in 1910 that it was perfectly effective. It was intended to put a stop to the  system of rebates, and the present Attorney-General admitted that the system was abandoned as soon as the amended Act came into operation. I hope, therefore, that honorable members will not think that because we may fall in our legislative progress, we cannot get up again, and, it may be, go on with greater strength, taking more care to discover how our Constitution may be applied. When the honorable member for Capricornia was referring yesterday to combines, and suggesting that he did not hear sufficient condemnation of them from this side, I was tempted to remind him that in 1902, some honorable members on this side predicted what would take place. I have a quotation here from a speech made at the time, but I do not wish to inflict it on the Committee. </para>

I can assure honorable members opposite that I can speak for the whole party on this side when I say that we are quite as anxious as they are, when we really know the facts, to prevent any body of men obtaining too great profits as the result of any policy we place upon the statute-book. At all events, we are quite as anxious as are honorable members opposite to see that the producer and the labour employed in the production of sugar shall get a fair share of any sacrifice the Treasurer makes, as the result of any policy adopted by this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I think we shall be able to find that out in time. I should never be one to prevent the fullest inquiry to ascertain what we are perfectly entitled to know. If the people of Australia, in order to keep the sugar industry going, are prepared to impose a duty which has the effect of raising the price of, say, sugar to the consumer in Australia, they are entitled to know to what extent that duty swells the profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. If the Government are prepared to treat that company fairly, I think they will have no difficulty in finding out how much of their profits are accounted for in that way. Whilst I admit, with the honorable member for Angas, that there is a great deal in connexion with the industry on which we require more light, I do not think that should prevent this Parliament at once dealing with branches of the industry upon which we have the fullest light. I do not think we should hesitate to take whatever action is shown to be necessary in the interests of the producers and workers in the production of the raw material. Looking over the discussion on the second reading of this Bill, I was reminded of a precept which I learned very early in my life - </para>

This has been owing to the fact that we have adopted the very round-about method of doing what we were unable to accomplish by a direct method.

                        <para>- We were not in a position to do that, so we did what we had a perfect legal right to do. We imposed the Excise duty indirectly upon the manufacturer, and, through him, we penalized the grower who grew his cane with coloured labour, and that is what we did it for. We did it to penalize the cane-grower who employed black labour - to get rid of coloured labour - and if the Excise and bounty had not operated in that direction that class of labour would not have been dispensed with. Surely that must be patent to all. Yet honorable member after honorable member opposite has told us that the Excise is not paid by the grower, but by the consumer. How any sane man can make such a statement I am utterly unable to comprehend. There is the fact that we imposed the sugar Excise for the purpose of penalizing the cane-grower who employed black labour. That it did penalize him is perfectly evident, seeing that black labour has disappeared from the canefields. </para>

                        <para>- To a certain extent it has, but not to the same extent. It penalized the white grower, owing to the peculiar way in which it was allocated, to the extent of &#163;1 per ton instead of &#163;4 per ton. I admit that for every ton of cane that is consumed in Australia the consumer pays  &#163;6  per ton more wholesale than he would be required to pay if there were no sugar grown in Australia, and if no duty were imposed upon it. </para>

                        <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning states that not only does the consumer pay the  &#163;6  per ton more for sugar, but he also pays the  &#163;4  per ton Excise duty. Such a statement is absolute nonsense. Whilst the consumer does pay&#163;6 per ton - or, to be strictly accurate, &#163;5 10s. per ton - more for sugar than he would otherwise be called upon to pay, the operation of the Excise and bounty is merely a shuffle of the cards between the growers, the refiners, and the Government. It does not touch the consumer at ali. As proof of that, I say that if the bounty and Excise were abolished to-morrow, the price of sugar would not be changed to the extent of a single farthing to any consumer iri Australia. This Parliament imposed the Excise duty for the purpose of penalizing the cane-grower who employed black labour. That it achieved its purpose is abundantly evident. If the sugar Excise were paid by the consumer in the true sense of the word - in the way that the Excise, say, upon beer, is paid - and if the sugar bounty were really in the nature of a bounty, would the growers be such idiots as to ask the Commonwealth to dispense with both ? </para>

                        <para>- That is another matter. If the consumer really paid the Excise, and the grower really obtained the bounty, the latter would be getting in the open market &#163;4 per ton more for his cane than he is getting to-day, apart from the bounty. In other words, he would be getting an additional &#163;7 per ton. Yet he is anxious to dispense both with the bounty and the Excise. He does not want them. Their removal would not affect the price of sugar to the consumer to the extent of a solitary farthing. </para>

                        <para>- There are practically only two States in which sugar is grown in Australia, namely, Queensland and New South Wales, although I know that there is some talk of sugar being eventually grown in Victoria. In New South Wales, the industrial legislation permits of the workers combining to secure the establishment of a Wages Board, and of that Board determining what rate of wages shall be paid in the industry. Consequently, the workers there are fully protected. In Queensland, at the present time, there is before Parliament a Bill which, in a few days, will become law, and which will confer just the same protection upon the workers there. As regards the employment of black labour in the industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, proposes to go further than this Parliament has ever gone by prohibiting the growing of sugar by that class of labour. This Parliament has not power to do that. </para>

                        <para>- Then he will vote for this amendment. Speaking of the Prime Minister reminds me of the fact that in 1905, when this question was before the House, the right honorable member took up exactly the same attitude towards it as I am adopting to-day. He showed then, just as conclusively as I hope I have shown to-day, that the Excise and bounty are of no assistance whatever to the cane-grower. The time is ripe for us to dispense with them for ever. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Fawkner asks what is to become of the coloured men now employed in the industry. My reply is, that I think that plenty of occupation could be found for them in other directions. During my second-reading speech, I stated that the increase in wages and the reduction in working hours insisted on by the Minister will increase the cost of growing cane by 6s. 6d. per ton, and the honorable gentleman, the Attorney-General, and several Ministerial supporters said that that was absurd. I wish, therefore, to give the Committee some figures which will prove that I under-estimated the increased cost. The Minister has increased the rate of wages from 22s. 6d. to 25s. and keep at 10s. a week, to 36s. and keep at 12s. a week. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say. It may be the fault of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, or of some one else, or even of this Parliament. The information on which I have made my calculation was not given to me by the gentleman referred to indirectly by the honorable member for Herbert, but by growers in my own electorate, who have been engaged from their boyhood in growing cane; intelligent men, who know what they are talking about, and have a better practical acquaintance with the industry than any member of the Committee. Working on the information which they have supplied, I have found that the increase in wages made by the Minister equals 37.5 per cent., and that the decrease in time worked is equivalent to an increase in wages of 17 per cent., or 54.5 per cent. altogether. </para>

                        <para>- It is not for cane-cutting that most of the money is paid. Under the new arrangement there must be a certain . amount of overtime, which&#39; I estimate as equivalent to an increase of wages to 5 per cent., making the total of the increases 59.5 per cent. The cost of producing cane, taking no account of interest on the capital invested in land, plant, and so on, has been proved to be, by averaging the expenditure of a number of years, from 15s. to 16s. per ton. Those figures have been given to me by several growers.. If the alteration made by the Minister be reckoned as equivalent to an increase of only  50  per cent, in wages, it means an increase of  7s. 6d.  to  8s  in the cost of producing a ton of cane, so that when I said that the increase was  6s. 6d.  per ton I was below the mark. Even if a man can do as much work in eight hours as in nine or ten, there is still this increase in cost. Now, according to the growers,  75  per cent, of what they receive for their cane is paid away in wages. The honorable member for Darling Downs gave figures which had been arrived at by a grower who had kept careful accounts, who had only &#163;112 a year as a return to cover interest on his investment, and all expenses except labour. Allowing that the cost of production is now  75  per cent, of the amount received, it will be seen that to add  50  per cent, to that cost makes it impossible to carry on the industry ; and is it to bo wondered at that from every sugar-growing district come telegrams to the effect that cane will not be planted this year? </para>

                        <para>- I know that it is true. Growers cannot continue to make a profit with sugar-cane, and are therefore going in for other kinds of production. It would be impossible for them to continue to grow cane without being faced with bankruptcy, and that, as honorable men, they do not desire. It is not wise for Parliament to destroy an industry which has been built up at such a great cost to the people of Australia, and therefore it is time to repeal the legislation regarding the bounty and Excise, because they have accomplished their object. The workers have nothing to fear. They are going to be fully provided for by Wages Boards. I feel confident that a Wages Board can deal with the industry on very much better lines than can any Ministerial order, because in Northern Queensland you get cane in about fourteen months, and get also a very much heavier crop than you do in the south, where it takes practically two years to get a crop of cane, and so the same conditions do not apply. I think the growers in Northern Queensland can afford to pay a higher rate of wages, and, as a matter of fact, I believe they are paying it, and the conditions under which the men have to labour there are very much more arduous than they are in the south. Let us give up the control of this industry through the Excise and bounty, and hand it over to the Wages Boards which have been promised, and under which the workers&#39; interests will be just as fully safeguarded, and the industry will flourish very much better than it can under any Ministerial order. </para>

                    <para>. - In moving the second reading of the Bill I was careful to avoid any reference to the particular company that has been referred to by many honor-, able members since the discussion started. The honorable member for Angas said that we should have full information regarding the whole sugar industry, including the product of Australia to-day, the probable product of omer countries in the near future, and how it will affect the Australian industry ; but we are not dealing with the whole of the sugar question at present. The object of the Bill is to take the fixing of the rates and conditions out of the hands of the Minister. It is far better that they should be fixed by an Arbitration Court or Wages Board than be left in the hands of any Minister, but if the amendment of the honorable member for Ballarat is carried by the Opposition, they will practically be saying, &#34; Leave the matter in the hands of the Minister.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member practically says, &#34; Let the 1910 Act, which provides that the Minister can withhold the bounty, stand.&#34; In fact, it is the Minister&#39;s bounden duty to withhold it unless fair rates of wages are paid, and fair conditions of employment observed in the industry. . I believe that every honorable member agrees that the men employed in the sugar industry are entitled to a fair deal. Personally, I do not think they have had it in the past. I said last Thursday that the Act of 19 10 was passed at my instance, and that in the light of experience we had found that it started at the wrong end. </para>

                        <para>- It is far better to try and fail than not to try at all. I said last Thursday that with all our industrial legislation we were gaining in experience. We know more to-day about the operation of these measures than we did two or three years ago. We fmd now that the Minister has the power, only after the work is done,- te withhold the bounty. As I said when introducing the Bill, I was told that <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> could have stopped the bounty from last year. Would it have been fair to withhold the bounty from growers who had carried out the whole of their arrangements, including working in the field, ploughing, planting, trashing, and cutting, believing they were on right lines? Would it be right, twelve months after the work had been done, for me to say, &#34; No, you did not observe proper conditions &#34; ? That was the reason why I issued an order stating that, pending a decision by the Arbitration Court, if such-and-such rates were observed, the bounty would not be withheld. I went further, and said that any amicable agreement arrived at between the employers and employes in any particular district would be considered fair and reasonable. The Cabinet, after consideration, decided that it would be better to allow the  President  of the Arbitration Court, or any Wages Board, or other industrial tribunal, to decide, before any of the work was done, what rates should be paid and what conditions observed. If the amendment is carried, the duty will still be imposed on the Minister of withholding the payment of bounty unless he believes that fair conditions have been observed. Some honorable members asked, &#34; Why did you not do this last year? Why did you allow the whole of last season&#39;s operations to be transacted, and the workers to work for twelve months, without taking steps to do anything?&#34; My reply was that we were expecting the Sugar Commission to arrive at a definite decision on this matter; but when it was seen that there was no hope of the Commission arriving at any decision, so far as the workers were concerned, and the workers themselves had complained to many honorable members regarding their conditions, something had to be done. I was asked to withhold the payment of the bounty to the Government of the State of Victoria, because they had not observed the conditions observed in certain other districts. The sum involved was about ,&#163;160. I considered in that case, as in others, that it was better to notify them in advance what were fair rates of wages and conditions of employment, instead of allowing the whole of the work to be done, and then coming down on them afterwards and stopping the full amount of the bounty. The complaint of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> and other harvester manufacturers was that they had gone on doing their work for months, and did not know what were to  be  considered fair rates of wages, and that then the Judge laid down 7 s. a day as the rate for unskilled work, and a greater amount for other work.  They  complained that, had they known beforehand, they could have fixed the conditions in the factory accordingly ; but that they did not  know, and that was why a number of them had the constitutionality of the Act tested. The honorable member for Richmond quoted a table from the <inline font-style="italic">Sugar Journal</inline> giving the rates of pay in the sugar industry throughout the world. He complained, on the one hand, that the rate of is. per hour fixed by me was unfair. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to be unfair to the honorable member, but he said that the industry could not afford to pay it ; yet he quoted the table to show that in Australia, for European labour only, the rate of pay for field and harvesting work was from1s. to 2s. per hour. My rate was a minimum of1s. If this table be correct, some of the workers received for this particular class of work double the rates prescribed in my regulation. </para>

Any honorable member who knows anything about the sugar industry will admit that those rates which I have issued are not unreasonable, and that the industry can continue to afford to pay what, according to this table, it is paying already. </para>

                        <para>- Let me show how unreliable the figures of this journal are. The only determination of a Wages Board in the sugar industry as far as Queensland is concerned is that of the Mackay Wages Board. I quote the facts from the <inline font-style="italic">Sugar Journal</inline> of 6th July, 1911, which took them from the <inline font-style="italic">Mackay Mercury.</inline> The highest rate here quoted works out at 2s. per hour. The first engineer in a mill receives 45s. and found, which is worth 12s. 6d. a week. He has to work sixty hours per week for that. The unskilled worker gets from 30s. per week and found, for sixty hours&#39; work. </para>

                        <para>- The great bulk of the workers in the mills. The honorable member for Herbert represents the largest sugar producing district in Australia. It produces probably 60 or 70 per cent. of the whole quantity of Australian sugar. He knows the industry pretty well, and agrees with me that the minimum of 30s. applies to the great proportion of the mill workers. It is equal, with found, to 42s. for sixty hours&#39; work, which means about 8d. per hour, keep inclusive. This measure is intended to allow the Arbitration Court, or a person nominated by the Judge, or any industrial tribunal, to consider a question which honorable members opposite apparently do not desire to have considered. </para>

The persons whom I should like to see taking up that position would be some of the big growers, such as Young Brothers or Messrs. Gibson and Howe. It would not be a bad thing to bring forward the wages rates upon which some of these people have claimed the bounty. I believe, with the honorable member for Angas, that the Minister cannot get rid of his responsibility. He has to see the wages are fair and reasonable. It has been said by honorable members opposite that the rates set forth will mean an increase of 60 per cent. in the cost of production. Before this action was taken, I took the trouble to ascertain exactly what rates were being paid for the coming season. The Collector of Customs in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barkley,</inline> ascertained what the rates were, and I find rates set forth in the regulations.

No.  4  district includes New South Wales and sugar areas in the neighbourhood of Brisbane, such as Nambour and Nerang, and the wages paid there are lower than are those paid in any other district. The average rates of wages prevailing in the remaining three districts, which are . producing probably 90 per cent, of the sugar of Australia, are something like the rates that were fixed in the recent order. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It is estimated that  8  tons of cane grown in No. 1 district will produce 1 ton of sugar, whereas 10 tons of cane grown in No.  4  district are required to produce the same quantity. That a., the estimate framed by the Department of Trade and Customs in connexion with the payment of the bounty. No one has said that the rates fixed are unfair or unreasonable. Indeed, I think that every honorable member would desire to see at least those rates of wages paid. &#39; lt is said by some that the industry cannot afford to pay them, but this Bill is being passed to enable the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to decide before, and not after, the work is done what ought actually to be paid. </para>

                        <para>- It is one of the purposes; but, unfortunately, one interest, to which I have not previously referred, is apparently determined that the Commission shall not complete its work. Are the old conditions to be allowed to continue while the Commission is sitting? Is it fair that whilst some employers are paying the higher rates that are set forth in the schedule which I have just read, and which has been prepared from information obtained from an absolutely reliable source, less scrupulous persons should be allowed to pay lower wages? The information which I have just put before the Committee was obtained from men who have nothing to gain by giving incorrect figures, and, as a matter of fact, it has never been challenged. All the papers have been seen by some honorable members of the Opposition. They were made available to honorable members, and have been placed from time to time on the Library table. I obtained them for the information of the honorable member for Darling Downs, and neither he nor any other honorable member has questioned the figures. Is it fair that some growers who are prepared to deal justly by their employes should pay the higher rates, while others who are less scrupulous get their employes to work for less? </para>

Is it not a fact that one of the objects of the whole of our industrial legislation is to protect the fair employer from the sweater ? Even when the appointment of Wages Boards in Victoria was opposed by the Employers Federation, some fair-minded employers asked for them, because they said that whilst they were prepared to pay reasonable wages they were dragged down to sweating rates by unscrupulous persons &#39; in their respective industries. It was to compel the unfair employers to pay fair wages that the rates were fixed. This Bill is to allow the whole question of wages to be decided at the outset by the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court or by a Wages Board. The proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition will not carry him one step forward. If the honorable member says that as a matter of principle the Opposition do not desire to refer the question to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, well and good. </para>

I trust that honorable members will net oppose the Bill simply because it happens to be a Government measure, but that they will, on&#39; the other hand, admit, as I think they must, that it is to the interest of the grower to know exactly his position before the work begins, instead of waiting until it is completed and new rates are prescribed by the Arbitration Court, or any other tribunal. </para>

Other food stuffs may be used by certain sections of the community, but sugar is used in some shape or form by every person from the cradle to the grave. When the honorable member for Richmond yesterday said that the cost to the grower would be increased by 6s. 6d. per ton by the proposed increase in wages, I asked for some definite and detailed information on the point. </para>

                        <para>- He may have, but, at any rate, he did not say so. To-day the honorable member comes forward with a return prepared by some hypothetical person, who alleges that for a number of years in the Richmond electorate the average cost of the cane has been from 15s. to 16s. per ton. My reply is that, under those circumstances, this person has been growing cane for less than nothing, because the returns show that 16s. has never yet been paid, minus the bounty, in the Richmond district. Such people as this return speaks of must have been growing cane the whole time at a loss. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but I think the honorable member has been misinformed, to say the least of it. One cannot help referring once more to the question of who pays the Excise, after remarks of the honorable member for Kooyong, the honorable member for Richmond, and others. There is one argument that has not, as yet, been adduced. Cane is produced only in New South Wales and Queensland, and the past Treasurers of those States have been described as heaven-born financiers. In Queensland we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Philp, followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston,</inline> who was a very able man at figures; and in New South Wales we had <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, and afterwards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waddell,</inline> all men of high financial repute. As cane is produced in only those two States, and if, according to the argument of honorable members opposite, the grower pays the Excise, those two States had a claim to the whole of the Excise prior to the expiration of the Braddon section. It will be observed, however, that those States never put in any claim for the Excise, simply because it was known that such a claim rested on grounds so poor that it had no chance of recognition. There is not an honorable member opposite who would have voted money to satisfy any claim of the kind had it been made. Sometimes when I am in the north, I say that the price to the consumer should be lower than it is. The price paid last year was&#163;9 7s. 6d., plus a bonus, the amount of which we do not know. The highest price, I believe, was about &#163;11, including the bonus. </para>

                        <para>- The average would not be that, and I should say that the price was about&#163;11 per ton for raw sugar, and the cost of refining may be taken at &#163;2. When I assert that the price to the consumer should be lower, based on mere prices, I am immediately met with the statement, &#34;Yes; but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has to pay the Excise.&#34; The Company pay the Excise as the sugar is taken out of bond ; but they add the &#163;4, with the other charges, to the price of the sugar. Now I ask, if the cane-grower is debited with the amount of the Excise, why is it put on again to the consumer? Is it paid twice over ? We know that it is not. It is paid once by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and they pass it on to the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I would like honorable members to understand that I am not opposed to the abolition of the bounty and the Excise, provided the farmers express their willingness that they should be abolished. I was returned to this Parliament on that question more than upon any other. I advocated the bounty, and told the farmers that I was entirely in favour of it, and on that statement I secured the biggest majority I ever obtained. I have suggested in letters to various bodies that by some arrangement of their own they should get a vote of the sugar farmers for or against the bounty, so that Parliament might know exactly what they desire, and I should be guided by the result of that vote. If the farmers do not want it, I am prepared to say, &#34; Let it go.&#34; Personally, I believe that it should be maintained. I believe the payment of the bounty was the best thing that could be done for the farmers. Yesterday I cited figures to show the benefit it had been in certain centres of my electorate. I have told the sugar farmers also that if it is once abolished they will never get it back again. If we do abolish the bounty I believe the day will not be fax  distant when the sugar-growers will come to this Parliament asking that it should be reinstated. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Constitution we could not differentiate in that way, and consequently had not the power to do what was suggested. If one who is aware of the facts reads up the old debates on this question, he will find that the bounty was never intended as a reward for the man who grew sugar with white labour. When we said that the black labour should be removed, and that white labour should be substituted for it, the bounty was proposed to compensate the grower for the increased cost of production due to the employment of white labour. </para>

                        <para>- It is the import duty only which regulates the price to the consumer. As regards the wages of 35s. per week and keep, it is estimated that the keep represents 12s. per week. Where a number of men are employed upon a plantation, the cost of keep will not amount to half that sum. When the trouble in the industry occurred last year, I visited the strike camp at Bundaberg. It was a very fine camp, the men were well housed and well fed. I had a first-rate meal at the camp, consisting of the best of food very well cooked. The men had a committee of management, with a  chairman  who was known as the Captain of the camp. The  chairman  of the committee told me, and offered to show me his books in proof of his statement, that the cost of the camp, including food, housing, and everything, was 5s. 3d. per week per man. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members are aware that the men appealed to other unions in the different States for financial assistance, and received it. At some of the camps, for instance, at the Mackay camp, it was found necessary to draw upon this fund to feed the men who, for the sake of convenience we will say, were on strike. But at the Bundaberg camp I was told that they had never drawn upon the funds for a shilling, because the townspeople found the money required. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the general work. In the north of Queensland there are nearly three months during which it is quite impossible to get on the land on account of the wet season. The growers start planting, perhaps, in April, and if they happen to be very fortunate complete this operation in May. In July the crop has to be harvested. Quite  90  per cent. of the harvesting is done by piece-work, and this regulation will not affect that work at all. Indeed, it is highly probable that in order to get inside the regulation the whole of the work will in the near future be done by piece-work. At the present time harvesting is done by piece-work, and chipping, in some places, is undertaken by the lineal chain. Between the rows of cane the scarifier has to be used, and between the stools a hoe has to be employed for chipping. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that the Minister will not go outside the rule which obtains in any district in regard to harvesting which for years past has been done by piece-work. I shall not pursue this line of argument any further. But before concluding my remarks I should like to read a letter written by the secretary of the Sugar Workers Union of Australia, which appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of this morning. These workers are federated now, and are becoming a powerful body. The letter is as follows :  - </para>

                </para>
                <para>Would you kindly grant me space to make public the methods adopted by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to prevent the employ&#233;s obtaining a Wages Board ? </para>
                <para class="block">I may, perhaps, be permitted to digress for a moment to say that I omitted to mention previously that the rate of wages which I quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Sugar Journal</inline> applies only to the employ&#233;s in sugar mills. So far no Wages Board has been established in Queensland to determine the wages of rural workers. </para>
                <para>Last week they sent a petition around the works asking the employ&#233;s to refuse a Wages Board, and those selected to take it around told those that they asked to sign it that it would be better for them if they signed it, and that the company would grant them an increase of 2s. a week at Christmas. I may state that to my mind the fact of telling them it would be better for them if they signed it contained a threat of dismissal in the event of a refusal. It is not surprising to me the attitude the company is taking to prevent the union obtaining a Wage Board for the industry, because I happen to know that in Sydney about 1905 or 1906 the union there had listed a case in the State Arbitration Court in New South Wales, and when within a few weeks of the case coming on for hearing they sent some of the foremen to the members of the union that were in arrears, and, giving them the amount, telling them to go to the meeting and vote for the withdrawal of the case, which, I am sorry to say, they succeeded in doing. Now, if the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is so anxious to give its employ&#233;s the fair conditions it says it is willing to do, how is it it has not thought of doing so until the employes have become organized, and made representations to the Government for relief through a Wages Board? The union, in the event of a refusal of a Wages Board, will approach the Federal Arbitration Court for an award, and will use every means to see that the company treats its employ&#233;s better in the future than it has in the past.

                    <para>. - I would not like this debate to close without making one or two observations upon this Bill, because the sugar question is one of very great moment, not only to the two States which are interested in the production of sugar, but to every part of the Commonwealth from the point of view of the consumer. I have endeavoured to closely follow the discussion, and to gather information from those honorable members who represent sugar-growing districts. It seems to me that the first and principal object of this Bill is to force the employes in the sugar industry into the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. In his closing remarks, the honorable member for Capricornia reminded the Committee that his party specially represented the workers, and that if they miss the opportunity which presents itself under this Bill, when they again appear before the electors the employes in the industry will say to them, &#34; You were in power, and you had the opportunity to allow us access to the Arbitration Court, but you neglected to avail yourself of it.&#34; I think that the honorable member will agree that this is a fair representation of his position. </para>

                        <para>- Are we not to consider how much the sugar industry will stand? Judging by several of the speeches which have been delivered, it is doubtful whether, in some of the districts, an additional burden can be placed on the growers without destroying their profits altogether. The testing time for the industry has arrived. The honorable member for Ballarat proposes the entire abolition of Excise and bounty. </para>

                        <para>- If Queensland will provide a local tribunal to deal with the question of wages. What was the original purpose of the bounty ? It was to do away with black labour, and it has been so far successful that to-day only a small percentage of the labour employed in the cane-fields is coloured. The honorable member for Ballarat, in submitting his amendment, told the Committee that the Premier of Queensland would undertake to introduce a Bill prohibiting the employment of coloured labour in the cane-fields, and that provision would be made for a tribunal to deal with the question of wages. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government of Queensland will undertake to prohibit the employment of black labour in the cane-fields of the State, surely Labour members have sufficient confidence in the Labour Government in power in New South Wales to believe that it will apply the White Australia principle to its canefields also. On what ground do honorable members representing cane-fields resist the concession that is offered in the abolition of bounty and .Excise? The Excise amounts to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> a ton, and of it <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> is repaid in bounty, making the collection for revenue purposes <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> a ton. If that amount of revenue be surrendered, it will be a distinct advantage to those engaged in sugar-growing. According to the newspapers, the Queensland growers are practically unanimous that the bounty and Excise should be abolished at the earliest opportunity. Black labour is practically a thing of the past, as the Prime Minister must admit. </para>

                        <para>- That statement is at variance with the statements of other Queensland representatives in this and previous debates. However, the matter is not one of speculation. There must be statistics showing what proportion of the labour in the cane-fields is coloured. The Queensland Government proposes to introduce legislation to put an end entirely and for ever to the employment of black labour in the cane-fields. </para>

                        <para>- It was done, not to exclude black labour, but to differentiate between the two classes of labour. The standard of comfort of a white man keeping a wife and family does not enable him to compete with a coloured man who had no obligation whatever to civilization, and seldom had wife or family. The object was to enable the white man to compete with the black man in an industry where manual labour is employed to a larger extent than in any other industry that I know of. A white man with a hoe, and a coloured man with a- hoe, are nearly on an equality. It is only in the arena of machinery and technical skill that the white man has no need to trouble about black competition. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parkes was one, while the honorable member for Oxley spoke for five or six hours, and I, myself, pleaded that he should be allowed to speak as long as he wished in order to put the case. The Opposition filled newspapers and pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with the wail that the industry could never be carried on with white labour. They published official reports to show that it was a physical impossibility for white labour to grow sugar successfully. It was  not an economic question at all, but a question of physical impossibility, according to them. Ten years afterwards we hear from that side of the , House quite a different proposal - to do away with both the bounty and the Excise. I agree with that, and always have agreed with it. I have always held that the Excise and bounty were merely superstructures for the purpose of the transformation of the industry. Unlike the honorable member for Herbert, I did not tell the sugar-growers at the last election that I was against the repeal of the Excise and Bounty Acts, but I advised them not to agitate for their repeal, and had good reasons for so advising them. I believe that the small grower would never have got the same return for his cane, small as it is at the present time, were it not for the fact that there is a difference between a payment by the Government and a. payment by the buyer of his raw material. It put him in a more impregnable position to be receiving returns from two sources, because the small man always knew that he would get the bounty exactly in cash from the Government, and he could more easily calculate whether he was getting a fair deal from the man who purchased from him the raw material from which sugar was produced and ultimately sold. It is for that reason that I have always strongly advocated the existence of those two enactments until such time as there could be brought forward a proposal such as this, but of more far-reaching consequences, to enable a Judge &#34;of the High Court, sitting as a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, to determine what is a fair remuneration for the worker to get, and the proportionate shares that should go to the actual white grower of the cane, and to the small miller, leaving it to be discovered what the refiner and seller should do with the commodity that they deal with. That is a policy which has been as much advocated by the honorable member for Ballarat as by myself or any one else here. It is a logical, clear, and distinct policy that can run through every industry if necessary. It is absolutely necessary ns regards the sugar industry. The sugar-grower is as helpless as the sugar-worker under open competition. The sugar crop at the most valuable time is absolutely worthless unless the miller will take it and crush it for him. In the case of other agricultural commodities, in a time of scarcity the price increases, and a man gets a larger return for a smaller amount, but in the case of a failure or partial failure of the cane crop, possibly the mill will not start at all, and the grower receives no return. The growing of cane absorbs all the energy and time of the grower, and the loss of a crop is a very serious thing to him. </para>

                        <para>- It is. When all goes well the industry is a very good one, but when things are otherwise the result can be expressed very emphatically. Unfortunately, in the present year there will undoubtedly be a very small crop, and there are difficulties in consequence; but any one who says that there is not sufficient money in the sugar industry in all its branches to give a.&#34; fair return to the labourer, the grower - that is, the owner of the holding - the sugar-miller, and the refiner, with a large margin to spare, has never looked into the industry. I cannot understand why we as a&#39; National Parliament should hesitate to send the whole matter to a competent Court which has been established by this Parliament, and get that Court, with its powers, to deal with the evidence, sift the question, and determine it finally. The honorable member for Ballarat speaks of dealing with the matter in little local districts. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion it does far more than that. It is in the interest of the small grower as well as of the worker. It gives him the protection of a Court in his desire to deal justly between the persons whom he employs and those to whom he sells his product. As soon as the growers fully comprehend that position, I venture to say that they will be agreeable, and exceedingly anxious, that the power should be given to this Parliament to enable it to establish a. Court to insure that justice will be done to all parties.. A question has been raised as to the effect of this amendment. It simply means nothing beyond creating a discussion. It is meaningless so far as this Bill is concerned. It does not attempt to improve the measure. It simply tests the question whether the method proposed should be abandoned or not. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the honorable member is entirely in error. What is now proposed would not attain the object he desires. I believe it would fail to secure a settlement of this important question, because it would prevent a Court being established which would deal with several individual cases on the evidence, and would leave it to a Government, which is the least satisfactory method, to deal with matters of this kind. We believe that we should go to a Court to get a final and definite determination on the evidence. There are many other features of the sugar industry which I should like to discuss, but this is not the proper time. As soon as the grower can be assured of protection regarding the value of his product in selling it to the miller, and the miller can be guaranteed against the refiner, and we get that general power to deal with all these matters - a power which, I think, is necessary to the Commonwealth - I shall be heartily inclined to support the abolition of the bounty and Excise. My suggestion was carried to Queensland, and came back here in a letter from the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham.</inline> I say that it is a practical proposal. Why? The State, in my opinion, has power to prescribe what kind of labour shall be employed in any particular area. That can be done by a State Act. I do not think that this Parliament has power to deal with such a question. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. But I would not commit myself to the specific statement, the Crown Law officers may have given an opinion to the contrary. The language of the Constitution led me to believe that we had power to distinguish. In the earlier years of this Parliament, when the matter was being debated by the lawyers - and there were four or five distinguished lawyers in the Cabinet of which the honorable member for Ballarat was a member - the assumption was that we had not that power of distinction. But there is no doubt that the sovereign power of the States  exists, and that they can do as they choose in the matter. I suggest to honorable members, as I have suggested to my electors, that this superstructure of Excise and bounty ought not to exist any longer than is sufficient to accomplish its object. Some honorable members say that the object is accomplished, and that practically white labour is now employed in producing nearly all cane. They therefore ask why we should continue the bounty and Excise. But do honorable members recollect that there is a difference of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per ton in favour of sugar-cane grown by white labour? Do they know that <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> is the difference in favour of the grower of the raw material of. the industry - the cane? It amounts to nearly half - or at least 40 per cent.- of the amount the grower receives for his cane. If we remove that barrier, and leave others free to employ coloured labour, we undo all our work of ten years. It would be stupidity and want of foresight to wipe out that work. That is an answer to the statement of those honorable members who say that we have accomplished our object in securing the employment of practically all white labour in- the industry. I say that we should be courting disaster if we did what is suggested. No other country in the world has developed a great tropical industry by white labour. What we have done is unique in the history of our race. It is a compliment to this Commonwealth of which it can be justly proud that we have accomplished it. Though I am not concerned to deny that the work has entailed considerable expense, nevertheless the advantage to Australia has been considerable. In the teeth of opposition, this National Parliament carried its white labour policy into effect. It has since worked successfully. I trust that the opposition to this measure will not be carried so far as to press the amendment to a division, because I am just as heartily in favour of the idea underlying it as the honorable member for Ballarat is. But, to use the title of a distinguished playwright, whose work was recently produced, &#34; The Time is not yet Ripe.&#34; It is nearly so, and I trust that something further will be done in the matter in the near future. </para>

                    <para>- - The Prime Minister, in his speech, seemed to proceed upon the assumption that there was some objection on the part of the Opposition to the reference of this question to a competent industrial tribunal. I am not aware that any statement has been made by a member of the Opposition indicating such an objection. On the contrary, we are anxious that the question should be referred to a competent industrial tribunal- The present system, I admit, is unsatisfactory. It is desirable that the growers, before they proceed with their work, shall at least know what rates of wages will be recognised by the Minister; and all that is attempted by this amendment is to secure a definite expression of opinion that it is desirable that the bounty and Excise shall be at once abolished. If carried, the amendment would have the effect of indicating that the Committee was desirous that they should be abolished. Apart from that, we only ask by this amendment not that the present Bill shall be rejected, because there is no determined opposition to it from this side of the House, but that it shall be postponed until the Premier of Queensland has had an opportunity to carry out his promise. There is no objection on our part to an increased wage. Honorable members on this side have indicated from time to time that they welcome the idea of an increased wage being paid in the industry. We do not object to the Bill as a Bill, or to the principle contained in it, nor do we object to an increased wage. But what we do say is that negotiations of a very satisfactory character have been going on between the Prime Minister and the Queensland Government. The Prime Minister has definitely announced that he is in favour of the abolition of the bounty and Excise, and he has been &#39;fortunate enough to obtain from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, a promise to introduce and pass legislation having for its object the prohibition of black labour in connexion with the industry. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. In the first place, I am anxious that this important matter shall not be dealt with piecemeal. We have an opportunity for its practical settlement, not in a piecemeal, but in a comprehensive way. The Prime Minister himself has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham&#39;s</inline> proposal is essentially practical, and one that completely meets the situation In all these circumstances, what do we suggest? We suggest, by this amendment, merely the postponement of the consideration of the Bill until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denhams</inline> has had an opportunity to carry out his promise; that promise being to introduce legislation to prohibit black labour - to the employment of which we on this side are completely opposed - and to provide for the establishment of local Wages Boards in connexion with the industry. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> carries out his promise, as we have every reason to think that he will, the House will then be able to deal with this Bill as it thinks fit. That is a reasonable and practical way of dealing with the question. We are all anxious that it shall be dealt with in a comprehensive way, and we have now an opportunity for a settlement, on an essentially satisfactory basis. Are we making an unreasonable request when we ask that this Bill shall be, not withdrawn, but postponed, and ultimately passed if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> neglects or refuses to give effect to the promise made by him. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I can see at present, I do not think there would be any serious objection to that, in view of what has taken place. I should, however, prefer to judge the matter completely on the basis of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham&#39;s</inline> proposed legislation. If we do not get that legislation I think there is much that can be said in favour of the suggestion that this Bill, if it is ultimately passed, should be made retrospective in order that the workers might not be injuriously affected in the event of the Premier of Queensland failing to carry out his promise. In the circumstances the amendment is fair and reasonable. It has not been submitted to secure any party advantage, or for any party purpose, and I think it is unwise to misconstrue in any way the suggestion that has been made by the Opposition. I trust that the amendment will commend itself to the fair consideration of the Government. I am prepared to admit, as I said last night, that the present law is unsatisfactory. It gives the Minister of Trade and Customs a discretionary power to determine what is the ruling rate, and what is the standard rate of wages. It seems to indicate that the procedure on the part of the Minister should be to wait until he has received a claim for bounty, and then institute a judicial inquiry. But the growers have a right to know before they start their work what the Minister will regard as the standard or ruling rate of wages. </para>

                <para class="block">This Government and previous Governments have therefore indicated what they would regard as a ruling or standard rate of wages, so that the growers might proceed with confidence, knowing that when they had completed their work they would not be deprived of the bounty. All sides are agreed that the present law should be altered. I have a great deal of confidence in our local Wages Boards, believing them to be more expeditious and effective than other systems. I think that they tend to harmonize more and more the relations of employer and employ&#233;, and as we have the promise of the establishment of local Wages Boards in connexion with this industry we should keep the Premier of Queensland up to his promise. </para>

                        <para>- By holding this Bill over his head. I am speaking now, of course, from the stand-point of the other side. The Constitution has practically left to the States the duty of fixing rates of wages, and we ought not to depart from the spirit of the Constitution. From our experience in Victoria I have the fullest confidence in local Wages Boards, which have justified their extension throughout other States ; and I am quite satisfied that, if they be established in Queensland, as promised, they will be a distinct improvement on the present system, which leaves the rates of wages to the discretion of the Minister. I am prepared to go further, and say that, if Wages Boards are not established, it will be desirable to pass this measure. I should like to refer to the remarks made by the honorable member for Herbert. With other honorable members last night, I dealt with the suggestion that the Excise duty was paid by the consumer, and I gave various reasons which led me to think that that contention is fallacious. The honorable member for Herbert asked whether it is not the practice for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to add the &#163;4, representing the Excise, to the price of the sugar. That is the practice, but the point is that the same &#163;4, which they add to the price of sugar before sending it out for sale, has been taken from the grower in the price of his cane. This establishes the fact that it is the cane-grower who pays the &#163;4 Excise, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is merely the instrument for passing it on. </para>

Further, if the Excise and bounty are abolished, the mill-owners have definitely agreed in writing, to increase the price of the cane by the amount of the Excise. It is quite clear that the Excise is not paid by the consumer, but by the grower ; and I again urge that the proposal to postpone this measure to enable the Premier of Queensland to carry out his promise should be accepted. </para>

Honorable members opposite are of opinion that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the other millers will, in such an event, pay the growers the amount now represented by the Excise. </para>

                        <para>- It is said that the mill-owners will pay 8s. 8d. per ton more if the bounty and Excise are abolished. But what did the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the other millers do in the pre- Federation days? Did they pay the cane-growers anything like the price now received, including the bounty? I have information from the Customs authorities to the effect that, prior to Federation, the cane-growers were paid from about 7s. 6d. to 15s. per ton, whereas they have since received from 13s. to 1 6s., with the 6s. bounty added, making the price of cane from 19s. to 22 s. per ton. My fear is that, as the Prime Minister said this afternoon, if we abolish the Excise and bounty, the industry will revert <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> coloured labour. We have been told that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham</inline> proposes to introduce legislation ; but let him do so, and pass it, and obtain the Royal assent. I remember that, when an endeavour was made in the Queensland Legislative Assembly to prevent aliens taking part in the industry, the Bill then passed was refused the Royal assent for, I suppose, certain reasons advanced by the Imperial authorities ; and we have yet to learn that the Imperial authorities will consent to a measure such as is now proposed by the Queensland Government. The singular fact is that not a word was said by the Queensland Government as to remedial legislation, nor was there a word from my honorable friends opposite about an agreement to improve the rate of wages, until the Minister of Trade and Customs brought down this Bill. I believe that honorable members opposite, including the honorable member for Moreton, were on a deputation to the Government in May, 1908, the object of which was to protest against the Ministerial regulation or Ordinance providing that the growers should pay 30s. a week for casual labour. </para>

How he is to enact such legislation I do not know. I know that we would not have the power, for example, to say that Chinese shall not be employed in the cabinet-making industry in Melbourne. I am. very doubtful whether any Government will be able, to pass any legislation providing that aliens at present in Australia shall not engage in any particular industry. If we abolish the bounty and Excise legislation of this Parliament we shall bring about a condition&#39; of affairs which is described in a report made to the Minister of Trade and Customs by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell.</inline> He drew up this report on the condition of the sugar industry on the 6th January,  1910,  and I find it is noted- </para>

A private copy was furnished to the writer ; but as the State Government had suppressed the document, it could not be commented upon by officials excepting by general reference, such as was made by the writer in the report to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, already referred to, which reference was made at that time in the expectation that the suppressed document would be called for. The attention of the Royal Commission is directed to the suppressed report in order that the writer may not have occasion to speak publicly of the document; and also that the Royal Commission, observing the reported outrageous treatment of the Kanakas by given persons prior to the advent of Federal legislation, may duly appreciate the possible recurrence of such conditions if the coloured alien again comes under the control of such persons without the protection of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para class="block">The Colonial Sugar Refining Company, it is estimated, produces from  30  to  40  per cent, of the raw sugar manufactured in Queensland. Honorable members opposite have spoken of agreements made by the growers with millers, in which it is stated that the millers are prepared to pass on to the growers the amount now represented by the Excise duty should that duty be removed. But the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has made no statement as to its intention to increase the price paid to cane-growers under its immediate jurisdiction and supplying cane to its mills. I remind the honorable member for Richmond that there has been a continual fight in his district between the sugar-cane farmers and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and that a number .of the farmers in that district have gone out of cane-growing altogether, and have turned their attention to dairying, because of the unsatisfactory methods of the company. The same thing applies from the Richmond River right away up to Cairns, where the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has large interests and a number of cane farmers under its control. I believe that if we were to abolish the bounty and Excise legislation the position of the sugar-growers would be no better than it was prior to Federation, and it would possibly be a great deal worse. They would not get a greater share than they are now getting of the ^6,000,000 which the public of Australia pay for their sugar. Honorable members can imagine for a moment what the position would be. We have the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the millers united under an honorable understanding, so called, to charge certain prices for sugar, and to pay certain prices for cane. </para>

                        <para>- One of the grievances of the cane-growers at the present day is that the combine has cut up the whole of the sugar districts into zones. They will permit Messrs. Gibson and Company, of the Bingera plantation, to take a part of the country, and the Windermere mill another part. The growers in each district must take their cane to a particular mill. The mill, therefore, has complete control over the cane-grower. The latter has his crop there, but he cannot do anything with it unless the miller buys it. What a deplorable state of things that is for the farmer. </para>

                        <para>- If the Queensland Government had done the right thing, when, they found that the cane-grower in a private zone was not getting a fair price for his cane, they would have purchased it. Sugar-growing, I would point out, is entirely different from the growing of any other agricultural product. A man may take his vegetables or fruit, put them in the cart, and hawk them himself. If the worst comes to the worst he can sell his apples from house to house. But he cannot do that with his sugar-cane. </para>

                        <para>- He certainly cannot send his cane to London. Consequently the grower of cane is at the mercy of the combine. At the present time the beneficent Government of Australia extends a protecting hand to the grower to the extent of granting him 6s. per ton upon his cane. If we abolish the bounty the grower will have no more redress than he has to-day. He will be under the control of the combine, provided that the electors of the Commonwealth do not vest the Government with sufficient power to enter into the business. </para>

                        <para>- I will go with the Prime Minister to the extent of saying that if the growers in public meeting, assembled ask for the abolition of the bounty and the Excise, I do not see how I, as a representative of the people, can refuse to vote for such a proposal. I hold in my hand an account of .the sugar industry in New South Wales. It is headed, &#34;The&#39; Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s new agreement,&#34; &#34; A serious position.&#34; The article deals with the state of affairs which obtained in the Richmond River district two or three years ago. The complaints of the farmers there are those of the growers at the present time. The farmers in the Richmond River district complain of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s refusal to pay them for their cane according to individual analysis. The grower properly says, &#34; I send in 20 tons of cane from high land, and I get no more for it than I do from cane which is grown upon low land.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The growers want to be paid on the sugar contents of their cane, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will not agree to that proposal. At the time of which I speak the growers asked for an agreement with the company to extend beyond the year 1913. As a matter of fact, they desired it to extend till 1 91 6. The company refused to grant them this extended agreement. In my opinion the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the millers are prepared to be very generous at the present time. They talk about paying the farmers 2s. 2d. per ton extra for their cane for every <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> that the Excise is reduced. But I venture to say that they will not give the growers an agreement to that effect over a ten years&#39; term. They will give them an agreement for two or three years until the legislation they desire has been passed, and then the growers will be at their mercy. I wish to bring under the notice of honorable members some of the grievances under which the cane-growers labour - grievances which will not be remedied by the abolition of the bounty and the Excise. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> a farmer in the Isis district, speaking at a cane- growers&#39; conference which was held at Bundaberg in 1909, said - </para>

                        <para>- The growers&#39; position is pretty bad, it is true, but sometimes it is necessary for people to be placed in an awkward position before the public will take any interest in their case. If the cane-growers are compelled to pay a higher rate of wages before they can secure the bounty, honorable members opposite may possibly endeavour to compel the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the big millers to give the growers a sufficient price for their cane to enable them to pay that rate. I know that this Bill will not help the growers to pay increased wages. We have endeavoured to help the growers. Last year we asked for power to legislate to assist the cane-growers, but the Leader of the Opposition, the  Deputy  Leader, and all their followers, although professing to desire power to legislate for the control of monopolies, went through Australia urging the people to vote &#34; No &#34; to the referenda questions, and thus the Commonwealth failed to acquire the power to help the sugar-growers. If next year the people are again induced to vote against the Labour party&#39;s proposals, the sugar-growers must remain in the position in which they are to-day. </para>

                        <para>- The cane-growers of Queensland and New South Wales desire that the Commonwealth shall fix the prices to be paid for cane. I know that this will be difficult. The British Parliament has not attempted for hundreds of years to fix prices, public opinion having turned against that course. But we shall have to revert to it again before we can relieve the community from some of the exactions of the big combines. The cane-growers in public meeting assembled in the Bundaberg district, unanimously determined that no redress could be obtained until this Parliament, or a tribunal appointed by it, had fixed the prices for cane. The meeting declared that this could be done, because the sugar contents of cane can be determined with the same exactitude as the butter contents of milk. That is what is in my mind. The Constitution does not at present allow us to do what they ask. Next year the people will be again appealed to for an extension of power. I hope that those who sympathize with the cane-growers will feel that they cannot urge the people not to grant this extension. I admit that some of the members of the Opposition are much interested in the primary producer, and I ask them to notice that as soon as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company got control of the Australian market it began to give up the growing of sugar-cane. </para>

                    <para>. - We have had an interesting discussion on this question, and the speech just delivered by the honorable member for Capricornia has made things much clearer than they were. I know now just where he stands regarding the sugar industry. Apparently he desires that the Bill shall be carried, so that the cane-growers may be compelled to pay their employes higher wages; and with some ingenuity he tried to make it appear that this will eventually put more money into their pockets. He argued that if the grower has to pay higher wages to his men, it will make him look about for some way of getting rid of the burden which the measure will impose on him. I hope that the grower will relish the argument. The proposal of the honorable member is to put an extra impost on the grower, so that he must kick, and thus better his condition. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The honorable member also said that power was needed by this Parliament to fix the prices to be paid to the grower for his cane. He admits that the system of fixing prices broke down centuries ago, when civilization was at a much simpler stage. Seeing that the system broke down then of its own sheer weight, how can it succeed under the infinitely complex conditions of modern times? Honorable members opposite are heading back to a point from which we have progressed slowly and laboriously during several centuries. He wishes us to return to conditions from which  we  have escaped only by continuous efforts, extending over a very long time. The experiment which he proposes cannot again be tried under the simple conditions of the Middle Ages. It is true that there is now more machinery at our command, and that we have greater experience, but, on the other hand, society is a much more complex thing than it was in the days of old. I do not think it is at all likely that we shall revert to the old position. Matters are now too complex to allow the application of a proposal such as that of the honorable member for determining the proportions of the value of a product that shall go to all the persons engaged in producing it. </para>

                        <para>- It means this if it means anything - that the Government will not under any circumstances allow the grower to get a bit out of what they are doing. Here is a chance for him to get something, and the Government say, &#34; No, the grower must wait.&#34; In the meantime, they compel him to pay these extra rates to the workmen. Equity demands of us that while the worker is to get a full share - it is quite right that he should - we should also consider the man who they say is equally a victim with the worker. From that point of view, is it not right that he should get a little as well? </para>

                        <para>- A fair thing quite so; and I say that the grower is as much entitled to a fair thing as the man who is to get extra for his work. But he is to have less remaining in his pocket as a consequence of this measure. I suppose that that is a fair statement of the case. Or is the grower by some magical process to get more into his pocket the more he pays out? I suppose that for every penny the Minister proposes to give to the working man, the grower of the cane, who has to pay him, is going to have so much less in his pocket. </para>

                        <para>- The facts are as I have put them. Whatever extra the worker is to get out of this edict of the Minister has to come out of the grower&#39;s pocket. Here we have a. proposal to compensate the grower also. The Leader of the Opposition urges that if this amendment be carried, and the bounty and Excise abolished, and if a local tribunal be set up to insure that the men receive fair rates of wages, both parties will benefit, instead of only one. So that the amendment aims at giving the man who has to cultivate what it is fair for him to get according to the decision of a competent Court, with whom the matter will rest, whilst at the same time it will insure that the man who has to pay the extra money will in turn get a little for himself as well, so long as the duties remain. Those, however, who oppose the amendment, as the Government are going to do, are simply saying in so many words : &#39; &#39; You growers must pay, but you shall get no benefit for yourselves.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member knows everything about the subject will he allow me to address a few words to those who do not profess to know everything? The more speeches I have heard from the Ministerial side the more I am convinced that the case is as I have put it, that whilst the Minister is proposing to make the grower pay more to the man who does the cultivating, he will not give any relief to the grower himself. The honorable member for Gwydir asks why the Sugar Company does not pay the grower more. The Sugar Company say that they will if the Excise and bounty be abolished. But the Government say that they shall not be abolished. Therefore, the grower can get no more either from the refiners or anybody else. It is abundantly clear from what we have heard this afternoon that the grower is the man who is to foot the bill, and the Government resolutely decline, by opposing this amendment, to give him an atom of the relief which he otherwise would get. What the Minister is going to do both by this Bill and by his regulation, edict, decision, fiat, or whatever it may be termed, is unconstitutional. A better authority than any which the Government can command - - and that is said in no disrespectful way, because it is recognised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell</inline> is one of the leading barristers of the Commonwealth, in the very front rank of them all - says that the Government cannot do this thing. Yet the Minister will take this devious and doubtful way when there is a straight way to the same goal. In the interests of the working man himself, by whom my honorable friends are desirous of doing a fair thing, they should accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. It may turn out that this suggestion is the surest way to justice. Abolish the bounty and Excise, and- </para>

                        <para>- I said that, as far as I could see, it ought not to take us very long to deal with it. I shall argue this question no further. Honorable members opposite must take the responsibility for their own action. They will find in the sequel, so far as I can see, that they will be no nearer the solution of their difficulties. They are embarking on a measure of doubtful constitutionality. Indeed, there is no doubt of that in -the minds of those best able to judge. If that be so, the Government will simply lead the workers once more into some piece of tomfoolery, and then they will say, &#34; We would have done what was necessary in your interests but for the High Court.&#34; The workers, if they are wise, should say to the Government, &#34; The trouble is due, not to the High Court, but to -your foolishness in not carrying through an agreement which would have given us positive relief of a definite character in the speediest possible time.&#34; That is how I view&#39; trie situation, and if I were Leader of the Opposition I should not press this matter further: The responsibility is with the Government, and I submit that, in the end, it will be found that they are again embarking on a doubtful, devious course when there is a plain and straight course before them. </para>

                        <para>- The debate on the second reading of this Bill opened last Thursday, and there was an idea that the Bill would be easily disposed of last night. It was not. As soon as we met to-day, an honorable member of the Opposition moved the adjournment of the House to discuss another question, and here we are, with another day gone, still dealing with the Bill. I hope that the Prime Minister will take every means, short of using the &#34; gag,&#34; to insure the speedier transaction of business this session. It is unfortunate that the honorable member for Parramatta did not acquaint himself with the facts of the case before addressing himself to this question. Had he done so, he could not possibly have said what he did. </para>

                            request concerned the construction of the central mills proposed to be erected by the Queensland Government only to the extent that the growers feared that under the new regulation fixing a higher rate of wages they might not be able to successfully grow cane. It was thought that they might not be disposed to produce such a quantity as would make the mills a success, and, that being so, the Queensland Government decided to find out the actual position before committing themselves to an expenditure of about&#163;350,000. The Prime Minister offered the suggestion - which was quite consistent with his attitude all along the line - that, provided an absolute guarantee were given that coloured labour would be excluded from the sugar industry, the abolition of the Excise and bounty could easily follow, and the sugar industry could be placed on the same level as other protected industries. He added that if the Queensland Government introduced arid passed a Bill abolishing coloured labour in the sugar industry, he would influence his colleagues and his party to agree to pass next session a Bill for the abolition of the Excise and bounty. The honorable member for Parramatta has overlooked the fact that the promise given was that such a Bill would he introduced next session. It was with considerable pleasure that we learned that

                            had promptly written agreeing to the suggestion, adding also that his Government thought there was no need to wait until next session, but that an Excise and Bounty Repeal Bill might be introduced this session. I am prepared to say that if the Queensland Government will pass a Bill to abolish coloured labour,

                        <para>- It will be seen, therefore, that there will be no necessity for the Minister to refer the matter to the Arbitration Court, and thus delay an award, when one can be secured earlier from the Industrial Courts of Queensland. But, again, I am prepared to say that any award under the local Industrial Courts will not be so satisfactory as leading to the settlement we all desire as an award of the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>- It is not an exception. We have the further fact that in the early part of last year there was a strike in the sugar districts of Queensland. The sugar season starts usually in July, but as early as February the workers approached the employers and asked for a conference to discuss wages and conditions for the forthcoming season; and the strike that occurred was solely and entirely due to the employers&#39; absolute refusal to meet in conference, or to refer the question to any outside tribunal. The men were asking for a wage of  30s.  a week and keep, equal to something like  &#163;2 2s.  6d. ; and, as I said in Cairns last year, I was amazed at the modesty of their demands. It utterly surprises me to fmd that white men are content to work for  &#163;2 2s.  6d. a week, especially in the tropical parts of Australia. The honorable member for Parramatta sought to cast some ridicule on the statement of the honorable member for Capricornia in reference to asking the grower to pay those wages without offering him any compensation. The question of bow the manufacturer or employer has to find the extra money to pay the wages is not under consideration; our first consideration must always be what is sufficient to enable the worker to lead a decent and comfortable life. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta ridiculed the statement of the honorable member for Capricornia, and said that it was sought to consider the worker without giving any consideration to the grower. It is somewhat amusing to find honorable members opposite expressing unbounded concern for the grower. There is no one whom the members of the Labour party are more anxious to help than the sugar-grower, because we realize that he is heavily handicapped in his endeavour to treat his workers decently owing to the fact that he himself is not being treated decently by those above him. We are accustomed, in speaking of the sugar industry, to divide those interested in this industry into workers, growers, millers, refiners, and, finally, the public. But it would be much fairer to separate them into three classes, namely, the workers, the growers and the crushers; for it is very certain that the millers and refiners not only undertake to crush cane, but also, and very successfully, to crush the growers and the workers. I have intense sympathy for the sugar-grower of Queensland, who knows that the workmen are entitled to fair wages, but who has found out, not only that he cannot afford to pay those wages, but that the only difficulty is that a company, or a combination of companies, is securing all the &#34; sugar&#34; and leaving them little to work on. Some of the small workers are handicapped by mortgages, heavy interest charges and an increasing wages bill, and their only hope of redress is to join forces with the workers against the crushers. I hope the time is not far distant when they will join with the workers and give this Parliament the power to deal with the men above them, who are not giving them the share of the benefits of the industry to which they are justly entitled. Honorable members should not forget that the proposal now before us did not succeed, but was antecedent to, the suggestion made in regard to the abolition of the Excise and bounty in the sugar industry. Some honorable members have argued, as the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> did this morning, that this Bill was brought down since the proposal was made for the abolition of the Excise and bounty, and the imposition of a Customs duty solely as a protection for the industry. I remind them that the Minister stated, in introducing the Bill last Thursday, that this proposal had already been under consideration. We know that we have been told by every deputation, and in every speech, that the sugar industry cannot afford to pay the wages suggested by the Minister of Trade and Customs. I wish honorable members to remember that whenever a suggestion has been made for an increase of wages and an improvement of the conditions of the workers in the industry the same opposition has been shown, and the same arguments used. I have here a copy of the official report of a deputation that waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs in May, 1908. On that deputation was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> H. Pritchard, secretary of the Australian Sugar Producers Association. Honorable members will have remarked the significant fact that this gentleman has been haunting the precincts of this House during the last week, and they must have noticed that the honorable members for Richmond and Moreton have found occasion to consult with him during the course of this debate. </para>

There is another significant fact in connexion with this deputation. It has been argued that the present Minister of Trade and Customs has no power to make the regulations that he has issued. The same question was raised by the deputation to which I have referred, and, amongst other things, they said - </para>

                    <para>We protest against your action, because it was not intended by the Bounty Act of 1905 that the Minister should at will vary the rates payable in the sugar districts. We say there is no legal authority for him to do so. </para>

                <para class="block">That argument is repeated to-day. It was met by the then Minister of Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austin</inline> Chapman, by reading to the deputation section 9 of the Sugar Bounty Act of 1905, as follows : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Every grower of white-grown sugar who claims the bounty payable under this Act shall, in making such claim, certify .to the Minister the rate of wages paid to any labour employed by him, other than the labour of members of his family, If the Minister finds that such rate of wages is below the standard rate, paid in the district in which the sugar is grown, to similar white labour engaged in that industry, then the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty payable. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">So that the arguments used then are being used again to-day. There is this further significant fact to be borne in mind that the people who then opposed the increased rate of wages suggested, and protested against the Minister varying the regulation regarding wages, or interfering in any degree with the sugar industry, were the same people who, a very few years before, were consistent opponents of white labour, and the friends of coloured labour in the industry. If I had the time, I could quote references to show that, time after time, the senators who were members of the deputation to which I have referred, and the men protesting against the regulation then proposed, were the champions of black labour in the Queensland sugar districts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pritchard,</inline> who represents the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and who has been consulted by members of the Opposition in regard to this Bill, was always the champion of that company, who, in its turn, has always been the champion of coloured labour in the industry. We have been told, over and over again, that the sugar industry could never afford to pay good wages. That&#34; was put forward as a bogy when the White Australia policy was first introduced. It was then said that we should never be able to grow cane with white labour, and it is to the everlasting credit of the Labour party, that, in spite of all these protestations, prophecies of failure, and suggestions of doom and disaster, we have persevered with our White Australia policy, and we stand here to-day as the champions of a White Australia in opposition to those men who desire to have coloured labour again employed in the industry. </para>

                        <para>- What does the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition mean but that if the Excise and bounty be abolished the barriers which at present exclude the introduction of coloured labour will be lowered? It has been suggested that the sugar bounty was granted by this Parliament for the purpose of penalizing the cane-growers who employed black labour. Nothing of the kind. It was given to encourage the production of sugar by white labour. That it penalized the production of &#39;sugar by black labour was merely an incident in its working. We shall have to continue this encouragement of white-grown sugar until every black man in the industry has disappeared. Then we shall be in a position to remove the barriers, but not till then. I rejoice that the Prime Minister has been so emphatic in his declaration that until the Queensland and the New South Wales Parliaments have passed Bills dealing with this matter we shall not remove even one restriction against the production of black-grown sugar in Australia. If to-morrow the Queensland Parliament were to pass a Bill prohibiting the employment of coloured labour in the industry, we have to remember that there would still be a certain amount of sugar production in New South Wales. No doubt the Parliament of that State will pass a similar measure. </para>

                        <para>- And in the meantime the workers would have to take what they could get. Last year, at the instigation of outsiders, and owing to the pressure of public opinion, a conference was held in Queensland which settled the rates of wages to be paid in the sugar industry. But those rates were limited to last season, and every effort which has been made by the workers to secure a conference with a similar object in view this year - outside of districts in which Wages Boards have been established - has been met with an absolute refusal. I believe that if it had not been for the shortage in the crop this year, and for the fact that the season will be a brief one, there would probably have been a recurrence of the trouble which was experienced last year. We must reach finality in this matter. These disturbances are not for the good of the industry </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member was loud in his remarks concerning the maintenance of the White Australia policy. But this Parliament has endeavoured for years to uphold that policy. The Government have attempted to exclude coloured &#39; labour from the sugar industry, and have been successful in reducing its employment to a &#39;minimum. At the present time only about 4 per cent, of the sugar produced in Australia is being grown by black labour. The amendment which is now under consideration affords us an opportunity to absolutely wipe out this class of labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denham,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, has promised to introduce legislation which will insure the industry in that State being carried on under white labour conditions. He is prepared to compensate the growers who employ black labour, and thus effectually to uphold the White Australia policy. The Minister of Trade and Customs, I regret to say, has placed upon the amendment a construction which it was not intended to bear. If he says that he will not take a direction from this Committee upon a simple question, of course, we are unable to force his hand. But for a number of years it has been the practice to take a test vote upon important questions by moving for the omission of some word which might perhaps mean nothing at all. It was for this reason that the Leader of the Opposition proposed the deletion of the word &#34; bounty.&#34; The question at issue is whether the  President  of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court or the Minister shall fix the wages and conditions which shall obtain in the sugar industry. Some doubt has been raised as to whether the cane-growers would secure any benefit from, the abolition of the Excise and the bounty. The honorable member for Capricornia doubts whether they would. The Minister of Trade and Customs has said that, so far, only one offer has been forthcoming to grant the cane-growers the resultant benefit if the Excise and bounty be dispensed with. I hold in my hand copies of telegrams which were sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swayne,</inline> the representative of one of the sugar districts in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, who is also a cane-grower himself. </para>

The honorable member will not trust any one. He quoted from a report furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> to the Commonwealth Government, which has not been printed. I learned for the first time tonight that the honorable member has confidence in and appreciation for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell.</inline></para>

                        <para>- And the honorable member himself suppressed a few things regarding a strike. The honorable member for Capricornia should have given us either more or less information regarding the action of a central mill in refusing to take cane from other mills. He might have mentioned the name of the mill referred to, so that we could know the strength of his statement. I remember distinctly that some two or three years ago, when the Nambour people decided to pay off their liability to the Government, some of the suppliers to that mill asked the Mount Bauple mill to take their cane, and the Government agreed to do so. I approached the State Government on the matter myself, and also the then Minister of Trade arid Customs - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best - and asked him to prevent the cane going from the Nambour mill to Mount Bauple. The Government were then offering to pay the freight on the cane from the Nambour district to Mount Bauple, and were taking away from the people&#39;s mill at Nambour the cane which they needed for the successful running of the mill. </para>

                        <para>- A central mill, under the usual central mill conditions. So was the Nambour mill, until the Nambour people, who had a little more pluck than some of the others, decided to relieve the Government of the responsibility. They have been running it as a co-operative mill since. I quote this to show that at least in one instance there were two mills open to growers. I know that at Nerang the Government refused to take cane for some time, but they are taking it there now. The reason they gave for refusing on that occasion was that the mill was a small one, and they had not sufficient power to crush any more cane&#34;. In fairness to the Queensland Government, the honorable member might have informed the Committee that, in order to have these mills established, the growers have to enter into contracts, and practically hypothecate their farms, to supply a certain quantity of cane. A sugar mill, if not kept going with cane, can not be carted away at short notice, but becomes so much scrap iron. In sugar centres, if the farmers want a mill, it is not only necessary, but it has been the practice in Queensland, for them to guarantee to supply it with cane. Most of the central mills (.are carried on very much on co-operative lines. The expenses are taken out of the proceeds of the cane, and the balance, less depreciation and redemption, is paid to the farmers. There are a few private mills, but that is the general rule, I think, so far as those mills are concerned. The suggestion that the people are being victimized by a monopoly, arid forced to sell their cane where it does not pay them to do it, is not a fair one to make. </para>

                        <para>- I presume there are a number of central mills in the Bundaberg district, and it is necessary to have a zone system so far as the mills are concerned. There is no doubt a benefited area declared before a mill is established, and those who have- farms in it hypothecate them to the Government before the mill is constructed. The time to object to a zone system is before you enter into your compact. After you have entered into it, it is fair to carry it out, and help your fellow farmers by growing cane, as each farmer agreed to do when the establishment of a mill in their midst was asked for. I therefore do not see any objection to the zone system, even as defined by the honorable member for Capricornia. I think the action of the Leader of the Opposition in moving to abolish the Excise and bounty will meet with the approval of the growers of Queensland at any rate, and I believe that the ultimate result, if the amendment were carried, would not be at all detrimental to the wage-earners in the sugar industry. After all, a number of the wage-earners are the small farmers themselves. Particularly in the Moreton district, where they go in for very small areas of cane, the farmers do practically the whole of the work themselves, and so, in my district, they will not be seriously affected. We are quite content to let the bounty and Excise go, if the Minister will agree to the proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Capricornia apparently quite overlooked that I laid the utmost emphasis on the fact that the abolition of coloured labour was secured first, and in no sense affected by, or involved in, the proposal I was submitting. My first condition was that this Bill should not be rejected, but that, if the amendment was carried, it would be an indication to the Government of the desire of those who carried it that the Bill should not be proceeded with until an opportunity had been afforded to the Queensland &#39; Government, and to the New South Wales Government also, to decree the abolition of coloured labour in those States. That would have removed all difficulty. It freed us from the responsibility which the honorable member appeared to consider rested upon us, of providing in some other way for that abolition. It was not suggested that our sugar policy should be adopted until the question of coloured labour had been settled. The honorable member for Brisbane also misapprehended the question, and his references to black labour dangers are met by the same statement. There was no proposal to encourage or permit the restoration of black labour in any form. </para>

It was not intended that the new Act should be brought into operation until that possibility had been excluded. My attention has been called to almost the first speech that I had the honour to deliver in this House, which happened to involve this very question. That speech laid down, in respect to Australia as a whole, and especially for the sugar industry, a continuous reduction of the black labour already in the country, and the absolute exclusion of additions to its numbers. On that issue, therefore, honorable members scarcely need the assurance that they had misapprehended my whole proposal. </para>

                <para>We are greatly indebted to the complete and frank statement of the Prime Minister.  In fact, the greater portion of the motive power of the amendment was diverted by his speech. He frankly admitted that he looked forward to an early abolition of both the Excise and the bounty, which was the principal proposal I contended for. He stated his firm conviction that this would be brought about in a short time. He regards the passage of this measure as merely a temporary expedient, bridging over the interval until the time - possibly not more than a few months, certainly not later than the next session- when he proposes to make that abolition complete. </para>

                <para>The Prime Minister is strongly convinced that the best opportunity of establishing the conditions of employment on a sound foundation is by an appeal to the existing Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I do not agree, nor can I concur with, his opinion that its decision would be arrived at in three months. In the first place, I believe that much more than three months would be necessary to deal with all the issues affecting labour connected with the sugar industry under the new circumstances about to be introduced. In the next place, I cannot but believe that the proposal of the Queensland Government for the creation of Wages Boards, perhaps as Courts of first instance, offers a speedier and better solution of all local difficulties. </para>
                <para>These issues undoubtedly derive a great portion of their complexity from the fact that, whatever the findings adopted, they will need to be applied in very different ways in. the very various parts of the vast State of Queensland. Few of us who have ever visited that State but have been immensely impressed, not only by its great extent, but by the contrasts between the conditions existing in different districts. To adopt a system applicable to the sugar industry as a whole, and yet capable of being adapted to many differing surrounding conditions, is a task which, it seems to me, will certainly not be performed within the time which the Prime Minister was sanguine enough to suggest. But the suggestion that local tribunals should deal with these practical issues, permitting an appeal to the Arbitration Court wherever appeal proves necessary, either to harmonize the different findings or to develop them, would attain the object we have in view in the earliest possible time, and with the least expense. It would also permit a reorganization of the industry throughout Queensland in the speediest possible way, and with the expectation that the solution effected would be more than temporary. It would, at all events, endure until the industry was thoroughly reorganized, or until its conditions were altered either by a higher Court or by legislative action. It will be seen, therefore, that the Prime Minister very nearly approached our desire. The particular points in which we still differ from him were not in regard to the main principle.  His  reference to the appeal to the Arbitration Court showed that the difference between us had become one of method. He urged our acceptance of the measure. Under these circumstances, I withdraw the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  The debate has covered a considerable amount of ground relating to many phases of sugar production. The Bill itself is simply a proposal to empower the Minister of Trade and Customs to call to his aid, in determining what is a fair wage for those employed in the industry, the Arbitration Court. When that wage has been fixed, the Minister is further empowered to regulate the payment of bounty, so that it may be given to those in the industry who pay the wage determined upon as a fair one, and withhold it from those who do not comply with the determination. So far I am in sympathy with the proposal of the Minister, and am prepared to give it my support. But I recognise, as the honorable member for Parramatta does, that this method does not promise a complete solution of the whole trouble affecting the sugar industry. I do not, however, agree with him as to the methods by which he proposes to meet the difficulty. Three sets of interests are mentioned as involved, namely, the interest of those engaged in earning wages, the interest of the growers, and the interest of the refiners. But, apart from those, there is the great interest of the consumers. Whilst we are very properly concerned about the wage-earners, the farmers, and the manufacturers, we should not lose sight of the interests of the great body of people who have to use this product. Sugar enters very largely into general consumption. There are very few for whom it is not one of the necessaries of life. This Parliament some years ago passed legislation imposing a Customs Tariff against outside competition to the extent of &#163;6 per ton on all cane-grown sugar, and &#163;12 per ton on beet sugar, which would otherwise be a serious competitor to cane sugar. That was done in order to bring the industry under White Australia conditions. We also imposed an Excise duty and countered that with a bounty to those engaged in the production of white-grown sugar. The result is that the industry is now practically conducted under white conditions; so much so, that only something like 15,000 or 20,000 tons out of a total production of 226,000 tons are being produced by coloured labour, whereas formerly the major part of the production was by means of black labour. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">We must realize, however, that these increased charges are passed on to the consumer. Moreover, apparently the wage-earner does not get the full benefit from the charge to which he is entitled. Apparently, the cane-grower is in a similar position. In fact, the farmer is in a very unenviable position. He is, so to speak, between the devil and the deep sea. On the one hand, he is met with a demand for increased wages ; and on the other he is pressing against the great sugar refining monopoly. How are we to remedy the difficulty? It seems to me that our regulations and our legislation in this regard can have but slight beneficial effect. We may by this Bill insure fair play for the labourer in the industry. There are in the sugar industry to-day men who assert that 22s. 6d. per week is more than they can afford to pay. They practically demand that, since black labour has been done away with, the industry shall be carried on by white men receiving, practically, black men&#39;s pay. An industry that cannot pay a living wage ought not to be bolstered up or tolerated in this community. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the honorable member is right. The sugar industry is natural to certain parts of Australia; and like any other industry natural to Australia, it can pay a living wage if reasonable opportunities are afforded it. I am not going to blame the farmers, in view of the conditions that beset them, because they feel that they are unable to pay higher wages, and view with considerable alarm legislation of this character. They, like the consumer and the worker, are the victims of a huge monopoly that has grown up here; and until we are able and determined to attack that monopoly and crush its monopolistic power, this problem will not be solved. Until that is done, we shall have in connexion with the primary part of the industry, conditions that will mean sweated wages for the workers, poor returns for the farmers, and exorbitant prices to the consumers. </para>

                <para>The sugar industry in America has been largely monopolized on lines very similar to those operating here. Those who have read Professor Ripley&#39;s learned book dealing with trusts and monopolies in America, will know that a monopoly begins by gradually obtaining control of the particular production in which it is interested. In the United States of America some of the monopolies practically control from 70 to 95 per cent, of the production in which they are operating- As they obtain control, they eliminate competition either by absorbing it or by crushing it out altogether. They . are then able to make their own terms, both with the primary producer and the consumer. As they begin to control the industry in which they are operating,  the prices given for the raw product are put down to the very lowest point, and the prices charged for the manufactured article are raised to the highest. If there is an agitation - if action is taken by the Legislature to investigate the secret operations or the particular monopoly - the first step taken by the monopoly concerned is, according to this learned writer, to obtain the interest and support of the large newspapers. The result is that every effort made to investigate the secret operations of the monopoly is made the subject of adverse criticism by these newspapers, every person who dares to take a hostile stand towards it becomes the target of adverse criticism and misrepresentation. &#39; Even the very Judges of the Courts that are empowered to make such inquiries have their integrity questioned in the press, in the Legislature and on the public platform, if &#39; they honestly set about their work. They are represented as biased and partial, and everything that can be done to discredit them in the proper discharge of their duties is done in this sinister way. If it is found that a Judge can be used by these great trusts, then in the legislative halls, as well as in the press and on public platforms, that man is magnified as a very Solon come to judgment. When the Courts are appealed to, the very best legal talent available is secured by the monopoly affected Enormous expense is apparently incurred by it in maintaining the position it has secured, and at last all opposition is in this way worn down. The expense incurred is ultimately recouped by means of high charges imposed upon the consumers, and by reduced prices paid to the primary producers. That is the history, not of one, but of many trusts in America, and I am afraid that &#39; the infant, trusts that we are rearing in </para>

                <para class="block">As to the sugar monopoly, the Commonwealth, unfortunately, is not clothed with powers sufficient to enable it to deal effectively with it. We are endeavouring to use the powers we have of investigation and so forth, but we have seen how our attempts have been frustrated by an appeal to the technicalities of law, and by a refusal on the part of those in authority to give the necessary information. I am strongly convinced that the only way in which this and other monopolies can be dealt with is to clothe the- Commonwealth with sufficient&#39; power to nationalize the industry and conduct it, not in the interests of a few wealth-making individuals, but for the benefit of the whole of the people. An attempt was made to secure this power last year; and it has been alleged, with what degree of truth I am not prepared to say, that the combine contributed large sums to the fighting fund of those who desired to defeat the referendum. Whatever the cause, the referendum appeal was defeated, and this gives the Colonial Sugar Refining Company the opportunity to carry on its operations and prevent this Parliament and Government from doing anything effective. While this Parliament should exercise all the powers it possesses under the Constitution in order to secure fair wages for the labourers, fair conditions for the farmers who own the land and till it, and reasonable consideration for other interests concerned, it ought not to limit its view merely to those persons, or to the secondary interests of the manufacturer, but bear in mind always the vital interests of the community as represented by the consumer. Until this is done we cannot have all-round justice. I regard this Bill, not as settling the problem, but as a contribution towards the alleviation of some of the harsher features represented by the sweated wages that otherwise would be paid, v </para>

                        <para>- I think it will be found that the growers are strong advocates of the duty, but it is not of that advantage to them that it might be if they had fairer treatment by this great monopoly. I have here a report prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell,</inline> who, as will be admitted by honorable members on all sides, is a competent and careful man with a knowledge of the sugar industry in Australia such as is possessed, perhaps, by no other person. This report, I understand, was prepared at the instance of the previous Government for the purpose of the investigation which it was proposed to institute into the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. </para>

                        <para>- Such an investigation would not be complete unless it embraced the operations of the company. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> makes a comparison of the prices of raw and refined sugars in Great Britain, New York, and in Australia, and quotes his authorities for his figures, which, I think, will be accepted as reasonably correct. The following is the extract from the report :  - </para>

                <para class="block">These figures show one direction in which this company makes very heavy charges for the work it does. This cable shows an increase of &#163;2 10s. 7d. on British, and &#163;2 3s. 6d. on American margins between &#34; raws &#34; and &#34; refined &#34; prices, charged to the Australian people. I do not propose at this stage to go into the history of the company, and to show how it has piled up profits until it has been hard pressed to dispose of them in the way of dividends. This difficulty has been met by issuing new shares at a nominal figure, and limiting those shares to the present shareholders. In some cases free gifts of shares, which in the open market were selling at from&#163;37 to &#163;39 10s. each, have been made to existing shareholders. All these different methods have been adopted by this company to dispose of the large profits it has made from its operations and the monopoly it enjoys. In addition, it is well known that the company will dispose of its sugar in the outside market, competing with the conditions obtaining there at a very much lower rate than it demands for sugar in Australia. So that the company charges the general consumer in the Australian market, which has been protected for it, from&#163;4 to &#163;6 per ton more than it is prepared to sell its sugar for to consumers in other places. At the present time the New Zealand Government are investigating charges against the company of violating legislation against trusts in that Dominion. These charges are to the effect that an agreement had been entered into between the company and a certain combination of merchants under which the company sells to the merchants in the combination at a lower rate than to those who are not in the combine. Before the trouble in this industry can be removed, and even-handed justice done to all the interests concerned, we must have some means of dealing with the operations of this great octopus, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Until we can do so every effort to secure fair treatment to the workers and farmers in the industry must fail. </para>
                <para>I supported the granting of the sugar bounty on the understanding that the community would receive its recompense in the elimination of the black labour element, which so largely entered into the production of sugar, and in the fact that the white labour employed would receive fair play and good conditions, and that the farmers engaged in the industry would receive a fair return for their money and labour. If this industry is to continue to be carried on in tropical districts at a sweated wage of  22s.  6d. per week, which some growers claim is all that the industry can pay ; if the farmers paying these sweated wages are to receive only a small return for their cane; and if, at the same time, a rich company like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is to monopolize the Australian market, and bleed the consumers white, that is a state of affairs which will never appeal to me. I believe that a remedy can be found by converting this monopoly into a &#39; national undertaking in the interests of the people. If that cannot be done I shall not rest content with the existing order of things, and if there be no other remedy suggested I shall be ready and willing to adopt the remedy of abolishing the bounty, the Excise, and the Customs duty, and let the industry stand the competition of an open market. </para>
