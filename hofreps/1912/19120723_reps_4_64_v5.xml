                    <para>I have the honour to point out that my figures with respect to the Gold Reserve on 14th November last have again been incorrectly printed.

                        <para>. - I make no apology for the form in which I have introduced this matter to the House. The importance of the undertaking of constructing the trans-Australian railway is patent to every honorable member, as is also the importance of securing for that work ability of the very highest character. I am bringing forward this question at the earliest moment, because it was not until a previous debate had come to an. end that it was possible to refer to the papers. I think I shall be able to show from those papers the existence of a most astounding state of affairs. Let me refer, first of all, to the application made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> to the Minister of Home Affairs, and dated from Perth, 20th June, 19 11 - </para>

                        <para>For upwards of twenty-five years I have been engaged as contractor&#39;s engineer on the construction of railways in almost all the different States of the Commonwealth ; and consequently have gained, by practical experience, the versatility demanded of an engineer, where saving in cost of construction and the making of profits are the chief consideration of a railway contractor. </para>
                        <para>My wide knowledge of the State of Western Australia, and its timber forests, and railways, would, I venture to think, be of great service from a business point of view, particularly where the supply of sleepers for this line is concerned, an item in itself that can be made the means of saving a huge sum of money to the Government, if managed by one as conversant with the detail of this industry as myself. Indeed, I might venture to suggest that steps should be taken in this direction without delay, for it has already been hinted that private enterprise is about to make a move towards obtaining a concession over vast areas of timber, reported upon by me some five years ago, and which would be of inestimable value to the Commonwealth Government if secured by them. </para>
                        <para>It might not be out of place here to make reference to the negotiations that have been recently conducted between your Government and myself regarding rail welding operations on the above railway, with the hope that full consideration will be given to my invention before anything definite is done by way of ordering supplies of rails and fastenings. </para>
                        <para>The accompanying testimonials, it will be observed, are some of those sent by me in support of my recent application for the position of Railway Commissioner in Tasmania, when, out of thirty-eight applications received from all parts, I was, I am informed, second to the successful applicant. </para>

                <para>That letter calls for one or two observations. There is a reference by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> to his experience of twenty-five years as a contractor&#39;s engineer in the construction of railways in almost all the different States of the Commonwealth. Although this gentleman has so remarkable a record in connexion with railway construction in almost all parts of the Commonwealth, according to his own statement, not a single indication of it appears in the whole of this file of papers. There is not a single proof that he was ever engaged in any of the work which he indicates in so general a fashion. </para>

                        <para>- No. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> goes on to speak of his wide knowledge of the State of Western Australia, but it can only be a knowledge derived from not more than seven or eight years&#39; experience at the very most. Again, I wish to know where he has indicated the nature of the knowledge he boasts of in this general fashion. He speaks of a report on the timber areas of Western Australia. We all know that there are large and valuable timber areas in that State. Although I have made a considerable number of inquiries during the time at my disposal, I have found no evidence that such a report as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> claims to have made is in existence. </para>

                            <para>- It is for the Government to produce it. The reference to this report is a rather important feature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> application, and I call upon the Government to say something about this remarkable report, which the author of it appears to regard as of very considerable value. He speaks also of a rail-welding invention, which he refers to as &#34;my invention.&#34; Here, again, I find nothing more in all these papers than this very passing reference to such an invention. I inquired also into this matter, and I found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> certainly made an application some few years ago for a patent in connexion with the welding of rails or metals generally, but that that application was withdrawn. I found further that in the Equity Court in Sydney on 20th October, 1910, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Street found that this alleged invention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Chinn was an infringement of an existing patent. So that his claim in connexion with an invention that he says would be of very considerable use and advantage in connexion with the construction of the transcontinental railway is shown to have no foundation beyond what may be in his own imagination. 1 do not wish for a moment to say that this gentleman has no testimonials at all. He has undoubtedly a considerable number of testimonials of a kind, and I intend to place them on record. There is a sort of appendix to his application, containing a number of testimonials sent to him by several leading citizens of Western Australia. They are of a general character, and most of the writers of them speak, I think, from hearsay. I have made inquiries from several of those who signed these testimonials, and they have explained that they were given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> in connexion with an application he made for employment on the Tasmanian railways. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, as Commissioner of Railways. He always aims pretty high apparently. These testimonials have been put in in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> application for employment on the transcontinental railway without consultation with, and without the consent of, those who wrote them for another application altogether. I take it that in the circumstances they will be regarded as entirely out of court, and consequently I do not intend to deal with them further. I admit that they are entirely harmless, but I wish to deal with other testimonials that are not harmless, but are highly objectionable, and should be placed upon record in connexion with the history of the present Government. I shall take them in the order in which they appear on the file. The first is from the Attorney-General&#39;s Office, Perth, and is dated 6th November, 191 1. It is addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in these terms - </para>

                    <para>The announcement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> whose most eminent achievement to date is the inditing of long blatant screeds to Hackett&#39;s organ, or any other accommodating journal, has been appointed to supervise the construction of the West Australian section of the transcontinental railway, will be received with amazement, not to say disgust, by every person in the country who. has any conception of the work and the man. Personally, we regard the result with fear and trembling. Such a great work, involving a maximum perfection of construction in a minimum of time, demands the brains of a masterful engineer, and we do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is master of anything but an interminable flow of language that does not conceal any thought. </para>
                    <para>Usually too much &#34; chin &#34; music disqualifies any man for an important post, but this Chinn seems to have made music that has caught the ear of King O&#39;Malley or some other person of authority near the Labour throne. We understand that the Premier of Western Australia and his colleague, the Minister for Railways, were guilty of the indiscretion of recommending; </para>
                    <para>Chinn to the Commonwealth Cabinet, who personally cannot know very much about the flatulent ink-waster. It has been suggested that the local Ministers did so in order to get rid of an importunate pest. If that is the case, they did a very bad turn to the Commonwealth, and should warn Prime Minister Fisher of the enormous responsibility he has incurred in permitting this astounding appointment. </para>
                    <para>What has Chinn ever done to justify his selection for such an important position ? We don&#39;t know. He tried to get the construction of the Hopetoun-Ravensthorpe railway stopped while the work was in progress. He got an appointment with Messrs. Smith and Timms, the well-known railway contractors, and shortly afterwards the partners had such an acute quarrel over him that they separated, but came together again, and Chinn had to resume his former occupation of writing to the papers.&#34; He wrote numerous letters to the defunct <inline font-style="italic">Morning Herald</inline> - letters that were &#34;agin the Government&#34; - and, maybe, this is why the State Labour Premier foisted Chinn on to the Federal Labour Government, and why the latter were induced to select him. </para>
                    <para>But it is not fair to the transcontinental railway it is not fair to common sense ; and it is not fair to the many able engineers who never had an opportunity to apply. That is one of the peculiar features of this fishy business - no applications were called. The matter was fixed up in the dark, and nothing was known about it until Chinn&#39;s senseless and objectionable appointment leaked out like a surreptitious fact that the principals were ashamed of. The whole thing can only be regarded as a job, a sop for a yapping Cerberus, the reward of a political helot. </para>
                    <para class="block">That appeared before any public intimation was made to the Minister that these positions were open. </para>

                            <para>- It appears, later, that the Minister had gone rather too far in making this appointment. He had not the power to act in the fashion in which he proposed at first, and accordingly we find the position modified. We find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is only appointed temporarily, and, instead of being supervising engineer, he is instructed that he is only to do certain preliminary work, and the Public Service Commissioner is approached, and permission is obtained for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> to be placed on the temporary list. Of course, he gets&#163;750 a year, the same as the others. There is no question but that the intention of the Minister was to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> to supervise the construction of the line as an engineer, and that as long as it was in process of construction he was to be there in that capacity. Now, strangely enough, an advertisement appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of the 24th February, that is, weeks after the appointment had been made. It reads as follows :  - </para>

It may be said that only one Minister is responsible for this particular matter. </para>

I have information from Western Australia that the statement is absolutely incorrect. I also want to know from the Minister whether he made any inquiries in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> general character. In connexion with an important position of this kind, the character of a man counts for something. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will give us very satisfactory proofs that he has made inquiries regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> character, and that the replies are of a thoroughly satisfactory nature in all respects. I have no hesitation whatever in. saying that the man is totally unfit to occupy this position. I do not find from any paper in this file that the Minister and the Government behind him have satisfied themselves as to his ability, or capacity, or character. They appointed him solely and entirely on the strength of the letter sent to the Minister of Home Affairs by Labour supporters in Western Australia claiming their consideration for the man, because he had done good . service for them at the last election in the State. Surely that of itself was sufficient to condemn the whole thing ! Surely that  is sufficient to justify me in bringing the matter forward in this way ! This is an action which the Government cannot justify. Putting it as mildly as I can, and not going beyond the limits of parliamentary language, it is an ugly and a discreditable transaction. I charge it, not alone on the Minister, but on the Government, and every member of the party that sits behind the Government in this House. </para>

                            <para>- For the last two or three weeks the Pawnee maiden and the chief of the  Chilkat  tribe - the right honorable member for Swan - have been travelling round together, like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and one has been pointing with pride to the other as one who  was going to do great service to the new tribe; but, after all, what has been produced? A miserable, sulky, paralytic, one-legged, one-eyed muck-worm - a hybrid without pride of ancestry or hope of posterity - a cross between a city guinea-pig and a country blowfly. I ask my right honorable friend, the Prime Minister, if he will give a bonus to this kid? I do not believe he will. This slandering of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is one of the most shameful things that ever happened in the House. It is most shameful that an honorable member should come down and challenge the Government - should malign the character of an innocent man, who cannot come here to defend himself, and, by innuendo and all sorts of suggestion, seek to deprive him of his method and means of making a living. Two years ago, at the close of the last Parliament, the Opposition had sixty-seven members - forty-six in this House and twenty-one in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>I have known you for many years, and am confident that, should the  Tasmanian  Government secure your services, they will have a gentleman who possesses the most intimate knowledge of railway management. It is well within my memory, when our Western Australian railway system had drifted into a state of chaos, and was actually a non-paying concern, owing to the system of reform which you so generously gave to this country through your criticism in the public press of this State, and which reforms were adopted by the Government, I have no hesitation in stating that it was the direct means of making our railways a most paying and profitable proposition, and saved the country at least  &#163;100,000  per annum. The people of this State are deeply indebted to you for the amount of detailed information you placed at their disposal, and which was so profitably used. I sincerely trust that, in the interests of the Tasmanian railways, you will be appointed. </para>

                    <para>That is a letter of the Honorable W.  J.  Butcher, of Western Australia, an absolute Tory. Should a Railway Commissioner know less than the man who builds the railway? Australian Governments have been brought into disrepute because men have been employed on railways who know nothing of the business. Then, is the Honorable M. 0L. Moss, exAttorneyGeneral of Western Australia, a Labour man? </para>

                        <para>It is now some thirty years since I first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance, and during that time you have been closely identified with railway construction and management. If proof of your knowledge were required, it will be amply shown in the letters which you contributed to the public press of this State some four years ago, when the railway management was severely criticised. Your experience and knowledge was amply borne out by the high  eulogiums  passed upon you by the various members of both Houses of Parliament. I know of no other person more qualified than you are 10 hold the position for which you have applied, and if your application be successful, the Government of Tasmania may be congratulated on their selection. </para>

                        <para>I feel it incumbent on me, as one who took a prominent part in the discussion in Parliament on the management of our railways, to place on record the very valuable services you rendered to this State by your detailed reports on the working of the system. These reports came at a time when little or no profits were being derived from the railways, and showed most conclusively that with proper management a handsome net return would accrue to the State. Subsequent events have verified in every way your contentions, for the net profits in the. past three years have reached the enormous figure of ^438,000, whilst the working expenses have been reduced in a similar ratio. </para>
                        <para>There can be no doubt that the vast knowledge displayed by you was the main factor in bringing about the desired alteration in the man,agement, and I am sure the greatest credit is due to you for the valuable services you rendered to Parliament and the public in ventilating the matter. </para>
                        <para>I am confident that if the Tasmanian Government realize the value of your services as we do here, there will be no hesitation on their part to appoint you as their Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>He is a man of strong personality, and has conclusively proved that he thoroughly understands the business of railway management. Just about the time the Railway Department of this State had got into a most chaotic state, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> undertook the task of showing how bad matters really were, and how they could be put right.  His  articles in the press, extending over a large period, evidenced his grasp of the detail and intricacies of the business, and met with the success they deserved, for, on his reforms being adopted by the Government, the railways at once became a profit-earner to a degree hitherto unknown in their history. </para>

Do you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I had a little doubt in my mind when I read all these testimonials from members of the party opposite. It put a bit of fear into me. I thought, &#34; Is this man so able as they say he* is?&#34; I was willing to test him, but I always have some doubt when a man is recommended from the other side, because I know that my honorable friends are not business men.

I say from my own experience that whenever a man departs from the boodleier&#39;s class they follow him to the grave, and expectorate on him before the earth is covered over him. There is no hope for a man, unless he be rich, who leaves that side. They would murder him. They are like the Camoora and the Mafia associations in their vindictiveness. </para>

                            <para>- I am the responsible man ; it is not the Opposition who are responsible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hardman</inline> spent $100,000,000 to shorten a line from Chicago to San Francisco by 40 or 50 miles. We were asked to build this&#39; line on a survey which was all right at the time it was made, but which, in my opinion, &#39;can never stand, as it was never fit to build a road on. </para>

                                is in Melbourne. Honorable members had a flying survey made. I have no objection to that. I could have started on that survey, and created a big town, but I stopped that. Already we have saved hundreds of thousands of pounds to the people.

Under no circumstances shall we allow the Opposition to dictate &#39;to us how this road shall or shall not be run. We are going to build it. The Opposition did not do anything but talk.

                        <para>. - I think that we may all congratulate ourselves that the painful exhibition just witnessed is over. The letters which the Minister has read were from very reputable people in Perth, but they all relate to an application for appointment to the position of Commissioner of Railways in Tasmania. It appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> wrote for the Western Australian press some articles on railway management, and so impressed many prominent persons there that they wrote letters saying that his articles had done an immense amount of good, and expressed the hope that he would get the position for which he was applying. We are all, from time to time, asked to give testimonials, and we comply with these requests, sometimes reluctantly, and at other times with pleasure. </para>

                            <para>- Well, he was appointed to manage, not to construct. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davies,</inline> who was imported from England by the Government of Western Australia to manage, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> who went from Western Australia to Tasmania, were not engineers. All these gentlemen were appointed because of their business capacity, and the letters read by the Minister have relation to an application for a managing, not an engineering, position. The writers had no knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> qualifications as an engineer, not possessing engineering experience themselves. Not one of them would have vouched for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> qualifications as a railway constructing engineer. It is not very pleasant to have to deal with these personal matters, but the charge brought against the Minister and the Government is a grave one, and, in my opinion, well founded. The proposed railway will exceed 1,000 miles in length, and is the greatest project of the kind yet entered on in Australia. In the expenditure of the immense sum which it will cost, we should have the advice and the assistance of the best ability and experience obtainable. Does any one say that there has been any evidence whatever produced of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> knowledge and capacity which would prove that he was the best man obtainable for the position? </para>

                            <para>- Notwithstanding that the Minister may be a great man, I say that he is not competent to judge of the fitness of a person applying for a professional position as an engineer to control railway construction, because he does not possess professional qualifications. All over the world when the services of a man of particular fitness are required, recommendations are sought from persons qualified to judge of his professional abilities. Has not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> been forced on the country by the Minister of Home Affairs? It is clear that the Minister did not wait for a recommendation from the head of his engineering department. In a minute dealing with the names of five applicants, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> wrote that he would certainly recommend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#39;</inline> Saunders for the Port Augusta end, and added that &#34; the Minister has already expressed his intention of appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Chinn at the Kalgoorlie end.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> did not say that he recommended <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> appointment. It is clear that the appointment was made, not on the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> but by the Minister himself, off his own bat. It is all very well for the Minister to say, &#34;I am Minister of Home Affairs, and I am going to do this or that;&#34; but we have to remember that this work is to be carried out, not at his expense, but with the money of the people. I have no desire to injure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> - I do not know him, and never heard of him before - nor do I desire to injure any one else. But in common with honorable members generally, I have a duty to perform. It is my duty to see that this great railway project is not injured by men like the Minister of Home Affairs, who will make appointments of this character for political or other purposes without being supported by the recommendation of any authority who has knowledge of the subject. In placing this great work in the hands of incompetent persons, or any save those who are most capable, the Minister is doing a great wrong, both to the project itself, and to the people of Australia. I am surprised that the Postmaster-General, who, I believe, has an acute mind, and is desirous of doing right, should allow the work to be injured in the way that it is being injured. He is very much interested, as the representative of Kalgoorlie, in the construction of this railway, and I am surprised that he should allow its success to be jeopardized by the appointment of an incompetent person. The work will not only be delayed very seriously, but will cost a great deal more than it would under competent management. </para>

                            <para>- It is very wrong to appoint a man solely because he is a Labour sympathizer. The papers do not show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .Chinn</inline> was recommended by any engineering authority by whom he had been employed. I am also surprised that the Prime Minister should allow his Government to be compromised, and the work to be prejudiced in this way. Surely there are in Australia men of undoubted repute and standing who should have been appointed to discharge these important duties. Surely it would be better to appoint such men than to employ people of whom we know nothing, and for whom no one has a good word to say. Nearly a year ago, when I expressed the hope that this railway would be constructed within three years, the Minister of Home Affairs said that it would be completed in less time than that. Does he still hold that view ? </para>

                            <para>- Those who inquire into the question must come to the conclusion that what led up to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> appointment was, not the letters of the gentlemen whom the Minister found it necessary to quote this afternoon in regard to his qualifications for managing the railways of Tasmania - gentlemen of the class whom he is always denouncing as having no business knowledge, as &#34;boodleiers,&#34; and whom he describes in other offensive ways - but the letters written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walker,</inline> members of the Western Australian Government, stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> had rendered valuable assistance to the Labour party in that State. One can well imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> inquiring of the Minister, &#34;What are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> qualifications? What  are his recommendations ? &#34; If such an inquiry were made of him, no doubt he replied in the words used by him in this House a few days ago, &#34; What -is the use of references? I have none, and I am Minister of Home Affairs. I am an American.&#34; I wish that he had stayed in America. He might have done some good there. He certainly has done&#39; none here. It must be clear to any one reading the official papers that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> did not favour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> appointment. I challenge the Minister to deny that statement. My knowledge of this case has been obtained only from a perusal of the papers, and from them it is clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> not only did not favour the appointment, but had good reasons for not wanting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> to be appointed. To start with, he was unknown to him, and he had no testimonial from an engineering authority. Further than that, he had never given any satisfaction wherever he had been employed. </para>

                        <para>-- After the two vigorous speeches to which we have just listened, I think it would not be out of place to endeavour to introduce into the scene of our deliberations a slightly calmer atmosphere. The attitude of the honorable member for Perth and the right honorable member for Swan has occasioned me considerable surprise in view of the fact that they repeatedly complained in this House that Western Australians have not been considered as eligible for appointments to Federal positions as are persons from other States. That has been a frequent, and, to some extent, a justifiable complaint on their part. Ye.t now that a Western Australian has been appointed to do Federal work in Western Australia, there is an immediate outcry on their part. </para>

                            <para>- What I do know is that this appointment has been seized upon in a discreditable manner by certain politicians and certain newspapers. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> for instance, was&#39; quite hysterical in its exaggeration, making a mountain out of a molehill. It may be that there has been some little irregularity in this case, but I am sure that it was no greater than has been the case in connexion with many appointments that have been made by various other Governments, and concerning which nothing whatever has been said. It has been stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> has not produced any testimonials from persons by whom he was employed. </para>

                            <para>- We have such truly representative gentlemen saying, not merely that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> would make a good manager of railways : but, and this is the important point, that he had experience in the construction of railways also. It is said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was appointed because he is a Labour man and for political services. I happen to be in a position to give that statement a flat denial. I may here say that I cannot understand how private and confidential letters have found their way on to a file of this kind. The writers of the letters to which I refer wrote only from their own personal point of view, and not on behalf of the Labour party in Western Australia. I am in a position to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> did not render any material service to the Labour party at the last elections. </para>

                            <para>- That was not the reason. Their position was that, as they knew nothing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> professional qualifications, they did not intend to interfere in the matter at all. I remind honorable members that the letter written by the secretary to the Trades Hall was apparently written in  His  private capacity. I think that there has been made a great storm about a very trifling matter. I know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> and although he may not have high professional attainments, many men who have not such attainments are very successful in practical life. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is a man who understands how to deal with men, and the right honorable member for Swan is aware that one of the chief requirements in the construction of a railway is a man who is able to hold his own amongst men, and see that they do what is right. I have no hesitation in saying that I think the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Chinn a suitable one, and I conclude with the statement that if I had been in the position of the Minister of Home Affairs, and had before me the testimonials of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> with my personal knowledge of him, I also should have given him the appointment. </para>

                        <para>.- It appears to me that many honorable members, including the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, are looking at this question from an exactly opposite point of view to that from which we require to regard it. It is not the business of the Opposition, who are not directly connected with this appointment, to prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> was not competent. The whole burden of proof to the contrary rests on the Minister of Home Affairs, and those associated with him. They have to prove not only to their own satisfaction, but to the satisfaction of Parliament, that at least this gentleman was in every way qualified for the position which he now holds, even if they do not attempt to show that he was the best person available. No effort has been made in either direction, and not one word has been said in either relation. There has been no discussion- of the relative efficiency of the applicants. The appointment has been discussed as if it was simply a question whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> could do the work which he has been appointed to do. That is not the real question. This is whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is the man who can do the work best and most economically. There has been no evidence to show that his credentials and experience have been measured with the credentials and experience of other professional men in Australia who are available. </para>

I admit that the circumstances of the case, and the procedure, are calculated to raise a great deal of suspicion; but wish to keep to the simple questions of qualification and proof of qualification. I say distinctly that the Minister has not only not proved <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> qualifications for this position, but he has not even attempted to prove them. If he. has proved anything, it is .that, on the testimony of certain Legislative Councillors and others in Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is a man who wrote some excellent letters to the Western Australian newspapers during a period of criticism of railway management in that State, and that amendments were afterwards made in connexion with the management of that Department which led to a saving, generally estimated at ^100,000 a year. </para>

This argument is that even if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> be credited with that saving on the Western Australian railways, he has proved nothing except a faculty for detecting mistakes and blunders in existing methods of working, and to make suggestions which resulted in their great improvement. But these are all questions of railway management. They are connected in no way with railway construction. </para>

                    <para>The experience of Australia, as well as of English Railway Boards, has been - I know it has in New South Wales and Victoria - that it is wise to secure as Commissioners of Railways one member who is an expert in railway construction, and another member who is an expert in railway management - the latter  is quite- a different branch. This is the only matter on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> is alleged to have any qualification at all. There has usually been associated with these Commissioners a third., who is supposed to supervise the financial side of the railways and accounts, and generally to study their finances. </para>

This case is entirely different. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn-</inline> has not laid before this House a shred of paper relating to his experience in any capacity, even in the management of a railway, putting aside- the question of construction. He wrote letters to the papers. He made fertile suggestions. So may many other people who have an outside knowledge of railway business; but he does not show that, for a single day, in this country or any other-, he ever served even in the management of a railway. </para>

                            <para>- We have not had a word from the Minister in that regard tonight, or a tittle of evidence in any of the credentials that have been read. If there is anything in the papers, let it be added, and I shall make allowance for it; but, so far, in this debate there has not been a word to show that he has had&#39; the slightest practical experience as manager in- any position of importance; on any railway, anywhere. Remember, again, that I am still arguing from the question of management, although it has next to nothing to do with the challenge to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn.</inline> The construction of the railway is under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> a capable constructing engineer, who requires beneath him engineers, if not equally, at any rate largely, experienced in that kind of work. No one versed in railway management would think of employing, as- a chief officer of a constructing engineer, a man whose experience of railways was limited to some minor employments of which we have yet to hear, and to; newspaper and other criticism. Until- this line is completed, there, is no room for- him as manager, <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> for any. one else; since there is no railway management. The work to be done is wholly and solely railway construction. We are told that he is only temporarily appointed, but. we have not yet been shown, that, he was ever concerned with railway construction. He has had a long career in Australia,, and all, except the short period when he was criticising the Western. Aus.tralian railways, has been left a blank. We- know nothing of when he served, where he served,, how he served. We have no testimonials from his employers or his. superior officers. We- have no proof of his ordinary professional standing or university degree. We have, in. fact, no evidence to. justify his choice, except that a number; of competent business men, and a lawyer or two, who happened to be members of the Legislative Council of Western Australia, have been good enough to give him warm general, certificates of little value except for their goodwill. </para>

                            <para>- Others have- dealt with that fact; it comes into consideration only when it has been decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> could not have been chosen for his. professional qualifications-. The question for us to determine is : for what qualifications has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> been chosen? He has had no experience even in management or- in construction. The one other thing that: he did, the achievement of a <inline font-style="italic">\ife&#62;time,</inline> of. which, the Minister of Home Affairs spoke, was an alteration which is to save 4 miles in the length of a railway of which, as every one knows, there was only a- trial survey in existence. A trial survey is- intended to be corrected afterwards- in the light of further and completer knowledge before the rails are laid down. What he did is part of the ordinary every-da-y task of an engineer who runs a trial survey, &#39; and then necessarily goes over it afterwards and corrects it before building a permanent route. Thus; the only testimony of practical efficiency with which we have been favoured is the ordinary correction of a trial survey, which had to be corrected like almost every other trial survey. </para>

This is that the Government has chosen the best man available for the post in Australia or out of it, so that we might rely with absolute confidence that this vast public work, one of the greatest ever undertaken in Australia, will be carried out in the most efficient manner. We ought to have been assured that we are not being exposed to unnecessary risk, nor those responsible for the work to unnecessary anxiety, by having associated with them a man apparently of the most imperfect qualifications, and certainly not comparable in his claim on the Government with many others outside, who were not favoured with the appointment. That is the last important consideration - the injustice that has been done to scores of able Australians, qualified by experience and by their university &#171;qualifications- </para>

It was quite possible for Ministers to carry out this undertaking by the aid of some man who had proved his standing and ability in Australia at this particular class of work. They have no excuse for offering us a man whose qualifications, whatever they are, are only indicated by a few non-professional people, who were never his employers in any sense of the term, and whose commendations, such as they were, related to another class of railway work altogether, and not to construction. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that, during this session, we are establishing records, beyond a doubt. A charge has been levelled against the Government of having made a partisan appointment. I have listened carefully to most of the statements which have been made from the other side, but not one word has been levelled against the capacity of the man who is in charge of the construction of the Kalgoorlie section of the trans-Australian railway. The mover of this motion contented himself with reading statements from a number of Labour politicians - responsible men who are go,verning Western Australia - in favour of his  appointment. Assuming that that is correct, are we to take up the attitude that each one of these men who have committed their names to paper in favour of this gentleman is incompetent to express an opinion, and that the honorable member for Perth and his supporters, who have never seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn,</inline> who know nothing of his work- </para>

                            <para>- Yes, if the honorable member will give me an opportunity. These honorable members, who have never been acquainted with any of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> work, say, &#34; Because Chinn has got the support of these Ministers from Western Australia, it must be a political job.&#34; That is the extent of their argument. The Minister of Home Affairs has demonstrated that, within recent times - none of these letters is dated long ago - men on the opposite side have been profuse in their approval of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn&#39;s</inline> qualifications in regard to railway matters - gentlemen who are recognised as the most absolute Tories in Western Australia. Then we get to this stage : that if it is a political job, honorable members on the other side are equally guilty with honorable members on this side. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, an unknown quantity with honorable gentlemen on the other side. From 1880 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chinn</inline> worked for five years with the chief engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moriarty</inline> - who, I am informed, is a highly qualified man - in connexion with the Syd- ney water works, and for two years he worked as a licensed surveyor in New South Wales. He practised in Melbourne for fourteen years as a consulting engineer and licensed surveyor. He enjoyed a lucrative business, and was acting for railway and sewerage contractors as their engineer on all classes of engineering work, besides doing the surveys under the Transfer of Land Act for a great number of leading firms of solicitors in this city for that period. </para>

Certainly that is not done in the Post and Telegraph Department. The head, or sub-head, confers with the Minister, and then he submits a recommendation which the Minister accepts or rejects. The Minister of Home Affairs has secured a man who is thoroughly qualified to get on with the job, and who ought to be protected from the slanders which, chiefly by innuendo, have been thrown at him to-day. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to say very much in regard to this motion. At the outset, I must express my agreement, to a very large extent, with the remarks made by the honorable member for Bendigo on Friday last to the effect that we seem to indulge too frequently in these redistribution schemes. Under the Constitution and our Electoral Acts we are compelled to redistribute the seats owing to variations of population which may, sometimes, prove to be only of a temporary character. If the responsibility for this lies, as the honorable member for Bendigo seems to think it does, with the Constitution, we should do well to make that instrument a little more elastic in that respect. It is a very serious matter to upset at frequent intervals the electoral arrangements of the various States. Of course, we should rejoice if we knew that the population was increasing in a greater degree in the rural districts than in the city areas. The Commissioners, I understand, first fix on a quota, from which they work, taking into consideration community or diversity of interests, physical features, and other circumstances. It has always seemed to me that our electoral system ought to be based on human beings, and not on areas. In Victoria, if we were to leave the representation as at present, we should have in the city of Melbourne 344,868 electors, with a quota of 38,318, and nine members ; while in the country, there would be 382,733 electors, with a quota of 31,894, and twelve members, or a difference of considerably over 6,000 electors in each electorate as between country and city. It is unfair, in my opinion, to have a quota of 38,318 electors within city boundaries, and only 31,894 in country districts. I sympathize largely with the honorable member for Wimmera and the honorable member for Bendigo in their regrets about the population drifting into the city, yet the Commissioners have to face the fact that nearly half the population of the State is within that area. If we enlarge the country electorates there can be no possible encroachments on the city areas, but there is a possibility of metropolitan areas touching on some country districts ; and that has been done. The Commissioners have, I think, carried out their arduous task in a manner that reflects considerable credit on them. It has been pointed out that in some country constituencies the quota is above that fixed for the whole State. It is impossible, of course, to get figures to tally exactly, and certain considerations have to be taken into account in forming or incorporating electorates. On the figures as they stand the Commissioners have, I believe, carried out their duties as well as could be expected. Personally, as representing Maribyrnong, I am not inclined to complain. I know that the quota has been reduced, but if one Radical section has been excised, another Radical section has been attached on the other side. In reply to the honorable member for Wimmera, who also, apparently, has no complaint to make, 1 have to say that it would be impossible to give country electors twelve members and the city only nine, with a difference of 6,000 electors in favour of the city; If I had any doubt whatever as to a mistake having been made, whether through an error of judgment or otherwise, or as to any injustice having been inflicted on any part of the State, or on the State as a whole, I should have no hesitation about referring this report back to the Commissioners in order that they might analyze it, and submit a fresh scheme to this House. The Electoral Act was wisely framed in this regard - that Parliament is the final arbiter, and that we have power to refer back to Electoral Commissioners any scheme submitted to us. As far, however, as I am personally concerned, I intend to vote for the recommendation. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to say a word or two in regard to the number of electorates in the city portion of the State of Victoria in comparison with the number in the rural districts. I do not know what principle has been in operation in other States, but in Victoria it has always been held to be a proper thing that country electors should have a relatively smaller number of constituents allotted to them than city electors. The  reason for that -is that in the rural districts there is a larger area to be covered, and consequently there is increased difficulty in securing effective representation. That principle has been departed from in this case. I think, therefore, that a mistake has been committed. If I had any influence  1  would cause the error to be rectified. I really think that the Minister of Home Affairs might take the matter into his very serious consideration, and if it is not too late to restore to Victoria one of the country constituencies which will be lost under the new scheme- </para>

                    <para>- I refer to the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth. The Minister, in spite of the advice tendered to him by myself and other honorable members, persisted in appointing the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth as one of the Commissioners to divide the State of Victoria into electorates. In that I think he distinctly committed an error ; because in a matter of this sort, which, should always be dealt with apart from party considerations, and into the settlement of which&#39; party feeling should never be allowed to enter, the Minister should always be in a position to be able to consult an expert, authority as to any criticism which might be offered upon any redistribution scheme submitted. But the Minister wilfully deprived himself of that opportunity, and I, for one, very much regret that he did, because I feel that had the officer who occupies the very, high and responsible position to which I refer been allowed to remain free, and had&#39; the Commissioner who previously . divided the State of Victoria, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Topp,</inline> been appointed,, the position would have been much more satisfactory. I understand that the Chief Electoral Officer was not anxious to be appointed, a Commissioner. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Topp</inline> is a man. whose <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> have never been challenged, and who, by reason of his personal knowledge of the State of Victoria, gained during- a very long public service, during part of. which he was Under-Secretary, was preeminently qualified for carrying out what all will agree is a most complicated: operation. </para>

                        <para>- The last  speaker  alluded to the fact, of which, of course, this House in its wisdom may refuse to take any cognisance, and to which it may decline to attach any weight, that in Victoria a certain principle has always been followed in regard to the proportionate representation of people in the&#39; city and those in the rural districts. As a supporter of the principle of adult suffrage I hold that, in an ideal state, the principle of one vote one value is a necessary corollary. But it is only in an ideal state that the second principle could be made to work in perfection. It is only when equal opportunities are given both to the electors and to those who desire to be elected that the principle of &#39;/ one vote one value&#34; can act perfectly. As. long as we have disparities ruling in social and geographical conditions there will be disparities between the values of the votes of different individuals in different parts of the country. The only way in which human wisdom, can endeavour to make up for the disparity which undoubtedly does exist is by acknowledging that, although it may be very much, to be desired, it is not expedient that we should have the principle of &#34; one vote one value &#34; carried out to the full in our elec.toral system. </para>

                        <para>- The point which I wish to impress upon the House is this : It is not a fair thing to the country electors that they should be placed on exactly the same footing as regards representation as are the people in the towns. Neither is it a fair thing for the man who desires to be elected for a country constituency that he should be asked to cover enormous areas in order to meet with those who have a right to express their preferences on polling-day. One has only to look at the map and contemplate the size of some of the electorates which exist in Australia to realize the tremendous disparity between the operation of adult franchise in those immense country electorates, and its operation in the cities. Surely those of us who speak for rural districts are not asking too much when we ask this House to allow those who are less favorably situated to have removed a portion of the disparity which undoubtedly exists. The Commonwealth Parliament, in its wisdom, made provision that some allowance might be made for country electors. Vet we find that the Commissioners have almost totally ignored the provision embodied by Parliament in the Electoral Act. Parliament, in providing that there should be a quota, provided a maximum and a minimum number of electors for each division, the idea being that the minimum should be approached in those divisions which are far removed from the big centres of population, which cover a large area of country, and which are, from their lack of means of communication, difficult to traverse. In this instance, the maximum number of electors for any division would be  4.1,578,  and the minimum  27,718;  but the division to which has been allotted the smallest number of electors is within the metropolitan area. Surely that is not in accordance with either the spirit or the letter of the law. There appears to have been wilful avoidance of an evident duty. I have always looked upon the Minister as essentially fair-minded, and am surprised that he recommends a scheme which shows its unfairness by the allotment of electors to the first division mentioned in it. He revels in figures and mathematical comparisons, and I wonder that he did not notice that Balaclava, which is within a few minutes of the General Post Office, will contain fewer electors than any other division in the State. In the middle portion of Victoria there is a large and important mining district, extending from Bendigo in the north to Ballarat in the south. It is there that the auriferous land of the State lies; but the Commissioners have been, so careless of the undoubted probabilities of -the development of that tract of country that they have wiped off the map two of the electoral divisions which were formerly situated there. With one of those divisions I have been associated in public life for nineteen years, having been born and having lived in lt, so that I know how it is developing. Within a few months there may be&#39; thousands of additional voters there. No account of that probability has been taken by the Commissioners. </para>

                        <para>- The Commissioners have taken maps and returns, and, by processes of addition and subtraction, have evolved the scheme which we are now asked to accept; but, speaking impersonally, I think that this is not the way a redistribution of an electoral division should be made. The work should not be done purely by means of what I may call literary observations. It is the desire of Parliament, and of the people, that community of interest shall be one of the strongest considerations in &#39;determining the boundaries of a division. There should not be a throwing together of persons not associated politically or in their ordinary avocations, and a severance of persons thus closely and intimately associated. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly ; because in Victoria, unlike Queensland, there are not enormous tracts of country to deal with. Unfortunately, Victoria must lose one member because at a certain date her population was below a certain number, although within a few months it had increased again &#39;beyond that number. Had the computation been made six months later there would have been no loss of a member. In addition to that, the proposed distribution is faulty because it completely obliterates boundaries which have been long recognised by the people as satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>- Both. The law should have been more elastic. Just as there is a maximum and a minimum provided for divisions, there should have been  a  maximum and  a  minimum population for each State, so that Ministerial or parliamentary action could prevent such an injustice as has undoubtedly befallen Victoria. What is the case of Victoria to-day may be the case of New South Wales to-morrow ; and I am sure that honorable members desire to look at this matter, not from the stand-point of their State interest, but in the interest of the proper representation of every State. As to the manner in which the subdivision has been made, I think it only fair to say that I do not agree with those who have thought it necessary or advisable to completely obliterate from the map two adjoining electorates. The action taken is certainly most extraordinary. Those who have had parliamentary experience must view with wonder any redistribution, and especially one following another after a comparatively brief interval, which provides for the wiping out of two neighbouring electorates. </para>

It would be better to start from the centre and work outwards. By the adoption of that course we should secure greater community of interest than is possible by encroaching on  the centre of a State. Even if the honorable member for Gippsland&#39;s idea is correct, I would point out that the electorates which have been obliterated are geographically in the centre of Victoria. It is more than unfortunate that the abolition of two neighbouring electorates  should have been thought either necessary or advisable. I can see no justification or it. If one had been wiped out of existence, and used to make up the necessary quota for the surrounding electorates, I could have understood the action of the Commissioners; but the summary abolition of two neighbouring electorates, comprising nearly half the State, may have been chance, but I fear that there was a good deal of design in it. I am informed that  a  proposal was made - I do not know whether the Minister himself ever considered it- that one electorate should be abolished and that another further away  to  the west should be used to make up the necessary quota in the surrounding electorates. That proposition, however, was summarily disposed of. </para>

Its adoption would have meant the abolition of a constituency at present represented by a member of the Ministerial party. I wish also to strenuously object to this practice of bringing into centres of population  a  larger number of electors than that to which they are entitled. If there is one thing more than another we have  to  deplore, it is the way in which our population is drifting into all the large centres. Instead of encouraging that tendency, we ought rather to discourage it by every means in our power. </para>

I believe that the honorable member agrees with me that a large number of people are prepared to &#34;accept lower wages in large cities, in order to secure more amusement and greater comfort than are possible in rural districts. There is a class of people who are not much concerned about the wages they receive, as long as their employment gives them opportunities for amusement and the comforts and even luxuries, that town life affords. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. We have, for instance, a port in the Western District of Victoria which ought to have been utilized, but of Which no advantage has been taken, simply because Government after Government have refused to give it the opportunity which it undoubtedly deserves. The same remark will apply to the position in New South Wales. There the trade of country districts has been diverted into Sydney, just as in Victoria it has been driven from the country districts into Melbourne. It is unfair that the country should be made to suffer in this way.I feel that honorable members who represent country constituencies, and who realize, from personal experience, the tremendous hardships that have to be endured both by the men who are seeking the suffrages of the electors as well as by men and women who have to record their votes, will allow that there must be some differentiation between town and country electorates. There must be some disparity - a disparity that we cannot logically defend - but which, for the sake of expediency, we are bound to allow to exist. That being so, the Government would have acted more fairly to the country districts of Victoria if they had provided that these two electorates should not be wrested from them. Those of us who live in the country, and who have not the advantages of those who live in the towns, are entitled to more consideration than we are obtaining in this regard. As to the result of this redistribution, and its effect on parties in the House, it is unfortunate that two members of the Opposition are being made to suffer. If a subdivision under which country districts would lose two representatives were found to be inevitable, it would have been far better to abolish an electorate represented by an Opposition member and an electorate represented by a member of the Ministerial party. </para>

Probably the Surveyor - General of Victoria was of use in ultimately marking the geographical lines for the subdivision, but  I  am not talking so much about that as about the division of the electors into particular subdivisions. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, for the sake of convenience they follow as far as possible State and shire boundaries with which the people are familiar. The Minister has endeavoured to make it appear that honorable members on this side were specially favoured by the fact that two members of the Victorian State Ser- vice were members of the Commission. But there is nothing in that, because these gentlemen were not in that position as supporters of honorable members on this  side. One was an electoral officer of the State of Victoria, and the other Surveyor-General of the State, and they were chosen,  I  presume, not because of their political colour, but because of their attainments  and special knowledge.  I  wish to say that their special  Knowledge  and attainments had very little to do with the final settlement of this question, which was virtually decided by the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. Had the Minister carried out what I conceive to be his evident duty he would have said &#34; This is the Commissioners&#39; report. I feel that, in certain respects, it does not adequately meet the just demands of fair play in the State of Victoria, and in those circumstances I invite the House to criticise it. Subsequently, as the Minister in charge of it, I shall express my opinion.&#34; We should then have had an opportunity of getting probably a much fairer and squarer scheme than we have before us on the present occasion. I can understand honorable members opposite being perfectly satisfied. It gives them at once, before the election&#39; comes, a gain to which, speaking politically and from a party stand-point, they are not entitled. It also gives them, in the future, opportunities, by means of their more complete organization, of taking an advantage of those who are less favorably placed in the great areas outside the centres of population. </para>

                        <para>- In answer to a very disorderly interjection, I did say something about an organization. This- scheme will, and does, give to the Government party a greater advantage than it gives to those who are sitting on this side of the House, and will undoubtedly result at the next election in giving them an opportunity - and this is probably why they are so unanimously in favour of it - of strengthening their position in places where they have undoubtedly been weak. In these circumstances, it would have been better if the Minister of Home Affairs, exercising his own discretion, had advised the House with regard to these proposals in such a way as to indicate that he, as a country member, feels that there is at present, and must always be under existing circumstances, a difference in the value of the vote of the man in the country and the vote of the man who happens to be in the city. </para>

                    <para>- I somewhat regret that two names that have been applied to constituencies from the very first Federal Parliament are being wiped off the electoral map of Victoria. I should not have questioned the judgment of the three Commissioners if they had removed one name and retained the other. If I were in the position of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, I should certainly feel a little pain, because, no matter who comes back to this Chamber, the honorable member representing Laanecoorie, and another honorable member who represents Mernda, are in the position of the old gladiators who, saluting Caesar, told him that they were about to die. If this scheme is accepted, this House will never again, after the next election, know the honorable member for Mernda or the honorable member for Laanecoorie as such. They may come in here under another guise, but those of us who have been in political fights for many years know that it is always harder to fight a new fight in a new constituency than to contest an old one. Any member who has done a fair amount of work will always make lasting friendships, but in most cases a candidate who tries to force himself in against the sitting member has &#34; Buckley&#39;s chance. &#34; In one way I regret that the honorable member for Maribyrnong is losing 7,000 splendid democratic voters who are coming my way ; but, on the other hand, I welcome back, in them, some of my oldest veterans who returned me in some of the fights we had in the State days. At that time they recorded a greater percentage of votes in that division than in any constituency in Australia, and honorable members will understand that I cannot feel many pangs of regret in seeing them added to my constituency. I do regret, however, the demise of two districts like Laanecoorie and Mernda. I would rather have retained one of their names, Laanecoorie for choice, instead of having a new name like Caulfield. Of course, if the Opposition are losing two seats, they must remember that Caulfield is considered a consistently Conservative constituency. </para>

A good many people in it have, perhaps, anything but a kindly feeling towards the more advanced and progressive party who hare possession of the Ministerial benches in this Chamber. I want to make my protest here against the loss of population in Victoria, and in apportioning the blame I place my finger upon the ill-judged legislation which has come from the State Parliament. Any one who reads the columns of to-day&#39;s paper, and notes how the captain of a vessel which has come into this port will speak of human beings who are to become Australian citizens, who are coming to a land- </para>

                        <para>- I regret the loss of our population, although the other States have gained it. We know that a country that does not lose its population progresses most, because, if the laws are not good, the people, in their increasing numbers, can bring pressure to bear on the Legislature to have been altered. I regret, also, that the number of representatives of Victoria in this Chamber is being reduced from twenty - two to twenty-one ; but no one is more willing than I am to recognise the great potentialities of Queensland, and, of course, the Victorian who goes to another State is still an Australian, and remains under the flag which we all appreciate. I firmly believe that each of the Commissioners has done his duty in this matter honestly and truly, according to the facts placed before him and the knowledge at his disposal ; nor do I think any member representing Victoria can hold a contrary opinion. At the same time, I think that, instead of introducing a new name, they could have kept one <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the old names, and, if that constituency was short of population, have added to it by taking away from others. I do not suppose there will be any heated debate on this matter, and, in the circumstances,I must fully support the action of the Commissioners as indorsed by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I do not feel like dying. I think, with the honorable member for Bendigo, that the primary difficulty arises from the provisions in the Constitution necessitating the re-arrangement of electoral districts, and which has occurred, I think, much more frequently than its framers ever anticipated. Therefore, to that extent we are tied. We must accept the Constitution, but it does draw public attention to the point that at some, period, not probably very remote, this provision will have to be. revised, by which the number of members of this House is fixed at double the number of members of the Senate, and which, I believe, was made at a time when there was considerable suspicion on the part of the smaller States with regard to the possible action of the larger States. In the light of our experience of twelve years we must see that it is utterly absurd that this House should, if it is to fairly represent the people of Australia, be tied down in this arbitrary fashion. The strength of the House cannot remain at seventy-five members if it is to meet the requirements of the people as the country advances. The last  speaker  alluded to Victoria losing population. The cruel thing about the present redistribution is that Victoria is not losing population. If the numbers had been made up at the proper time we should not be losing a seat ; in fact, there would have been no redistribution. We may be gaining population steadily in proportion to our area. If Queensland, with ten times, perhaps twenty times, the area, with any number of ports, each of which is a centre of population, and will lead to an increased population, goes ahead, as I trust it will, Victoria may lose more members, not because she has declined in population or prosperity or anything else, but merely because of the increased population in Queensland or some other State, perhaps Western Australia. This is really a matter which calls for attention, that is, if the House is to remain representative of the people of Australia as a whole. However, we cannot deal with that question at present. </para>

At the present time they enjoy an advantage under the Constitution, because they were allowed a minimum number of representatives - more than they were entitled to be allowed by reason of their population when the Act was framed. But by-and-by it is quite possible that they may come into the field and create still greater anomalies than we have. </para>

                        <para>- The number of members must be in some relation to the population. In regard to this redistribution scheme, I have always thought that it was a mistake on the part of the Government to appoint public officers on a Commission of this kind. It would be far better to select three men who were outside the Public Service. I do not know the Chief Electoral Officer. I am not aware that I have ever seen him, but I think the present system puts him in an invidious position. I have nothing to complain of as far as his action is concerned. I know nothing of the reasons which induced the Commissioners to make this report and to propose this new arrangement, but I feel that they have not done their work well. </para>

                        <para>- Reasons are stated in the report, but there are other reasons not stated which weighed with them. I do not think that they have done their work well. They should have had some consideration for the fact that Victoria is the only State which has suffered in this way. Some years ago we lost a member, and now we are to lose another member. Instead of making a general redistribution the Commissioners have simply done as they did before. On the first occasion they took one electorate out of the centre, and on this occasion they have taken two electorates out of the centre with the result that the remaining country electorates are made geographically bigger. Looking at the question from a reasonable point of view I think that the Commissioners have not considered fully the effect which this method must have on the fair representation of the people, which after all ought to be the first consideration. A redistribution scheme should have nothing to do with the convenience of members or parties. The representation of the people should always be equitable and reasonable. As the first member for Mernda I had an immense addition to the area by the first redistribution when  Colonel McCay&#39;s  seat was taken away, and I have had to work that district. It is not fair to the people, or to the member, whoever he is, that a district should be increased so enormously as the country electorates are likely to be through this plan of redistribution, because it is made absolutely impossible for a member to keep in touch with his constituents, and for them to keep in touch with him&#39;. If a member has to travel, as I have had to do, over mountainous country extending 260 miles one way, and from 70 to 80 miles the other way, and containing an enormous number of centres, he cannot keep in touch with them. The plan is very unfair in that respect. I think some redistribution should have been arrived at, to the extent that the quota would permit of, on a different principle. With regard to the quota it is unfortunate for Victoria that it is to lose two members, but it is still more unfortunate for the country districts of Australia that they are to lose three country seats. Because, not only in Victoria, but elsewhere, the country districts are likely to be those to suffer. Victoria has already lost three country seats. As previous speakers have pointed out this all tends to that concentration of population which it ought to be the effort of every public man to prevent, but there it is. In my opinion, a redistribution could easily have been made which would have kept the country electorates down to the minimum number, and increased the city and suburban electorates to the highest number that the quota would admit of. That would have enabled us to carry out a principle which, I think, has been observed, not only in the State, but also in this Parliament; that is, to make the country districts, so far as the population is concerned, very considerably smaller than the city areas. We have, however, gone in the opposite direction, as the honorable member for Bendigo pointed out ; and the country districts have positively a larger electoral population  than many of the suburban districts. I j do not think the position can be defended I on any principle; and if I had my way j I should refer the report back to the Com missioners with a view to seeing whether they could not make an arrangement fairer, not only in the interests of the electors, but in the interests of the country districts. I suppose, however, that the carrying of this motion is a foregone conclusion. I may say that the electors in my district are strongly opposed to the. alteration; they feel that the constituencies are being cut up in the most extraordinary way. For instance, the constituency of the honorable member for Flinders will stretch right over the mountains, and take in Healesville, Marysville, and Lilydale, while Corio will stretch out towards .Heidelberg, though it can have very little real connexion with such places as Yan Yean and Morang. In regard to my own electorate, the arrangement is, in my opinion, a most foolish one ; there is so little community of interests between one .part and another that some of the residents, when they journey to town, will come from the west, while others will come from the east and north-east. As to the name, &#39;I do not see why &#34; Mernda &#34; should be altered to &#34; Caulfield &#34; or &#34;: Henty.&#34; In m&#39;y judgment, &#34;Caulfield &#34; is the better, but I think we ought to retain the name of &#34; Mernda.&#34; The present name was chosen by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Shiels, who claimed that it was the most euphonious of all in Victoria. I do not know what the word &#34; Mernda &#34; means, but I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shiels</inline> said it was a native name. &#39; I do not like the name  &#39; Moorabbin &#39; &#39; ; and if we desire euphony we ought to adhere to &#34; Mernda,&#34; </para>

I think that the change in the electorate has not met with the full consideration it should have, and that it might have been more skilfully accomplished. I have not been in communication with anybody on the matter, but if I had been asked I think I could have given the Commissioners some information and advice which would have proved useful and made the division fairer to all concerned. My suggestion is that the report be referred back for the consideration of the points raised by the honorable member for Bendigo and others. The honorable member I have just mentioned put the case very fairly, covering the whole ground ; and, that being so, I shall not detain honorable members longer. </para>

It is a division which might be indorsed by any one, and, therefore, we cannot impute any motives. I know the Commissioners to be thoroughly honorable men; and, so far as they are concerned, I desire my position to be clearly understood. I may say a word or two, however, on the political outlook which the proposed division opens up. According to the previous division, there were in the metropolitan districts three Liberal members and six Labour members, and in the other districts of the State nine Liberal members, three Labour members, and the honorable member for Gippsland, who, like Mahomet&#39;s coffin, hangs between the two parties. Under the proposed division, two of the Liberal seats are completely wiped out, and there is one new seat carved out of the other seats. That one seat is undoubtedly Liberal ; I refer to the &#34;Caulfield&#34; or &#34;Henty&#34; constituency. Fawkner, according to the last electoral figures, would have been a Labour seat by about 208 votes, irrespective of the absent votes and postal votes, which are now abolished. We may, therefore, say that three Liberal seats are wiped out and one Liberal seat is added, leaving a net deficiency of two. This does not seem quite a fair division from a political point of view, a view which we are entitled to take, but which the Commissioners are not, except from the point of view of community of interest. &#34;Community of interest&#34; should, I think, cover political views; people in similar walks of life hold similar views. </para>

                        <para>- Commercial interests largely embrace political interests, because the great questions debated in this Parliament are those affecting the classes to be taxed. In the last Parliament Victoria, had thirteen Liberal members, nine Labour members, and the honorable member for Gippsland. In the next Parliament the probability is that she will have about eleven Liberals. </para>

                        <para>- Inasmuch as we believe nowadays that every man and woman should have one vote, we should also establish the principle of equality of value for those votes. Whether it should be a numerical equality or an actual equality is an arguable proposition. I think there ought to be, as nearly as possible, an actual equality. Consequently, we ought to recognise that a man or woman living far away from the centres of population cannot exert the influence enjoyed by those in the metropolitan area. But what do we find under this scheme of redistribution? Balaclava is .to have 32,000 electors, whilst Wimmera is also to have 32,000. The Balaclava electors have no distance to go to the poll. Consequently, a far greater number of them will vote than will be the case in Wimmera. Again, Batman is to have 35,829 electors, and Wannon 33&#62;758. I think that a fair division has not been thought out. . We ought to make conditions as favorable as possible to people living in the country. We hope that by extending irrigation facilities we shall be able to give people iri* the country some of the comforts of town life. We hope that those living in the country centres will have nice asphalted pavements and good schools for their children. At present, however, the country elector is at a disadvantage. Consequently, his vote ought to have slightly more weight. That principle has not been studied in this division. We all know how congested our cities have become, and we are now offering another inducement to people to live in town, fi is, I know, a small inducement, but we ought not to afford any extra facilities for people in the towns to exercise more political influence than they have at present. I am aware that the congestion of population in the cities is attributed to the fact that our railways are concentrated towards the metropolitan area. Every one of us would like to see our people more widely scattered throughout the country districts. I am sure that my honorable friend, the honorable member for Maranoa, wants to see many more good, sound, Labour electors in his constituency. </para>

As the name of Charles Cameron Kingston stands out among those of the great ones of South Australia, and that of Higinbotham in Victoria, so does the name of Lilley in Queensland. I shall be proud to vote for the amendment, and am sure that, if a division be called for, honorable members opposite who hold kindly memories of the great man who bore the name will support the proposal of the honorable member for Maranoa. </para>

                    <para>.- In August, 1903, I objected to the redistribution of the electoral divisions of Queensland then proposed, and was fortunate in securing the support of the Minister of the day, the honorable member for Hume, who moved the rejection of the scheme. I intend on this occasion to move to refer the redistribution back to the Commissioners. When the redistribution was made the three Commissioners were, in the first place, unanimous regarding the divisions of Kennedy and Herbert, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> subsequently saw fit to disagree with his fellow Commissioners regarding some of the other  divisions. The first redistribution made the borders of the division of Herbert those marked on the map which I hold in my hand, which I ask honorable members to compare with that hanging on the wall. In 1903 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDowall,</inline> who was then a Commissioner, sent to the Government a report and map showing the distribution which had been made ; but within forty-eight hours another distribution was made, and further maps were sent to Melbourne, showing an entire alteration of boundaries. I thereupon made a charge of gerrymandering against some person or persons unknown, with the result that the distribution was rejected, and a departmental Committee was appointed to inquire into the matter. Its verdict was &#34;not proven.&#34; The Committee did not say that I was wrong in my contention. There was not sufficient &#39;evidence to show that the Commissioner -had been influenced in any way detrimental to my own interests, but there was such evidence of unfairness to myself that I had .the support of practically every honorable member of the House. The honorable member for Ballarat, who then adorned the Treasury bench just as he adorns any seat that he &#39;occupies, thoroughly agreed with his own Minister that there was evidence, although not absolute proof, that something in the nature of gerrymandering had been attempted. Some sinister influence detrimental to myself Has, it would appear, in this case also been at work. I ask honorable members to carefully examine the map displayed on the wall, setting forth the redistribution scheme. Is it not significant that, although it is laid down that wherever possible State and Federal electoral boundaries shall be conterminous, in this case the electorate of Herbert has been so cut up as to throw the whole mining vote of Herbert into the electorate of Kennedy. If we are to consider community of interest, then it cannot be denied that the State electorate of Cook, a portion of which is now included in the northern part of the electorate of Herbert, should have been included in the electorate of Kennedy. There are practically no agricultural interests in Kennedy, and there are certainly none in the State electorate of Cook, so that if there is any force in the provision that, wherever possible, due regard should be paid to community of interest, then the electorate of Cook should have been included in the electorate of </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Kennedy instead of being placed in that which I represent. Under this redistribution scheme the electorate of Herbert will comprise 33,364 electors, or 1,976 above the quota. On the other hand, the electorate of Kennedy under this scheme will comprise 27,177 electors, or 4,211 below the quota. If the whole of the State electorate of Cook had been added to Kennedy it would have increased by 1,693 *ne number of electors in that division, thus reducing Herbert to 31,671-, or only 283 above the quota, -and raising to 28,870 the number of electors in Kennedy, which would still be 2,578 below the quota. I desire now to refer to a matter which is really due to a weakness in the Act rather than to any fault on the part of the Commissioners. I do not blame the Commissioners at all for it, but the Act should be amended at the earliest opportunity in order to prevent its recurrence. This map, showing the redistribution of &#39;Queensland into Federal electorates, together with the accompanying report of the Commissioners, was issued on 8fh April last, and copies of it had to be posted at every post-office in each electorate. At any time within thirty days from the date of its publication any suggestions or objections to the scheme may be sent in to the Commissioners, who, under section 18 of the Act, are entitled to take such suggestions or objections into consideration, and to make any alterations they may choose. Twenty-seven days after the map had been posted a deputation, according to press reports, waited upon the  Chairman  of the Commissioners, and raised certain objections to the proposed redistribution of the electorate of Herbert. Why have we no information as to the character of those objections? I wish to know now who comprised that deputation, and what objections were raised by them. Following a question put to the Minister of Home Affairs a few days ago by the honorable member for Darling Downs, I asked the Minister if he would table the whole of the papers, and he replied that he would  do so. I desire now to know what has become of those objections, and by  whom  they were launched. We know nothing about them, and cannot say whether or not they were lodged with the Commissioner&#39;s before or after the prescribed date. </para>

                        <para>- We have simply the statement that four objections were received, but the report does not state whether they were lodged by individuals or organizations, nor does it indicate the character of the objections. We ought to have all the papers laid on the table of the House. Why have they not been placed on the table? I am going to ask the Minister presently some further questions that may be inconvenient for him. I am not going to spare him j he has not spared me. The weakness of this part of the Act is that the Commissioners, having taken objections or suggestions into consideration after the thirty days&#39; period has elapsed, may make such alterations as they please, and that no one knows anything about them until their report is laid upon the table of the House. I did not know until a few days ago, when the Minister laid the second report on the table, what had been contemplated. This map, showing the proposed scheme of redistribution, has never been laid on the table, although it should have been. </para>

It was the duty of the Minister to lay these reports and maps on the table, and if he had done so he would be sure of it, and would not have to say that he thought they were laid on the table. I cannot too strongly emphasize my objection that no one is given an opportunity to Object to a subsequent redistribution after the first has been made, and .thirty days have been allowed for objections to &#39; it, though the second redistribution may be entirely different from the first. We have three reports on the redistribution of Queensland divisions - one from Messrs. Gall and Spowers, an&#39;d two from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham,</inline> the third Commissioner.

I ask the honorable member for Darling Downs whether that is to be considered laying such papers &#34; before Parliament.&#34; I say that those papers should be laid on the table, and submitted to Parliament as the Act provides. It is significant that when the first redistribution was made the three Commissioners were unanimous with regard to the two electorates of Kennedy and Herbert, and those were the only two divisions on which they were unanimous. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> took exception to some of the other divisions proposed.

This course was not decided upon without full consideration ; without fully advocating my ideas at the sittings of the Commission ; or without due recognition of the  advisableness  of, if possible, being in accord with the majority. To achieve this latter I tentatively gave way upon several points which I considered essential to the success of the redistribution, but ultimately the sum .of these became too great. Consequently, I submit a separate proposed distribution, together with maps (showing also the  proposals of the majority where practicable) and technical descriptions of the boundaries of the Divisions as proposed by me. In the case of any proposed Division regarding which the three Commissioners are in accord, separate maps and technical descriptions are not included. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen that the numbers were decreasing all the time in the Kennedy division, whilst they were increasing in the Herbert division. The natural inference, and the one to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> points, is that the decrease in the numbers in the Kennedy division was continual, and likely to remain so, and, therefore, the surplus existing in Herbert should be taken from that division and placed in the Kennedy division. I shall read what he has to say on this matter for the information of honorable members - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The figures above quoted indicate that during the six years (1906-1911 inclusive) the enrolment within the Division of Herbert has undergone a steady and consistent increase, while that of the Division of Kennedy has steadily decreased. The object to be attained, therefore, is to increase the number of electors allotted to Kennedy to such an extent as to provide that the increasing enrolment in other Divisions shall not cause the enrolment for Kennedy to fall below the minimum allowed by the law. The number of electors allotted by the majority of the Commission is - Herbert, 33,364 (or 4,302 below the maximum) ; Kennedy, 27,177 (or only 2,067 above the absolute minimum). The obvious course would be to withdraw from the surplus enrolment of Herbert a sufficiently large number of electors to raise the enrolment of Kennedy above the quota to such an extent that it will remain within the prescribed margin for a reasonable period, say, five years. In order to attain this object I propose to detach from the existing Division of Herbert and add to the proposed Division of Kennedy the whole of the Subdivisions of Bowen and Mackay, containing in the aggregate 11,520 electors, which number, added to the existing enrolment of 20,709, would have the effect of placing Kennedy in a practically unassailable position in relation to electoral strength - the total, 32,229, being reasonably near to the quota, and consequently affording a margin of approximately 6,000 for increase or decrease during the ensuing five years, while Herbert, with 27,941 electors, which number will undoubtedly be rapidly increased, would be placed in a position which would allow of expansion without endangering its relation to the quota. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Within the existing Division of Herbert, community or diversity of interest presents a very difficult problem when making a redistribution of boundaries for a Division containing approximately 95,000 square miles of territory. The population is practically confined to the southern half of the Division, the northern half including a very large area of almost uninhabited country. The chief interest is the production of sugar. The principal centre thereof (Mackay Subdivision) is at the extreme south, small territorially, very densely populated, and  entirely devoted to sugar-growing. Adjoining this Subdivision to the north and west is the Bowen Subdivision, sparsely populated, the interests including sugar production, but to a much less extent. Proceeding northward, sugar-growing country is rot again met with until the Ingham district, some 200 miles distant, is reached. Thence sugar-growing interests wax and wane in importance until the Douglas Subdivision is reached, approximately midway along the eastern coast. It will thus be seen there are two widely separated sugar districts in the Division. </para>
                    <para>Of the 20,709 electors in the existing Division of Kennedy, which is of vast territorial extent and in which the interests are entirely pastoral and mining, 8,570 are concentrated . within the very small area of the Charters Towers Goldfield, the next most populous Subdivision (Cloncurry) having only 1,988 electors. There is no way of satisfactorily adjusting the incidence of the electoral population without in a measure disregarding the provisions of section 16 (a), consequently it is proposed to transfer the Bowen and Mackay Subdivisions from Herbert to Kennedy. </para>

                    <para>This course is recommended after mature consideration and with full recognition of the fact that a foreign interest will be introduced into Kennedy, and that portion of the sugar-growing interest will be detached from the coastal Division of Herbert. Exhaustive examination was made of all other practicable combinations without affording an adequate and satisfactory solution of the difficulty. Herbert. - The proposed Division comprises the existing Division of Herbert, less the Bowen and Mackay Subdivisions, which have been transferred to Kennedy ; enrolment, 27,941.

                <para>Those are the facts. In face of them I am justified in asking that the redistribution, as made by the Commissioners, be referred back to them for further consideration, and I believe honorable members will support me. I said a little while ago that I had asked that the whole of the papers be laid upon the table of the House. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs &#187; now if all the papers were laid upon the table of the House. A report sent by the Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland to the Chief Commonwealth Electoral Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> regarding this matter, has never seen the light of day so far as this House is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- A paper of that sort,, which is an official document to all intents, and purposes, should be laid upon the table for the information of honorable members. Does the Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland approve or disapprove of any of these maps or plans? The Minister of Home Affairs is an oyster; he is as silent as the tomb. If he were only as fluent now as he was this afternoon, upon another matter, we should, perhaps, get some valuable information from him. I ask him now, in. the first place : Is it correct that there is, a report of that nature? I say there is. Will the Minister deny it? He cannot deny it. The report exists, and it is the duty of the Minister to let us know the gist of it. What did the Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland say about this scheme? Why is there any mystery or secrecy about the matter ? We have a perfect right to demand that this official document shall be made available to the House. I am sure that if it contains any matter of a confidential nature the Minister can trust honorable members to treat such matter as confidential.. Has the report been submitted to the Cabinet? Not a word can I get from the Minister ! I think that there is a most fishy odour about the whole business, and that I have been treated most unfairly. In this case the Ministry - and there are only two of the Ministers here - are guilty of moral cowardice. They will not do what they know in their hearts to be right, because they are afraid of being accused of doing what is wrong. They are moral cowards in that respect. The Minister can take my comment as he likes ;. there- is no <inline font-style="italic">hot</inline> milk about it. The second report of. Mr Graham, I repeat, should be here. </para>

I am not responsible for the delay which has taken place. The report which has been handed to me is dated  3rd  July, but I want the report of the  18th  July to be also supplied to honorable members. Where is it?  I have a copy of it, but I do not know whether the Minister has one. </para>

I ask the Minister whether., if I move that the reports and the maps be referred back to the Commissioners for further consideration, he will accept the amendment? That is a very fair and reasonable proposal. Honorable members need not be alarmed regarding the shortness of time, because ten days ago, when I asked the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth whether if any of the redistribution schemes were referred back to the Commissioners there would be time to bring forward fresh reports and maps and before the* close of this session, and to have new rolls compiled for the general elections, he told me that there would&#39; be ample time. In fact, that is what he told me twelve months ago. I then urged the Minister to have Commissioners appointed and the work of redistribution carried out in good time.

                        <para>- Where is any activity being shown by the officers regarding these reports? I take the strongest possible exception to this proposal. I desire to make a few observations now in regard to community of interest. A great deal of unnecessary importance is attached&#39; to this point. In the first report sent in by Messrs. Gall and Spowers, they referred to community of interest; but that was only from the agricultural point of view. They propose that the whole of the sugar districts should be confined in one electoral division - this, however, is quite- impossible: But- there are other interests to be served. The commercial interests, for instance, are entitled to quite as much consideration as are the agricultural interests. Then the means of communication is also entitled to a good deal of consideration. Regarding community of interest,, there is exhibited on the opposite wall a map showing the Flinders division in Victoria. It com. prises several interests - dairying, agricultural, mining, and, I believe, timber-getting - but no particular interest has special representation. There is not one of the interests in that division over which this Parliament has the slightest control. We have no control over mining or dairying or general agriculture or the timber industry. But will any elector in the division contend, for a moment, that, because his own industry is. not represented&#39; in this Parliament, his interests are, therefore, neglected.?&#39; The honorable member for Flinders is not here at present, but I feel quite certain that nobody will accuse him, any more than he could accuse me, of neglecting to represent any particular interest. Regarding, the Kennedy division, in- Queensland, in which the pastoral and mining  industries  predominate, the Commissioners. put forward the plea that community of interest should be considered. We have no jurisdiction over the mining and pastoral industries in the division, and no one will accuse its representative of neglecting those industries. We cannot possibly have all interests represented in this Parliament ; and, if we had, it would resolve itself into a series of sections and cliques. We would have here a representative of the mining industry, a representative of the agricultural interest, and a representative of the dairying interest - of &#34;course, all sitting on this side of the chamber. Therefore, there is no force in the argument that community of interest should be so specially considered. Regarding means of communication and commercial interests, I want to point out that the hinterland of Cairns, which is contained in the Herbert electorate at present, but which it is proposed to put in the Kennedy electorate, is commercially united with Cairns. The Commissioners have cut out the whole of that hinterland, which is connected by railway with Cairns, and has its commercial interests identified with Cairns. Why was no consideration given to the commercial interests? The Commissioners have given consideration to other interests over which we have no jurisdiction, but to those interests over which we have some jurisdiction, they have paid no attention. Means of communication should also be taken into consideration. It may be said that a candidate for Kennedy would have to pass through another electorate to get to portions of that which he was contesting. Granted ; but he would have to do that under the proposed redistribution, and the position often arises. For instance, the honorable member for Capricornia has to pass through my electorate to get to a portion of his own j and the honorable member for Mernda to-night told us of a similar state of affairs in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say it applies to dozens of electorates, so that that argument should have no weight whatever with honorable members. If this map had been the first issued I should have raised no objection. But when it is issued at the instance of a few people whom we do not know, it becomes another matter. We do not know what the objections were, or when they were lodged; and I have reason to think that some were lodged on the very day of proceedings, or immediately after the time had expired. I read in the press that a deputation waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gall</inline> twelve days after the period during which objections might be taken had elapsed. However, the officer has denied the statement to the Chief Electoral Officer; and I accept his denial. The press does not usually anticipate matters twelve days ahead, though it would appear to have done so on this occasion. The whole proceeding seems to savour of what is known as &#34; gerrymandering.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- If so, he has left us very much in the dark. I appeal to honorable members to give me a vote on this occasion, so that the reports and maps may be referred back to the Commissioner. I am only asking what is fair, seeing that opinion is so much divided on the matter. First we had three Commissioners unanimously agreed, and then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Graham</inline> disagreed with the majority and sent in two reports, one of which has not yet been tabled. Where is that report? The Minister will not deny that the document is in existence; and I ask why it is not placed on the table. Believing that I am being most ungenerously treated by the Minister, I move, as an amendment - </para>

                    <para>.- In seconding the amendment I may say that, as member for a southern State, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> take a most impartial view of the case before us. If the statement be true that all the reports of the Commissioners have not been distributed it shows, to my mind, a ridiculous way of carrying on parliamentary business. No one &#39;would be louder in his condemnation than the Minister of Home Affairs himself if he were in Opposition, and a document of this kind were not forthcoming. </para>

                        <para>- The first set of maps issued by the Commissioners in Queensland were sent to me, and were shown at several public places., I at once accepted their plan of redistribution, although it added some 60,000 square miles to my territory. I did not feel called upon to raise any objections, and I was very much surprised later on to find a fresh set of maps sent out. I looked up the Act and found that persons who had any objection to the plan of redistribution could notify that objection to the Commissioners. Some people did so, and the Commissioners, as a result, issued a fresh set of maps, on which neither myself nor any one else had an opportunity to make any suggestions whatever. That seems to be an anomaly. </para>

What would then be the position of Queensland, which desires to have the additional member to which she is entitled?

                    <para>.. - I am sorry that I cannot support the proposal of the honorable member for Herbert to refer back this scheme of redistribution to the Commissioners, as I consider they are on a very fair and equitable basis. I feel, with the honorable member for Capricornia, that we should be endangering our position by doing so. Under the Representation Act, Queensland is entitled to an additional member. I fear that sending the report back will endanger that State getting its proper representation. Under the original Act we had but one Commissioner for this purpose. It was felt, however, that the power was too great to be left in the hands of one man, and that the result of so doing would probably be that matters would be continually referred back by Parliament to the Commissioner. In order, therefore, to obtain a judicial decision, and to insure that qualified persons should make a thorough investigation in which Parliament might have complete confidence, it was decided in 1909 to appoint three Commissioners, one of whom should be the Surveyor-General, of the State concerned, <inline font-style="italic">ot~</inline> an officer in his Department. The object was that there should be upon the Commission at least one person possessing a full and detailed knowledge of the country to be divided up. In this instance, the three Commissioners appointed were instructed to subdivide Queensland into ten divisions. Honorable members have only to look at the map of Queensland to see how the population is scattered about in that enormous area. There is an immense diversity of interests. I do not suppose that any State in Australia has such a diversity of natural products as Queensland, due to varieties of climate and of geographical conditions. The Commissioners had a difficult task to perform. It must be remembered that this process of subdivision, though done under the authority of Parliament, is not simply for the convenience of the Queensland representatives. It is done with the object of allowing Australia to be represented equitably and justly, according to the different interests concerned. In this case the Commissioners went into their task thoroughly. As far as I know, they were three men in whom we were justified in having complete confidence. They were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> A. Spowers, the Surveyor-General ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. Gall, a State officer who has a very full knowledge of Queensland ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham,</inline> whom I confess I do not know except that I understand he is in the Commonwealth Electoral Office. </para>

                        <para>- The report has to be examined to find a reason for that action. The Commissioners made their investigation, and posted their conclusions throughout Queensland. I do not quite agree with the honorable member for Capricornia as to the right of a member of Parliament to take objection. It seems to me that a member of Parliament has just as much right as any member of the public to enter his protest and give his reasons for so doing. </para>

If we send back the scheme to the Commissioners for reconsideration, the public will be unable to offer objections to any other proposal, because, under the law as amended last session, it will be returned direct to us for acceptance or rejection. The general intention of the Electoral Act is that this matter shall be decided, not by Parliament but by independent Commissioners after a judicial investigation of all the circumstances, and I think that we cannot do other than accept their proposals. It should be referred back only in exceptional cases. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot support the amendment. As the proposed distribution is so little out of joint, it would be a pity to endanger it by referring it back to the Commissioners, in whom, personally, and in whose knowledge of Queensland, I have the utmost confidence. They spent a lot of time on their work, and went to very great trouble in the endeavour to meet the requirements of the State. The objection of the honorable member for Herbert seems to be that the quota is not in accordance with the total enrolment. He appeared to lay little stress on the importance of studying community of interest. The Commissioners report that - </para>

I was surprised to hear from the honorable member for Herbert that there was a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allars.</inline> If that be so, honorable members should know what he said. As for the second report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham,</inline> I have only just seen it. Perhaps there is reason for postponing this matter until we have had time to read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham&#39;s</inline> second report and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allars&#39;</inline> report, if he made one; but it cannot be said that the Commissioners have not tried to consider the interests of the sugar-growers as well as the very important shipping interest.

                            <para>- Well, it is sufficient to say that the  Government  have not given this question a party complexion. They have brought down the reports of the Commissioners, and have left the House, their own supporters included, absolutely free to do what it believes to be best and right in the interests of the future representation of the people in this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I am not here to judge the conduct of the Minister. He may have his own reasons for what he has said, and I do not care to inquire into them. I should like to direct the attention of honorable members to the imperfect nature of the map of the new divisions for Western Australia which is exhibited in the corridor. It is impossible for any one who has not intimate local knowledge to discover from that map, except by very close scrutiny, what the boundaries of the new divisions really are. That being so, I ask permission to display a map delimiting the new boundaries in a manner which honorable members will be easily able to perceive. A glance at this map will enable honorable members to grasp the. extraordinary nature of the division of electorates which has been made in Western Australia. I say that the division made is extraordinary without intending any reflection upon the impartiality or competency of the gentlemen concerned. But it is clear from their report that the Commissioners have misinterpreted the instructions contained in the Act. From the second paragraph of their report it is evident that the Commissioners did not realize the imperative nature of the mandate in section 1 6 of the Electoral Act. They ignore altogether the paramount considerations of community or diversity of interest, means of communication, and so on, and write as if they were free to do what they pleased so long as they kept within the margin of allowance provided for. But they were not free to do as they pleased. They were bound, before having resort to the margin of  allowance,  to give full and due consideration to the conditions which Parliament considered to be of paramount importance; that is to say, community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, State boundaries, and so on. These, I say, were the primary considerations to which they should have given attention, because it is &#34; subject &#34; to these conditions that the quota becomes &#34;the basis for the distribution into divisions.&#34; The law distinctly lays it down that the margin of allowance from the quota is to be used only &#34; whenever necessary.&#34; These words must be taken as restrictive as well as permissive, and they have a significance which the Commissioners for Western Australia appear to have overlooked. They mean that the quota may be varied only in the last extremity, because the underlying principle of our law is that, so far as practicable, the divisions shall be constituted of an equal number of electors. This is the predominant consideration which Parliament intended should influence the Commissioners in fashioning electorates. Every other- factor is subsidiary to this. As a matter of fact, the margin of allowance was a legislative afterthought. It extends latitude to the Commissioners in dealing with exceptional and difficult situations, but it does not contemplate the licence of a general application, because a situation might often be found - and this is the true explanation of it - where contiguous districts have adverse interests, and the purpose of the margin of allowance was that those districts might be grouped with other communities having greater community of interest with them, even if in so doing a departure was made from the quota. But the Commissioners in this case have not attempted to group in one division all having a community of interest. For instance, they describe in paragraph 5 of their report a division as a &#34; Gold-fields Division,&#34; but they have excluded from that division one of the most important gold-fields of the State which lies contiguous to the division, and have excluded also another gold-field containing  a great many miners, placing both in a district which may be said to be purely farming and pastoral. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter of opinion, and I think they could help it. The Commissioners have in this matter utterly ignored community of interest, and have relied upon the margin of allowance alone. They have professed to comply with the Electoral Act, but, as a matter of fact, have violated its spirit. They have not made this distribution of electorates on the existing enrolment as they were required by law to do, but have projected themselves into the future, and on statistics compiled at the end of 191 1, they have distributed the divisions on what they assume will be the electoral condition in Western Australia in April or May, 191 3. To show the House how loosely these gentlemen have gone about their work, I have only to read one or two extracts from their report. Making an explanation about the Perth and Fremantle divisions, they say - </para>

                            <para>- I have read it very carefully. The Commissioners are bound by law to make the quota on the existing enrolment, but here is a clear and plain admission that they have made the distribution on what they conjecture will be the enrolment eighteen months later. To show that I am not misinterpreting them, I refer honorable members to the following paragraph in their report - </para>

                    <para>I am not aware of any general election in 191 2. I suppose there will be one in 1913, but that reference shows that it was a future quota, not a present one, which influenced the Commissioners. They assume that Parliament has given them power to peer into the future, and to distribute the divisions on a prophecy, or estimate, or conjecture. Then they say - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Commissioners also consider themselves justified in assuming that the provision contained in the Commonwealth Electoral Act for the creation of Divisions of equal electoral strength - or as near thereto as circumstances will admit - indicates an underlying principle and a desire on the part of the Legislature of giving to all votes, as far as possible, an equal value, an object that, in the opinion of the Commissioners, can only be effectively achieved by securing to each Division at the time of an impending election an enrolment as near to the quota as  is  practicable. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That clearly shows that the Commissioners have gone outside the functions delegated to them by Parliament, and have formed the divisions, not on the figures supplied to them by the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, but on what they imagine will be the quota in  1913.  They write about the desire of the Legislature to give all votes as far as possible an equal value. I cordially indorse that sentiment, but instead of giving each vote the same value throughout the divisions of Western Australia, they have placed in one division nearly  5,000  electors more than they place in each of the other four, and, in order to give that increase, they make this extraordinarily shaped division. They have included in it districts that have always been in communication with the port of Geraldton, and which have no communication or community of interest whatever, except common citizenship, with the distant region to which it is proposed to join them. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware that any serious objection is taken to the others, but if the right honorable gentleman has any objection to offer, I presume we shall hear from him later. I hope the House will insist as far as possible on having an equal number of electors in the divisions, because the fundamental idea of our government is one man one vote. That is the bedrock principle of parliamentary representation, and a necessary corollary to that is that, one vote shall have one value, that every unit of the community shall exercise the full power of every other unit in the election of a representative to Parliament. Whether this principle be right or wrong, at any rate, it has been fought for over many years, and having triumphed it ought to be observed in the spirit as well as in the letter. Whenever we fashion electorates unequal in the number of their constituents we sap this basic principle. We may extenuate it by arguments such as the honorable member for Bendigo used &#39;the other night, that a country electorate should have a smaller quota than a city one, because of the greater area and the difficulties which voters have in getting to the poll. But when all this is admitted the fact remains that we are departing from a vital principle of democratic government if we sanction such a variation between two electorates as  5,000  votes. Now, the Commissioners say that Division &#34;D &#34; shows a decreasing enrolment. . It has shown a slightly decreasing enrolment. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite as reasonable for me to estimate that a new gold-field will be found, and that the population will increase, as it is for the Commissioners to assume that the population will decrease. Furthermore, let me remind the right honorable gentleman that nine-tenths of the work of the transcontinental railway, so far as Western Australia is concerned, will be done in and around Kalgoorlie or within the Kalgoorlie division. That work will attract between  2,000  and  3,000  persons, including the workers and their families, and those who will cater for their wants, so that the probabilities are, not that Division &#34; D &#34; will decrease in enrolment, but that it will increase. I would like to point out also that, in the matter of community of interest and means of communication, the Commissioners absolutely ignored those primary and elementary considerations in fashioning these divisions. Suppose that a miner at Nannine wanted to go for any electoral purpose to the centre of the electorate of Kalgoorlie. He would have to travel a journey of 990 miles, or a total distance of 1,980 miles. The Commissioners themselves admit that there is no direct means of communication. </para>

We have this Murchison country united to other country which has no community of interest, and which the Commissioners admit has no direct means of communication by rail. The Commissioners evidently felt that the inclusion of this territory, which has always been in the other electorate since Federation, required a good deal of buttressing. They obviously felt that their action in this regard was extremely vulnerable, and therefore much of the report is devoted to an attempt to justify the inclusion of this territory with Kalgoorlie. The House will be amazed at the extraordinary statements which they make in the report under the head of community of interest. On page 10 they say - </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, they place their opinion before the mandate of Parliament. Now, every single one&#34; of the questions they set out here to establish a community of interest is a question not under the jurisdiction of this Parliament, but entirely under the jurisdiction of the State Parliament. What do we mean when we place in our Electoral Act the requirement of community of interest? We mean, of course, that the people who are called upon to elect a member of this House shall have common interests allied to the work which they have in hand of returning a representative. Well, every one of the items which the Commissioners relied upon to show community of interest between this very remote region and Kalgoorlie is a question entirely outside the scope of this Parliament. It is clear from the admissions in the report that the Commissioners, however valuable their work has otherwise been, have not, in the spirit of the law, carried out the duty which this House imposed on them. I contend that the words &#34; quota of electors,&#34; in section 16, clearly means electors actually enrolled when the quota was ascertained. They cannot mean electors to be enrolled, as obviously no one can foretell the number existing at a future time. The Commissioners are, therefore, required by law to form the divisions from the existing rolls of electors ; and this they have not done. What they have done is to anticipate from statistics compiled in 191 1 what the total enrolment will be in April, 1913, and define the new  devisions  in accordance with the anticipated enrolment. The . Commissioners were entitled to adopt a one-fifth margin of allowance to be used &#34; whenever necessary,&#34; but this was contingent on their giving due consideration to requirements which Parliament regarded as paramount, namely, &#34; community or diversity of interest,&#34; &#34;means of communication,&#34; and so forth. The onus, therefore, lies on the Commissioners to show - first, that due weight was given to the above statutory requirements; and, second, that it was &#34;necessary&#34; to adopt such &#34;margin of allowance &#34; as gives one division nearly 5,000 more votes than any of the other four divisions. </para>

                            <para>- That does not affect the&#39; matter; there are 4,792 more votes in one division than in others, and I say that that is not according to the spirit of the law, which provides for equal electorates. They attempt no justification for forming divisions in anticipation of future enrolment, contenting themselves with the vague statement that &#34; consideration would also have to be given to the probable effects of the present outlook,&#34; and &#34; that the shortage of the quota would be more than made up by increasing enrolment between December, 191 1, and next year&#39;s Federal election.&#34;&#39; Again, in paragraph 33, they state that they &#34;consider themselves justified in as&#39;suming &#34; the intention of Parliament, and so forth. In forming divisions on &#34;  assump-tions  &#34; and on &#34; anticipations &#34; of estimates of future enrolment, their intention may be excellent, but their action is outside their authority. In paragraph 23 the Commissioners admit that they have disregarded the statutory requirement in respect of &#34; means of communication &#34; between Cue, and Mount Magnet district, and Kal,goorlie. They also appear to have ignored&#39; the mandate to preserve &#34; community of interest,&#34; although their reasoning as to this is somewhat unintelligible. I shall not dwell further on that point, but merely deal with the point of the excess number of electors placed in one division. The grounds on which &#34; D &#34; division is given nearly 5,000 excess electors are entirely speculative. No one can attempt.  to forecast with accuracy the movements of population, especially in a mining country like Western Australia. Division &#34; D &#34; includes vast auriferous areas, in which a rich discovery of gold may at any time occur. In the past such a discovery has drawn to a new field from 3,000 to 4,000 adults within a month. Division &#34; D &#34; also embraces about five-sixths of the Western Australian area, through which the transcontinental railway will pass. This work calls for an army of men, who, with their dependents and those who cater for their wants, may add from 2,000 to 3,000 voters to the &#34; D &#34; division roll. If estimates are to be considered at all, then it is more reasonable to expect that by election time &#34; D &#34; division will have some 40,000 voters - about 11,000 in excess of any other division - than that its electoral strength will relatively decline. I do not think I need detain the House any further on that point, but I should like to recur to the question of the legality of the action of the Commissioners in distributing the electorates, not on a quota of the enrolled electors, but on what they assume will be the quota some months hence. </para>

                        adds that, in his opinion, Parliament should be asked to invalidate the proposed distribution and should send it back to the Commissioners for them to make a fresh one. In conclusion, I repeat that I cast no reflection upon the Commissioners.

                            <para>- That is a very ungenerous inference. I have criticised the work of the Commissioners very freely, but I do not think that I have impugned their motives or intentions. I cast no reflection upon them in any way. Nor do I think that the House, by returning this plan of distribution to the Commissioners, will be casting any reflection upon them. They are fallible human beings, liable to err, as we all are; and I presume that the most that can be said is that they have committed an error of judgment in this case. I confidently appeal to the House, on the grounds I have mentioned, not to sanction the scheme. If we were to establish a precedent, and to allow the (Commissioners in Western Australia to distribute the electorates according to what they expect will be the conditions existing eighteen months in advance, there is no reason in the world why other Commissioners should not distribute divisions according to what they think will be the conditions four or five years in advance. </para>

                            <para>- I have dealt very fully with that point, and established my case. The right honorable member will have some difficulty in rebutting the arguments used. I think that a mere error of judgment has been committed, and that it will be no reflection upon the Commissioners to return the scheme to them, with an intimation that the House considers that, as far as practicable - and it is eminently workable in this case - there should be equal electorates. The State of Western Australia should be cut up into five equal divisions, and this House should intimate that it does not sanction the action of the Commissioners in speculating as to what the enrolment will be in the future; but that they should confine themselves to the strict letter of the law, and make their distribution on the existing enrolment of electors. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Coolgardie has fought his case pretty hard, but I should like to point out to him that he has not dealt with the distribution of electorates generally, but only with the electorate which he represents. We must take what he says <inline font-style="italic">cum gram salis,</inline> inasmuch as he has not taken the least notice of the boundaries of any other electorate than his own. I should like to point out, also, that I do not know what procedure would be adopted if this scheme is sent back to the Commissioners, because, to my own knowledge, one of the Commissioners is away in Europe. I do not think it would be proper or legal to appoint a new Commissioner. Probably those who remain in the State would have to decide the matter. It appears to me that you cannot bring a fresh Judge into a cause, and ask him to decide upon an issue that has been half tried. To my own knowledge, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stenberg,</inline> one of the Commissioners, is not in Western Australia&#39; at present. I think he ought to have been asked to stay until this matter was dealt with. Unfortunately, the procedure that is being adopted to-day is not unknown to this House. We have had the same sort of thing previously. </para>

                            <para>- I do not take all the responsibility for that. Moreover, we have three Commissioners now, whereas we had only one previously. That is an important difference. If this scheme is returned to the Commissioners for Western Australia, and they take some time to re consider their position - as they must do - the chances are that the old arrangement will prevail at the next election. For my own part - looking at the matter from a selfish point of view - the existing arrangement suits me. But the present procedure shows, I think, how unsuitable is the plan of returning these electoral schemes to Parliament for a final decision. I am sure that no one will think that I wish to cast a reflection upon any honorable member, but it must be evident that very few of us - I might almost say none - are competent to express an opinion about the subdivision of any other State than our own. I have perhaps had more experience than most honorable members in the matter of arranging electorates, and being a professional man myself, may be expected to know something about work of this kind. But I confess that I have not taken the trouble to gain any personal knowledge about what are suitable arrangements for Queensland or even Victoria. But I am asked here to give my vote as to whether arrangements proposed by expert Commissioners appointed by the Crown for other States than my own are good, and should be adopted or rejected. I am competent to give an opinion upon the work done in Western Australia, because I have an intimate knowledge of the subject. That illustrates how unsuitable a tribunal this House is for settling such a matter. I hope that the Government will take the subject into their consideration so that we may adopt a better system in future. Whatever is done should be final, and such schemes should not be referred to this House, in which three-fourths of the members know nothing about the subject upon which they are called upon to vote. The present Prime Minister, on the  23rd  November,  1909  - when sitting in Opposition - expressed a very sound, opinion which we might very well follow. </para>

                        <para>An attempt to manipulate electorates and to take the work of electoral redistribution out of the hands of a responsible officer appointed for the purpose, is about the nearest possible approach to political corruption. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is pretty strong language ; I quote it for the information of honorable members. This attempt by the honorable member for Coolgardie to upset the present distribution should, I think, show what an unsatisfactory tribunal Parliament is to determine a matter of this kind. I do not say it to give offence, but it is my opinion that seventy members of the House know nothing about the merits of the scheme under discussion. </para>

Of the five representatives of Western Australia who make up the rest of the House, four are not taking any action against the adoption of this scheme. The honorable member for Coolgardie alone, and that for personal reasons, because the proposed new electorate will not suit him, is trying to get the Commissioners&#39; scheme upset. He has sent a circular to every member of the House, urging honorable members to help him. </para>

Lest it may be thought that, because I support the present arrangement, it is a good one from the point of view of my party, let me say that it is not so. For instance, if you pay regard to the voting in October last, it is not certain that our party will be successful in the Perth electorate, or in the Fremantle electorate. In the Lower Swan, the southern half of my electorate,, the position is also difficult, and the Kalgoorlie seat appears to be a safe one for the Labour party. I admit that the Coolgardie seat does not seem too good for the present member, but in four of the five divisions our opponents have a chance. I hope, of course, that we shall be able, notwithstanding, to win nearly alt the seats. We think that the tide is turning, and that the people have changed their views. Judging by the voting last October </para>

                            <para>- But this scheme is submitted by three Commissioners, and &#34; in a multitude of counsellors there is safety.&#34; Although an interjection that I made might, possibly, have conveyed a suggestion to the contrary, I believe that the honorable member for Coolgardie considers that the Commissioners in this case are men of unblemished and unassailable character. No doubt they are. I desire now to point out that the number of electors on the rolls for the Murchison goldfields has greatly diminished during the last two and a half years. The number of electors in Cue has diminished by  1,660;  in Lenora - which is not in the Murchison gold-fields, but is now included in the electorate of Kalgoorlie - the number has diminished by  1,018;  in Mount Magnet, by  1,347  ; in Menzies, by  1,211  ; and in Mount Margaret, by  1,123.  Thus, in those five districts, which are now in the electorate of Coolgardie, but, under this scheme, will be transferred to the electorate of Kalgoorlie, there has been, during the last two and a half years, a diminution of  6,359inthe  number of electors on the roll. Then, again, the electorate of Kalgoorlie has now only  20,255  voters, or  10,136  below the quota; and Coolgardie has only  24,177,  or  6,214  below the quota. During the same two and a half years&#39; period the adjoining agricultural and pastoral district of Swan, however, has made an increase of  7,921  electors. It now comprises  48,997  electors, or no less than  18,606  above the quota. It is therefore clear, I think, that it would not be justifiable to give the electorate of Dampier, as it is now to be called, a number of electors above the quota, and to have the number of electors in a district that is diminishing, below the quota. It is curious that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, who, under this scheme, will have in his electorate  3,640  voters above the quota, is not complaining of this increase. </para>

                            <para>- That is immaterial. Three thousand six hundred and forty miners in Cue and Mount Magnet will now be within the electorate of Kalgoorlie, and we find that the honorable member who represents that electorate, instead of complaining, is supporting the new arrangement. The honorable member for Coolgardie, on the other hand, evidently wishes to nullify the agricultural and pastoral votes in the proposed new electorate  of  Dampier by adding the miners&#39; votes  of  Mount Magnet and Cue to the number. He wishes to mix mining votes with agricultural and pastoral votes, thus destroying the principle of &#34;community of interests.&#34; </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to make a personal explanation. The right honorable member for Swan made the statement a few minutes ago that I had addressed to honorable members of the Opposition a letter asking support of my action against the adoption of the report of the Commissioners appointed to distribute the State of Western Australia into Federal electorates. That statement is absolutely incorrect. As honorable members are necessarily unacquainted with local conditions in Western Australia, and with the flaw points involved in the action of the Commissioners, what I did was to prepare a letter, which I addressed to certain honorable members, setting forth the actual facts. I did not ask that they should vote either in one direction or the other. </para>

                        <para>. - When the House met this afternoon, I asked the Treasurer a question in reference to a regulation that has been embodied in the notices to those doing business with the Commonwealth Bank. This regulation warns depositors that the bank will not be responsible for any fraudulent withdrawal of money, and I asked the Treasurer whether such a regulation was not in defiance of the will of the Parliament as expressed in the refusal of both Houses to agree to the insertion of such a provision in the Commonwealth Bank Bill. The Treasurer replied in the negative. He further used words to the effect that I was not quite correct in my statement of what occurred, and that the question was never tested. I wish to direct attention to the fact that this clause was in the. original Bill, and that the effect of it is identical with the clause now embodied in the regulations of the bank, which the Treasurer said was not so. This is the clause to which I refer - </para>

Then, on the 19th December, after several honor able members on both sides had pointed out the iniquity of this provision, and how unjust it was to depositors that the Commonwealth should shirk its responsibility, the Treasurer receded from his former attitude and asked the leave of the House to withdraw his motion. It was only on the leave of the House to withdraw the motion being granted that the right honorable gentleman moved that the Senate&#39;s amendment omitting the clause should be agreed to. It will, therefore, be seen that, in his answers to my questions this afternoon, the right honorable gentleman was absolutely misleading. </para>

                            <para>- The strangest thing of all is that private and confidential letters should come to the knowledge of honorable members opposite. I should like to know whether such a thing ever happened to them in their lives. For days before there were tit-bits going around the House that we were about to get something. The right honorable member for Swan also launched a question about the Chief Electoral Officer. I am going to look into this thing. The time may have arrived when, if these officers intend to be on the other side, it may be necessary that they should join the other side. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister of Home Affairs has said either too much or too little. If he is aware that his officers have any communication with honorable members on this side in a way detrimental or injurious to him as Minister in charge of a Department, it is his duty to require those officers instantly to cease that communication. If he knows that they are not loyal to their Minister, he should get rid of them at the earliest possible moment. That is my statement about the matter. But I say that, before the honorable gentleman does that, or talks about his officers in this House, he should be very sure of his facts. </para>

                            <para>- I know nothing of what is happening in the honorable gentleman&#39;s Department. He is barking up the wrong tree. He is drawing upon a disordered and discoloured imagination in making such statements. I know nothing of what is transpiring in his Department. Moreover, I do not wish to know anything; that transpires there, except through legitimate channels. I have made no inquiries about the case, and if other honorable members did so they can speak for themselves. But I say here and now that the Minister of Home Affairs ought not to come here and make these insinuations against officers of his Department without the slightest tittle of justification for doing so. I repeat that the honorable gentleman has said either too much or too little. If he knows that they are not loyal to him, the sooner he deals with such officers the better. </para>

Service of this country, and have been loyal to every Minister. That is the complaint I have to make against the honorable gentleman. If he has been made the victim of any tricks of this kind in his Department, I sympathize with him to that extent. Above all else, officers should be loyal to their Minister. That is their first duty; but the honorable gentleman ought not to impugn their loyalty without the strongest possible grounds. </para>
