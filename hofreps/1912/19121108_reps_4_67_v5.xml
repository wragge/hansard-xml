                        <para>- I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if he has read the statement that a number&#39; of men on board the immigrant ship <inline font-style="italic">Irishman</inline> have been put under arrest? They say that they worked their passage out without receiving wages, but with the promise of a bonus. Does not the honorable gentleman think that that is a barbarous way to bring out immigrants? </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen the statement referred to, nor am I aware that any men are under arrest. I do not think that immigrants should be allowed to work their passages to Australia. That is prohibited under our navigation law. Vessels leaving here could not take away men to work their passage to some other place. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Melbourne mentioned the matter yesterday at question time, and again last evening, and informed me that he intended to make it the subject of a question this morning. In view of his doing so, I have been supplied with the following reply - </para>

                            <para>Yes. I am informed that over fifty cases of measles have occurred during the voyage. It appears that the first case must have been infected before coming on board, and that the other cases were infected from this or other unrecognised cases. It is stated that there was some delay in isolating the first case, and the quarantine officer at Adelaide reports that at his inspection on arrival of the vessel he discovered among the general passengers several cases with the rash already out. It is through such cases that the disease is widely spread through a ship. The vessel is also reported to be not very suitable for the accommodation of a large number of passengers, being essentially a cargo and cattle ship. The space between decks usually used for the cattle trade has been temporarily fitted up for immigrants. The ventilation is reported to be very defective, and I am informed that it is in the presence of such conditions any infectious disease that may break out is specially liable to take on a serious aspect. The hospital accommodation is reported to be very like the quarters for passengers - only a makeshift. I may mention that the amending Quarantine Act is now in force, and the vessel will be dealt with under that Act on her arrival in Sydney. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta) to have an explanation of the largely increased amount set down for the administration of the Land Tax Office. We have here an increase of &#163;25,000 over the actual expenditure of last year. For what can this 50 per cent, increase be ? We were led by honorable members opposite to believe that the land tax, as it became effective for the purpose for which it was imposed, would be a constantly decreasing amount. It is contemplated that there will be a small easing off of the amount collected, yet there is to be an increase of .&#163;25,000 in the cost of collection. Although the tax has been in operation for nearly three years, the Government are still going to collect between &#163;1,300,000 and &#163;1,400,000, the estimated yield to-day being practically the same as when it was first imposed. We may infer from this that the tax has failed in two important respects. It is evident that it has not reduced values, and that it has not broken up large estates to such an extent as to place them without the pale of the tax itself. Last year we voted &#163;70,000 in respect of the Land Tax Office, and only &#163;55,000 was spent. This year we are asked to vote &#163;80,000 in respect of the cost of administering that Department.

                            <para>- The right honorable member is always promising to give me lists of various kinds or other, but I never see one. ^ It is worthy of notice, also, that these Estimates provide for a large increase in the amount payable for maintenance of old-age pensioners in charitable institutions. I thought that, with, their Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, Maternity Grant, and other humanitarian legislation, the Government were going to do away, to a very large extent, with such an item. But we find it growing instead of decreasing, despite all that this Government can do to prevent it. The problem of poverty appears to be increasing under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of my honorable friends opposite. </para>

                            <para>- Another item to which I desire to call attention, relates to interest and sinking fund on inscribed stock. Evidently this Government are beginning to pay interest. I congratulate my right honorable friend on the inauguration of an interest-paying era, and I hope sincerely, for the sake of the pockets of the taxpayers, that we shall pay shortly a little more interest. It is better to pay a little more interest on capital accounts, and so to relieve the taxpayers to some extent from the millions they are paying out of their hard earnings for the purposes of evading legitimate interest payments on the capital accounts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>Then, again, there is to be another advance to the Commonwealth. Bank. I take it that the item of  &#163;60,000  in respect of interest and sinking fund, to which I have just referred, is to pay interest on the loan which was floated last year, or, in other words, interest on the inscribed stock which was authorized to be issued. I presume that the Prime Minister expects during this financial year to spend the whole of last year&#39;s authorization amounting to about  &#163;2,250,000,  and the  &#163;500,000  authorized this year. </para>

JOSEPH COOK.- Will the Prime Minister keep those two rude, uncouth Ministers of his in check, and get them to remember that this is a National Parliament in which we are discussing the Commonwealth finances. Does the Prime Minister intend to present the accounts of this Bank to Parliament? Section 18 of the Commonwealth Bank Act provides that the Governor of the Bank shall furnish to the Treasurer a quarterly statement of the assets and liabilities and of the business of the Bank, which statement shall be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and any such other statements as are prescribed? Has any statement appeared yet, seeing that it is more than three months since the Bank commenced business? </para>

                            <para>- It is about time that we knew what is doing in connexion with the Bank, but at present all we know is that the Governor of the Bank is touring all over Australia, buying huge properties in the various capitals, and we hear talk of sky-scrapers of twenty-two stories in Sydney. However, my time is up, and I shall have to come again for information. </para>

                        <para>.- It has been brought under my notice, though I do not know to what extent the complaint holds good, that some of the assessments have not been made even after two years. The assessments to which I refer are those where a taxpayer has land of his own and  also shares in a company. The Act provides that such a land-owner pays on his own holding and also on his interest in the company, and that interest is added to his own holding for the purposes of valuation, with the result that it may bring him into a higher grade, and force Him to pay a higher tax. </para>

I should like the Treasurer to consider whether the additional revenue that will be derived from this particular source is really worth the money spent in this connexion. </para>

The difficulty is that there has been great delay in arriving at these assessments, no doubt on account of the complicated character of the business that the clerks have to do, and the number of directions they require. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; if the difficulties created by the administration are such as to require the services of a host of lawyers, they must be paid. This . rather points the moral of the argument I am endeavouring to lay before honorable members. For some reason there are complications, but whether this is the fault of the Act or regulations I do not know. Last year the total expenditure was &#163;55,000, while this year it is over &#163;80,000, showing an increase of 50 per cent., when we should naturally have expected the expenditure to be decreasing. This is a matter on which the Committee are entitled to some definite explanation from the Treasurer. If this expenditure, or any considerable portion of it, is to be accounted for by those complicated assessments, it is a matter of serious consideration whether the game is worth the candle. Apart altogether from the merits of the principle underlying the land tax, I do not suppose that even honorable members opposite desire to impose on any section of the people any unnecessary burden. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister has informed the Committee, in reply to the criticism of the honorable member for Flinders, that the extra cost of the Land Tax Department is to be accounted for partly by the permanent appointment of many employes whose positions had been only temporary. For some time I have been endeavouring to have some of the men in the New South Wales office made permanent, but without success. They complain bitterly about being kept in temporary positions, saying that it was unfair that they should have that status, because their duties require the possession of a good deal of technical knowledge, and of an acquaintance with conveyancing law, and are of a strictly confidential nature. The final reply to my letters to the Department was that the desires of the men could not be complied with. Temporary hands may have been made permanent employes in some of the States, but not in the Sydney office. In my opinion it is extraordinary that the cost of the Department should have increased from &#163;55,000 to &#163;80,000. Had it remained at &#163;55,000 the amount would be very large. When the land tax proposals were before us, it was strongly urged in their favour that the collection of the tax would cost very little, because the returns would be furnished by the land-owners under heavy penalties for false statements, and, therefore, only a. very small staff would be needed. It might have been expected, too, that the cost of collection would have been greater in the first year or so before the machinery had been got into full working order than now, and that there would be a decrease instead of an increase in the expense. At first, complications would naturally arise through the staff being new to its duties, and many unforeseen difficulties would crop up. I understand, however, that the cost of collection is increasing by leaps and bounds, and this year will amount to 25 per cent, more than it did last year. I indorse the remarks which have been made by the honorable member for Parramatta about the unwisdom of erecting enormous buildings for banking premises throughout the Commonwealth. We have no warrant for the expenditure of huge sums on sky-scrapers for the accommodation of the Commonwealth Bank, seeing that it has yet no business. The honorable member pointed out, too, that the Act requires the production of a quarterly return, and that no such return has been made. The Commonwealth Bank is going to compete with the private banks throughout Australia, and yet we cannot be told what business it is doing. At the same time, the Governor is making arrangements for the purchase of blocks of land at enormous prices, and the erection of costly premises all over the Commonwealth. It is not sound that this matter should be intrusted wholly to one man. No one would cast any reflection on the Governor, but one man should not have the responsibility of expending huge sums of Government money. Very often the result of throwing temptation in the way is the downfall of the person tempted, and while I think that the Governor is a man of integrity and honour, I feel it is not right that the business of the country should be conducted in this way.- Some other method should be followed in connexion with land purchases. The way in which the affairs of the bank have been conducted so far do not reflect credit on those responsible for the scheme. They have been conducted in a slipshod fashion, which in the end &#34;will probably bring serious loss on the people of Australia. It was a mistake to establish a Commonwealth Bank to compete with the private banks already in existence. The Commonwealth Bank cannot hope to compete successfully with the long established private banks. </para>

                            <para>- We have had very little information given to us regarding these Estimates, so that it is hard to understand them. The Prime Minister has explained that the contribution to charitable institutions has been increased in connexion with the maintenance of old-age pensioners by those institutions, but I fail to see why there should be an increase from &#163;7,000 to &#163;9,000 a year. It was taken for granted that under a Labour Government very little charitable expenditure would be needed, but apparently for the maintenance of pensioners in institutions &#163;2,000 more is required this year than last. I do not complain of the expenditure of money on charity of this kind. We should spend all that is needed to alleviate the sufferings of the aged and infirm, but I cannot think that this increase in expenditure is necessary. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for North Sydney has spoken somewhat unfairly of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The honorable gentleman, as a man possessing business knowledge,, must know that it takes time to establish a bank, and that an immense expenditure has been necessary to put the private banks into their present positions. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is evidently possessed of one of the essentials to success - confidence in the future of the institution that he is managing. If he had not that confidence he would have no right to his position. The private banks may well have nothing good to say of the Commonwealth -.Bank, because undoubtedly it will compete strongly with them. The Governor has, however, treated the State Savings Banks more than fairly by offering a lower rate of interest than they are offering. This action should! inspire confidence. The State Savings Banks have already enormous sums invested, and their expenses are not so great as they were at the beginning, so that they can perhaps afford to pay interest at the rate of 3J or 4 per cent. But had* the Governor of the Commonwealth Savings Bank offered a big rate of interest,. I should have felt a little alarmed because it would have looked like &#34; wildcat&#34; financing. He should be praised5 for what he has done. No doubt, when the bank is well established, and the initial&#39; cost of establishing it has been met, he will gradually increase the rate of interest, arid1 begin to compete more largely with the State Savings Banks. He will have every right to the business he gets if the people choose to deposit their money in the Commonwealth instead of in the State Savings Banks. Regarding the complaint that there has been no quarterly return of the business of the bank, I would point out that it is only the Commonwealth Savings Bank that has commenced business, and? that the general bank will not be open before 1st January next. When that bank has been opened, and is in full swing, I shall join with those who demand quarterly statements of its&#34; business. But the Governor must first be given an opportunity to get things in order. I agree with those who say that the cost of collecting the land tax should Be carefully scrutinized, but I am. prepared to- strengthen the hands of the Minister in obtaining more effective valuations. The evasion of land tax by the making of unfair valuations is as old as land taxation. I am not enthusiastic regarding 4he results of the Land Tax Act. Undoubtedly it has done some good an breaking up big estates ; but I am not satisfied with, its effect in some localities, and local residents admit that it has not been effective there. The suspicion has entered my mind that the chief reason for the ineffectiveness of the tax in those districts is that there has been a dodging of proper valuations. The valuations should be increased to something Hike the level of the prices demanded &#39; for the land which is being cut up. These men are defeating closer settlement by asking enormous prices for their land. They are quite willing to pay land tax on a valuation of &#163;3 per acre, but in offering it to the public they demand from &#163;6 to &#163;8 an acre for it. </para>

                            <para>- Then to make (the matter clear to the honorable member, let me say that sometimes a man who has valued his land at &#163;3 per acre for land tax purposes, asks &#163;7 an acre for it when he proceeds to subdivide it, the increase representing only  &#163;1  per acre for improvements. I contend that valuations are dodged in all directions. Very considerable savings might be effected if the Commonwealth, the States, and the shire councils interested in securing correct valuations were to co-operate so as to secure a uniform scheme. Such a scheme carried out by a well organized Land Tax Office, could be utilized by all concerned as the basis for collecting land tax, and very considerable savings could be effected on the cost of administration. Like others who have advocated this tax, I am tied fast to an exemption of  &#163;5,000  unimproved value, and if I altered my mind in that regard I should have to resign my seat in this Parliament. At the same time I am also pledged to make the tax thoroughly effective. I therefore urge the Treasurer to stand to his guns, and to see that effective valuations are secured, even if the cost of administration is slightly increased. </para>

                            <para>- In that respect the honorable member appears to differ from many of his party, who boasted at the beginning of the session that last year, as the result of the operation of this tax,  &#163;22,000,000  worth of land had been subdivided. I do not ascribe to the operation of the tax any such beneficial result. My own opinion is that if large estates had been cut. up to the extent suggested by honorable members opposite, we should not have had this year - as the Treasurer estimates to receive - a revenue within  &#163;5,000  of the amount derived from this source during the first year of the operation of the tax. It seems to me that the increase of  &#163;25,000  in the cost of administering the Department is unwarranted. If, as a result of the tax, large estates are being cut up, the cost of administration should be reduced, and if from year to year the revenue from this source is to decrease, there is no reason why the cost of administration should be increased. It is an unbusinesslike procedure to convert a number of temporary assessors into permanent employes of the Department. When the Land Tax Bill was before us, we were told that we were going to avoid a very heavy expenditure by the introduction of the self-assessment system. The Bill provided- for the most barbarous penalties where land-holders failed to send in correct assessments, but the assessment notices were no sooner circulated than a whole army of assessors was sent out to check the assessment made by the owners. Either the self-assessment system is a farce, or there, is no necessity to appoint a lot of permanent assessors. In Tasmania we have State assessors as well as Commonwealth assessors, dealing with land valuations, and it seems to me that if this tax is  to be as effective as we were told it would be, there should be a lightening of these burdens. As to the suggestion that incorrect valuations are sent in, I believe that people have done their best to put before the Commissioner fair valuations of their property. If that were not so, we should have heard of many prosecutions. </para>

                            <para>- And some of the valuers who have been appointed are not experts. On the whole, I think that the land-holders have made out their returns, quite honestly, and as well as could be expected. That being so, it is strange that so many assessors should be appointed to travel round the country checking valuations. In passing the Bill, we believed we should avoid considerable expense by providing for self-assessments. Had we not thought so, I do not think that we should have agreed to the system. The New Zealand Government found, after a time, that the self-assessment system was liable to a great deal of abuses - that owners of land far removed from railways arid other means of communication could undervalue their properties with impunity, knowing that there was not much likelihood of the Government ever demanding its surrender, whereas those owning land in favorable localities placed a high valuation on it in the hope that the Government would give them 10 per cent, on their valuations, and take it over. Either the land-owners ought to be relieved of the necessity of furnishing returns to the Commissioner every twelve months, or permanent assessors ought not to be required. If we are to have permanent assessors, let them make the assessments, and let us give the owners the right of appeal. Land-holders would not object to the retention of these officers by the Department if they were relieved of the trouble of making up the annual returns. As to the increases that have been made in certain assessments, I understand that in some cases a decision has not yet been arrived at, although two years have elapsed since the Act was passed. I am informed that some time ago the Department found it practically impossible to assess certain values in cases where men held interests in land as well as in insurance and other companies. The complications with which the Department were confronted in these cases made it difficult to arrive at a decision, and I understand that where they, did come to a determination to make an increase the revenue obtained was barely sufficient to justify the work involved in securing it. It is exceedingly difficult to determine what is the unimproved value of certain land interests. The only other matter to which I desire to refer is the Commonwealth Bank. I hope that when it is well established, the quarterly return, which the Governor is required to furnish under the Act, will be promptly presented, so that honorable members wilt be able to see for themselves what progress is being made by the institution. </para>

                        <para>.- I am rather inclined to agree with the honorable member for New England, that whilst we are all anxious that the provisions of the Commonwealth Bank Act passed last session shall be complied with, it must &#39;be recognised that the Governor has been busily engaged in organizing work since his appointment, and that this is probably the reason why the first quarterly return has not been furnished as promptly as some honorable members would have liked. In view of that fact, I think that some slight margin should be allowed. </para>

                            <para>- I think it&#39; was opened on the 15th July., and it is gratifying to know that in Victoria alone deposits amounting to &#163;350,000 have been made with the Savings Bank branch, an interesting feature of the business being that withdrawals are exceptionally small. This fact proves, to my mind, that even those outside the ranks of the workers are placing money on fixed deposit with the Bank. Then, again, in Queensland, where the Savings Bank branch has been in operation for less than two months, the deposits amount to, I think, about &#163;1.50,000. This shows, to my mind, that the people thoroughly appreciate the system. I met, the other day, an old friend of mine whose confidence in the Bank was such that he had just deposited &#163;100 in it, and I am sure  that, before long, such deposits will be general. I am confident that when the general Bank is opened it will do excellent business. As it is, we have made a very good start. The Governor is not advertising the Bank by means of large posters and placards all over the country. </para>

The Victorian branch of the Bank is being carried on in an obscure building in Collins-street ; the name is painted in modest letters on the window, and? there is nothing to suggest that deposits will be received there. The Governor is moving along modestly and quietly, and I rather admire him for his action; but, notwithstanding that there has been no blare of trumpets, the people are sending along their deposits. </para>

                    <para>I do not know how many valuers have been appointed in the various States, but it is only a little over twelve months since they were appointed in Victoria. In the first year of the -Land Tax the owners were called upon to make their own valuations, and then valuers were to be appointed in each State to revise them. In many cases in Victoria considerable increases have been made in the valuations, particularly in the fertile Western District. It is a great pity that we cannot prevent the multiplication of officers in this connexion. In New Zealand, where, of course, they have the advantage of only one Government, one set of men make the municipal, the Dominion land tax, and the probate valuations; and such an arrangement, of course means considerable saving. I believe that in New South Wales all the municipalities outside Sydney base their rating on unimproved values, and, that being so, I think all the assessments - municipal, Federal, and :State - might be made by one set of men. In Victoria, the Federal and State taxes are imposed on the unimproved value, so one set of officers should carry out both valuations. Unfortunately, however, the jealousy of State Righters continues to cost the taxpayers of the country considerable sums of money. </para>

                            <para>- As to that, when I have addressed meetings, some of them in the honorable member&#39;s constituency, people have been astonished when they have learned that the Federal Treasurer offered the State Treasurers 75 per cent, of all the new business while leaving the old business undisturbed, and even a proportion of the remaining 25 per cent., while permitting the post-offices and postal officials to be used for the banking business. When the people realize the true position of affairs, they will not be able to understand why such a munificent offer was not accepted by the various State Treasurers. It is true that we looked forward to the expenses of the collection of the land tax being a light burden on the Commonwealth. We find that in Victoria the cost of collecting the State Land Tax on unimproved values in 1911-12 was &#163;24,349, on a revenue of &#163;293,823, and on an estimated revenue for 1912-13 of &#163;290,000, or nearly &#163;4,000 less than in the previous year, the expenses are expected to amount <inline font-style="italic">10 &#163;3&#176;i538-</inline> The Treasurer has promised to explain fully how the &#163;80,000 required to collect the Federal Land Tax is made up. The figures quoted in regard to State tax collection would appear to show that there may be several influences at work which would lead to an increase. A very fair comparison can be made between Victoria and the Commonwealth as a whole in this connexion, because the State Land Tax and the Federal Land Tax, both on an unimproved value basis, were imposed about the same time. In the State, valuers had to be appointed and, of course, they cost money, but I would like to point out that the cost of collection in the case of the State is over 8 per cent., and in the case of the Commonwealth it is less than 4 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but the  Commonwealth Land Tax covers the whole of this continent, whereas Victoria is only a small State - one fact counteracts the other.. In the case of the vast stretches.  of land in Western Australia, for instance, a valuer could not be expected to cover them in the same time and at the same cost as he could cover the smaller spaces in Victoria. Honorable members may take the figures I have quoted for what they are worth, but they prove, at any rate, that the cost of collecting the Commonwealth tax is about half the percentage of the cost in the case of the State. I shall be glad to read the first report of the Governor of the Bank, and I feel confident that, with a shrewd Scotchman at the Treasury the expenses will be kept down to a minimum. </para>

However, I notice amongst the. items in this division one relating to the sugar industry; and I should like to know when the report of the Sugar Commission is likely to be presented ? </para>

                            <para>- The Government have announced that on the presentation of the report they will take it into consideration, and then announce their policy. I take it that, under ordinary circumstances, the Queensland Parliament will rise in the first or second week in December, and that we shall not sit much longer than the seconder third week. It will be remembered that the Premier of Queensland informed the Prime Minister that if the bounty and Excise were abolished, he would be prepared to introduce consequential legislation in the State Parliament. </para>

At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that public meetings are being held in the different centres, strong opinions are being expressed, and that they represent the only method at present of ascertaining public opinion. I urge the Prime Minister to expedite this matter. </para>

They intend to turn the remainder of the land to such other use as they can manage to do themselves. </para>

                            <para>- The companies have paid the tax, and so have private individuals holding land, but shareholders in companies and banks have also to be assessed, and do not know what tax they will have to pay. An honorable member to whom I spoke was amazed to learn that he is liable for two years&#39; taxation. It will probably cost more to collect this tax than will be received, because the difficulties in the way of its collection are enormous. I ask the Prime Minister, therefore, to consider whether it is worth while to collect it. Although honorable members opposite wish to tax the big estates I do not think that they wish to penalize people. When the tax comes to be collected many persons will be unable to pay it, because they will have spent their incomes not knowing of it.- </para>

                            <para>- A matter to which T wish to draw attention is, I think, of importance. The writer deals with the question, how to meet a crisis. Banking crises occur periodically, and the proper time for legislating in regard to them is a time of peace and prosperity. In the Old Country it has been customary, when crises arrive, to suspend the bank charter, and make notes legal tender. It is usually not that the depositors are frightened that they will not get their money, but that they fear that others will get in before them, and that they will have to wait. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> writer says that the Government, having control of the note issue, it is not possible to give the relief which is given in England.In 1893 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Dibbs made the notes of the banks legal tender in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the Government will seriously consider the suggestion of the honorable member for Darling Downs regarding the sugar industry. In the Moreton division a number of small farmers grow cane as a side crop, and they naturally desire definite information as to what is to be done in order to know whether it will be worth while to continue growing cane. The present uncertainty is playing havoc with the sugar industry throughout Australia. I should like the Prime Minister to urge the Commissioners to send him an advance report as early as possible. The relations between this Government and that of Queensland seem to be strained, though I am at a loss to know why, because they are both interested in the sugar industry, and should try to work harmoniously to settle the important questions affecting it. Unless matters are expedited&#34;, nothing will be done during the present session of this or the Queensland Parliament, in which case there will be another twelve months&#39; delay, much to the detriment of the sugar industry. </para>

                    <para>I wish to know what provision is made for reimbursing charitable institutions for the maintenance of old-age pensioners. I know of one or two cases in which old-age pensioners have had their pensions stopped while they have been in hospitals, but what I am referring to is the complaint of the institutions that they get no assistance from the Government for maintaining old-age pensioners, and I understand that pensioners have been refused admission to some institutions on that ground. In a leaflet circulated on behalf of the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum on Hospital Saturday and Sunday, it is stated that the cost of maintaining the inmates is &#163;21 3s.  9¾d per  head per annum, an increase on the cost of previous years. The increase was due mainly to the higher prices of provisions, and to the fact that the institution has had to take in old-age pensioners, in most instances in a deplorable and dying condition, so that they must be placed in a hospital, where the expense of maintaining them is more than would have to be spent were they ordinary inmates.

                        <para>An impression exists  that the asylum gains by receiving old-age pensioners; this is a mistake. The fact is the institution does not benefit one penny from their pensions ; but, on the other hand, is put to a great expense, not only for maintenance, nursing, and medical attention, but with burial expenses, which is no small item. This institution is almost daily relieving the Melbourne, Alfred, St. Vincent, and other hospitals of cases, so that they can make room for more serious and urgent cases. These cases can obtain all the medical attention and nursing necessary in the asylum that their condition requires. </para>

                    <para class="block">These institutions publish to the people of Victoria the statement that they are hampered rather than benefited by taking in old-age pensioners. I think that in the interests of these sufferers, the amount of the pensions should at least be given teethe institutions so that we may secure for them as much relief as possible. The Minister does not appear to be very much interested in this subject, but I hope that he will see that these public institutions receive the pensions payable to inmates if they do not already obtain some allowance in regard to them. </para>

That Commission dealt with fire and life assurance, and also, I believe, with social insurance. </para>

Strong representations have been made regarding the necessity for a uniform law, more especially in relation to life assurance. Life assurance companies, which, for the most part are conducted on the mutual principle, have cast upon them a costly duty in having to prepare annually six different sets of returns in respect of the six States of the Union. In this way a costly burden is being imposed upon policy holders, which could be avoided by means of a uniform law. The hope has been expressed that some uniform system will be devised, and the whole procedure simplified. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me to be an anomaly that whereas the cost of administering the invalid and old-age pensions system is only  &#163;43,875,  the cost of administering the Land Tax Act is nearly twice as much. We were told when the Land Tax Bill was before us that one of the advantages of such a tax was that it cost very little to collect, and yet, notwithstanding that the returns have to be sent in by land-owners themselves, we are asked this year to vote  &#163;80,000  in respect of land tax administration. Very great dissatisfaction exists throughout the Commonwealth regarding the way in which the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is being administered, and the discontent is most marked in relation to the administration of the invalid pensions branch. I have brought several cases of great hardship before the authorities. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that before we proceed with business we should have a Minister present. I, therefore, call attention to the want of a quorum <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed&#93;.</inline> I regret the absence of the Treasurer, because there are in these Estimates, relating to his Department, two or three items to which I desire to call attention. In the first place there is an item of  &#163;800  in respect of note printing. I wish to know when these notes are likely to be put into circulation, and how many are to be printed. I have seen some of the samples, and the printing, design and general appearance, are certainly excellent. Some of the designs are most artistic, and will not be a discredit to the Commonwealth as samples of our first venture into the realms of note printing. In view of the fact that the printing and issue will mark an historical epoch in the progress of the Commonwealth, as well as a distinct departure from the established practice in Australia, I should like the Treasurer to consider a suggestion that a complete set of cancelled notes be given to each member of the Parliament. They would form an interesting and historical souvenir, and if properly cancelled there could be no danger of their getting into circulation. I suggest that the first  11 1  notes printed should be cancelled and distributed as souvenirs amongst members of the Parliament. I am not quite certain, but I think that the notes have been designed and printed in Australia. </para>

                            <para>-  I understand, however, that a plant is being obtained, and that experts are being engaged to do the work in Australia. Although the samples so far available have been executed in the Old Country, the notes to be issued to the public will be printed in Australia. If that be so, then honorable members would certainly appreciate the adoption of the suggestion I have made. There is precedent for it, inasmuch as in connexion with the first Commonwealth stamp issue, sets of cancelled stamps were issued to honorable members, whilst on the introduction of the Commonwealth silver coinage the first  11 1  shillings struck were distributed amongst members. I hope that the Minister temporarily in charge of these Estimates will convey my suggestion to the Treasurer, and that he will indorse it. As to the item &#34; Additional Clerical and General Division Officers,  &#163;700,&#34;  I wish to know whether these officers are to be employed temporarily or permanently. The growing practice of appointing large staffs of temporary assistants in the Clerical and General Divisions&#39; of the Service is not a good one. Experience has shown it to be a great mistake. Just at a time when labour of the kind becomes most valuable to the Commonwealth is the very time it has to be dispensed with. Under the Public Service Act, a temporary employe&#39; may be employed for only six months, and, only in very special circumstances, for another three months in any one year, and it very often happens that such employes have to be discharged when additional assistance is required late in the year when the Christmas season is approaching,. The trouble in dispensing with the services of temporary  employes  in this way is that permanent officers have to be detached from their ordinary duties, and devote much time to instructing the newcomers, and this gives rise to general disorganization. As a matter of fact, the temporary employes, instead of being of assistance in the various Departments, are, for a considerable time, an absolute hindrance. I should like to know whether the additional officers provided for are to be permanent or temporary. As to lending and borrowing, it would be interesting to know whether it is intended by the Government, in their newly-established policies, to borrow the deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank in order to meet some of the commitments for which it is now desired to raise money. The honorable member for Darling Downs endeavoured to elicit some information, but the Treasurer was very reticent and unwilling to impart any. If the Treasurer&#39;s purpose is to borrow the people&#39;s savings for some of the projects on account of which the Loan Bill was recently passed, it may prove a further cause of stringency in the local money market. Indeed, I am surprised that the Government have launched out with a borrowing policy, because I see that no later than the last general election a great parade was made of the fact that the Labour policy was a non-borrowing one. </para>

                            <para>- In a circular issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jelley,</inline> a defeated Labour candidate, the public were asked to &#34; compare the non-borrowing policy &#34; of the Labour party with the borrowing started by the Liberal party, and were asked to vote for Jelley in order to keep the Commonwealth &#34; free of debt.&#34; As a matter of fact, however, under a Labour Government we are getting more and more into debt every day. It was not until the present Treasurer took charge of the finances that the Commonwealth was involved in any borrowing. The Liberal Government carried out all public works by means of the ordinary revenue, and when they made a proposal to borrow, even for naval purposes, there was an outcry by honorable members opposite. </para>

The leaflet is one continual denunciation of the Liberal party for engaging in a policy of borrowing. It is pointed out in the leaflet that before the advent of the Labour party the States under Liberal Administrations had borrowed &#163;251,773,000, and this was condemned as unsound finance.

The Government started their career with a forced loan from the people on the note issue. One of their first acts, it will be seen, was to throw overboard the whole of their non-borrowing policy, and all their professions on the public platform. Many honorable members opposite secured their seats by appealing to the credulity and lack of knowledge of the people who returned them, and how woefully they have been deceived. We have the Treasurer not only borrowing, but starting as a money lender, and I expect before the close of the session to see three golden balls hanging in the portico of Parliament House with the legend, &#34; Money lent on good security.&#34; I do not think it is proper for a Government to do work of this kind, which should be left to private enterprise. </para>

                            <para>- It is the Labour Government who are playing the part of &#34; Ikey Mo,&#34; and what I am concerned about is the depletion of the local gold reserves and the savings of the people, mostly of the wage-earning classes. There is a risk of increased financial tightness if this system, inaugurated by the present Government, is continued. Already, through local borrowing, in New South Wales and elsewhere, the money market has tightened wonderfully, and private investors find it most difficult to obtain advances in order to carry out their enterprises. The Government would have been well advised if they had raised their loans, as previously, from British investors, but British investors, with the present outlook, as a result of Labour administration, are very loth to find the money. As a matter of fact, New South Wales had to go to a foreign money-lender, and enjoy the peculiar distinction of being the first Government in Australia to raise a loan in a foreign market. I am certain we are on the wrong track in the management of our Trust Funds and loans from Trust Funds, and we shall presently find ourselves tied in a knot. In the event of a crash we shall find the trouble accentuated, and not relieved, by what is happening now. I do not desire to see the Commonwealth of Australia in such a position, but we are fast approaching a crisis, if we follow the lines laid down by the State and Commonwealth Labour  Governments. I see that the Treasurer&#39;s Advances has been increased from  &#163;400,000  last year to  &#163;500,000  for this year. It will be noted that of the  &#163;400,000  voted last year none was expended, and I should like some explanation why, under the circumstances, this amount has been increased to enable the Treasurer, according to a note on the Estimates, to make advances to public officers, and to meet expenditure, the particulars of which will afterwards be included in a parliamentary appropriation. We have no information in this connexion, and apparently are not going to get any until after the money is spent, or we are pledged to spend it. Apparently it is not supposed to be the function of the Government to take any notice of Opposition criticism, or to afford any information, although we have to represent our constituents even to a greater extent than have honorable members opposite. I understand that all these matters are arranged in another place upstairs, and that Parliament is only a secondary consideration; but from the point of view of courtesy alone, members of the Opposition are entitled to be furnished with information regarding the spending of the money they are called upon to vote. Only the most casual references are made by the Treasurer to the expenditure of his Department, although it amounts to hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the Estimates, altogether, represent millions. The same policy of reticence is adopted in regard to all the Departments, and information has to be dragged out piecemeal in a series of questions which ought not to be necessary. We ought to be given full information as to the financial position of the Treasurer&#39;s Department - the commitments, the requirements for the current year - and, if necessary, there should be memoranda supplying the details. As it is, we have to dig and delve as best we may in order to search out the various items, which in many cases are covered up in such a way as to elude our vigilance. I should like information on some other points, but at present I will leave the matter in the hope that it will be supplied by the Treasurer or by some other Minister. The Treasurer himself does not seem to attach the slightest interest or importance to the opinion of Parliament, or to the criticisms offered even by Opposition leaders and the  financial experts of our party. The right honorable gentleman waves all criticism aside in an airy way on the principle  of  the interjection by the honorable member for Maranoa the other day when he told us &#34; Not to worry.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- And allow the Estimates to slip through without any consideration? Personally, that is what I should feel inclined to do - to meet discourtesy with discourtesy - but I have to recognise a higher obligation, not only to the Treasurer and to Parliament, but to those who sent me here to look after their interests. It is in the interests of my constituents that I am making these few remarks, and I do not desire to go before them and confess that I voted millions without the remotest knowledge of the purposes for which they were intended. </para>

                        <para>. - There is some misconception as to the purpose of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. The Treasurer is not empowered to expend money in excess of the appropriations for particular items, but, it being impossible to foresee a year&#39;s transactions, it is necessary to provide a sum out of which to meet emergencies. The Treasurer is authorized to make advances with regard to necessary work, and &#163;500,000, the sum now provided for the purpose, is less proportionately than the &#163;200,000 that was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner. </para>

                            <para>- Very nearly. It has never been suggested, during my term of office, that any of this expenditure has had a political purpose, and I should be no party to such expenditure. The Constitution does not permit us to obtain money other than by an appropriation of this kind, and the appropriations of Parliament are not exceeded even when the total Advance is spent. </para>

                            <para>- No. The suggestion that honorable members should be given specimen copies of the new note requires consideration. Banks, in this and other countries, have cancelled notes by perforating them, but some of these notes have afterwards been successfully circulated, being accepted by the cleverest tellers, because the perforations have been so cleverly filled up. Consequently, it is now often the practice when a note has been cancelled to cut a piece off it. I should not like to give a reply to the honorable member for Lang until I had obtained expert advice regarding his suggestion. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> is a very active man, and an excellent officer, and has a good deal to do.  His  first business was to examine the machinery, and to ascertain the best firms from which to get paper. That he did before leaving England. Since then he has had to inspect the premises to be used, especially with a view to providing absolute security. Honorable members can see that it is almost as necessary to prevent the stealing of the unprinted as of the printed paper, and to prevent access to the machinery. We have a building which is being strengthened and fitted up with protective appliances and equipped with the necessary strong room&#39;s and safes. </para>

                            <para>- They have been sitting for a good many months, but there seems to be no end to their inquiries. Of course, they are somewhat handicapped while Parliament is in session, but they are costing a good deal. It may be that we shall find it necessary in the future to insist upon each Royal Commission reporting within a fixed time. The Sugar Commission, although its investigation is an important one, ought to have nearly finished its work. </para>

A copy has already been laid on the table of the House. The information so furnished is to the effect that where a child lives for more than twelve hours nothing further is necessary on the part of the applicant than to fill in the ordinary forms, and to send them, together with the certificate of registration, to the Treasurer. If the information so supplied  is satisfactory, the  application  is at once granted. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, and we have prescribed the manner in which this may be done. Forms have been drawn up to simplify the whole procedure. The officers of the Treasury dealing with the maternity allowance are not confined to that branch of work. They are general Treasury officials of good standing, capable of dealing with financial matters, and of determining whether an application is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> just as a banker, by reason of his experience, has usually little difficulty in determining the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of certain- documents. The real difficulty arises in the case of stillborn children or those who live for less than twelve hours. In the case of a stillborn child, a medical certificate that it was a viable child must be provided if there is a medical man in the district, but where a doctor is not available a qualified nurse or other witness must certify. We have to take these precautions against the possibility of abuse of a most serious kind; the Commissioner must be satisfied in all oases that the application is a <inline font-style="italic">bondfide</inline> one. The honorable member asked whether we were using the State machinery, and I am glad to be able to inform him that all the States have agreed to their registrars co-operating with us in this matter. We are making them a small allowance for the work done. The expenditure on the administration of this fund will represent so low a percentage on the actual amount distributed that it is hardly worth mentioning. The desire is to make the payment as expeditious as possible. Where the papers sent in are in order, a money order will be sent out immediately upon their receipt. As the Act came into operation before the whole of the machinery was in readiness, there may be at first some strained cases, but later on the whole procedure will be simplicity itself. </para>

                        <para>- There is in this division an item relating to coinage, and in connexion with it I should like to refer to a paragraph published in the newspapers some little time ago to the effect that the Commonwealth Government intended to introduce a nickel coin. If any nickel coins be introduced, I trust that the Treasurer will see that they have a hole punched through them. In some countries which I recently visited the nickel coins in use were larger than the silver coinage, although, of course, of less value, and the fact that a hole was punched through them enabled one to distinguish between the two without any difficulty whatever. One of the first statements I read in -the press on reaching the United States of America was that a proposition had been made to adopt the principle followed in Belgium and elsewhere, where a round hole is punched in a nickel coin, so that even if such a coin is of the same size as a silver coin carried in one&#39;s pocket, one can distinguish between the two by the touch. It is recognised throughout the world that nickel coins should have a hole in the centre in order that they may be readily distinguished from others. Usually the hole in such coins is about three-sixteenths of an inch, and I am told that the Belgian practice is to be adopted in the United States. </para>

                        <para>.- In the early days of Commonwealth coinage I favoured the use of nickel coins of low denomination, and, in reply to the honorable member for Capricornia, who has since impressed upon the Government the desirableness of their adoption, I have said that we favour their use. I do not agree with the honorable member for Fremantle, however., that nickel coins should have a hole punched through them. In Italy, and, I think, in India, the nickel coins in use have a carved flowing edge, beautiful in design, which sufficiently distinguishes them from the silver coinage, with a plain or a milled edge. I think that we should have a more artistic looking nickel coin, if, instead of punching a hole through it, we made it with a round flowing edge. Nickel coins are particularly necessary in hot countries, where people do not wish to carry heavy coppers in light dress. </para>

                        <para>. - This seems to be one of the first opportunities that the Estimates offer to the Committee to deal with a matter which, in a general way, has been ventilated and discussed, not only during the financial debate in this House, but from the public platform, as well as in the press. I refer to the extraordinary increase in the current expenditure of the public Departments. When we have debated this matter generally we have been met with the statement that we were indulging in generalizations, and that we would not condescend to go into details. That is an accusation which can be met only by endeavouring to deal with the particulars when they come before us. </para>

                            <para>- I have endeavoured to go into details and they have not been altogether agreeable to my honorable friends opposite. We have in this vote several instances of very unusual and extraordinary increases for the ordinary administration of the Department. I wish to discuss this matter for the reason that whenever we engage in general criticism of the advancing expenditure &#34;required for the carrying on of the government, honorable members on the other side, either in this House or on the platform, accuse us of being opposed to such matters as the payment of old-age pensions and other proposals involving increases of expenditure which the public have demanded. We have our own views upon those matters; but what I am dealing with at present has nothing to do with any increases in expenditure due to the adoption of such proposals, but with increases in the ordinary expenditure involved in carrying on the Department. </para>

But when we find towards the expiration of a period of abnormally good times that in one year the expense of carrying on, for instance, the Accounts Branch of the Treasury increases by 23 per cent., we get something which requires a little investigation, and something which is not fully accounted for by the simple assertion that we are having good times now. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to items which appear on the same page of the Estimates of the Treasury Department - the Accounts Branch, the Correspondence Branch, and Contingencies. I leave out the Australian Notes Branch, because that is a new matter, and is readily accounted for. I invite the honorable gentleman&#39;s attention to these very striking figures. If we compare the estimate of the vote required for the Accounts Branch for 1911-12 - because the actual expenditure is not given - with the estimate for the current financial year, we shall find that it has risen from &#163;4,748 to  &#163;5,607,  or an increase of about 23 per cent. The vote for the next item, the Correspondence Branch, &#39; has risen from &#163;2,317 to &#163;2,627. The advance there has not been so great, and represents an increase of about 1  5  per cent. . If we compare the estimate for the Correspondence Branch with the similar vote for 1909-10, immediately before the present Government came into office, we shall find that the expenditure for the same work has risen considerably. </para>

                            <para>- Practically the same work. The work of the Correspondence Branch of the Central Office of the Treasury cannot have been enormously increased merely because we are getting more revenue. It should increase a little, no doubt, but the increase should not be in anything like the same ratio as the increase in the revenue. The increase in the cost of this branch of the Department is shown to be from &#163;1,777in 1909-10 to &#163;2,627 for the current financial year. Let us now consider the expenditure upon contingencies. The vote in each case covers practically the same things - allowance to State officers, office cleaning, postage, telegrams, office requisites, and so forth - the ordinary contingencies of a Public Department. The vote for contingencies in 1909-10 was &#163;4,403, and it has now gone up to &#163;6,245.That is to say,thatinthree years the vote has been increased by about 45 per cent. Can any honorable member dismiss that fact altogether from his mind by merely saying &#34; Times are better, therefore we are spending more? The revenue has increased, therefore there is greater expenditure upon Contingencies in the Treasury?&#34; Is that a way in which to account for the increase? It is not an answer to the objection to say that public officers must get increments. We all know that; but in any well-regulated Public Service in which increments of salary are granted in the ordinary way, one would naturally expect that, after some years of working, as young men come in and old men leave the Service, a fairly even annual payment for the whole of the officers in a Department would have been arrived at. After eleven years of Federation, we might expect to have arrived at a stage at which, making full allowance for all increases of pay in the ordinary course, a somewhat uniform annual expenditure upon a particular Department would be arrived at. Sometimes, of course, we must employ more men, and there will be some increase in correspondence, or in the amount necessary for contingencies ; but I submit that an increase in the Contingency branch of this Department of 45 per cent, in three years is a matter which calls for consideration. </para>

                            <para>-  At the time the honorable gentleman is referring to, there was very little work involved in the payment of old-age pensions to be provided for, there was no maternity allowance, and no big works in hand. All these matters involve clerical work. The note issue involves a great deal of clerical work, as well as the work of accountants. The honorable gentleman forgets that some very important services have been established since the time to which&#39; he refers. </para>

                            <para>- When I attempt to arrive at the truth, I am told, in effect, that I have a motive in desiring to eliminate the Public Service Commissioner from this discussion. But I really do not think that such interjections carry very much weight. The Treasurer will admit that if there is a reason for this great increase in the ordinary expenses of government, that reason ought to be presented to the Committee by himself. We have had three Budget-statements from him, and in not one of them have I been able to find any explanation of the increases which have taken place in this Department. There has merely been a general statement that there has been more work to do. I wish to know why, in the Accounts Branch of the Treasury, for instance, there is an immense increase in the expenditure for 1912-13 as compared with that for 1911-12. Why has that expenditure increased by 23 per cent, in one year? Surely the Treasurer might honour the Committee with his confidence in regard to these matters. It is idle for him to accuse us of talking generalities if he will not give us information upon specific points. We might expect an increase in the Correspondence Branch in three years, though it would surprise me. to learn that there is any good reason - unless the Treasurer, who is in a position to know the facts, can furnish one - for an increase of about 45 per cent. It seems very large. The difficulty is not that we are prepared to condemn these increases, but that we have not the materials on which to form a satisfactory opinion. </para>

                            <para>- The Correspondence Branch of the Treasury has been in existence for eleven years. Are these Departmental branches to be so managed that we may expect increases of 20 and 25 per cent, in each succeeding year ? Of course, the answer must be that the work of the Correspondence Branch has not increased to such an extent. There is, I suppose, practically the same amount of work to be done, but we are paying 15 per cent, more for it this year than we did last, and 45 per cent, more than we did a few years ago. </para>

                            <para>- That may be a complete answer. The Treasurer may be able to assure the Committee that the same officers have been employed, but that the increases are due to increments. Possibly we shall have to accept that answer. But that does not apply in the slightest degree to the enormous increase in the vote for contingencies. The Minister of External Affairs smiles. Contingencies mean something to him. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not think the Minister of External Affairs is much troubled about anything as long as the revenue is coming in, and he is allowed to develop his own ideas unrestrained. When we come to deal with the Estimates of his Department, we may have something to say that will affect him more closely. The instances that I have given are typical of the increases throughout the whole Service. One can expect that there should be some increases, but these appear to be out of all proportion to the amount of work done or the amount of revenue received. I think the Treasurer might give honorable members a little more information than he has ever yet done, either in his Budget Speeches or by statements in Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Flinders set out with the object of showing that there has been extravagance in connexion with this Department, and he was going to put his finger on some particular point to show where&#39; the extravagance existed. My retort to him was that all the officers concerned had received increases in consequence of the action of the Public Service Commissioner. It is his duty to prescribe the number of officers that a Department requires for the particular work that has to be done. </para>

                            <para>- The Government need not employ additional officers, or they may employ more than the Public Service Commissioner recommends ; but if the Government do take exception to the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s certificate, they have to bring down their reasons to this Parliament, and lay them upon the table of the House. The honorable member for Flinders knows that. I will say this for the Public Service Commissioner : that, whatever other complaints may be made regarding him, he is certainly a diligent student of the work that is being performed by the Commonwealth Departments ; and no Department gets an additional officer, and no officer gets an increase in his salary, unless the Public Service Commissioner has examined the case for himself, and ascertained whether what is asked for is warranted or&#39; not. It was for that reason that I said that the honorable member&#39;s attack was virtually an attack on the administration of the Public Service Commissioner. The honorable member speaks of the proportionate increases as compared with the year 1909-10. But I remind the Committee that a large amount of additional work has been placed upon the officers since that time. In 1910 the note issue came into operation, and there was also an extension on account of old-age and invalid pensions. </para>

                            <para>- Take the item in connexion with bank exchange. It is a new item. To some extent it relates to the larger purchases of material in London. We had a very good officer indeed in charge of this work. In my opinion his services were worth his salary over and over again. The Public Service Commissioner desired to transfer him to another Department. I was very loth indeed to lose his services ; but the Public Service Commissioner said he was required elsewhere, and was entitled to get his promotion. I am not at all sure that the Commonwealth is benefited by his transfer ; but the Public Service Commissioner was responsible, and the transfer was made. </para>

                            <para>- As to the general increases, I point out that the Treasury has to deal with the accounts of all Departments, and these accounts have naturally increased in number. There is a point beyond which an officer cannot go ; he may be able to deal with 1,000 accounts in a working day, but if there happen to be 1,005 accounts, another man has to be obtained to take a share of the work, so that it may be done efficiently. It is here that the Public Service Commissioner comes in, and he considers, on the requisition of the head of the Department, whether the assistance is or is not warranted. We know that an ordinary man, as years go on, and he becomes more experienced, deals more rapidly with his work and makes fewer blunders, and hence the increased expenditure on the same number of men is justified as an advantage. From my experience of life I would rather have few men who can do the work of &#38; great many men than a great many men to do the work of few * men, although the same expenditure might be involved, because then there are fewer mistakes, and the work is better done. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is shifting ground. An attack has been made by the honorable member for Flinders, and has not been sustained ; and that honorable member is quite capable of making such an attack without assistance. The honorable member for Parramatta is less frank than is the honorable member for Flinders. Immediately the honorable member for Flinders saw that some item had escaped his eye, he admitted the fact at once, and that is the way to get on. I have no desire to be responsible for financial statements or financial proposals that cannot bear the keenest scrutiny, and I hope- that Parliament will never depart from the course of exercising its full right of criticism. Although I am not in a position to give all the details at the present moment, I think that there are now the minimum number of officers with whom the work of the Treasury can be carried on, in view of the new services. </para>

                        <para>.-! suggest to the Prime Minister that the note issue, as currency, ought to be under the control of the Commonwealth Bank, and that it would be advisable, I think, to have a report from the Governor of the Bank on the point. If this suggestion were acted upon the size of the issue would be governed solely by the public demand for paper money, as it was before, except that the Commonwealth would, very properly, through its proper officials, govern the issue. My objection to the Government note issue is solely due to the fact that, under the present system, there is a great temptation to any Minister to issue more notes than is necessary, in order to finance various Government enterprises. Every sovereign raised by the issue is a liability which will have to be met sooner or later, and most probably at a time when the country is the least able to meet it. If, on the other hand, my suggestion were adopted, the Bank would, for its own protection, as well as for the protection of the Commonwealth - for the Bank is not interested in what I might call party finance - draw in its horns on approaching financial trouble, and so automatically regulate the issue of paper currency. At any rate, it would be worth while the Treasurer asking his highest financial expert to express his opinion on the matter. I have no knowledge of what the Governor&#39;s views are, but I am satisfied that if the matter is referred to him, he cannot fail to advise the Treasurer more or less on the lines of my suggestion. </para>

                    <para>We must remember that most of any country&#39;s financial difficulties are because of the party system. A party in power, with a tenure of three years, will try to carry out public works, and finance them in such a way as to increase their popularity in the country, and lead to their return for another period of office. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, on the other hand, is responsible solely for the solvency of his institution, and the security of credit generally, with which it is intimately bound up. The result will be that if we put this matter under him, we shall still have Commonwealth notes, but they will be paper currency, and will not be the means primarily of raising money from the public of Australia for the pressing necessities of a particular party. I do urge this upon the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- It is a question of high finance, and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, I take it, is the best financier we have in the service of the Commonwealth. In fact, I think that he is the only first rank financier in the service of the Commonwealth at present. We have excellent officials, but they have not been in close touch with general finance in the same way as he has been. I am only asking that his opinion should be ascertained. Surely the Government are not going to shut down on expert opinion in dealing with this question? Surely they are not afraid of the verdict of their highest officer? If they are, of course the public will understand the refusal of my very simple and modest request. I do hope to get a simple, affirmative answer from the Prime Minister before I resume my seat. </para>

                            <para>- Banking is vitally interested in currency. It is the basis of exchange, and a bank&#39;s prime operations are dealings with exchange. If you interfere with currency, you interfere with bills. If you disturb currency, you disturb bill currency, and cheque currency, which is the biggest currency in the financial world to-day. Exchange is the biggest function of any bank,. State or private, at the present time. The big profits of a bank are not made, when all is said and done, by advancing money, and. receiving interest. </para>

                            <para>- In the time of crisis, the only currency that has an intrinsic value throughout the world is gold. It is, consequently, obviously a matter of vital importance to the Commonwealth Bank that it should be able to be sure of the solvency and the security of a big paper issue of money in the Commonwealth. Not with a view of embarrassing the proceedings at present, but simply to enable the Prime Minister to reply, and give me an. opportunity, if necessary, to speak for a minute, I move - </para>

                        <para>. - I support the proposed reduction. I have always thought that the moment the Commonwealth Bank was set up the Governor should have control of the note issue. He will have at his disposal immense resources, monetary, metallic, and otherwise. He would be in a better position to gauge the demand of Australia in regard to the note issue. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret very much the delay which occurred in issuing the bound volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the last session. We made frequent representations to the Government Printer, and we found that it was the congestion of work - State work, I think - which prevented the despatch of the volumes, but we have now made better arrangements. After this session, special efforts will be made to enable honorable members to procure the bound volumes quickly. It will also be arranged that a large number of copies of the debates on the referendum proposals shall be available to the Opposition and to Government members for circulation. </para>
