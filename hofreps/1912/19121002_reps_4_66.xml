          <para>.- Section III of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 provides that no person may engage or supply a seaman or apprentice to be entered on board any ship in the United Kingdom unless that person holds a licence from the Board of Trade for the purpose, or is the owner, or master, or mate of a ship, or is <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> the servant, and in the constant employment of the owner. In my opinion, it would be a great convenience to the community if the words &#34; or is <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> the servant and in the constant employment  of  the owner &#34; were inserted in the clause.  I  do not think that their insertion could lead to any abuse. </para>

          <para>. - This clause is one of the most important of those providing for the protection of seamen, and it was in connexion with it that so much evidence was taken regarding the crimping that exists in Australia, it being found that, although Newcastle had a bad name for this practice, other places were nearly as bad. The clause is designed to prevent or diminish crimping, and, in my opinion, is already sufficiently wide. A superintendent, a seamen&#39;s inspector, and the owner, master, mate, or engineer of a vessel may be employed for engaging or supplying seamen. If we added to the clause, it is possible that persons who have been connected with crimping might be employed directly to secure seamen. </para>

            <para>- So far as we could see, there were some captains employed in the trade who were unscrupulous enough to make a profit out of this practice. Those who ought to have been the natural protectors of the seamen were not their natural protectors, but were trying to make a profit out of a nefarious traffic. The evidence showed us that it ought not to be tolerated in Australia for ten minutes. We all desire to suppress the traffic. I am sure that when the honorable member for Angas suggested an improvement by the adoption of some words in the Imperial Act he did not wish to insert an amendment which would encourage or countenance this practice at all. </para>

            <para>- Reading the clause through, I cannot see how the suggestion made by my honorable friend would give facilities for the operation of crimping, because he does not suggest that any body or individual should be licensed to engage seamen. All he suggests is that a person who is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> the servant and in the constant employment of the owner shall, be authorized to do it. That would give, I think, a certain elasticity in the conduct of Australian engagements, without encouraging any of the evil effects which the Minister has suggested. I hope that he will give us some reason why this provision has been omitted from the Bill of 1908, and may see his way to provide something similar, if not the same. The Navigation Commission distinctly recommended that, so far as possible, this business should be in the hands of a superintendent - that is, of a responsible person. This clause allows the owner, master, mate, or engineer of a ship to act. Of course, the owner cannot do it by himself, as he will be away, nor can the master; mate, or engineer leave his post for this purpose All that my honorable friend asks is that, in order to make the clause effective, the master, mate, or engineer should be enabled to carry out what he desires through a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> servant who is constantly in the employment of the owner. </para>

          <para>. - I think that the amendment would be dangerous. The Navigation Commission heard a great deal of evidence on this matter, and it was alt to the one effect. A condition of things had existed in some of the ports of Australia, particularly Newcastle, which, was little short of scandalous, and from what we gather only in San Francisco were conditions worse. The extent to which this practice went, and its ramifications, were really calculated to surprise any person who was not familiar, with shipping matters. It was clearly impressed upon the Commission that the only, remedy was to confine the business of engaging seamen, to a public officer, and so they recommended that no person other than a superintendent should be allowed to supply or engage a seaman on board a ship. I want it to be clearly understood that it was never suggested for a moment, nor was there the slightest evidence that . anything in&#34; the nature of crimping occurred in regard to Inter-State shipping; of course, that would be perfectly absurd. The practice was confined to foreign-going shipping. But, as this measure affects Australian shipping as well as foreign-going shipping, naturally some regard had to be paid to the representations of ship-owners who might be handicapped by a too strict application of this principle, and, as a consequence, an amendment of* the Commission&#39;s recommendation was made. The scope which was thought proper by the Commission was enlarged by the Government, so that now a superintendent is not the only person who may engage a seaman, but a seamen&#39;s inspector, who is, of course, a Government officer, or the owner, master, mate, or engineer of a ship may -dso do so. We can find an excellent reason for allowing those persons to act, because they all have the sanction of practice. The master or mate does engage, and ought to be allowed to engage, seamen. He is the man under whom they are going to work, and, therefore, it is perfectly proper that he should be allowed to engage any person who he thinks is suitable for his purpose. The engineer is in a similar position with his staff. When we go outside the owner of the ship we are in troubled waters. The amendment suggested would, I think, be most undesirable. Take the suggestion of the honorable member that this business should be intrusted to a person who is <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> the servant and in the constant employment of the owner. Practically it means that any person who is in the employment of the owner may engage a seaman. I take it that in practice a seaman could be engaged under the clause by the owner or by the owner&#39;s agent. The honorable gentleman would not say that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> strictest possible interpretation of the provision would preclude the owner from delegating to a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> agent the business of getting a seaman. It is perfectly true that he could only be supplied and shipped in one way, but the preliminary negotiations could be carried out by an agent. The owner would be responsible under the provision for anything improperly done. The moment you enlarge that, and permit the owner to delegate his authority, you will get into a very uncertain position. I do not think that even the question of allowing the owner himself is without difficulty </para>

            <para>- I think so. With the master of a ship, you know where you are. Who is the owner of  c  ship? If the ship belongs to a registered company, or to a single individual, I know who the owner is ; but under the law the ownership of a ship is divided into sixty-four parts, and any person who has a sixty-fourth part, unless, of course, the ship belongs to a registered company, is the owner of the ship within the meaning of this provision. The clause is quite wide enough ; it cannot possibly affect Inter-State snipping prejudicially. I do hope that there will not be any tendency on the part of the Committee, in the full light of the evidence, which disclosed an astonishing and scandalous position of affairs, to enlarge the scope of the clause, and so to invite the continuance of that situation. </para>

            <para>- I am quite willing to assist the honorable member in putting down crimping, but I am simply urging now that reasonable facilities should be afforded owners in this connexion. I am- prepared to go almost to any length to avoid crimping ; I would make it a criminal offence to be severely punished. But our experience shows that crimping has been the result of negligent supervision, boardinghousekeepers who are primarily and mainly responsible for crimping, being permitted to go on board ship. It is not possible for my honorable friends opposite to produce any evidence that the practice that has hitherto prevailed of permitting this work to be performed by a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> servant of a company has resulted in crimping. In the case of a large ship, it is quite impossible for the owner, the master^ or the engineer to undertake work of this kind, involving, as it does, much time. </para>

            <para>- Surely the honorable member will recognise that whilst this is a rigid Bill as against ship-owners, it is only reasonable that we should afford them reasonable facilities if we can do so to get through their work in a legitimate way. The Bill of 1908 provided for the continuance of the existing practice, but for some reason or other the provision to which I have just referred was omitted in the Senate. That, I think, was a mistake. The Attorney-General said that it was probable that the clause as it stood would enable the servant of an owner to do this work. I understood him to say that that&#34; was a reasonable inference, but having regard to the rigid character of the clause such a view, I think, is excluded. The clause throws on the master, the owner, or the engineer a personal obligation to do this work, .and that, in the case of large vessels, must prove impracticable. If we provided, that a man in the constant and exclusive employ of the owner should be permitted to act for. him in this regard the position would be met. Surely honorable members do not think that either the owner or his employe&#39; would run the risk of having to pay .&#163;50, or undergo three months&#39; imprisonment. </para>

That amount is going to be passed on to the public, and surely when we have an opportunity to afford reasonable facilities we ought to take advantage of it. Do not let us ignore what is fair and reasonable in this connexion. If the Minister chooses to make inquiries I am sure he will be satisfied that no evil results have followed from the present practice. </para>

          <para>.- I admit that from the stand-point of endeavouring to make the Bill a workable one the honorable member for Kooyong has made out a good case. I have had a good deal of experience of crimping cases which were brought before the old Arbitration Court in New South Wales, when awards were given in connexion with the coal trimmers and the wharf labourers of Newcastle. If there is in existence in the Commonwealth one system which is more pernicious than another, it is that of crimping. At the same time I fear that if we adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Kooyong it will be open to a stevedore in the employ of a shipping company to engage seamen. </para>

            <para>- There are some shipping masters who visit the port of Newcastle in whose honesty I would not repose much faith. They appear to be in league with the boardinghouse-keepers and crimpers. The clause under consideration is one of the most vital provisions of the Bill. It will prove of great advantage to the honest shipowner, who is at present handicapped by reason of the action of unprincipled men who can outdo him in business. It is a disgrace to humanity that crimping has been in existence so long in the Commonwealth, and especially in Newcastle. That city is notorious for crimping. </para>

          <para>. - I think the Committee is unanimous in its desire to abolish crimping. Personally, I would make imprisonment the penalty for that offence. If there is one contemptible person on the face of the earth it is the individual who is willing to take sailors into his house, and whilst they are under the influence of liquor to induce them to sign articles to ship on certain vessels. I desire to assist in stopping that practice, and therefore I wish to make the punishment for it a sufficient deterrent. But in the offices of many of our shipping companies there is usually a confidential man who practically looks after the whole of the shipping for the firm. </para>

            <para>- No. If I thought the amendment would open the door to crimping it would not command my support. But most of our shipping firms employ a confidential man who is a firstclass servant, and who attends to the whole of the shipping business for his particular firm. He naturally knows a great deal more about it than does the shipowner, who is very often only a figurehead. I do not think we should incur the slightest danger in empowering such a man to ship the crew of any vessel. Very much more danger would be incurred in permitting the mate to sign on the seamen. </para>

          <para>.- I trust that the Committee will not alter the clause. If we place the matter of shipping seamen in too many hands we shall run grave danger of the practice of crimping creeping in. The honorable member for Kooyong said that we ought not to penalize the ship-owners. I wish to assist them as far as possible, but I must safeguard the interests of the men whoare employed on board ships. We all know that the masters of the principal vessels which trade along our coast have a lot of work to do whilst they are in port, and it is only that consideration which prevents me from voting in favour of taking the work of shipping seamen out of the hands of the mates of vessels. I view with alarmthe suggestion that our shipping laws should be made so elastic as proposed by the honorable member for Kooyong. We know that, if anything occurred, the legal profession would be easily able to bring evidence to show that the person was employed by the owners of the vessels. I hope the Committee will accept the clause as framed, so as to, as far as possible, prevent the practice of crimping. </para>

            <para>- Quite so; I have no doubt that if we were legislating for Newcastle only, the law would be much more strict than it is. The honorable member for Franklin has stated that it is very often the mate that arranges the crimping; and I think it would be much better and simpler to leave the engagement of seamen to some person who resides permanently in the port, and who is much more likely to know &#34; the run of the ropes &#34; than is a man who visits the town only at long intervals. The State Government of New South Wales have under consideration legislation to make the law even more strict than it is at present, and they communicated with the Commonwealth Government with a view of tightening up the provisions of this Bill instead of leaving them more elastic, as is now suggested. It is well known that the practice of crimping does not apply in the InterState trade, but is confined to oversea shipping, British and foreign. I trust the clause will be accepted as it stands. Doubtless this Bill, like every other Bill, will require amendment in the future, either in the way of tightening up the clauses or making them less drastic. </para>

          <para>. - This is one of the most important clauses in the measure; it touches the very core of the disadvantages under which ocean-going seamen sometimes labour, and I am sure that honorable members on all sides are in accord with the Government in their desire to put down with a firm hand the detestable practice of crimping. I cannot at the moment say whether the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Angas is a good one or a bad one; but my own inclination is rather to restrict the number of people who are permitted to engage in the work of supplying seamen - to restrict them within the smallest limits consistent with the reasonable working of the shipping business. One point on which this Bill errs on the side of leniency is that of penalties. In my. opinion, the monetary penalty should be abolished and imprisonment only substituted. I cannot help contrasting the lightness of these penalties with those imposed under the Royal Commissions Bill ; and nothing that could be done in connexion with a Royal Commission is half as detestable as the practice of crimping. In this connexion I should like to call attention to the report of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill, which affords some very startling information. It is just as well that these facts should be laid before the Committee, so that honorable members, who have not had much experience in nautical matters, may gather some idea of the practices which sometimes prevail in&#39; shipping seamen for deep-sea vessels. On page  15  of the report of the Royal Commission we are told - </para>

          <para>A considerable amount of evidence was received in connexion with the supply and discharge of seamen on foreign-going ships.. Some of this was so sensational that, had it not been amply corroborated, its accuracy might well have been doubted. The witnesses, it may be remarked, were not recruited from any one class, but represented, indifferently, all sections of the community. From  boardinghouse-keepers,  shipmasters, seamen, lawyers, merchants, doctors, and police, the same testimony was received. As it would be impossible to suppose that witnesses of so representative a character, would mislead your Commissioners, they were forced to the conclusion that fresh legislation in. this matter is most urgently needed. </para>

        <para class="block">I may here remark, parenthetically, that it is the practice in some ports, not only to crimp seamen, but for boarding-masters andothers to sometimes utterly neglect to ascertain whether the men they supply are really seamen. Cases have come under my personal observation where men, who had never been to sea in their lives, have, after a spree, found themselves on a sailing ship miles out of sight of land. </para>

        </quote>
        <para>These were ordinary business transactions, as is admitted. They were frequently conducted in years past. I hope they are not conducted to the same extent now at the port of Newcastle, in this beautiful country of Australia. I venture to believe that few shore-going persons have any knowledge of the fact that these practices have been pursued, and that our seafaring men have been victimized in this shameless and heartless fashion. But that is not all. It has even happened that seamen who have come out to Australia in ships, especially American ships, have been so tyrannized over on the voyage, and. been subjected to so many pinpricks, and often ill-usage, as to make them disgusted with the vessel, and anxious to leave her on arriving at port. The object of this practice has been largely to induce the men to accept only part of their wages as a condition of their discharge, or even practically forcing them to desert the ship and forego the whole of their wages. What has become of those wages I am unable to say. Whether they went entirely into the pockets of the owners, or whether the master of the ship, in consideration of the part he took in making life as uncomfortable and as intolerable as possible on board ship, shared&#39; in the wages thus forfeited, the evidence does not disclose. The report says, however, in regard to that matter - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It was sworn, too, that a regular traffic existed in inciting seamen to desert, and that this was carried on by boardinghouse-keepers. runners, and others, some of whom, it was alleged, did not even have a place of accommodation. Several witnesses alleged that some masters of vessels connived at such practice, partly for the purpose of sharing what was suggestively termed &#39; blood money &#34; (the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> paid for the supply of seamen), and partly for the purpose of defrauding the seaman of his wages. Cases were cited in support of this statement. In one, men to whom three years&#39; wages were due were compelled to accept an insignificant proportion in order to obtain their discharges. A witness gave an instance where &#163;60 being due, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> had to be accepted. In other cases, despairing of ever getting anything and induced by glowing reports of local conditions put forward by the crimps, men have left the whole of their wages in the hands of the ship. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think there can be no two opinions on the part of honorable members that practices of that kind should be put down as firmly as possible, and that we should see that no loophole is left in the Bill which will permit them to be continued. To that extent I realize that the Government in framing the Bill have tried as far as they could to provide against abuses. I myself am very chary of accepting any proposal that might possibly open the door to a continuation of such abuses. </para>

            <para>- I do not know that the amendment of the honorable member for Angas will do that. I am rather inclined to think that it will afford an additional safeguard. But I am informed that the mates of some of these vessels share even more largely than the masters do in the money which is obtained from crimping. I do not know whether it is a wise thing to leave the clause as open as it is in regard to the power of  mates to engage seamen. Sub-clause1 provides that - </para>

        <para class="block">I think some safeguard might possibly be inserted to insure that there shall be some official supervision over the transactions of mates in that regard. Of course, I realize that a mate has not the same facilities as men ashore for successfully engaging in crimping. But at the same time he could be an active participant in the profits of crimping by sharing with boardinghousekeepers, runners, and others. I think that the amendment of the honorable member for Angas deserves consideration, because, provided that a person in the employ of the owner is a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> employe constantly and exclusively engaged by the owner, and in a responsible position, I do not think that any such danger as is feared by the Attorney-General is likely to occur. If the amendment were safeguarded in that way, I think it would be a safe one for the Minister to accept. I hope that he will not regard this as a hostile suggestion, because I am heartily in accord with him in his desire to make this amending Bill as perfect as possible. So are we all on this side of the House, especially in regard to those provisions which relate to the employment of seamen. </para>

            <para>- That general register, as will be seen by clause 8, applies, apparently, only to British ships. Clause  27,  however, provides for a different kind of register, to be kept by the seamen&#39;s inspector for a port, of persons desiring to be employed as seamen or apprentices. That register, as will be seen by clause  25,  will apply to both British and foreign sailors. Does the Minister intend to use the information supplied in that way to keep up the general register, or is it intended to include in the general register only British seamen? </para>

          <para>. - This clause should be read in the light of the preceding clause. This will be a different register from that mentioned in clause  9.  What is the object of appointing a seamen&#39;s inspector? If crimping is still as bad at one or two ports after the passing of this Act as it is now, an inspector will be appointed, and part of his work will be to see what he can do to carry out the law in regard to that matter. It will be necessary for him in carrying out his duties to have a general register of persons shipping in and out of the port at which he is stationed. Honorable members need not be alarmed on the ground that the clause will rehire to foreign ships. At the present time seamen are not signed on or discharged from foreign ships at the shipping office, but in the office of the Consul of the country to which the ships belong. I can quite imagine that the Consul for any other friendly nation might report to the Government that crimping had occurred in connexion with ships of the country represented hy him. It is not the policy of any civilized power to interfere with the shipping of a friendly nation, but T should imagine that at the request of the representative of any nation a Government would put down an evil which might bring disgrace upon a port. </para>

            <para>- I have known cases in connexion with shipping at Port Adelaide of men getting their discharge from Russian ships at the office of the Consul&#39; in Adelaide. Though a foreign ship may be in our waters, it is to a very large extent subject to the laws of the. country to which it belongs, so long as those laws do not contravene our domestic laws. In the same way, the residence of an Ambassador for a foreign nation in London is not regarded as a part of London, but as a part of the country represented by the Ambassador. We may assume that our officers will have sense enough to administer the law in such  a  way as not to interfere with foreign vessels without absolute necessity. The object of making this clause applicable to foreign shipping is really to enable us to secure the same protection and fair play for men employed on foreign ships as we give to our own seamen. </para>

            <para>- That &#34;is so. With respect to what has been said by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, trie practice adopted in connexion with foreign ships to-day is for the Consuls representing the countries to which they belong to go with the men when they are being signed on or off. Foreign Consuls will have absolutely no standing under this Bill to sign on or discharge seamen, nor have they any such standing under any State Act; but it is the practice for them to accompany foreign seamen when they are. signing on to explain any matter which they may not understand. There is nothing in this Bill which would prevent foreign Consuls continuing that practice, but we propose to make provision on our own account to safeguard the interests of seamen on foreign vessels. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to draw attention to the qualifications of greasers and firemen. My attention has been drawn to the fact that the clause, as it stands, will unduly restrict the choice of men to act in these capacities. Before he can be rated as such, a greaser is required to have served six months as a fireman at sea, while a fireman has to serve six months as a trimmer or fireman at sea. It is contended that this provision is unduly restrictive, and that many men may gain their preliminary experience as firemen on land. In the New Zealand Act, from which the clause is taken, provision is made that where a greaser or fireman has served on land, such service shall be taken into account in the rating for sea service. It is also pointed out that under the New Zealand Act three months&#39; service is sufficient. What reply has the Minister to make to that criticism? </para>

          <para>. - I hope that the Minister will adhere to the clause as it stands. There may be a very great deal in the view expressed by the honorable member for Bendigo. But if he had had the misfortune to go to sea as a fireman, he would have found it pretty awkward to be obliged to fire with a man who had never been to sea before, and who, therefore, had no sea-legs. If a fireman finds himself on a steamer which is bad to fire, it is of no use for him to kick up a row whilst he is at sea. The work of firing has to be done, and very often one fireman has to do the work of two, and to carry a man who is a dead-weight. That is a general ground of complaint by firemen and officers. A fireman is entitled to be protected against a man who is not competent to do his work. If anything is a dog&#39;s job, it is that of firing at sea. Firemen have a perfect right to ask us to look at this matter from their point of view, and to give them a decent chance to earn their living in a manner which is fair both to themselves and to their employers. The present system is not fair to the men who fancy if they can get to sea they will be able to get along somehow. The proper place for such men is the inside of a gaol, because they have obtained their positions through misrepresentation ; they undertake work which they are utterly incompetent to do. No man is of much account when he first goes to sea. Everybody has to learn. A trimmer, of course, can be put on one side for a few days until he recovers; but the position is different in the case of a fireman, who should always be fit for his work. </para>

          <para>. - With regard to the point raised by the honorable member for Bendigo, the clause as it stands was in the Bill of 1907, and, I presume, in the Bill of 1904. It provides that these men should have a certain amount of experience. Probably the honorable member for Hindmarsh has had as much practical experience of this class of labour as any honorable member has had. A number of men go to sea as trimmers or firemen as a last resort, having failed on the land. As my honorable friend has truly remarked, the life of a fireman at sea is a dog&#39;s life, and the smaller the liner is the worse it is for the fireman. One of the main objects of the Bill is to try to improve the lot of men who go down to the sea in ships, whether as firemen, greasers, or seamen. No doubt many honorable members have seen an unsteady fireman helped on to the boat after the gangway has been removed. I think that every man should be competent to take his share of the work. At present the men who are steady frequently have to do the work of firing for a watch or two for two men. In other words, they have to do the work of the men who are laid up for the first portion of the voyage because of their inexperience, and perhaps because some are not quite steady, and are unable for a watch or two to do their share of the work. The steady men are those who should be encouraged to get on, and we ought not to make their work harder than it is. I move - </para>

        <para class="block">What has been the complaint regarding a number of men who have gone to sea? The complaint of the officers is that the men will not take part in the boat drill, which is necessary, and which can only be carried out in perhaps one day out of ten, as boats can only be lowered on one day in ten, but the ordinary boat drill can be held at any time. Those who have been on ship board have seen posted up a notice showing how the crew is distributed among the several boats, and must know that firemen as well as ordinary seamen are required to assist in handling a boat. In case of shipwreck the chance of rescue might be very remote if one elected to remain on board rather than to put to sea in a small boat; but I think that the chance would be even less if one put off in a boat manned by men who had had no experience in pulling an oar. If I remember rightly, Lord Mersey, in his report, states that some of the female passengers who were lowered into the boats from the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> were able to show the seamen what to do. In that case there had not been any opportunity for boat drill. This amendment is designed to insure having on board ship men who are able to pull an oar and handle a boat, and so to meet an emergency. </para>

          <para>.- I think that the Minister is right in proposing to make provision that a seaman shall be able to pull an oar and handle a boat; but, under the amendment as it stands, a man would not be allowed to work in any capacity on ship board unless he could do so. It is proper to require this qualification in the case of seamen-- </para>

          <para>. - This clause, I think, goes far beyond what is reasonable. It provides, in effect, that the crew of a foreign-going ship shall not be employed in handling cargo in connexion with loading or unloading. I dare say that what the Minister has in view is to provide that the crew of a ship shall not be permitted to do this work where there is a strike in progress, but I believe that the clause as it stands would even prevent an A.B. from working a winch. A great many men are engaged with a view to their labour, irrespective of their work &#34;as seamen, being utilized in particular ports. Whilst we do not wish in any way to interfere with the wages conditions of Australia, since we have attained to a fairly healthy .state of affairs here under which the general mass of the community are able to live up to the standard that modern civilization and education require, still if labour is not available locally at rates prescribed under an industrial agreement filed with, or an award made by, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, it should be possible to use the crew of a vessel to load or unload her. The clause goes beyond what ought really to be in the mind of the draftsman. In order to test the matter, I move - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>This is a new clause, and seeks to forbid the employment of the crew of a foreign-going ship (British or foreign) in handling cargo in connexion with the loading or unloading of cargo. The clause in the Bill is, as it stands, very general (&#34;in handling cargo in connexion with&#34;), and, though it is understood that it is unusual to employ British crews in this work in Australian ports, the provisions of the clause will press very hardly on owners in the event of no shore labour being available. The Board has urged against some foreign Governments the claims of masters of British vessels to employ their crews in foreign ports in the manner sought to be prohibited by this clause, and other foreign Governments also support similar claims on behalf of their masters. It is to be feared that the putting into force of such an enactment will lead to retaliation by foreign countries. </para>

          <para>. - In my opinion, the amendment ought not to be adopted. The intention of the clause is that, in the case of foreign-going ships, shore labour shall be employed. That is perfectly in accord with &#34;the general principle which has governed the economic and fiscal policy of the country since this Parliament has been in existence. I most emphatically protest against any attempt being made to differentiate between persons who are engaged in the maritime industry and persons who are engaged in a shore industry. Both the author of the amendment and the honorable member for Darling Downs know quite well that the position is not so simple that it would be met by providing that when there is a scarcity of shore labour available, the crew of a vessel may be employed to work cargo. The members of the crew of a foreign-going vessel are paid, I suppose, from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 10s.  to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline> per month at the most, which works out at less than 6d. per hour, whereas, under the awards which are now current throughout Australia, stevedores get is. 6d. per hour for working cargo eight hours a day and extra pay for overtime. How profitable, then, it would be for the master of a foreign-going ship to say,- &#34;I cannot get labour here, and, therefore, I will employ my own crew to load and discharge cargo?&#34; The proviso sets out clearly &#34; that the regulations shall not allow the employment of the crew of such ship, in handling cargo or ballast, where a sufficiency of other labour is available.&#34; That is perfectly proper. I utterly fail to see why we should differentiate between shore labour usually so-called and shore labour which is employed in working, ships.. I cannot agree that any such differentiation is proper. The agreement which exists in Australia at the present time between the employers under the Shipping Federation and the members of the Waterside Workers Federation in regard to the working of cargoes, provides that in all the main ports sailors shall not be permitted to work cargo, but that, in those ports in which shore labour presumably is not available, or is not always on hand, the crews of vessels may be employed in this connexion. This clause places the foreign-going shipper on exactly the &#39; same footing as the local shipper; and anything more than that the foreign-going shipper ought not to ask for. If he comes here and trades he ought to pay shore rates. A foreign-going ship may take on hardwood at Bunbury and bring it round to this side; and, under such circumstances, it is to all intents and purposes competing in the Inter-State trade. Such competition, at 6d. an hour, is quite unfair and unjust to those employers whom we compel to pay certain rates. </para>

          <para>.- Sub-clause  2  provides that the regulations may forbid the employment, except aa prescribed, of members of the crews of Australian-trade ships in handling cargo or ballast in connexion with the loading or unloading. The Attorney-General referred to an agreement which is in existence with the Wharf Labourers Union; and I desire to be quite clear as to whether it will be possible, under the regulations, to prevent the employment of crews in connexion with the cargo on ships trading up the rivers. </para>

            <para>- We have had some peculiar experience lately of what can be done under regulations. I do not think that it is the general desire of honorable members that the -regulations under this clause should prohibit the crews of vessels being used under the circumstances I have indicated. If the regulations are to apply, such vessels, at the first port of call, will have to ship a special crew to work the cargo; and this, of course, will&#39; mean an increase in the freight. The actual work done by the crews is not very heavy; and I should like to know whether the AttorneyGeneral will accept an amendment to prevent the regulations applying to vessels of the kind? </para>

          <para>. - 1 understand the honorable member to ask whether, under sub-clause  2,  regulations can be framed which would prevent the use of the crews in the handling of cargo on vessels trading between Brisbane or Sydney and Lismore, or any other northern river port. I do not say that no such regulation could be framed ; but this clause is confined to &#34;Australiantrade ships,&#34; which are defined in clause 5 - though that clause has not yet been passed - as including - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>Every ship (other than a limited coast trade ship or river and bay ship) employed in trading or going between places in Australia, and every ship employed in trading between (a) Australia and (4) territories under the authority of the Commonwealth, New Zealand, or the islands of the Pacific. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Then, further, clause 5 contains the following interpretation : -   &#34; Limited coast-trade ship &#34; means a sea-going ship exclusively engaged in making short voyages from and to any port in Australia within limits (not exceeding a radius of 400 miles)  . . . determined for the port by the Governor-General. </para>
        <para>There is no doubt that for all practical purposes an &#34; Australian-trade ship &#34; is a ship engaged in Inter- State trade so far as this sub- clause is concerned ; and, therefore, I think that the regulations would not apply. That, however, is a matter for interpretation. The honorable, member has asked what is the conception of the scope of this sub-clause by the Government, and whether it would be possible to frame such a. regulation under it. No doubt it would be possible to frame such a regulation, but whether it would be proper to do so must remain for the discretion of the Minister. I indicated what the practice is in regard to Inter- State shipping; but there is no such practice at the present time in connexion with the InfraState shipping. I am now speaking of the result of an agreement between the shipowners and the employes. In regard to Inter-State shipping, the practice I have spoken of is subject to limitations, in so far as certain ports are exempted. In regard to Intra- State shipping, and particularly in regard to those ports the honorable member has in his mind, the practice does not apply. </para>

          <para>.- I am afraid that the sub-clause, if retained, would be very oppressive in its operation in connexion with some boats engaged purely in the Gulf trade. The Attorney-General was quite right in referring to the definition of &#34; Australian-trade ship,&#34; because the sub-clause applies to such shipping only, and not to a limited coast-trade ship or river and bay ship. A limited coast-trade ship means a ship exclusively engaged in making short voyages from and to any port in Australia within limits. The AttorneyGeneral in quoting the interpretation clause &#34;jumped&#34; the succeeding words, &#34; not exceeding a radius of  400  miles.&#34;  The limit may be much less than  400  miles ; and in South Australia, for instance, there are a great number of vessels who make short trips daily, say, from Port Adelaide to Yorke&#39;s Peninsula, of about four hours&#39; duration. The greater number of the men are employed on those vessels owing to the fact that their services may be utilized at the various ports,; the actual sea part of their work being comparatively small. Under recent awards they are paid fairly good wages and good overtime rates. Under an interpretation of some awards - the last one, for instance, connected with officers - a sum may be paid as commutation for overtime at sea; but if no overtime is worked at sea, and; the monthly sum is paid to commute the amount paid&#39; for overtime there is no allowance for work done on land. </para>

            <para>- - In the majority of cases men are employed on board because they can be used at the various ports, and the greater part of the work is done in port. For instance, a seaman who is also a winchman is engaged on account of the double qualification. If the limits prescribed by the Governor-General are sufficiently short, a limited coast-trade ship cannot employ men in loading and unloading, though, of course, if the voyage prescribed is over the  400  miles a good many ships might be exempt. &#34; River and bay ship&#34; is defined as including &#34;every ship which trades exclusively in some river, gulf, or bay within any State or States.&#34;&#39; </para>

        <para>I very much doubt whether in South Australia a ship engaged in the two Gulfs would come under that definition. But some of the vessels in South Australia are not confined to one Gulf. They are  engaged  in the two. The definition of river and bay ship therefore might not cover them, and they would not be excepted from the operation of the clause. That would  be  very severe and oppressive in some cases. I suggest&#39; to the Minister whether he has not gone too far, and am inclined to vote against the clause as it stands, as clearly going beyond what ought to be prescribed if any limitation is to be imposed. </para>

            <para>- I think that the practice of allowing such matters to be dealt with by regulation is objectionable. Where we have an opportunity, it is better for us to put into an Act of Parliament exactly what we mean. Instead of leaving so much to regulations, it will be better for us to define as clearly as we can what ships to which we intend this provision to apply If  the  amending clauses which we have to discuss afterwards are not carried, we shall  be  passing a measure which will be quite  Oppressive  in many instances. Would it  be  possible for us to deal with the new clauses before we proceed to deal with kindred matters which the amending clauses will affect? </para>

            <para>- We are imposing restrictions which will be affected by the definition clause, which we have not yet passed. The amending clauses, I freely admit, give me nearly what I want in regard to river boats. There are no wharf labourers on the jetties where these boats put in. The sailors do the whole of the loading and unloading. There is an understanding between the Ship-owners Federation and  the  Wharf Labourers Union. The Union  has  never attempted to interfere with the trade done by these little vessels. </para>

          <para>.- One aspect of this question has not been touched upon. I quite agree with the honorable member for Franklin with regard  to  the smaller ports where the seamen are engaged in handling the cargo, but we have had recent experience, especially on  the  Queensland coast, in regard to this matter, and to my mind the clause is not sufficiently drastic. In Queensland in more than one case, and in comparatively recent times, whenever there has been a little disturbance between the shipowners and  the  men in any particular port, the former,  in  order to defeat the men, who were asking for better wages or better conditions - perhaps for some trifling concession- have shipped what they call a double crew.  The  Attorney-General and myself have had these matters submitted  to  us officially  on  more than one occasion and we have found no way of providing for the difficulty. There has been a mutual agreement, but I think so soon as the Bill is passed all those arrangements will go by the board. The trouble mentioned should be provided against in the Bill itself, and I think it is met by the position taken up by the Minister. </para>

Any Government can cut that radius down by regulation, and the moment that is done the vessels trading to the Northern rivers of New South Wales become &#34; Australian-trade ships.&#34; </para>

            <para>- Power is given in the definition itself to alter the radius. I am informed also that some of the Northern river ports are beyond the radius of 400 miles from Sydney. Lismore is 425 miles, and the Tweed is further still, so that the vessels trading to the northernmost of those rivers from Sydney would become Australiantrade ships, to which sub-clause 2 would apply. </para>

            <para>- I want to be perfectly clear upon the point, because it would be most disastrous to our people if they suddenly found that they had to carry special crews up and down the rivers to attend to this work. Recent awards have put 50 per cent, on to the freights on those rivers. Five years ago we could send a bag of corn to Sydney for a shilling. We have now to pay1s. 6d. It is the same with freights on butter. In fact, everything has risen through these additional awards. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable member for Richmond and others have asked whether the clause will apply to small vessels trading up  rivers,  and carrying only a few hundredweights of cargo, which at present is put on board and discharged by the crew. We all know the vessels engaged  in  this trade, some of which do a little coasting. It  is  not intended that the clause shall apply to them, though  it  should apply to large river boats which load and discharge the bulk of their cargo  at  big ports. I suggest that the clause be allowed to pass as it stands, and chat when definitions of &#34; river and bay boats&#34; and &#34;limited coasting trade&#34; have been arrived at, there should be a recommittal, if it be thought necessary. I admit the force of the contention that the matter should not be left to regulations. </para>

          <para>. - A number of vessels visit outlying South Australian ports in ballast, going to them from various parts of the world to obtain cargoes of wheat. At these places there may be difficulty in obtaining sufficient labour to do the discharging of the ballast and the loading of the wheat, and there may be difficulty in deciding whether there is or is not a sufficiency of labour available. I have been requested by residents of Port Darwin to draw attention to the fact that when two steamers arrive together, there is not always a sufficiency of labour available locally for the handling of their cargoes, and the crews have therefore to be employed to give quick discharge. I ask the Minister whether it would not be well to make an exception in regard to outlying ports such as that. </para>

            <para>- It is not my desire that crews should be employed in the work of loading and discharging cargo, except where that may be absolutely necessary, because of the difficulty in getting other labour. Many of the South Australian coasting steamers carry men specially for the handling of cargo. They have extra men on their articles for this purpose. This is done in the Spencer Gulf and west-coast trade, and it is the practice of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company to carry extra men. The clause as it stands might work hardly in some cases. </para>

Some honorable members thought that the agreement should not be signed except in the presence of the superintendent or the inspector of seamen. The Board of Trade, however, are anxious that no executive officer shall be brought into the transaction. </para>

          <para>.- The New Zealand Act follows the Imperial Act, by declaring what are to be the conditions of the agreement. This Bill departs from the principle altogether, and leaves the provisions of the agreement to be prescribed by regulation. In the New Zealand Act very important provisions are included as necessary terms of the agreement. The time when an engagement commences, for instance, might be material for many purposes. That is incidentally referred to in clause 81, which provides that a seaman&#39;s right to wages shall be taken to begin either at the time at which he commences work or at the time specified in the agreement. I do not know why the provisions embodied in the Imperial Act as to the terms of the agreement have been left out of this measure. The point to which the Minister&#39;s attention has been called seems to give a very wide latitude to the superintendent to determine what are to be the terms of the agreement. I am not a great believer in the principle of leaving to be prescribed by regulation all those matters which, in other parts of the world, are usually made statutory conditions. . I understand that at present representatives of the ship-owners and the seamen meet together, and go through the agreement clause by clause. There seems to be no necessity for bringing in the superintendent to interfere with them. </para>

            <para>- Very well. The question has been raised whether this clause permits of the agreement being signed &#171;on board ship. Reading it in connexion with clause 10, I think that it does. That doubt has arisen, 1 think, owing to the fact that there has been omitted from this Bill the provision in the New Zealand Act, that where the agreement is signed on board ship, or at any place other than the mercantile marine office, the expense of bringing the superintendent there shall be borne by the ship-owner. Under the clause as it stands it may be that in few, if any, cases will the superintendent go on board ship to see that an agreement is signed, and attendance at the mercantile marine office, where something like  100  men had to sign on, would occasion loss of a day. I think it would 6e well to insert the provision in the New Zealand Act that the expense of bringing the superintendent to the ship shall be paid by the ship-owners. </para>

          <para>. - I think it inadvisable to make the amendment suggested, that the agreement can be signed on shipboard if* the superintendent goes there. I cannot see that there is anything to prevent the agreement being signed on board ship under the clause as it stands. That is evidently the opinion of the Senate, because an amendment moved there to add the words &#34; at the mercantile marine office &#34; was negatived. The agreement, therefore, may be signed wherever the superintendent is. The superintendent is not prohibited from going on board a ship, and, therefore, an agreement can be signed in his presence on a ship. I do not know, however, that we are called upon to invite the practice of signing agreements on board ship. Wherever possible the agreement should be signed on shore. The Minister has pointed out that an agreement might be read in such a way as to be little understood by the men called upon to sign it. It was shown before the Commission that usually the agreement was read, just as an oath is administered, at such a rate that even a person educated in the language used in the agreement, which is not always or generally the case, could hardly understand one word in ten. Frank Bullen and Conrad, in their works - and both of these have had great experience of the sea - state that no human being can detect a solitary word, or the meaning of it, except as we catch the concluding words of the oath, &#34; So help me, God 1&#34; - and the peremptory demand for half-a-crown. The unfortunate sailor who is either recovering from, or is, perhaps, still under, the in-, fluence of drug or drink, or is a foreigner, does not know what the agreement is. If he did, he would not, usually, be there. I think we should encourage the signing of agreements on shore. The Government have agreed not to compel agreements to be signed at the mercantile marine office, but to leave the place of signing to the discretion of the superintendent. He will know that in some cases it is perfectly proper for an agreement to be signed on board ship, and that in others it is not. The matter should be left to his discretion, but we should provide that the agreement must be signed in his presence. I cannot agree with the suggestion made by the Board of Trade. It was carefully considered, but we could not adopt it. </para>

          <para>. - In my opinion, the clause ought to be left as it is, and I am rather surprised at the remarks of the honorable member for Kooyong, who had charge of the measure in another place, and ought to know something about it. Running agreements for six months are an established practice recognised by the Ship-owners Federation and the organizations of the seamen ; and I cannot understand anybody desiring to depart from it except some hungry shipowner for reasons best known to himself. If a man signs on in Melbourne, the ship may not return to that port within six months. It is quite possible that a vessel may go into the Queensland or Western Australian trade, and, under such circumstances, a seaman can compel the shipowner to give him his discharge and pay his fare to the home port. The only object I can see in the suggested alteration is that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> may permit some grasping ship-owner to evade the expense of sending the seaman home. In the ordinary Inter-State trade a voyage does not occupy even three months; for obvious reasons, there is no necessity for men to sign on every time they start. As I say, the only object I can see is that some shipowners - and not the best of them - may have an opportunity to swindle the members of their crews. The established practice has worked remarkably well, and I can see no cause to interfere with it. It appears to me ridiculous to make an alteration simply for the sake of making an alteration. </para>

          <para>. - I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the fact that in the Bill of 1908 there is a proviso, in section 48, that, in the case of a limited coast-trade ship an agreement, not otherwise contrary to the Act, may be made for a period not exceeding two years. This, I understand, was taken from the New South Wales Act, and I believe that the Minister has had a communication from the North Coast Shipping Association asking for the retention of this proviso. This would inflict no hardship on any seaman, who can obtain his discharge on very short notice, though I believe it would impose some inconvenience on the master. Why has this proviso been omitted from the Bill ? </para>

        <para class="block">That is precisely what we are trying to provide for in this Bill. In New Zealand the home-trade agreement is for six months. In Canada the running agreement is not to exceed six months, and under the Merchant Shipping Act the running agreement is to terminate on the next following 30th June or 31st December, so that it may be under six months. Six months is a fair period for any agreement made in Australia. </para>

          <para>.- The proposal in the Bill is a very fair one. A six months&#39; agreement is quite long enough. Under a running agreement a man can ship from here to London, and go thence to America or elsewhere. The home port is wherever the man has signed on. If a man signs on under a running agreement, and leaves his ship before he gets back to his home port, he is a deserter, and forfeits his wages, so that the owner is protected. If the parties do not agree, six months is too long, and if they do agree there is nothing to prevent a man renewing his agreement; and the little inconvenience that may be caused to the sailor or shipowner is small in comparison with the difficulties that often arise from long agreements. </para>

          <para>.- Will the Minister explain why a distinction is drawn in this clause between Australian-trade ships and limited coast-trade ships ? . It seems to me that it would be better for the agreement to be made with the owner or master in the case of Australian-trade ships. A man may be shifted from one vessel to another, being still under the same owner, but not the same master. The Australiantrade ships would be a bigger class of vessel than the limited coast-trade ships, and why, in their case, should the agreement be made only with the master? </para>

          <para>. - Clause  44  provides that the master of a ship other than a limited coast- trade ship of less than  15  tons who engages any seaman shall enter into an agreement with him in the prescribed form. Clause  49  says that in the case of a limited coast- trade ship an agreement may be made with the owner or master, and in the case of an Australian-trade ship with the master. That brings it into conformity with clause  44.  If a company has ten ships, a running agreement will give it the option of putting the sailor on to any of them. On this coast until recently, although certain companies owned certain ships, it frequently happened, by a system of cross-chartering, that one company was running another company&#39;s ships. Who was responsible for the payment of the crew we did not know. The fact remains that when a seaman makes an agreement with the master of a ship, he agrees to sail on that ship; but the matter is quite different when he makes an agreement with a company to sail on any ship. A man may sail willingly on a certain ship, and have objections to sail on another. The agreement carries out a time-honoured practice, and respects the prejudices of seamen, so that a sailor will now ship on a particular vessel, and not on any one of a fleet. As things are now, for all the Committee knows, there is nothing to prevent a man shipping to serve on any one of the whole Shipping Federation&#39;s fleet. </para>

          <para>. - The Attorney-General is quite right in contending that a man should know what ship he is signing on for, but I see no reason why he should not be permitted to sign on before an owner as well as before a master. In some cases considerable  der  lay will be caused if signing on is always to be done in the presence of the master. A steamer like the <inline font-style="italic">loongana,</inline> for instance, is in port for only a few hours, and her captain under the recent arbitration award is at liberty to leave her as soon as she is moored, and need not return until she is on the eve of sailing. If it were discovered during his absence that one or more seamen were required, it would be necessary, under the clause, to wait for his return to get them signed on, and by that time they might have disappeared again ; and, in any case, there might be delay, postponing the sailing of the vessel. I admit that it is objectionable that men should sign on to serve on any of a company&#39;s boats. That &#39; should not be permitted. But there is no reason why a definite agreement should not be made as to the ship, the signing on being done before either the owner or master. </para>

          <para>- In the coastal and Inter- State trade the practice is to sign on before the master, and nine-tenths of the men employed in these vessels do not know their owners, or the managers, where the vessels are the property of limited companies. I understand from a well-known Inter-State captain that in his experience the signing on before a master is invariable. In the little river ports owners as well as masters are made available, because it often happens that the masters assist the crew in loading and unloading, and it would be inconvenient to call them off their work. </para>

          <para>.-I think that the term used in the Merchant Shipping Act is &#34;port of destination,&#34; and those are the words used in the Constitution. It would be best to stick to that phrase, because the meaning of it will be the subject of a decision by the High Court in connexion with merchant shipping awards made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. The question is whether port of destination means an intermediate port or the final port of destination of a voyage. A vessel leaving Sydney for a voyage through the Pacific Islands to Auckland and back to Sydney touches at a number of ports, all of which might be referred to as ports of destination. </para>

          <para>-- Is there any reason for making noncompliance with this clause an indictable offence? There would be great delay in trying the master of a ship for such an offence, which might, after all, have been merely the result of inadvertence. The requirements of the case might be met by imposing a heavy fine. Probably if a person charged were convicted by a jury, the result would be merely the imposition of a fine. That being so, why incur the delay of submitting him to a trial bv jury ? This is the only indictable offence with which we have yet dealt. I ask the Minister to make a note of the point. </para>

          <para>. - It is very easy to state a hard case, but we have to look at the facts, and the possibility of seamen being victimized. The position is very clear. It is provided that a master of a ship who fails to comply with this provision shall be guilty of an indictable offence. He has, however, to be proved guilty. It is a perfectly good defence for him to say, &#34; I went to the Mercantile Marine Office and inquired for the superintendent, but he was not there. My ship was ready ; I had to go to sea ; the tide was right, and I went.&#34; We provide that he shall make out a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case that he tried to comply with the clause. I do not agree with the suggestion that the offence should not be an indictable one. If we allowed it to be regarded as a trivial offence, we might as well forego the Bill altogether. We are dealing with a class of men whom the Equity Courts have always taken under their special protection as persons who are not capable of looking after their own affairs. The Courts have always- held out to them a helping hand, and&#39; we have also to safeguard their interests. The master of a ship, on the other hand, should not be victimized, and we therefore provide, that if he makes a reasonable effort to secure the sanction of the superintendent he shall not be held blameworthy. </para>

          <para>.- The whole question of rating requires to be very seriously considered. The rating, A.B. in Australia, has come to be an absolute misnomer. Unfortunately, the old A.B. is to a very great extent dying out. A man obtains his rating as A.B. after he has been employed for three or four years as an ordinary deck scraper on a cargo steamer trading along the coast. It is about time that we considered whether men who are not qualified sailors should be classified as A.B&#39;s. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member is quite correct. So long asa man can handle an oar - and most grotesquely some of them do it - and has been three years on a cargo steamer he can be rated as an able-bodied seaman. We passed that clause because it was understood that the question of rating would be considered when the proposed amendments of the measure came up. We are now dealing wholly and solely with the question of rating; and I contend that the discharge should state distinctly whether a man is a sailor or is just an ordinary deck hand. </para>

            <para>- It does not prescribe any qualification, but simply defines a seaman as a man who has served a certain time at sea, and who may be nothing more than an ordinary deck hand. For such men as these, infinitely better sailors are to be displaced - men who have spent their lives in navigating small sailing vessels. It is the height of absurdity to class a manas an able-bodied seaman when he may know nothing whatever of seamanship, and may have no experience in steering or in handling canvas. </para>

          <para>-This will compel the owners of coastal boats to discharge men who have been all their lives at the work, and supplant them with others who are probably not half as skilful. A man who has been engaged wholly on a steamer as a deck hand is just as dangerous a man as could be found to put in charge of a ketch or coastal vessel. The whole question of rating should be considered and decided by the Committee now; and I repeat that the discharge should show exactly the work in which a man has been engaged. </para>

            <para>-I say that the definition of an able-bodied seaman is wrong; a deck hand is not a sailor in the proper acceptation of the term. This would not be of so much importance if the schedule did not compel the carrying of able-bodied seamen according to the definition set down in the Bill. In my opinion, wrong is being done to the men at present employed, and it is stupid to classify men for work in which they have had no experience. </para>

          <para>. - We all have a desire to do what is necessary to prevent grave injustice. I have been trying to follow the argument of the honorable member to see precisely in what direction the danger lies, and that these men are in danger. Apparently, there is a class of ship &#176;n which the most skilful and reliable seamen of Australia are to be found. We are told that those we. have been in the habit of regarding in the light of seamen are nothing more than persons who have worked on steam-boats, and cannot be relied on in any serious emergency, and that under this Bill able seamen are to be displaced. This is a most extraordinary position. I ask that some attention should be paid to the Bill, and it should be indicated by the honorable member what is the particular class of men to whom it is proposed to do this monstrous and asinine wrong. I know of my own knowledge how rating is obtained. I was, with twentyeight other men-, shipped as a seaman on one discharge, which was handed from one to the other ; and during a strike in Sydney no men were shipped, not on one discharge, but without any discharge at all ; they were shipped on permits. A permit represents an effort of imagination on the part of the applicant to remember the circumstances under which his alleged discharge has been lost. It is the practice to ship men on worthless discharges or on these permits; and now, by this Bill, it is proposed, for the first time in the history of navigation, that that practice shall not continue, but that no man shall be shipped unless he is of a certain age, and possesses certain qualifications. Then, the honorable member will observe, by the proviso to clause 37, that a man who has been rated as an able seaman before the commencement of the Act shall continue to be so rated ; and, therefore, every able seaman now will be an able seaman under this measure. Under the circumstances, I earnestly hope that the honorable member for Franklin will not persist further. I freely admit that the nursery of our mercantile marine is to be found in our fishing and other small craft, and all men employed thereon who are now entitled to be rated as able-bodied seamen will continue to be so rated under the schedule. </para>

            <para>- Fifty tons  win  cover most of them, but still there are some which are considerably over 50 tons. Every one of those will have to carry a complement of A.B.&#39;s, as denned by the Bill. The young men of the district now employed on them have not got that rating, and under this Bill cannot get it. I am certain the Minister does not want to turn them out of their positions to make way for others who, although they have the definition of A.B., may not understand the navigation of those boats. A man who has spent his life on such boats is an infinitely better sailor, so far as they are concerned, although he has never got the rating of A.B., than a man who&#39; has been a deck hand on a steamer and has become an A.B. </para>

          <para>. - I suggest that the Minister should follow the New Zealand Act and the Merchant Shipping Act so far as this clause is concerned. The clause is all very well as far as it goes, but it is frequently found that there is great difficulty in truthfully making a report on the subject ; and, in clause 61, there is a stringent provision as to the accuracy of these discharges. In the Merchant Shipping Act the following words are added: &#34;Or may state in the said form that he declines to give an opinion upon such particulars.&#34; In the New Zealand Act, the following words appear : &#34;Or may state in the said form that he declines to give any opinion upon such particulars, or upon any of them.&#34; I suggest that similar words should be added after the word &#34; discharged.&#34; </para>

          <para>.- Difficulty arises from the fact that if one knowingly makes a false statement regarding character he is liable to be indicted. Character is a mere matter of opinion. We here know one another fairly well, but would hardly like to be called on to give certificates of the characters of our fellows. The master who reports on character must report on the character as a whole, as a guide to the person to whom the discharge will be presented ; to state one feature of the character would not be sufficient. If a mistake is made the risk of being indicted is run. A master ought not to decline to give a certificate of character, because that may suggest that something is being suppressed. The discharge is a privileged communication, and an action could not be brought by an aggrieved seaman for any false statement on it, but there is the risk of the master being indicted for having made a wilful and malicious mistake. </para>

          <para>. - It is an indictable offence to give a discharge falsely indicating the capacity in which the seaman has served. The seaman is entitled to a discharge stating that he has served as A.B., O.S., fireman, or greaser, and the length of his service. If his service has been good, the master should not write on the discharge &#34; D.R.,&#34; which means &#34; decline to report.&#34; It sometimes happens that the very best seamen displease the master, or the officer with whom they come most into contact, and, consequently, when their discharge is written out &#34; D.R.&#34; is placed upon it. This is most unjust, and often damns a man&#39;s chances of getting another ship. The seaman who has given good service is entitled to a proper discharge.

          <para>- - I am in favour of the clause as it stands, but there should be some modification of the penalty. The Royal Commission took a lot of evidence on this subject. The 1904 Bill followed the Merchant Shipping Act, clause 69 providing that the master might state that he declined . to give any opinion upon any or all of the particulars required to be written on a discharge. The Commission not only took the evidence <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> many seamen on this point, but also questioned Captain Charles Parsons, the Superintendent of Mercantile Marine in Victoria, part of whose examination I shall quote. It is as follows : - 497. What does a &#34;decline to report&#34; discharge mean? - That the master declines to report to the man&#39;s ability as a sailor, or as to his conduct. 498. It is generally considered a bad discharge? - Those to whom such a discharge is presented generally interpret it as meaning that the man has not a good record. 499. Do you think it is advisable in new legislation of this description to compel a master to give a man a discharge on his merits, setting forth that he is either good &#39;or bad? - Yes. 500. Although a &#34; decline to report &#34; discharge is generally recognised as a bad one,  a  master is not responsible at law for it?  -  I think that he is. I believe that the question has been dealt with by the Courts. 501. I wish you could show me a decision to that effect? - I have heard of a case in which a master was proceeded against for giving a man a bad discharge. 502. A &#34;decline to report&#34; means an attempt to avoid making any statement as to a man&#39;s record? - That is so.&#39; 503. You think there should be no medium course - that a discharge should be either goad or bad ? - I do. </para>

            <para>- It is good enough for me. Whatever position in life a man may occupy, his character is his most valuable possession, and where it concerns his living we should take special pains to protect it. A man upon whose discharge &#34;  D.R.&#34;  is written is practically damned, because the letters amount to the statement that he asked for a certificate of character and his employer declined to give him one. A positive statement of bad character would hardly be worse than this negative statement. A man&#39;s service is either good, bad, or indifferent, and the actual facts should be stated about it. But if we put upon the master the obligation of making positive statements on the discharge, we should protect him in all cases where he has honestly expressed his opinion. </para>

          <para>. - No doubt it is convenient to masters to be able to write  &#34; D.R.&#34;  on discharges; other persons often find it advantageous to evade responsibility in a similar manner. But seamen are entitled to discharges on which their character and the nature of their service are truthfully stated. At present &#34;  D.R.&#34;  may be written on a discharge merely because a master has a&#39; prejudice against a man, and that will damn his chances for employment as effectually as would the worst character, leaving him without any remedy. The Royal Commission was informed that it was a regular practice in the port of Newcastle to make the lot of seamen so uncomfortable that they were bound to leave their vessels. Seamen discharged from such vessels would be sure to have their certificates marked &#34;  D.R.,&#34;  or to be given bad certificates. Clause  66  provides that a master shall be liable for wilful false statements, which is only proper, because a man&#39;s character being his most valuable possession, it should not be traduced. Seamen are often spoken of as though they were little better than dogs, but in the Bill they are treated as men. They are entitled to their discharges, and to have written on their discharges the whole truth about them. </para>

          <para>. - There is very much in what the Attorney-General has said about the treatment of seamen at some ports being so bad that they are only too glad to leave their vessels at the first opportunity. They are sometimes so incensed at their treatment that they are quite satisfied to leave their ships, and to forego the wages accruing to them. Any master of a vessel or, in the case of an American ship, the &#34; bully &#34; mate, might so treat the sailors on board as to make it absolutely impossible for them to obtain a good discharge, no matter how satisfactory their conduct would have been to a master not actuated by unworthy motives. On the other hand, while I think it should be obligatory to give a man a character where his character has been good, I do not think this provision would be altogther an advantage in the case of a man whose character has been uniformly bad., and whom it is not desirable to recommend for employment. Unfortunately, even among seamen, such cases sometimes occur. </para>

            <para>- I recognise that it is unsatisfactory from an employer&#39;s point of view. A  &#34;D.R.&#34;  discharge would indicate that the holder was not considered by his employer to be a desirable man to recommend for employment, but that practice does not compel a mast.pt to make specific charges against a man in a written document. What I see in this clause is the possibility of a master, actuated by the best of motives, and perfectly honest in his dealings with his men, having, perhaps, on board a ship a sailor of bad character, and having to set out his character in a written document. That might render him liable to an action for defamation. </para>

            <para>- Not at all. I think that the object in view - that of protection to seamen - is good. But I was suggesting that we might so word the clause as to afford ample protection to the seamen whilst at the same time protecting an honest master from proceedings at law as the result of giving a true statement regarding a man of bad character. As long as a seaman has the necessary qualifications, and his conduct is satisfactory, the master should certainly be compelled to give him a certificate, and to indorse on it his qualifications in the way provided by the clause. At the same time, where a man&#39;s conduct has been really bad, some protection ought to be afforded the master who is compelled to convey that information in a written document to the superintendent before whom the discharge is effected. I confess that I do not know exactly how to get over the difficulty, but the Minister, after consultation with the Attorney-General, might be able to overcome it. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that we shall not in this Bill repeat what, after all, is a crime upon the seamen of Australia in so far as any captain is permitted to say that he declines to report either as to the ability or conduct of his men when discharging them. My experience of a little over four years at sea teaches me that the practice simply permits an officer or master who has, perhaps, obtained his position largely because of a little scholastic training and a good memory - rather than ability - to vent his personal spleen or smallness of mind upon competent men. If a man&#39;s conduct has been of such a character as to necessitate comment by the captain, that captain should be protected in making the necessary observations, but he should not be protected in what, after all, is defamation of character. At present a master is often allowed to go free, while the seaman continues to suffer for the rest of his life, because of a discharge which will noi permit him to get another ship. The average master of a ship is not much concerned with conduct. He does not ask for angels in his fo&#39;c&#39;sle; he is more concerned about the ability of his men.- I do not think that the average seaman is over anxious to be described as an angel ; but, at the same time, he is anxious that his character shall not be defamed by a mere refusal on the part of his captain to report on it, so that he is prevented from earning a living in the. only direction in which he is able to earn it. I have in mind a case that came under my notice during my few years at sea. The only objection that the captain in this particular case had to an acquaintance of mine on board was that during the voyage he had had the supreme pleasure of thrashing a &#34; bucko &#34; second mate, who happened to be related to the skipper. When we arrived at port, the captain declined to report, on the man&#39;s discharge, as to either conduct or ability. The man, however, was not quite a fool, and he told the captain that if he did not give him a different discharge, he would undergo an. examination as to -his ability, and that, if the examination were satisfactory, he would go as far as the law permitted. The captain immediately altered the discharge, and gave him &#34;V.G.&#34; for ability, but declined to report as to his conduct. Conduct, of course, is a matter of opinion. This skipper injured the man to the utmost of his petty, miserable power, and would have declined to report as to his ability, notwithstanding that he was as good a seaman as ever worked on a ship. There are many cases of a similar character. </para>

          <para>. - Honorable members must realize that the effect of the awards of the Court and of legislation, of this character must be to raise the standard of our seafaring men. That being so, we should give them the utmost protection. The effect of this clause will be to reduce the number of bad discharges.^ that have hitherto been given. A skipper&#34; will not care to give a man a bad discharge, and there will really not be such a necessity as there used to be to do so, because there will be a better type of men available, and it will be only in a flagrant case of bad conduct that a bad discharge will be given. I do not think it will be long before a man who is known to be a pretty bad character, and who has a bad discharge, will find it exceedingly difficult to get a ship. There is no danger to be feared in passing this clause. Honorable members opposite, no doubt, think that a captain might suffer under the clause as it stands. I do not think there is any danger for the reason that, without reflecting on &#34; the sailors of the past, I believe that awards of the Court, and our legislation, must have a tendency to raise the standard. Under the existing awards, the sea is not a bad calling to follow. If we had to deal with the standards of twenty or thirty years ago there would be a good deal of force in the arguments of the Opposition; but, having in view the standard that will be created, I do not think there is any danger to be feared. </para>

          <para>. - I am loth to propose an amendment of this clause, because I recognise the difficulty of drafting one to meet the views that have been expressed by some honorable members. As it stands, the clause provides that a report as to character must not be false. In other words, a humane master, who tas on board a seaman of very bad character, must tell the truth about him. He could not be considerate, even to the point of commiseration. The obligation is thrown on the captain of doing justice, not only to the seaman, but to others who may re-engage him. A person who signs a discharge takes a very big risk; and the captain, out of kindness, might wish to modify his opinion of a seaman&#39;s character, and for this he is liable to be prosecuted on an indictable offence before a jury. We have decided to protect the seamen, who ought not to be maligned; and I suggest that it might be possible to modify the clause by making sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> a distinct clause with a lighter penalty attached. I further suggest that we might follow the wording of the Imperial Act by which such an offence is regarded as a misdemeanour. We have adopted a different terminology from that of the Imperial Act, and speak of a captain &#34;knowingly &#34; committing an offence, which does not quite mean the same thing as the terminology of the New Zealand and the Imperial Acts. Very often in our drafting we make changes of this kind, for which I cannot quite see the reason. The New </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Zealand and the Imperial Act speak of the issue of a false discharge, the captain knowing it to be false, whereas we provide that he shall be punished for making a report which is false, but the falseness of which may be known to some one else, and not to him. That may not be the interpretation which will be placed on the clause,, but, as a matter of grammar, the clause may mean that. We should, I think, provide that such an offence shall carry with it the penalty of, say, six months&#39; imprisonment,, under which circumstances the case need not go before a jury. I further suggest that after the word &#34;false&#34; we should insert the words &#34;and defamatory.&#34; This would give the captain a chance to modify his opinion about a bad fellow, but good seaman ; but be must not be maligned by defamatory statements. A sailor may be guilty of unmentionable crimes, but, at the same time, an excellent seaman; and a kindhearted captain might not wish to tell the whole truth, as he is compelled to do by theclause as it stands. If we insert the words &#34; and defamatory &#34; it will mean that the discharge must not be false tothe detriment of the seaman. </para>

          <para>. - I am quite prepared to submit to the Attorney-General and the Crown Law advisers the honorable member&#39;s suggestion that the clause be reconsidered with a view to making the penalty lighter. The object of the clause is tosafeguard the seamen as far as possible. As has already been said, all seamen are not angels, nor, indeed, are all captains ;. it is possible that both seamen and captains may have made mistakes, and our only desire is to deal fairly with all concerned. We regard the seaman as needing a little more looking after by reason ofhis position ; and this makes us, perhaps,, lean more towards him than to the officers. </para>

          <para>. - I do not profess to know the exact legal bearings of this question, but I should say that a man who knowingly gave a false and bad character to a seaman, on whom he has perhaps a &#34;set,&#34; should be deemed guilty of an indictable offence, and very severely punished. On the other hand, if the seaman be as bad a lot as could possibly be found on board a ship, a skipper ought not to be permitted to give him a good character, and thus deceive another shipmaster. </para>

          <para>.- The AttorneyGeneral is practically omitting clause 76, and inserting it, in the form of a new sub-clause, in clause 75, as being connected with the same subject-matter. I am informed that the provision will be very difficult to carry out, as many ships arrive on Saturday or Sunday, and there may be a holiday afterwards; in which case the time limit of twenty-four hours would be too short. In other Acts, special provision is made against the occurrence of a holiday.

The Attorney-General might look into the question of whether it is advisable to permit payments of cash wages anywhere but at the home port. </para>

          <para>. - There is a good deal to be said for the point raised by the honorable member for Angas. The clause is obligatory, but it would be impossible to carry out the arrangement in some cases. An oversea ship might arrive on Christmas Eve, which might fall on a Friday. There would then follow practically four holidays in succession. A similar state of things might occur at Easter time. The master would not be able to have access to the banks or to the agents&#39; offices, and he could not be expected to carry sufficient money with him to pay the wages. Even a ship limited to the coastal trade might be delayed by stress of weather or accident to the machinery, and arrive at a time when the banks and other offices were closed. The clause should be made a little more elastic to provide for contingencies of that kind. </para>

          <para>- Section 12 of the New Zealand Act provides that if, by reason of the termination of an agreement with the crew by effluxion of time, a seaman is discharged and reengaged on the day of his discharge on the same ship, his wages under the new agreement shall commence on the following day.. There was a doubt as to whether, when a seaman was off and on articles on the same day, he was entitled to two days&#39; wages. That and other questions may arise under this clause, by which it is provided that the wages shall be taken to begin either at the time at which the seaman commences work, or at the time specified in the agreementfor commencing work or presence on board. But a man might agree to commence work on a Wednesday, and by reason of urgency, he might have to set to on Monday. The question might then arise, was he subject to the law as a seaman until the time agreed upon for commencing work ? These points are technical, but they lead to law suits, and should be considered by the Minister. </para>

          <para>.  - Clause 81 of the Bill of 1908 provided that if the service of a seaman terminated before the period contemplated in his agreement because of the wreck or loss of the ship, or because of his being left ashore at any place abroad under a certificate of his unfitness or inability to proceed on the voyage, he should be entitled to his wages up to the time of this termination of service, but that if he had been engaged by the run he should be entitled to a proportionate part of his wages, subject to all deductions, to be calculated up to the termination of his service. Then section 158 of the Merchant Shipping Act provides that where service is terminated before the date contemplated in the agreement, by reason of the wreck or loss of a ship, or by reason of the seaman being left ashore at any place abroad under a certificate provided for by the Act, showing his unfitness or inability to proceed, he shall be entitled to his wages up to the time of the termination, but not for any longer period. In this clause nothing is said about unfitness to proceed because of illness, and a man engaged by the run will be entitled to the wages for which he had agreed on its termination, although his services may be determined earlier by the wreck or loss of the ship. Why has this departure been made from an Imperial Act and the draft of 1908? </para>

          <para>. -The Bill of 1908 followed the New Zealand Act of 1903, section 79 of which provides that where a seaman, wherever engaged, is discharged in New Zealand before completing the full term of his engagement, he shall be paid, or may recover, the full amount of his wages up to the time of his discharge, notwithstanding that he has not completed his full term. Where his service terminates before the date contemplated in the agreement, by reason of the wreck or loss of the ship, or by reason of his being left ashore at any place under certificate of his unfitness or inability to proceed on the voyage, he is entitled to his wages up to the time of such termination. It is further provided that a seaman engaged by the run shall be entitled to a proportionate part of the wages to which&#39; he would have been entitled on the termination of the run, subject to just deductions, and that that proportion shall be calculated up to the termination of his service. The wording of the New Zealand section was practically followed in the Bill of 1908. I think that after the words &#34;entitled to&#34; there should be inserted the words &#34; a proportionate part of the wages to which he would have been entitled on the termination of the run.&#34; Surely there can be no reasonable objection to such an amendment. </para>

The position, however, is different when a seaman engages for what is termed &#34; the run.&#34; If, for instance, a man engages to take a vessel from Port Pirie to Newcastle, he undertakes to do for a lump sum the ordinary work of a seaman on board, and if, for any reason over which he has no control, he is prevented from taking the ship to the port to which he has undertaken to take it, his wages should not be deducted. </para>

            <para>- Where men are paid by the month, when a wreck occurs, or anything else happens by which their vessel cannot be taken to its intended destination, their wages immediately cease, but, in so far as a &#34; run &#34; is concerned, the men invariably contract to take a vessel from one point to another for a lump sum. They undertake a risk. The quicker the vessel reaches its destination, the sooner they earn their money. In the case of a wreck, which for all practical purposes is under the control of the captain - one of the parties to the agreement - the seamen are in no way responsible, and they should get their money. They are on the spot, ready and willing to perform their contract, and are prevented from completing it by circumstances over which they have no control. It would scarcely be fair in such circumstances to say to them, &#34; Although you are willing and ready to complete your contract, and have been prevented from doing so through no fault of your own, you must have a certain sum deducted from the amount agreed upon.&#34; How could the proportion to be deducted be determined? A seaman is engaged &#34; by the run &#34; to take a vessel from one port to another, regardless of time. In ordinary circumstances, a vessel might run from Port Pirie to New- castle in ten days.; in unfavorable circumstances, she might take twenty-four. I remember being on a vessel which took that time to make the &#34; run.&#34; How, then, would the honorable member in such circumstances apportion the amount to be paid ? It could not be determined on the basis of time, nor could it be on the basis of distance. A sailing vessel might take a week in some circumstances to cover  500  miles, and in others she might cover it in two days, so that the amount to be deducted could not be determined on the basis of either time or distance. Where the practice has been to pay a lump sum &#34; on the run,&#34; the seamen should receive the full amount even if they are prevented by a wreckfrom completing the contract. </para>

          <para>.- Any confusion that may have arisen is due to the fact that we have departed from the terms of the New Zealand Act. Sub-clause  1  agrees with a provision in the New Zealand Act upon which it appears to have been founded, as well as upon the Imperial Act. That provides that in the case of a wreck, the seamen shall be entitled to their wages, under the agreement, up to the time of the disaster. I have always thought that that is rather hard on the seamen. It was pointed out in the evidence during the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> inquiry that some of the sailors were given a few pounds by passengers, because they had lost everything, and their pay had ceased from the time of the wreck. In sub-clause  2  we have departed from the New Zealand Act, under which only a proportion is paid where the service of the seamen engaged on the run terminates by reason of the wreck or loss of the ship.. The New Zealand Act provides that where a seaman whose services are terminated by. the wreck or loss of the vessel has been engaged by the run, he shall be entitled to a proportionate part of his wages. Here we provide that he shall be entitled to the whole of them. Since the New Zealand Act provides for the payment of a proportionate part, it is to be assumed that it is possible to find out, in relation to time, at all events, what ought to be the proportion paid on the destruction of the vessel. </para>

          <para>. - I have received a letter suggestingan amendment of this clause, which provides for compensation for a premature discharge. It is stated that it frequently occurs that a vessel going from one port to another is laid up and unable to earn anything, and it is suggested that after the word &#34; earned,&#34; in sub-clause  1,  the words &#34; unless he is provided with a passage back to the port of dischargementioned in the agreement &#34; be inserted. Hardship must be experienced in any circumstances, but where a ship is laid up there must be special hardship. If in such circumstances a sailor is granted his- passage back to the port where he was engaged that should be sufficient. </para>

          <para>. - Australiantrade ships are practically the only vessels with which we are dealing under this clause, and it seems to me that the ordinary agreement made in connexion with them would provide that seamen signing on should be returned to the port at which they were engaged. With one slight exception, the clause is the same as that which the honorable member put before the Senate. The Board of Trade took exception to it as not being in accordance with the Imperial Act, but in introducing the Bill of 1908 in another place, the honorable member for Kooyong said that the Government had adhered to the clause as drafted, &#34;as it made for definite compensation to the seamen.&#34; I think it advisable to allow the clause to pass, subject to the technical amendment I have moved. </para>

          <para>.- Inthe definition of &#34; master &#34; we do not follow the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, which provides that the word includes any person lawfully acting as master of a ship. This is not the place to move an amendment, but, had the definition clause been before us, I should have made a suggestion in this connexion. I ask the Minister to bring the definition into line with the Imperial Act. It will be noticed that some of the provisions of the Bill were framed before the awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and, according to the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, for instance, a seaman, in addition to his wages, is entitled to a free passage to his home port. These matters ought to be borne in mind, or we shall really be giving seamen the benefit of the Bill, and also of special provisions made in Acts and awards since the Bill was introduced </para>

          <para>. - This amendment is inserted to provide a punishment for men who sign on, and, atthe last moment, do not turn up. Such men, although they have never been on the ship, are practically deserters. Men who have joined the ship and fail to proceed to sea are already provided for as deserters. It is this sort of offence that plays into the hands of the crimps, who keep the men from one ship out of the road and supply others. We are endeavouring to do our best for the men, but they should take the responsibility for their own actions. </para>

I do not say it is the fault of the Government, but half of our seafaring men who are charged with drunkenness have been simply drugged and poisoned. lt would be much better if the authorities would take one-half the trouble they do over the drunkenness, in order to insure that our sailors are not treated in this way. Sailors, I am sorry to say, are regarded as the legitimate prey of certain classes of the community, and people generally regard the position with indifference. It would appear as if laws were passed simply to ornament the statute-book, and we ought to see that firemen and sailors get something like a &#34; fair deal &#34; without piling up penalties against them. </para>

          <para>. - I should be very sorry to brand any section of the community unnecessarily with any particular offence, but we cannot ignore the fact that it so frequently does exist so far as certain seamen are concerned. As regards the Honorary Minister&#39;s objection to putting a reference to it in an Act of Parliament, I remind him that a much more serious offence, relating to embezzling or wilfully damaging cargo, stores, or equipment, is mentioned a few clauses further on. It cannot be urged, therefore, that the seaman will suffer any undue detriment by the insertion of the suggested provision, while it is thought that it might have a good moral effect. </para>

          <para>.- I believe this Bill will do away, to a large extent, with crimping, and thus remove a great deal of the temptation to certain people to make sailors drunk or drug them. The Bill will, therefore, have a beneficial effect in that direction, and the ship-owners, will be benefited also by its passage. </para>

          <para>.- The conditions imposed by this clause seem to be more onerous than those imposed by the Imperial and New Zealand legislation. It is questionable whether it is necessary to apply them to ships registered in Australia, or engaged in the coasting trade, of 500 gross registered tonnage and upwards. In the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906 these conditions are limited to British foreigngoing ships of 1,000 tons and upwards gross tonnage. </para>

            <para>- I do not regard it from that point of view. The fourth sub-clause seems to me indifferently worded. It provides that the Minister may cancel the certificate of any cook for incompetency or misconduct. Any occupant of the office of the Minister of Trade and Customs must have too much to do to have time to satisfy himself as to the competency of a ship&#39;s cook, and this would be especially difficult for so sincere a champion of the right as is the present Minister. What would suggest incompetency? A cook reported upon might merely have failed to please those for whom he was cooking on a rough day, while almost anything might be construed as misconduct. If it is intended that the Minister should act on the report of a subordinate, why is not the sub-clause phrased differently ? </para>

            <para>- Their record may be wiped out by the Minister. Parliament is often rather callous in the punishment it provides for men whose living depends upon their holding certificates. If the owner of a motor car offends against the traffic regulations, and has his licence cancelled, he is able to employ a chauffeur, but if the chauffeur&#39;s licence is cancelled, the man loses his means of living. Similarly, if a cook&#39;s certificate is cancelled or suspended, he may be forced to stand for Parliament, or look out for some other way of earning a living. </para>

The desire is that a better state of affairs shall exist in the future. The Minister has power to delegate his authority. However comical the view taken by the honorable member for Wentworth, the sufferings of hundreds of men at the hands of incompetent cooks have &#34;been anything but humorous to them. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Hindmarsh seems not to be aware that I was not speaking against the provision requiring the employment of certificated cooks, of which I am in favour. On every vessel there should be some one who is able to cook properly. But it should not be for the Minister to say whether a cook is competent. I suggest that the honorable gentleman should consider the matter, and, if necessary, have the clause amended in another place. </para>

            <para>- The consideration of the definition clause has been postponed; so that if the honorable member desires, as he says, to make the meaning of either of these words more stringent and less nebulous, he will have the opportunity to do so. As to the responsibility being placed upon the Minister, I need only remind him that the power must be intrusted to some person, and that the only person to whom it could be reasonably intrusted is the Minister who is responsible to this House and to the country. No doubt, examinations will be prescribed, and the test in the case of a cook will probably be that he shall cook a plain meal without spoiling the food. Many persons, as I have previously said, follow the sea because they have failed at other callings ; and some men have probably acted as ships&#39; cooks because they have been unable to succeed in other callings on ship-board. I think this clause is very necessary, and I hope that it will pass. </para>

          <para>. - I think this clause is very necessary, because the majority of seamen have had ample cause, at one time or another, to complain, not of the quality of the provisions supplied, but of the way in which they have been cooked. Cases have occurred where ships&#39; companies, otherwise peaceably disposed, have been goaded to the verge of mutiny by having served up to them improperly cooked provisions, which have militated very much against their health. I think, therefore, that it is wise to provide for certificated cooks. The defect of the clause, however, is that, in the case of ships of upwards of  500  tons gross registered tonnage, there is no provision for more than one certificated cook being carried. On some of the larger vessels which carry passengers, a number of cooks are necessary, and those who deal with the passengers&#39; food do not always cook the food supplied to the crews. I do not think that the clause as it stands goes far enough. Surely it is insufficient to provide for only one certificated cook being carried on a vessel of, say,  12,000  tons burden. On such a vessel there might be ope certificated cook acting as chief, while the real work would be done by uncertificated cooks, so that passengers and crew, under this Bill, would be just as much at the mercy of complete novices as they are at present. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister is empowered to draw up scales of medicines and medical stores, and may sanction a book containing instructions. Under the British Board of Trade the <inline font-style="italic">Ship Captains&#39; Medical Guide</inline> is published, and, in all probability, that will be the book suggested under the Bill. The Board of Trade took exception to many provisions in this Bill ; but, as a matter of fact, some of these have since been adopted, and made part of the British law. For instance, the clause dealing with allotment notes was objected to, but it has since been accepted by the House of Commons. The Board of Trade, however, takes no exception to this penalty, which applies only to vessels in the Australian trade, and British ships, until they are registered here, will not come under the clause. We are providing for our own ships, and I do not think the penalty is too high. </para>

          <para>.- I do not wish to deal with the point raised by the Minister, because the argument of that honorable gentleman seems to answer itself. There is, however, a curious anomaly in the clause. In the first place, it applies to the master or owner of a foreign-going ship, and he has to keep a supply of medicine as ordered by the Minister. I understand that the Minister will merely order the same sort of medicine as is required by the British Board of Trade. While this clause applies to foreign-going ships, the master is the only man who is fined if he does mot comply, although, perhaps, this may not be due to bis own fault. We have a pious expression of opinion, which we cannot enforce, that if the master is convicted through the act or default of the owner, the master may recover the penalty and costs from the owner. How can we say what is to happen in the owner&#39;s country, 10,000 or 12,000 miles away? Could we arrest the ship when the master is convicted through no fault of his own? Could he recover the penalty and costs from the owner in an Australian Court? Where could a master recover the penalty and costs? In a foreign country, I take it, although this Bill will give him no power in any country beyond the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- It seems to me to &#34; depend &#34; very considerably; and I desire to know exactly what the clause means. If the master cannot recover in an Australian Court, the clause is, as I have said, merely the expression of a pious hope, for the Bill does not give one iota of claim in any other country. Of course, the Bill binds the Australian owner, but the foreign owner is in a different position, unless we can arrest the ship; and I do not know how we stand legally in that regard. </para>

          <para>.- It is rather hard to follow these long medical clauses. Sub-clause 3 deals with apprentices and seamen who are left on shore in any place in Australia, by reason of sickness or accident on an Australian registered ship. It is provided that there shall be a deposit of the full amount of the wages due to the seaman to the end of his engagement, for a period not exceeding three months, and, in addition, the medical expenses are paid. At the end of the clause it is provided that, in lieu of the express benefits which I have mentioned, a seaman may elect to be sent back to his home port, and receive all the wages due, the medical expenses also being paid. In other words, a seaman gets all the wages up to the time he is left on shore, and his medical attendance paid for, while he may request to be sent to the port of shipment. My attention has been called to the fact that this clause is anomalous ; and it appears to some that to give three months&#39; wages is rather too much. I do not so much object to that, though I desire to call attention to the fact that a seaman may, under the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act, be getting compensation, the amount of which is half of his wages, in addition to the benefit of this Bill. I have once or twice drawn the Minister&#39;s attention to the fact that it is really neces sary to read this legislation in the light of Acts passed and awards made since the Bill was drafted, and since the Senate dealt with it. Last year we passed an Act under which the seaman would be very properly entitled, in case of accident, to half his average wages for twelve months, up to a period of about three years. Therefore, in addition to the benefits of this clause, he will receive half his wages. In other words, he will receive all his wages up to three months, as well as medical attendance under the Bill, and half wages under the Seamen&#39;s Compensation Act. It is also necessary to look at the conditions of recent awards in connexion with shipping, because, so far as our local jurisdiction is concerned, we are really duplicating the benefits in some cases where the award is in relation to Inter-State shipping, and possibly where it relates to Intra-State shipping. The jurisdiction upon Intra-State shipping, however, is a matter upon which the High Court has yet to give a decision. I do not wish to move an amendment, but I do not know whether the Minister is aware that he is giving these double benefits. </para>

          <para>. - There is something to be said in favour of the contention of the honorable member for Angas ; but a provision of this kind is very desirable, as is shown by my own experience. On one occasion, having signed for a round voyage, I had been about fifteen months on the ship, and we put into Colombo after leaving Mauritius, where I, with one or two other members of the crew, had developed fever. I was sent ashore to the hospital at Colombo. I had only a canvas suit on at the time, all my other clothes being kept on board, and the master of the ship received orders to sail to another place. When he left, he was under the impression that I would be a dead man within four hours. However, I recovered, and after eight weeks in the hospital was discharged as cured. I did not receive one penny of the wages due to me; I was not allowed to accept any employment in Colombo, or to ship on another vessel. The authorities of the port  insisted on putting me on board the first steamer bound for London as a distressed seaman, much against my will. I wanted to obtain further employment, because I was left without money or clothes. I had to spend six weeks on&#39; that steamer living on top of a deck house, with a coiled hawser for my sleeping place, and was landed in London without a penny. I went to the agents for the owners of my ship, and explained my position to them. While they had every sympathy with me, they refused to recognise any claim on my part, in the absence of identification. The ship was at that time somewhere in Indian waters, and I have never received my wages from that day to this. I can appreciate a provision of this kind being inserted in the Bill to prevent others from undergoing a similar experience. </para>

          <para>.-! hope the moving story of the honorable member for Lang will not blind us to the statement of the honorable member for Angas that we may possibly be doublebanking with regard to some of this legislation. It is essential that the interests of seamen should be safeguarded, either by this clause or some award. I should prefer to see it done by statute; but we do not want a system of double payment of hospital expenses and sick pay. They should be ample to meet the necessities of the case, and that is what both sides of the House are anxious to bring about. </para>

          <para>.- My present inclination is to prefer the Bill as it stands, as the necessity for a doctor is governed more by the number of persons carried than by the distance of the run. Many things may happen suddenly on a ship, where you have a large number of human beings travelling outside the reach of medical science. There should be a doctor on board whenever passengers and crew number sufficient to justify his presence. </para>

          <para>. - The Royal Commission recommended that vessels carrying 160 passengers or more&#39; on voyages lasting five or more days should have medical men on board. The coastal trip that was in the mind of the Commissioners was probably that across the Australian Bight. I think that the clause might be left as it stands. We are introducing many innovations, and experience will show the directions in which we should proceed further, and, perhaps, those in which we have gone too far. </para>

          <para>.- It has been pointed out by the representatives of those engaged in the limited coast-trade that special consideration should be given in the matter of accommodation to the smallness of their vessels. The nature of the trade in which they are engaged, and the shallowness of the rivers and river entrances, make it necessary to construct vessels of peculiar design, with very small draft, on board which space is naturally at a premium. Of course, Parliament cannot consider only the commercial interests connected with shipping ; the best accommodation possible should be provided for the officers and men employed on these vessels; but, in view of the fact that they cannot afford to greatly curtail their present cargo space, and that increased demand will be made on their accommodation by the increase of the size of their crews in many cases, we should not be too exacting in our requirements. </para>

It is impossible, because of the shallowness of those rivers, to build for that trade vessels as large as those in the Inter- State trade, but it is objected that the same conditions will be required of them. I wish to know whether the Minister can meet the difficulties which have been brought under his notice. </para>

Where men do not live on the vessels on which they work, it is not necessary to provide the same accommodation as should be provided on a vessel whose voyage may last for a week or more. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Herbert</inline> Williams, the medical officer of the Port of London, one of the best authorities in the world on the health of seamen, writing to the <inline font-style="italic">Shipping Gazette</inline> of the 26th July last, says - </para>

          <para>The prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis among seamen is much greater than is supposed. A sailor&#39;s life is supposed to be particularly healthy but the conditions under which sailors live and to which&#39; attention has been drawn repeatedly in my annual reports, are such as favorably predispose to the dissemination of this disease. </para>
          <para>It may be stated that the crews&#39; quarters on vessels are habitually overcrowded, when judged by the lowest standard of accommodation which exists, or is permitted on shore, which cubic capacity is, in the case of common lodging-houses occupied by day and night,  400  cubic feet, whereas seamen may only have  72  cubic feet per head. </para>
          <para>The conditions under which seamen on vessels live are particularly favorable for the dissemination of pulmonary tuberculosis, and it would seem that until the Legislature takes some more practical interest in the welfare of seamen, pulmonary tuberculosis will continue to be a cause of much mortality amongst this class of men. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>I have pointed out before that the conditions of life on vessels for seamen can be much improved, especially in new vessels, without much addition to the prime cost of construction. The crews&#39; quarters should be situated above deck, preferably in the after part of the ship. This position will enable their quarters to be provided with skylights and adequate means of ventilation. Ventilation means the Tegular supply of fresh air to the inhabited spaces without the creation of a draught, and the extraction of the foul air so that the carbonic acid gas, &#38;c, shall be constantly removed, and the quantities not allowed to increase beyond a recognised low percentage, while the relative quantity of oxygen in the air may be as high as possible. </para>
        <para>The present regulations of the Board of Trade merely insist on the provision of a ventilator, which isoften situated over a berth, and is generally stopped up from below, or the external opening is covered up with canvas. </para>
        <para>Complaints are made of the degeneracy of the seamen found on board British ships. They can indeed do little else but degenerate under the present conditions. </para>
        <para>Persons who travel by steamer, and are enabled to sleep in state-rooms below deck, are often only too cognisant of the imperfect ventilation found in ordinary steamers even under such favorable circumstances where the stateroom is inhabited usually for only a few hours at night. They can easily imagine the condition of the seamen, shut up in quarters below deck which are practically in constant use as a sleeping, living, and dining room, generally dark, dirty, damp, and encumbered with clothing. In some of the smaller vessels the men have even to provide and to keep their food in their quarters. </para>

          <para>. - We are all agreed that it is our duty to require that seamen shall have, certainly so far as the construction of new ships is concerned, the most complete and. comfortable accommodation. The attention, of Parliament has been directed for some years to that object, and a very considerable advance has been made. In the Merchant Shipping Act of  1894,  which was supposed to be a substantial advance on previous legislation, it was required that only  72  cubic feet of space should be provided. In the Merchant Shipping Act of  1906,  however, provision was made for  120  cubic feet less messroom and bathroom accommodation. That was a substantial advance in a very proper direction. The Commonwealth Navigation Bill, of 1904, followed the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, and it required that provision should be made for only 72 cubic feet of air space. That Bill was subsequently referred to a Commission, of which the present AttorneyGeneral was a prominent member, and the Commission made a recommendation, in which I most heartily concurred, that a minimum of 120 cubic feet of space should be provided. That goes even a little further than the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, which, as I have said, provides for 120 cubic feet per man, less bathroom and messroom accommodation. The New Zealand Act has a like provision. Under this Bill, we have gone one step further. The Minister has very fairly said that it is quite impassible in a Bill of this kind to provide for every class of vessel. The small trading craft referred to by the honorable member for Darling Downs may, in many cases, suffer considerable hardship, but the Minister has, very fairly, promised that if he can meet their case, he will do so; that he will not wantonly inflict hardship on the owners. Apart from that feature of the situation, which has been dealt with by the honorable member for Darling Downs, I ask the Minister whether we are not surpassing anything that has been suggested in this direction by proposing to require that 140 feet of space shall be provided? I am prepared to listen to a justification of this proposal, but I do not know that anything has transpired since the Royal Commission reported, and since the British and New Zealand Acts were passed, that would necessarily justify the proposal to increase the accommodation from 120 to 140 cubic feet. We must provide for the most comfortable accommodation that can be afforded our seafaring friends, but consistently with the inquiry that has already taken place, I submit that we ought not to unnecessarily penalize ship-owners by requiring that a minimum accommodation of 1:40 cubic feet shall be provided. We must recognise that this means a decrease in the carrying capacity of every vessel. This proposed increase of accommodation for the crew will make a difference in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Kyarra,</inline> to which I referred in my secondreading speech, of ,&#163;3,500 in the matter of freight. It is unwise to unduly penalize the owners unless there is complete justification for this proposed extension. The only justification yet offered is for an increase of the present accommodation to 120 cubic feet. To increase it beyond that point means to unnecessarily penalize the ship-owners and also the public, because the cost will be passed on to the public. I am not going to propose any amendment, but I expect to hear from the Minister a statement showing that the recommendation of the Commission that 120 cubic feet should be provided was too low. </para>

          <para>.- There are one or two phases of this matter that ought to be looked at. The Royal Commission was guided by the evidence, a summary of which shows that of the witnesses on this point, three were in favour of 140 cubic feet, eleven in favour of 120 cubic feet, eleven in favour of 100 cubic feet, and six in favour of 72 cubic feet. The Commission, as I say, had to be guided by the weight of evidence, which was not in favour of 140 cubic feet. At that time there was a tradition, very strongly held by all seafaring men, that,  for  some inscrutable reason, Providence had ordained, from the beginning, 72 cubic feet of space for seamen. That was the space provided for in the Merchant Shipping Act, and had been so provided from the beginning. At the Navigation Conference a discussion arose on this very point, and the question of applying this space to all British ships arose. The representative of the shipowners, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hill,</inline> and others, including Captain Chalmers, of the Trinity Board, all assured us that 72 cubic feet was ample, and that the conditions under which seamen lived were everything that could be desired. But as the Minister of Trade and Customs has pointed out, there has been a change in England, where the space of 120 cubic feet has been adopted, although it was then scoffed at as impossible. It is perfectly proper, I contend, for us, who live in a semi-tropical and tropical country, to ask for 20 cubic feet more. </para>

            <para>- That is perfectly true; but I should hesitate to affirm the principle that we must follow the English Statutes in every respect ; we have seen too clearly, by a recent disaster, how foolish and how dangerous it is to do so. As to the accommodation for officers, I point out that a space of  350  cubic feet for two men means a room  8  feet by  6  feet, and  7  feet high. It is such a room that no sixpenny lodging-house would be able to let, except to a derelict; and it is suggested that the accommodation is so extremely restricted on some vessels that officers cannot be provided with such space. I do not think that is true in many cases, though in some cases it possibly is true. I think that wherever structural alterations can be made they should be made to comply with the Act in this particular, though, no doubt, there are vessels to which the provision is inapplicable. It is a very difficult matter; and by no means can we, in the Bill, discriminate between one vessel and another. The discretion must be left with the Minister, and, no doubt, he will exercise it wisely. We should be taking a very retrograde step if we did not insist on giving the officers, as well as the seamen, that amount of accommodation which is demanded by modern conditions and an enlarged idea of what is necessary for people who have the responsible duties of navigation. </para>

          <para>- We have to take into account the whole shipping industry, and we are all desirous that seamen should be treated properly and seafaring pursuits encouraged. This is desirable, not only in the interests of the men, but in order to secure immunity from outside attack. Our first line of defence is the Navy, and unless we have an efficient mercantile marine, we have no chance of manning our war-ships. At the same time, it is a question of what is reasonably necessary ; and it may be that, in providing for too large an air space, we may cause such an increase in the shipping charges, or such a decrease in the profits, that it will be impossible to comply with the Bill. </para>

            <para>- The Minister has promised to make allowance for that. In vessels of  200  or  300  tons dead weight, to comply with these air space conditions, will mean a loss of space representing  90  tons of freight ; and this, of course, must have a serious effect on the profits. In the report of the Royal Commission, it is stated that the practically unanimous recommen dation of the medical men was at least  120  cubic feet; and the only reference to  140  cubic feet is that in a recommendation by the British Labour Commission ; and I take it that that was a recommendation as against the  120  cubic feet in the Imperial Act. We know that from the space allowed under the Imperial Act, deductions are made for mess-room and bath-room accommodation ; so that we may take it that even the British Labour Commission did not recommend the air space provided in this Bill. The space provided in the Bill of  1907,  and in the Bill of  1908,  was  120  cubic feet, and the latter measure was drafted after the report of the Royal Commission. </para>

            <para>- Yes. How is it that we are only now asked to provide for air space of  140  cubic feet, in addition to mess-room and bath-room accommodation? If such an air space was unnecessary then, why should we, by this provision, practically cripple some of the shipping, which cannot fulfil the law without a great increase in the shipping charges? Many obligations are now cast on ship-owners, and one has to welcome these, to a large extent. But they do result in very large charges to the public. I believe that, in New South Wales, in connexion with some of the vessels referred to by the honorable member for Richmond, there has been in consequence of industrial and arbitration awards an increase of no less than  50  per cent, in freight charges during the last eight or ten months. All these things must have a very substantial effect upon the public using these vessels, as well as on the margin of profit left to the ship-owners. While I welcome every change which will give increased accommodation to the men and &#39;make their conditions as to living and wages better, I hope we shall not push these matters to such an extreme that the source from which wages have to be derived may be rendered inadequate to meet the increased demands arising from the industrial developments which are going on. </para>

          <para>As to the value of the evidence given on this head, it may be remarked that nearly the whole of the witnesses, were experts - masters, officers, seamen, and medical men. </para>
          <para>The amount of space recommended by the British Labour Commission was 140 feet. This had regard particularly to conditions obtaining in England, and climates . of a temperate character. Many witnesses pointed out during our inquiry that the climatic conditions obtaining here range from temperate to tropical, and, consequently, greater air-space is necessary ; whilst 72 cubic feet, the present minimum, or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ham</inline> aptly put it, &#34;6 1 6 1 2, the sepulchral accommodation which a man is entitled to at his own interment,&#34; is altogether inadequate. Your Commissioners therefore recommend that the air-space for each seaman shall not be less than 120 cubic feet. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">We have to pay some regard to the fact that some difficulty may be experienced in providing for very much increased accommodation on existing vessels of comparatively small tonnage. I do not see why ample provision should not be made in vessels built after the date of the passing of the measure. No one who knows what the space provided for in this Bill really means will contend that it is too much. The Attorney-General has pointed out that people would scoff at such accommodation as is provided for in this Bill being offered them even in cheap boarding houses. It must be remembered, however, that, on board ship, space is necessarily very much restricted, and there is a greater access to fresh air than there is in the cheap lodging houses used as an illustration by the AttorneyGeneral. We should, however, provide all reasonable accommodation for people who have to go to sea to earn their living. We must remember that one of the objects of this Bill is to make sea life somewhat more attractive than it is at the present time, with a view to inducing Australian young men to take to the sea as a profession, and with the ultimate object of being able later on to recruit our Australian Navy from the ranks of our mercantile marine. The more attractive we can make sea life in connexion with Australian shipping the better it will be for our seamen, for the country at large, as we may then be in a fair way of becoming a maritime nation, and having suitable material to draw upon for the naval defence of the country. One of the oldest pilots serving in Torres Strait suggested to me that there is a tendency on the part of this Parliament to grandmotherly legislation affecting sailors. Whilst agreeing that there is room for improvement in the accommodation supplied to seamen, he felt that there was some danger of making featherbed sailors of our seamen if we provided them with too many comforts. That may be an exaggerated view of the matter, and this pilot may have been contrasting the accommodation proposed, not with that provided at the present time, but with what was provided some forty or fifty years ago, when he was a boy. Consistently with a due regard to the interests of ship-owners I think we should insist upon as much reasonable accommodation as we can get for officers and crew.

I am sorry that the honorable member for Melbourne is not present, because he accompanied the honorable member for Herbert and myself on a tour of inspection of the vessel. Wefound that the officers&#39; quarters were situated on either side of a very narrow and dirty alley-way. Some were alongside thegalley, where, added to the natural heat of the tropics, there was the artificial heat arising from the engine-room and the cooking stoves of the galley. The lavatoriesand other conveniences for passengers and members of the ship&#39;s company were also situated in the same part of the vessel, and in the immediate vicinity of the officers&#39;&#39; quarters. The officers on these vessels have a very busy time. They are calling at ports very frequently, and have to be on deck while cargo is being loaded and discharged. The accommodation provided for them is anything but healthy. I think that we should make provision that, from the time of the passing of this Bill, vessels trading in Australian waters should&#39; not have the quarters of officers or crew situated in such positions. </para>

A vessel goes where she can get work, and her internal structure cannot be altered every time she is taken from one region to another. </para>

What we ought to insure, and what is insured by the Bill, is sufficient air space, efficient ventilation, and proper sanitary arrangements. The honorable member for Lang, who has had experience, must know that the worst part of the ship to sleep in is not that near the engine-room, but what is known as the &#34; glory-hole,&#34; where the stewards sleep - without exception the most horrible den in which any human being was ever condemned to exist. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> of clause  136  makes full provision for proper ventilation of quarters for seaman and apprentices, and seamen include officers.

Notwithstanding what the Attorney-General has said, there are some ships which are trading at present exclusively in tropical waters, and the quarters of the officers and the engineers are situated in a narrow alleyway, which is not more than  4  feet wide or thereabouts, and is right alongside the engine-room and the galley, where, in addition to the ordinary unbearableness of a tropical heat, they have to endure the artificial heat which finds its way into the cabins, and further raises the temperature.

It was simply abominable to go near them. The boat is not now in commission, but at that time it was subsidized by the Commonwealth to carry mails to the gulf ports. It is only typical of some other boats. On the <inline font-style="italic">Mindora,</inline> and other boats running up to Papua, and engaged wholly in trade of that kind, some of the accommodation is not fit for any human being to occupy. </para>

            <para>- From Brisbane northwards, and Brisbane is hot enough, even at this time of the year. It seems to me nothing short of downright cruelty that officers, after having performed their duty on deck, after having to retire to these wretched dens, and take their rest under suffocating conditions. Surely while we are trying to make the Bill as perfect as we can in the interests of those who go to sea, we ought to endeavour to meet all these conditions as far as we can ! I am rather surprised that this antagonism to the amendment comes from the Attorney-General, because in his early days he had some experience of sea-faring life, and that not under the most favorable conditions. He knows as well as I do how extremely bad some of these conditions can be, and actually are, at the present day. I was surprised, after not having come in close contact with vessels of that description for many years, to find that vessels which should have been broken up twenty years ago were still running on the Australian coast, and subsidized, too, by the Commonwealth. Are we still going to favour these conditions, and to fail to provide for better accommodation being supplied? The honorable member for Melbourne, who has just entered the chamber, can bear me out in my statement regarding the accommodation provided on the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego</inline> for the officers in the little narrow, stifling alley-way alongside the galley and the engine-room. </para>

          <para>. - It is quite true, as the Attorney-General has stated, that no special provision can be made for vessels which are coming down the coast from the tropics to-day, and which in a fortnight will be in the south. But the amendment deals with a class of boats which are trading practically in the tropics all the time, those boats which never come south of Brisbane, and spend most of their time in the north. Take, for instance, the boats which are running from the Gulf country across to Papua. They are in a hot climate all the while, and there is no doubt that the officers&#39; quarters, which are situated close to the engine-room, are unbearably hot in the summer. Why cannot we give attention to the requirements of those officers; they deserve as much consideration as do any other persons trading in Australian waters? It is quite hard enough for them under ordinary circumstances in the climate in which they spend most of their time. It would not entail a great expense upon the owners to remove the accommodation of the officers from the alley-ways. We ought not to put the owners to more expense than is necessary, because every <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> of expense to which we subject them will have to be paid by the primary producers and the travelling public, with a little more by way pf interest. This accommodation could be provided without putting the owners to material expense. Whilst we were in the north we inspected the accommodation at the invitation of the honorable member for Melbourne, and we realized that it was not fit for the officers to occupy in that climate. It is the intense heat which is the trouble. There is no doubt that this is a matter which calls for consideration from honorable members. I can assure them that the quarters we saw were not such as they would live in themselves or like their friends to live in. </para>

          <para>.- I . quite indorse the remarks of the honor able member for Franklin. On board the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Warrego</inline> it would be an impertinence to call the accommodation provided for officers and men decent. The supposed shower bath is a disgrace. A man had to walk along an alley-way on bare feet. He dare not wear boots, and he could not wear slippers. If I had the power I would send the shareholders and directors of that company for a twelve months&#39; cruise on board that vessel. Very few of them would come back ; the mortality rate would be alarming. The accommodation provided for the steerage and second-class passengers was an infamy. The Minister of Trade and Customs will probably recall the fact _ that some time ago an immigrant ship visited this port, the captain of which stated that he was not required by the Board of Trade regulations to provide a single bath on the vessel. It is an infamy that the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego</inline> should be supported by Australian money. We should insist upon proper accommodation being provided not only for officers and men, but also for the steerage and second-class passengers. If the Government do that they will have added to the monumental work which this Bill represents. I have no desire to delay the Committee, as there appears to be a general desire to make the measure as perfect as possible. I recollect an occasion upon which I acted as an officer on board a vessel coming through the Red Sea. I was obliged to stand in the alley-way, and I may tell honorable members that a Turkish bath was Heaven in comparison with that place. </para>
