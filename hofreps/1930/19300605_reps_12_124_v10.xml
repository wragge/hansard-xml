                        <para>-Prior to the present Government assuming office, tenders were called for the installation of a wireless telephone service between Tasmania and the mainland. Subsequently an investigation was conducted to ascertain whether wireless or cable would give a better telephone service. The superiority of the cable is beyond dispute. It would assure a full 24-hours' service, absolute secrecy, and reliability at all times. On the other hand, it would cost three times as much as a wireless service, and the installation would occupy nearly two years. Having regard to these circumstances, and the difficulty of raising money at the present time, the Government has decided to install, for the time being, a wireless service. When circumstances are more favorable, the more efficient cable service will be substituted, and the wireless plant can then be utilized for general broadcasting. The project to establish wireless telephone communication between Tasmania and the mainland will be referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. </para>

I replied to him that the Premier of South Australia had broached this matter to me about six weeks ago and that I proposed to discuss it with him in Canberra next week. This matter was discussed at the last Premiers Conference, and I subsequently made a statement to this House on the subject. At the last conference the State Premiers expressed the opinion that owing to the long distances which the representatives of some of the States Would have to travel to attend a federal gathering, conferences might be more advantageously held in each State. If there is a desire for a general discussion of financial and economic problems by the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States the periodical conferences of Premiers and the meetings of the Loan. Council provide adequate opportunities. </para>

                        <para>- The project for the construction of a railway from Red Hill to Port Augusta has been before the House on many occasions and some time ago the commencement of the work seemed imminent. I ask the Minister for Transport whether any consideration has been given to the project recently by the Government; if not, in view of the large extent of unemployment in South Australia, will this proposal receive attention at an early date? </para>

                    <para>.- Last night the committee had reached clause 10 of the proposed new schedule to the bill. I have an amendment to that clause, which raises a matter of first-class importance, not only to this chamber, but also to the whole of Australia. During the debate upon the bill there has been some doubt as to the intention of the Government with regard to making up any loss that may be incurred as a result of the operation of the compulsory wheat pool. The purpose of my amendment is to give the Government an opportunity to say what is the real intention of the wheat pooling scheme with respect either to price-fixing or making provision for any loss that may be sustained under the guarantee. The points I desire to clear up are two in number. First I wish to discover by the reception of my amendment whether the guarantee of 4s. by the Commonwealth and State Governments is really all that there is in this compulsory pooling arrangement. Is it the intention of the Government to guarantee 4s. a bushel for the wheat, and, in the event of that figure not being realized in the ordinary commercial way at the country railway stations, to make up the deficiency? As an alternative, I desire to test by my amendment whether the wheat-pooling scheme is deliberately designed to hand over to a pool board of wheat-growers an absolute monopoly of the Australian wheat market, with a charter to fix such prices for Australian wheat, flour and bread, as will give it for all wheat grown in Australia, including the exported wheat, any price that it may deem satisfactory. I appeal to the Minister to be absolutely candid as to what is in his mind and the mind of the Government. I appeal to members of all parties to treat the amendment seriously; and I trust that the Government will endeavour to accept it. If it is accepted, the liability of the Government and the people under this scheme will be clearly limited and defined. Today wheat is worth approximately 3s. 9d. a bushel at country railway stations. Let us assume that there will be a crop of 170,000,000 bushels, of which 20,000,000 bushels are withdrawn for seed. On that basis, with a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, there would be a loss of 3d. a bushel, and the cost to the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States would amount to £1,800,000, say, £2,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have the honorable member's approval to that statement. The Minister has declared the average cost of producing a bushel of wheat in Australia is us., and that the price of 4s. a bushel represents a dead loss to the farmer on his capital and labour. It is fair to assume, therefore, that if this amendment is not accepted, and the Government intends to hand over to the pool the power to fix prices on the definite understanding that the scheme is not to cost the Government anything, the price fixed for local consumption will be substantially raised. If the pool decided that 4s. a bushel was  a  fair thing, and if wheat  was  worth only 3s. 9d. a bushel, as is the case to-day, there would have to be an all-round increase of 3d. a bushel. That would cost the Australian consumers approximately £2,000,000, or about 6s. a head. Assuming that the Australian consumption totals 30,000,000 bushels, it is interesting to note that by every 3d. a bushel that the price is increased on the total harvest, the price of that required for local consumption is increased by1s. 3d. a bushel. If the price for the total harvest were raised to 4s. 6d. a bushel - and I doubt whether the pool would make it less than that - the price for Australian consumption would be increased from 3s. 9d. to 7s. 6d. a bushel, compared with 3s. 9d. a bushel abroad. But I believe that the pool will make the price 5s. and not 4s. 6d. a bushel. Let us test the matter on that basis. An increase from 3s. 9d. to 5s. a bushel would add £10,000,000 to the price paid by the Australian miller for wheat to be milled into flour for Australian consumption. If we add £2,000,000 for profit on the capital outlay of £10,000,000, we find that the bread bill of the Australian people will be increased by £12,000,000, or approximately £2 for every man, woman and child in this country. That is what this compulsory pool will mean. Honorable members should face the facts, and realize what this ghastly proposal means to the nation.I wish, particularly, to drive it home to honorable members opposite who represent the workers of this country. I am anxious to ascertain whether the cost of this scheme, which will be at the rate of £2,000,000 for every 3d. a bushel that is added to the price of wheat, is to be defrayed out of Consolidated Revenue and raised by general taxation, or is to be loaded on to the price of bread. Those two forms of taxation are entirely different. If it is to be taken out of Consolidated Revenue, it will be limited and defined; we shall know what the scheme will cost, and can put a margin on it. But if the matter is handed over to the wheat pool, we do not know where it will land us. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>Let us analyse these two forms of taxation. If the money is taken out of Consolidated Revenue, and raised by way of income tax or other direct taxation, as it would have to be, the basis will be ability to pay; the more a man has the more he will pay towards this national cause. But if we depend for the raising of the money on an increase in the price of bread, the inverse ratio will apply; the lest a family has, the more it will contribute, to this scheme, because the relative consumption of bread by the workers is out of all proportion to its consumption by the rich. The worker on the basic wage, and his family of two or three children, habitually eat more bread than does a rich man's family of the same size on an income of £5,000 or £10.000 a year. Every honorable member knows that the narrower and simpler the diet, the larger is the relative consumption of bread. If money for the assistance of the wheat industry is to be raised by what is virtually a tax on bread, this will be one of the most odious pieces of class legislation that Parliament has ever been asked to sanction. </para>
                <para>Is this a time to double the price of bread, or even substantially increase it? The great trouble with Australia to-day is the high cost of production, and yet it is here proposed  deliberately to take a step which will surely increase the cost of living, especially to the worker. I am not at the moment opposing the bill or the pool, but I appeal to the members of all parties in this House to rid themselves of their prejudices, and, when considering this matter, to bear in mind Australia's economic position. A week or two ago Parliament passed legislation, the effect of which will be to make cotton clothing, which is chiefly used by the workers, the dearest cotton clothing in the world. Now it is proposed to make bread, which enters so largely into the diet of the worker's family, dearer here than anywhere else in the world. And yet we wonder why we have 250,000 unemployed in Australia ! Evidently the Government, with the idea of ameliorating their unhappy lot, is taking steps to increase the price of bread ! </para>
                <para>I am really sympathetic towards the wheat-grower. I favour the guarantee of 4s. a bushel for this year, but I do not favour the compulsory pool, nor the placing of undue power in the hands of the pool authorities. While I think that for this year a guarantee of 4s. per bushel should be given, I believe that there is a better way of assisting the growers. If we desire to increase .the export of wheat, and put £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in the hands of the wheatgrowers, let it be done by making available to them cheaper superphosphates, and by a bonus on fallow. Lot us get down to the root of the matter. The Government's scheme will really tend to do. more harm than good, because it will induce farmers to sow wheat on every available scrap of stubble, without allowing it to lie fallow for a sufficient time. Every one will be anxious to avail themselves of the good thing while it lasts. I appeal to the Government, even at this stage, to restrict the operation of the scheme to one year, and to take the money required out of the Consolidated Revenue. Above all things, let the Government adopt measures to prevent any increase in the price of bread in Australia. I warn my friends of the Country party, who are growing restive under this argument, that if the price of bread is raised it will result in the destruction, not only of their wheat pooling scheme. but of other precious marketing schemes as well. This practice of bolstering up industries with bounties, of living in one another's pockets, as it were, and of creating monopolies of manufacturers and primary producers must come to an end, and I think we arc almost at the end now. If the Government insists on perpetrating this latest outrage, the whole false and rotten fabric will speedily collapse. Therefore, I move - </para>

                        <para>- I did not utter one word while the honorable member was orating and beating the air; but as soon as I attempt to show the feebleness of his argument, he becomes fearful of the trend of the debate, and attempts to interrupt. He tried to show that if the price of wheat for home consumption was raised above world parity rates, ' there must follow an increase in the price of bread. He spoke as if he were in possession of figures and statistics to bear out his contention, when, as a matter of fact, air the data procurable is directly opposed to him. He did not attempt to quote any figures or facts in support of his argument; he merely made 'bald statements, and was content to emphasize them with much bodily contortion. I believe that, when he resumed his seat, he had not even convinced himself; much less any one else, of the truth .of his assertions. Honorable members who spoke in favour of the bill during the second-reading debate quoted figures and statistics which' have not yet been refuted. As showing the relative prices of wheat and bread over a number of years, some figures taken from the  quarterly summary of Australian statistics for March, 1930, are illuminating. In New South Wales in 1920-21 the average price of wheat was 8s. lid. per bushel and the average price of bread for five large towns including the capital was 6.22d. per 2-lb. loaf; but in 1928-29 the average price of wheat had dropped to 4s. 9$d., or about half the 1920-21 price,, yet the price of bread dropped to only 5.88d. Comparative figures for South Australia for 1920-21 were 9s. per bushel for wheat, and 5.74d. for bread, and for 1928-29, 4s. 8£d. per bushel for wheat and 5.51d. for bread. The figures for Western Australia for 1920-21 were 9s. for wheat and 5.46d. for bread, and for 1928-29, 4s. lid. for wheat and 5.86d. for bread. It will be seen, therefore, that in Western Australia the price of bread was actually higher when the price of wheat was <inline font-style="italic">4s'.</inline> Id. per bushel lower. The position in Victoria has been thoroughly investigated recently and I shall refer to it in a moment. The figures I have quoted are a flat contradiction of the argument of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> which was that if the price of wheat for local consumption were increased by ls. per bushel there would be an increase in the price of bread. </para>

                        <para>- If the price of wheat increased very greatly it would have some effect on the price of bread; but the figures that I have quoted show that although the price of wheat fell in the period under notice by more than 4s. a bushel in the three States to which I have referred there was only a fraction of difference in the price of bread. The reason for this is easily explained. The merchants who operate between the producers and the consumers have reaped the whole of the advantage of the difference in prices. The middlemen always get the advantage of such variations in price, and not the consumers. The object of the Government in providing for this better system of marketing wheat is to cut out these intermediaries and to safeguard the interests of both the producers and the consumers. We feel that by allowing the wheat-growers to manage their own affairs we shall be able greatly to improve their position and also that of the consumers. In view of the official statistic* which I have quoted, it is ridiculous for the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition to attempt to tickle the ears of a certain section of the people by such erroneous and entirely unsupported statements as he has made this afternoon. My figures are a definite answer to the honorable gentleman. </para>

                        <para>- I have quoted from the official report, in which there is not a tittle of evidence to support the argument of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The position in Queensland is also enlightening. In that State the millers are charged up to 9d. a bushel above export parity for wheat for local consumption. Queensland does not grow enough wheat for her own consumption. That is the reason why an amount up to 9d. a bushel is added to the price of wheat for local consumption. According to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this would be reflected in the price of bread. If his contention had any substance in it, it would be so; but it is not so. The price of bread in Queensland is 5£d. per 2-lb. loaf, which is lower than the price in Western Australia. This fact is exceedingly interesting. The price of wheat for local consumption in Western Australia is consistently lower than in any other State ; but the price of bread there is about 6d. per 2-lb. loaf, or one halfpenny per loaf higher than in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member thinks that if he says that sufficiently often he will convince some one, even against his will, of the truth of the statement.  Any  reasonable person would say that there should be added to the price for local consumption a figure representing the amount charged for the transport of wheat from Australia to London, and, according to the statistics, that makes no appreciable variation in the price of bread. I have given official figures to show that a variation of as much as 3s. a bushel in the price of wheat for local consumption has made a difference of only a decimal point in the price of bread. The whole of the facts are against the honorable member's argument, which was fully answered in the debate on the second reading of the bill. Therefore, I cannot accept his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been waiting to hear the Minister answer the precise point made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> who, as I understood his argument, said first that it was quite irrelevant to refer to previous years in which there had been a fall in the price of wheat which had not been accompanied by a fall in the price of bread. We know that there are many who are willing to take up any. slack in connexion with the manufacture and distribution of bread. This fact, however, has no bearing on the position in the case of a rising price for wheat. If the Minister anticipates that the price of bread will remain stationary when the price of wheat has increased from 3s. 9d. or 4s. to 7s. 6d. or more per bushel, then I suggest that he is due for a rude awakening. When the price of wheat is falling, it may very well be that owing to arrangements between millers and their employees and between bakers and their employees, the public does not get the benefit of the fall.We are all aware of that; but the case is very different when the price of wheat increases from 50 to 100 per cent. Take one basis of argument that the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> adopted. If it is desired so to handle the wheat pool as to pay 5s. per bushel to farmers over the whole production of Australian wheat an object which the Minister has not disclaimed - its achievement will inevitably be followed by certain consequences. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The bill, as I pointed out in my second-reading speech, is perfectly ambiguous. It suggests that a real payment will be made, under the guarantee, of any shortage that the Commonwealth Bank suffers as the result of paying 4s. a bushel to the farmers. It became obvious, however, in the course of the debate, that it is not intended that the Commonwealth and the States shall find this money at all. The intention is that the Australian price shall be raised to such an amount as will provide for, not only the 4s. guarantee, but also some extra amount. The Minister argues that the Australian farmer is entitled to what is generally described as an Australian price. With that contention many of us have a great deal of sympathy; but the Minister has not answered the point made by the honorable member for Henty that, upon a crop of about  170,000,000 bushels, of which some 20.000,000 bushels will be used for seed and about 30,000,000 bushels will be consumed in Australia and 120,000,000 bushels exported, if the pool is so handled as to pay the farmers 5s. over the whole of the crop, it will mean an increase of £10,000,000 in the price of wheat to the Australian public. As to that result, upon that hypothesis, there can be no dispute; it is merely a matter of arithmetic. The amount is not quite £10,000,000; it is over £9,000,000, and well on towards' £10,000,000, and it cannot be put on to the price of 30,000,000 bushels of wheat without very substantially increasing the cost of the raw material of the millers. This £10,000,000 must be obtained from, some source. It must come either from additional charges for bread and other wheat pro-, ducts in Australia - and of all wheat products, bread is easily the most important - or from some source in between the farmer and the distribution of bread at the doo)1 of the consumer. To put it shortly, it must be taken from the millers' profits or from the bakers' profits. Those are the only sources from which I can see that it could come, if not from the public. The honorable member for Henty has said, and with reason, that it must be paid by the public. It is impossible to compel either the millers or the bakers to carry on at a loss. We cannot insert in this bill a provision for the reduction of the wages of the employees of the millers and the bakers; nor do we desire to do so. But if wages are not to be reduced, and the costs of milling, baking, and distributing bread are to remain the same, then the £10,000,000 must come either out of the profits of the millers and bakers, or from increased charges- to the Australian public for bread. That is the case which has to be answered. </para>

                        <para>- I am not challenging it. I am conceding that point. But it does not follow from that fact that a considerable increase in the price of wheat would not .mean an increase in the price of bread. On the basis of 5s. a bushel, the extra charge to the Australian public will be about £10,000,000. That money will not be obtained from the air; it must come from somewhere. The Minister has not told us where it is to come from. If, in reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> the Minister had said that, on the figures given, the increase would not be so great as 5s., that would have been an answer <inline font-style="italic">pro</inline><inline font-style="italic">tanto ;</inline> if, on the. other hand, he had said that a sum of nearly £10,000,000 was not, in his opinion, an unreasonable charge, and had proceeded to give reasons for his opinion, that also would , have been an answer. But the Minister gave no answer whatever. </para>

                        <para>- It is impossible to increase the price of wheat without affecting the price of bread, unless there is in the profits of the millers and the bakers such an amount that bread can still be produced and sold at the old price. There is no guarantee that such profits are made by the millers and bakers and this bill contains no provision for taking this large amount out of those profits. Indeed, if it were seriously suggested that any amount comparable with the sums mentioned should come out of the pockets of the millers and the bakers there would be an outcry from one end of Australia, to the other. As the  increased charge cannot come from nowhere, it would appear that it must come from increased charges for bread. To that contention I am asking for an answer. Reference to the price of wheat on a falling market has nothing to do with the position which obtains when it is proposed to increase the price of wheat while maintaining the existing costs incurred in the production of bread. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister's contention that in the past the price of bread has been unaffected by the price of wheat is unanswerable. That it should be so is to the discredit of the coUntry. As a result, of combinations and the organization of distribution, the millers and the master bakers, particularly in capital cities, have been able to exploit the consumers of Australia bowel.lessly. Inquiry after inquiry has been hold into the price of bread. During the period that there was a Prices Regulation Commissioner in "Western Australia it was made plain that the profits of the members of the Master Bakers Association were extortionate. Although the price of wheat has fallen the price of bread has remained constant. </para>

No section of the community should be entitled under statute to receive money in order to supplement the price it receives for its product - whether it be galvanized iron, cotton, or wheat - unless the amount is raised by means of a tax on the community generally. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- New. South Wales appears to be an extraordinary State. The board, constituted in pursuance of the provisions of this bill, should not have power to fix the price at which wheat should be sold for local consumption. I believe it should be a purely marketing organization and its activities confined to the orderly marketing of pooled wheat at the market prices. I do not agree with the Minister that the price of wheat in Australia should be the same as in London plus the cost of transportation. I understood him to say that nobody would object to that principle. I object to it because I believe the people are entitled to the full benefit of the natural resources of this country. If Australia produces a certain commodity in abundance the people should enjoy to the full the natural advantage which they possess. </para>

                        <para>- My statement of the principle involved does not mean that. This is where I part company with honorable members opposite. The producer of a commodity in Australia should get a fair return for the work that he does. I, therefore, agree that the grower should get a guaranteed price per bushel for his wheat, but the guarantee should be a charge on the whole of the people and not, in the major aspect of the case, a charge upon those who consume more bread than another section of the community. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I repeat that whatever the wheat guarantee is going to cost the people of Australia the charge should be part and parcel of the demand which will be made upon the Consolidated Revenues of the Commonwealth and the States. It should not be met, even in part, by the imposition of an additional charge upon that section of the community which happens to be the largest consumer of wheat products. This seems to be a sound principle of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- We have to deal with realities. They will all be under the control of the board in relation to the export of wheat, but they will not all be obliged to contribute towards the guarantee except in .so far as an indirect impost is levied upon them in the form of increased prices fixed by the board for wheat intended for local consumption. This is an objectionable principle. I object to it in connexion with the sale of  every  commodity produced in Australia. If the Commonwealth  is to come to the rescue of all industries, the national guarantee should be subscribed to by every citizen in proportion to his income, and not in proportion to the demand that he makes, as a consumer, upon the particular commodity in question. This is the principle which I stand for in connexion with this bill. </para>

                        <para>- The next point I wish to make is this. Either one of two things should be done. Either the board should be prohibited from fixing a price in excess of London parity for wheat consumed in Australia, or else the power of the board should be considerably expanded to enable it to fix not only the price of wheat to flour millers for bread-baking purposes, but also the price of flour sold by the miller to the baker. I doubt that there would be any objection to the board doing this. The sales would, I presume, be effected under licence. </para>

                <para class="block">In other words, I could not understand upon what he based his words. The figures he quoted were most amazing. A 170,000,000 bushel crop, he said, after putting aside 20,000,000 bushels for seed, would allow for 150,000,000 bushels to be marketed. Then by some strange process of reasoning he took 3s. 9d. a bushel as his basis, saying that it was the present price of wheat. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may have based his calculation on the railway siding price in both cases, but in inferring that the price of wheat for local consumption would be considerably higher than 4s. 6d. a bushel, he did not take into account the fact that any increased income from the pool would be deducted from the price of wheat for local consumption. He ignored the fact that the pool would probably effect considerable savings in handling charges and freight, without adding one penny to the price of bread or wheat. In the receiving of wheat at railway sidings there are usually from four to six agents, and in order to keep that number of men going there is a receiving charge of1½d. a bushel. Some years ago it was1¼d. a bushel. One or two agents could easily do all the work of receiving wheat at each railway siding at1d. a bushel. It is a small item, true, but that saying of ½d. a bushel would represent a big item on 170,000,000 bushels. At the other end of the rail, by elimination of various shipping firms, each with their different stacks, there should be a saving of at least another½d. a bushel. That makes 1d. a bushel for handling, alone. </para>

                        <para>- Logically the pool should benefit. I have mentioned the smaller items of savings first. I come now to. the big saving in freight. It should be at least 6s. a ton.. At present the. overseas freight is- from 40s. to 42s. 6d. a ton, largely owing to the fact that the shipping combine is closely organized, and there are: half a dozen wheat firms competing for space . With a 170,000,000  bushel crop there should be a saving of at least 6s. a ton by having one chartering agent. That represents 6d. a bag, or 2d. a bushel.

                        <para>- I am not quite sure. The amount per bushel would certainly be fractional, but over 170,000,000 bushels the saving should be considerable. However, I merely mention insurance in passing. On the main items there should be a saving of 3 1/2 d. a bushel, which the honorable member for Henty deliberately ignored. In estimating the additional amount that Australian consumers would be expected to pay for bread, the honorable member started at £6,000,000 and soared up to £9,000,000 and £10,000,000 and ultimately reached  £12,000,000.  He might just as well have gone to £20,000,000 and made a job of it. It would have looked much better' than  £12,000,000  in the headlines of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> When the honorable member starts out to perform a star turn, he should go the whole hog. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's slogan a little while ago was " Spend £50,000,000 bravely." Now he is performing the star turn of " Spend £12,000,000 foolishly". I wondered whether the honorable member for Henty spoke as a private member or as  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, but to my astonishment his leader supported him, and other members of the Opposition interjected in chorus their approval. Therefore I assume that those two leaders expressed the views of the once great Nationalist party. The honorable member for Henty said that this scheme would mean the end of everything; in other words, when the wheat-growers are placed on the same basis as other sections of the community, the worst will have happened. What is that but an admission that the primary producers have been carrying the whole of the burden. The honorable member said that the 4s. guarantee does not cover the cost of production. Of course it does not. The wheat must be marketed in new sacks for which the farmer usually pays at least 9d. Therefore his net return will be not more than 3s. 9d. a bushel. Any honorable member who contends that with the present high cost of production and the seasonal fluctuations, 3s. 9d. is an adequate. return for the wheat-grower is advocating sweating. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared*, to start with the wheat-growers. When all industries are on the same platform, all can step down together. The wheat grower has been the under dog long enough; in. spite of my opposition, legislation has been passed by this Parliament which imposes additional burdens upon him. To its credit this Government has at least submitted a proposal to give to the wheat-growers something no previous government offered. Nationalist members are endeavouring to delude the people, and the wheat-growers in particular, into the belief that they are yearning to do something for the primary producers, but when they were in power; and were asked by my constituents to stabilize the wheat-growing industry, they deliberately refused to do so. Their whole attitude condemns them as against the primary producers. I am glad that the members of the Country party are at last doing what the primary producers elected them to do - discussing proposals on their merits, regardless of the source from which they emanate, and supporting those which are in the best interests of the people. </para>

                    <para>.- I appeal to honorable members of all parties to support me in protesting against the manner in which the citizens are exploited. If this bill has one fault it is that there is no provision to regulate the price of bread over the counter in accordance with the price of wheat. Figures I shall give can be checked, and I challenge any honorable member to prove that they are wrong. From 3,000 lb. of wheat the miller produces 2,000 lb. of white flour and 1,000 lb. of pollard and bran. The flour, plus water, will yield 2,600 lb. of bread. If the same quantity of wheat is made into wholemeal flour, that flour, by reason of its greater absorption capacity, will yield more than 3,900 lb. of bread, that is 1,300 lb. of bread in excess of the yield by white flour. Despite the fact that the bakers get 1,300 lb. of wholemeal bread more than of white bread from the same quantity of wheat, they charge ½d. per lb. more for the former. That infamy should be prevented. The Minister has rightly stated that the price of bread does not always fall in accordance with a decline in the wheat market, but if bread were sold over the counter at list prices based on the current price of wheat, the consumers would not be robbed as they are to-day. </para>

                    <para>. - All honorable members admit that the price of wheat for homo consumption will be higher than the export price. The Minister estimated the difference at1s. to1s. 6d. a bushel; the. honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> at1s., and the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> at considerably more. In my second-reading speech I estimated the difference at 3s. per bushel, and I am convinced that experience will prove that figure to be fairly accurate. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> said that members of the Opposition are basing their arguments on supposition, and then he proceeded to enumerate several supposititious savings that might be effected by pool management. Why have they not been effected by the voluntary pools which,weare told, are perfectly managed? Why were they not made in connexion with both the compulsory and voluntary pools in New South Wales? The experience of the past is a more reliable guide than hazy speculations as to the future. It is admitted that there is going to be an additional cost on wheat used for home consumption, and it is urged that that will not affect the price of bread. Throughout the debate I have been unable to understand how the supporters of the bill can, one after another, claim that the higher the cost of wheat the less will be the price of bread. Not a single supporter of this pool has said that an increase in the cost of wheat will increase the cost of bread. Time and time again the Minister has quoted statistics and supplied them to others in an endeavour to prove that the price of bread cannot be increased by any addition to the cost of wheat. Let me reduce the argument to an absurdity by saying that if the price of wheat for home consumption were fixed at £1 a bushel, farmers would get that good innings about which the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> speaks, and the price of bread would be cheaper than ever. What an absurdity! Some people are having too good an innings already, and Bradman's recent innings will be as nothing compared with  the innings that these farmers will have under this bill. It has been claimed that there have been reductions in the past in the cost of flour and wheat, and that that has made no difference to the price of bread. That is perfectly true, and it is a regrettable state of affairs. At the recent National General Convention a master baker drew attention to the wage increases paid to bakers and carters since 1921. He pointed out that whereas in 1921 bakers' wages were £5 3s. 6d. a week of 44£ hours, and those of carters, £4 17s. for 54 hours, they now are, respectively, paid £6 8s. 6d. for 44 hours, and a week's holiday on full pay, and £5 8s. 6d. for 48 hours, and a fortnight's holiday each year. In 1926 the Lang - Government passed the Day Baking Act, and that, coupled with workers' compensation, childhood endowment and other incidental costs, again inordinately increased the price of - bread. This afternoon the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> said that the money had gone to the millers and bakers, who had a monopoly. There are others who have a monopoly: for instance, the operative bakers and carters, and it is their demands that have contributed towards the present high cost of bread to Australian consumers. This same delegate to the National General Convention also stated that, from 1921 to 1930, the price of flour had been reduced by £8 15s. a ton. In the same period the reduction of Id. a loaf was relatively equal to £5 10s., but the increase in wages and alteration in conditions involving expense were equivalent to another £3 5s. 6d. a ton of flour. Those are statistics supplied by a master baker, the  president  of his organization. </para>

I suggest that the honorable member should apply direct to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed</inline> for an answer. The Minister made reference to the report of the royal commission appointed by the Hogan Labour Government to inquire into and report upon the prices of flour and bread, and said that the report suggested that the price of wheat did not affect the price of bread. In answer to the honorable gentleman I quote paragraph 61 of the report which reads - </para>

Even if it is only ls. a bushel on wheat used for home consumption, it will make a difference of from £2,000,000 to £2,500,000. It is ludicrous to contend that the millers will meet the difference. Every honorable member in this chamber knows in his heart that the difference will be passed on to the consumer, per medium of the additional price of bread.

                    <para>.- I noticed yesterday that the  Deputy  Leader of 'the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> chided honorable members on this side with their silence. The main reason for our silence has been our desire to expedite the passage of this bill, which has already been before us for three or four weeks. We realize that it still has to go to the Senate, and that provision has to be made in the State legislatures for the scheme to be put into operation. I should not have risen at this stage had it not been for the remarks of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill).</inline> Here we have a gentleman, who was at one time the king-pin of the Nationalist organization, making extraordinary statements. While the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> was speaking, I interjected that it was time that the farmer had an innings; and he retorted that Bradman's innings was as nothing compared with what the farmers would get out of this bill. When such statements are made by members of the Nationalist party, one cannot wonder at the fact' that the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has at last awakened to the necessity for drawing a clear line of demarcation between the two parties. It is a mis-statement of the facts to draw a comparison with Bradman's innings. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> argued that it is time that the farmer shared in what is going, and added, "If you are prepared to come down to the hard economic position "- - meaning that we should do away with the tariff as well as bounties on the production of sugar and other commodities - " I am prepared to vote against this bill." The reply of the honorable member for Warringah to that suggestion was that if anything was proposed along those lines, a start should be made with the wheat-growers of this country. In the light of these facts, the action of the Leader of the Country party is perfectly understandable. He realizes that the primary producers cannot look for protection to the party that watches the interests of the bag merchants, the wheat merchants, and the superphosphate combine. The honorable member for Warringah has attempted to blame the men who are engaged in the bread-making industry for the fact that the price of bread has not fluctuated in accordance with the fluctuations in the price of wheat. Is he aware that in practically every State in Australia, certainly in New </para>

                        <para>- I would not expect the honorable member to admit the correctness of my statement, because he belongs to a party that looks after the interests of the flour-millers and wheat merchants, and it is his duty not to show them up. I am a member of a co-operative society at Port Adelaide. Repeatedly, when the  chairman  of the board of directors of that society has been criticized in regard to the price being charged for bread, he has stated that if the price were reduced they would have difficulty in obtaining flour from the millers. In one half year I received a dividend of 4s. 6d. in the £ from that society. That dividend was distributed out of profits made from the sale of bread, and it indicates what has been going on among bakers and millers. It is not correct to say that this proposal of the Government will have the effect of withholding from both farmers and consumers a benefit that they should obtain. The Minister in his second-reading speech told the House that some millers welcome the bill because it will make for more orderly, systematic and stabilized conditions throughout the industry. They are the best type of millers. The reason that, so far, I have remained quiet during the consideration of this measure is, not that my mouth has been closed by caucus, but because I wish to see the bill go through, so that the farmers may be assisted. </para>

                <para>Mr.PATERSON (Gippsland) [4.36].- One point that should have been raised in this debate has not been touched upon. The statement was made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> and repeated in a different form by the honorable member for Warringah (Mr.Parkhill), that if these powers are given to the wheat board it may charge as much as 7s. 6d. a bushel for wheat for local consumption. The honorable member for Warringah said that the price for local consumption might be 3s. a bushel above the ordinary price. It is absolutely impossible for a wheat board, or any other organization in Australia, to fix a price so much above world's price, on account of the existing tariff, which is 1s. 6d. per cental or11d. a bushel. The highest price that any organization, possessing all the powers that this Parliament can confer, could fix is world's price plus the existing tariff. If the wheat-grower, the butter producer, or any other individual, unreasonably exploits the consumer, this Parliament has it in its power to remove the tariff protection, which alone enables an artificial price to be obtained. </para>

                    <para>- It can do so, however, and I want to show how absurd is the contention that it will be possible for any organization to make the Australian community pay a price so much above world's price. It is an economic impossibility to do so. When I first read the amendment of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition I thought that the honorable gentleman was giving full play to his sense of humour; but, after the honorable gentleman had been speaking for some little while, I realized that he was as serious as he usually is. The honorable gentleman pleaded for frankness, and asked the Minister to state candidly what are the intentions of the Government. He should have sought to ascertain -the intentions of the board in regard to the local price. The honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> was exceedingly frank in expressing his opinion as to what price should be charged. That honorable member is in the inner councils of those who have been connected with  wheat pooling ever since the war. He said that there are three bases which can be adopted. The first, export parity price, he considers is too low. The second, import parity price, he admits is too high, although it is the price upon which practically the whole of the secondary industries of this country base their prices. In his opinion, the wheat-farmer should receive world's price ; not the price ruling on the wharf after all deductions have been made to cover the cost of transportation to the world's markets; but the actual value of the wheat in the great markets of the world. He expressed the view that that would be a fair thing, and that it would- amount on the average to about1s. a bushel more than export parity rate. </para>

The honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> suggested that the farmer should receive world's price without freight deductions only for that portion which was sold in Australia. As one who represents primary producers, although not very many wheat-growers, I say that it would be quite unthinkable and unpardonable for a section of primary producers to raise the price of what they sell in Australia to a level that would always enable them to cover all deficiencies on export. At best the primary producers can only demand, and all they demand is a fair Australian price for that portion of their produce which they sell within Australia. I do not believe that either the wheatgrowers or any other section of primary producers desire or suggest that they shall have more than that. </para>

Notwithstanding the arguments that they have used, the honorable member for Warringah and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition have said that they believe in giving a fair price to the wheat-farmers of Australia.. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition went so far as to describe this measure as punitive class legislation. Any man who will attempt to so amend the bill as to condemn the wheat-grower to accept export parity rates, not world's rates, is guilty of punitive class legislation. The primary producers of this country have to pay an Australian price for everything they use on their farms and in their homes. </para>

                        <para>- There has been a definite promise for one year. Therefore, while the guarantee might lift the wheat-farmer above world's parity, if it be exceedingly low, for one year, there is no assurance that it would do so in future years. If this amendment is carried, the millers must obtain wheat for milling into flour, for local consumption as well as for export, at a figure considerably lower than world's rates, owing to the deduction of the cost of transport. In other words, the Australian consumer, protected as he is by arbitration court awards and so forth, would get as a discount off world's prices the benefit of the cost of transportation from this country overseas, in respect of goods that  were not so transported. Such an amendment is unreasonable, in view of the fact that we are all living under artificial economic conditions. It is impossible for any section of the community to carry on permanently outside of those artificial conditions. It is unreasonable to expect that one section of the community shall pay Australian prices for everything they use, and sell all they produce at something less than world's prices. </para>

If the wheat-farmer, through this pool, sells wheat to the Australian consumer not at export parity, but at London rates, he is doing something for the community which no secondary industry has been able to do. If all the industries in Australia were to adopt the reasonable price level suggested by the honorable member for Echuca for the guidance of the Wheat Board, and sell their products at the rates ruling in Great Britain, there would be an immediate and very substantial reduction in the cost of living. </para>

                    <para>.- I propose to move an amendment which I trust the Minister will accept. If he does not, I shall absolutely lose confidence in him, and his pretensions regarding the bill. If he accepts it I shall be satisfied that the bill will be of great assistance to the country generally, and will stimulate the wheat-growing industry, while, at the same time, establishing Australian finances on a sound basis. Under my proposal all the taxpayers would bear any loss suffered by the pool. I trust that the Minister will take a broad national view of the matter, and agree to a proposal which I am sure would induce all the States of the Commonwealth to join the pool. Therefore, I move - </para>

                    <para>That the following words be added to clause 15 of the proposed new schedule: - " The sum by which the amount realized net on wheat for use or consumption within the States exceeds the value of such wheat at net export parity shall be put into the equalization fund and accounted for to the respective States in ratio to the quantities, of wheat produced and delivered for sale in such States respectively."  1 understood from the remarks of the Minister that it was intended that States which are large exporters of wheat and small consumers should get the benefit of higher prices in the Australian market. That, however, does not appear to be made plain in the agreement. Clause 15 is the only one which touches the matter at all, and the only relevant words in that clause are that an equalization will be effected. The words themselves do not convey any definite assurance how an equalization scheme will be put into effect, nor is it quite clear just what equalization means. I can see a likelihood of trouble when it comes to the distribution of the pooled funds. It may be difficult to get the several States to agree upon any basis of equalization. It would be better, I think, to make the position quite clear in the agreement itself. </para>

                    <para>. - If the honorable member looks closely at the wording of clause 15 he will see that it provides for everything which he seeks to achieve by means of his amendment. The clause gives almost unlimited power to effect any measure of equalization justified by circumstances. In my second-reading speech I informed honorable members that when the bill was in committee I would explain some of the details of the equalization scheme. I cannot explain . the matter better than by quoting a definite example. Supposing the price for home consumption is ls. a bushel higher than the export price. If New South Wales has a local consumption of 13,000,000 bushels, Victoria one of 10,000,000 bushels, South. Australia one of 4,000,000 bushels, and Western Australia one of ' 3,000,000 bushels, there will be available a sum equal to 30,000,000 shillings in excess of what would have been realized had the wheat been exported. This sum will be allocated among the States which are parties to the agreement in proportion to the amount of wheat they have put into the pool. Thus, if the total wheat crop were <inline font-style="italic">200,000,000</inline> bushels, and Western Australia produced 40,000,000, she would be entitled to one-fifth of the surplus fund. Prior to such allocation, however, adjustments may have to be made so that any State enjoying an existing advantage would be allowed to retain such advantage. For instance, New South Wales may be able to substantiate a claim that ordinarily the price of wheat in that State for home consumption is 3d. per bushel higher than export parity. If that should be so, she would be entitled to retain 3d. a bushel on her 13,000,000 bushels, and if there were no other claims, 9d. per bushel of the ls. would go into the equalization fund. Victoria might be able to claim that her home consumption price is 4d. per bushel above export parity, in which case, if she had no right to make any other deductions, she would pay 8d. per bushel on her 10,000,000 bushels into the equalization fund. In the case of Western Australia there would no doubt be a claim based on geographical considerations. It is said that Western Australia enjoys a freight advantage over the eastern States of about 3/4 d. a bushel. If Western Australia could satisfy the board on that point she would be entitled to deduct that amount, in addition to any other advantages which may be due to her, from the equalization fund. </para>

                        <para>- We are not considering that point at the moment. It has been said that the States with the smaller populations, such as South Australia and Western Australia, might be at a disadvantage as against the States with a large population, because their local consumption would be proportionately small and they would have to export the greater part of their production. In the case of Western Australia, I understand that the local consumption is only about 3,000,000. bushels, whereas in New South Wales it is about 13,000,000 bushels. The States with the smaller populations would be at a disadvantage because they could not make up any ground on wheat for home consumption.. This point was given a great deal of consideration by the conference and it was agreed that it should be a factor in determining what amount a State should pay into the equalization fund. The delegates from New South Wales, and also from the other States with a large home consumption, considered that this was only fair so long as their States were not placed in a disadvantageous position. The object of this clause is to counteract any possible disadvantages of the kind that I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sure that honorable members have listened with interest to the explanation of the Minister of the objects of this clause. But the explanation depends almost entirely upon the meaning of the word " equalization " which appears to be a charmed word. I doubt whether any single word could mean as much as the Minister intended it to mean. </para>

                        <para>- I had thought of using that word but did not wish to hurt any one's feelings. This " equalization " will involve some intricate accounting which could be conducted on some other basis than that suggested by the Minister. I suggest that it would be safer to set out in the clause exactly what " equalization " means, and also the precise process to be adopted to bring about the particular kind of equalization which he has in mind. The proviso now limits the advantages to three classes, whereas in the original agreement the advantages to which the States were to be entitled were referred to in the general phrase " any geographical or other advantage enjoyed by a State." That left it open for a State to argue that there were other than geographical advantages. The headings <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> which appear in the clause in its extended form, were not part of the original clause. I do not know whether any States enjoy other advantages than the three mentioned, but it is important that honorable members should understand that if they do no consideration can be given to them if we agree to the new clause. There is one other point I desire to mention. Apparently the equalization account is to be made by the Australian Wheat Board, and it may be that on a true interpretation of the clause the accounts so made would be final as between the parties, and that they  would have no right of appeal, no right of criticism, and no means of relief if they were dissatisfied with the accounts. But the proviso provides -  that prior  to the effecting of such equalization  any advantage arising . . . shall be taken into consideration  and  accounted  for to  the State Wheat Board concerned. </para>

                <para class="block">So this particular matter is not left to the discretion of the Australian Wheat Board after all. Any State will have, as I presume it is intended to have, the right of litigation if the Australian Wheat Board is not prepared to allow it as much in respect of its advantages as it considers itself to be entitled to, or it may have the right to go to law if it considers that the value of the advantages allowed to another State are higher than they should be. If, on the other hand, it is intended that the Australian Wheat Board shall be the final judge, I suggest that some consideration should be given to the desirability of allowing such a body to adjudicate finally on a question which involves such huge sums of money, and so profoundly affects the interests of the farmers. </para>

                    <para>.- When I first read this bill I thought it was intended that we should have an Australian pool; that the Government desired to provide by legislation that all the Australian wheat should be brought under one control, and that there should be an equal distribution of the proceeds to the various States. Likewise, when I read that there was to be an equalization fund I naturally assumed that it would be true to its name and that after all the expenses of the scheme had been met the States would get the same amount per bushel for the wheat which they entrusted to the pool. Now I am not surprised that Queensland should give such wonderful support to this scheme, for it appears that as the price of wheat for home consumption in that State has been 6d. per bushel higher than export parity Queensland will still get that advantage in respect to all the wheat which she puts into the pool. </para>

                        <para>- It is between 3d. and 4d. The figures that I have before me give the minimum as 3d. Victoria must receive that extra price for the three years, and as long as the pool lasts. What is South Australia to get? I see no record of that State having received any extra price. For the whole period of the pool, three States are to receive the advantage of the extra prices that they have enjoyed in their local markets; but South Australia and Western Australia will not benefit in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- If it saw fit to sell its wheat locally at London parity, and the other States obtained an increased price, it does not follow it should get  no  advantage in the future. If we could escape from this system of compulsion, I should like to see the time when the farmers could charge the local consumers the prices that they would have to pay if they imported their wheat from other countries. So many charges are imposed upon the producers for everything they buy that they are specially penalized. This Parliament should endeavour to see that equal justice is done to all sections. If there are to be advantages, they should go to the men who are producing the basic wealth of this country, but, by our legislation in the past, we have built up conditions that invariably favour the people in the cities. I hope that a proper equalization scheme will be devised, because, with the consent of the Commonwealth and the States, this pool could be continued beyond the three-year period, and this special concession to Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland continued for all time. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the word, " equalization " should be defined. Further difficulty will arise through this attempt to make allowances for advantages that have been enjoyed by certain States in the past. It seems to me that Western Australia will be at a disadvantage. A more simple arrangement would be to apply the scheme equally to all States. If Western Australia enters the pool it will save a lot of the pin-pricks that are likely to be experienced. Western Australia, with her geographical advantages in the matter of freight, may be able to show that she is getting several pence per bushel more than the other States on local sales. </para>

                        <para>- It would be better for all concerned if the honorable member would cease interjecting, and allow the committee to deal with this important matter in a serious way. I do not know whether the Minister has anticipated the difficulty that must arise from the equalization proposal. It should apply equally to all the States which join the pool. Has the Minister considered whether the carry-over of last year's wheat will not nullify the equalization arrangement for the first year? I have heard no explanation as to how that difficulty is to be overcome. Benefit cannot be derived from local sales unless the carry-over is acquired by the States. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                    <para>.- -The explanation given by the Minister would be entirely satisfactory if his definition of " equalization " could be read into the measure; but the act will be read quite apart from the debates in this chamber. </para>

                <para class="block">We shall have the bare words of the statute, and a court would not be permitted to consider statements that may have been made by Ministers, or other members, during the debate on the bill. There is every risk of a dispute arising as to what " equalization " means. The States will sell wheat at varying prices, and it will be asked whether the prices realized in the foreign market will be taken into consideration in connexion with the equalization. The word, in itself, conveys varying meanings to a dozen different minds. Since the proposal affects a fund that may amount to £1,600,000, or more, it is particularly important to States that produce a great deal of wheat and consume comparatively little. If a dispute arises the people of Western Australia will be at a decided disadvantage, if they are not entitled to the benefits which the other States will share. I am sure that the Minister is sympathetic to the idea. It would be more satisfactory to every one, and a greater inducement to the States to join the pool, if the matter were made perfectly clear. I hope that the Minister will make it clear beyond all doubt that the smaller States will be given the benefit of the equalization scheme. </para>

                    <para>. -  I take it that there is a fear in the minds of the people of Western Australia that what is proposed to be done in connexion with the equalization scheme might not be done, and for that reason the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> wants a definite assurance that Western Australia will get out of the equalization fund the amount which I suggested. I have an amendment which should meet the position. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that the Minister has done something to define the vague word " equalization ". At the same time, I feel that the introduction of the amendment at this stage, and the reading of it by the Minister from a document which he alone has, must leave in the minds of honorable members generally a rather vague idea as to its effect. So far as I could follow it, however, the amendment seems to meet fairly the criticism which I directed against the use of a vague word in an important clause. I have had no opportunity of reading the amendment, and I think that a good many members are taking it on trust in the dark. I rise only to suggest that it would be desirable for honorable members to scrutinize it carefully in order that any ambiguity or uncertainty may be removed in another place. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that the debate on this measure, following the speech of the Treasurer, in moving its second reading, was interrupted by a prolonged discussion, in committee, on the Wheat Marketing Bill, which has just been disposed of. The honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> in a comprehensive criticism of the proposal, raised a considerable number of objections to it. It was obvious that he was speaking from a brief which he did not fully accept or understand. Those who know how briefs are prepared, could see that whoever instructed the Leader of the Opposition, furnished him with evidence, which was not supported by the facts and opinions of authorities which, upon examination, proved to be obsolete, over-ruled, and of no practical value in the discussion of this measure. The honorable gentleman based his criticisms largely upon a report issued in 1926 with regard to a proposal to establish a central reserve bank for the Irish Free State. He appeared to forget altogether - and this seems to be vital in the consideration of a measure like this- that Dublin, the capital of the Irish Free State, is within 70 miles of London, where a Central Reserve Bank has been established since 1844. How can the position be compared with a country 12,000 miles from London. </para>

                            <para>- It should be remembered also that Ireland is served by a number of well-established banking institutions, including the Bank of Ireland, the Royal Bank, and the Northern Bank, which have their head offices or affiliations in London. Unlike Australia, the Irish Free State has not an independent banking system. This shows that the report upon which the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> relied so much, has been proved to be obsolete as an authority on banking systems. Since it <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> issued there have been two other pronouncements upon central banking which are up-to-date, and deserving of far greater attention than has been given to them. In 1927 the act constituting the South Africa Reserve Bank was thoroughly overhauled by a committee of experts, and as a result of their report, valuable amendments were made to it. Much water has also  flown  past the mill since the publication of the report on the proposed central reserve bank for the Irish Free State in 1926. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey, Comptroller of the Bank of England, in 1927 paid a visit to Australia at the invitation of the Commonwealth Bank Board, to report upon central banking operations in this country.  His  report is of the greatest value to honorable members in debating, this measure. I have a copy, and I propose quoting at some length from it later. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>The Leader of the Opposition took the view that provisions in this bill will render the proposed central reserve bank liable to political control. The majority of the directors, he said, would be under the control1 of the Government. The honorable gentleman has forgotten, apparently, .that until the change in the management of the Commonwealth Bank was made following the amendment of the act in 1924, the same charge might have been levelled at that, institution. It was not till 1925 that the directorate of the bank included persons actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance and industry. Previously it was under the control of one Government appointee. </para><para>It may not be generally known that the strongest central bank outside the Central Reserve Bank of the United ' States of America in proportion to its area of influence and the population which it serves, is the Bank of Sweden. In recent years Sweden has become so prosperous that it has a premium in exchange on London and New York, and instead of placing an embargo on the export of gold, has taken steps to prohibit the importation of the precious metal, because of the effect of a surplus of gold on price levels. I take the following extract relating to the constitution of the' Swedish  Riksbank  from "Willis and  Beckhart's <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Banking Systems: -</inline> The  Riksbank  is not administered by the executive Government, but is placed under the direct supervision of the Parliament. The  Riksbank  is governed by seven delegates. One of these, the  chairman,  is nominated by the King for a period of three years, and the remaining six are elected by the Parliament, also for a period of three years. Two of the last mentioned members resign each year, but they may be- re-elected. The seven delegates select one of themselves to act as first  president  and two as second presidents, and these three assume principal charge over the work of the bank and its administration. </para><para class="block">Nobody who has knowledge of central banking will deny that the dollar exchange rate of the Swedish bank on the Bank of New York is better than the rate for the Bank of England or the central banks of any European country. We may take it, therefore, that the appointment by the executive government of the directorate of a central bank does not necessarily imply that the institution itself will be adversely affected by political control. </para><para>I turn now to the position in South Africa. The Reserve Bank of the Union of South Africa is accepted as a standard of what a central reserve bank should be. It was established in 1923, and its charter was amended in 1927. The proposal, which was endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition, that the representatives of trading banks should be appointed to the board of the proposed central reserve bank, was adopted in South Africa in 1923 ; but in operation it was found to be inconvenient if not dangerous. Consequently the act was amended in 1927 and the provision for the appointment to the directorate of representatives of the trading banks was deleted. The reasons for this course are stated in Willis and  Beckhart's  authoritative work at page 990, in the following terms: - </para><para>The bank is a corporate body with head office at Pretoria. The bank management consists of a board of eleven directors, of whom originally three experienced in banking and finance were nominated by the stock-holding banks and appointed by the Governor-General, and were known as the banking representatives ; three (described as the commercial and industrial representatives) who at the time of their election had to be actively engaged, one in commerce, one in agriculture and one in some other industrial pursuit, were elected by stock holders other than banks; and three (described as the Government representatives) appointed by the Governor-General, who also appointed the remaining two, the governor and the deputy-governor. By the Amendment Act of 1923 the banking representation was abolished on June 30, 1923, and six directors (the commercial and industrial representatives) who must be or have been actively engaged, three in commerce or finance, one in agriculture and two in other industrial pursuits, are now elected by the stock-holders. The remaining five are appointed by the Governor-General as before. The reason for this change was that the board found it difficult to discuss certain aspects of banking policy before representatives of the banks. </para><para class="block">I have already shown that the whole of the capital of the Bank of Sweden is provided by the State. It is an answer to one of the claims put forward by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> on behalf of the trading banks and chambers of commerce whose resolutions he read to the House, that they should provide part of the capital of the central reserve bank and have representatives upon the bank's directorate. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The capital of the South African bank was originally contributed in part by the trading banks, and three of the directors of the central bank represented the trading banks; but the experience was, to use the words of the authors I have just quoted, that "the board found it difficult to discuss certain aspects of banking policy before the representatives of the banks." As a consequence the Union Government not only took over the capital subscribed by the trading banks, but also replaced the three representatives of those banks on the directorate with government nominees. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Although £13,000,000 may have been deposited in the Commonwealth Bank by the trading banks, it does not mean that that amount has not been drawn against for credits in London ; nor does it mean that £13,000,000 is not in excess of requirements for exchange purposes. But the point I am seeking to establish is that the money has been deposited in the Commonwealth Bank because the trading banks knew that it could be compulsorily acquired, and, having it there, they are making use of it, as they are entitled to do, for exchange purposes. </para>

                            <para>- The central banking movement is of comparatively recent growth. The Banking and Currency Act of 1844 gave to the Bank of England the powers of a central reserve bank, with control of the note issue, subject to certain exceptions. Later, the rights of the  private banks were bought up and the Bank of England is now  the only  authority in the United Kingdom that can issue notes. The financial power of the Bank of England, together with the commercial and shipping resources of the. United Kingdom, has enabled Great Britain to avoid the crises that have occurred in other countries. The Baring bank crash, which completely upset the finances of the United States of America, was successfully weathered in England. Although  the  United  States of America  has much greater financial resources  than  has the United Kingdom, it realized the necessity to adopt a similar system of central banking. A law introduced by Alexander Hamilton prevents .the establishment of a branch system such as exists in Australia and Canada, but by arrangement between the banks that legislation through the operations of chain banks has been overcome to some extent by subterfuge. Owing to frequently recurring crises, .the Federal Reserve Bank was established in 1914. It operates from seven centres, representatives of which, meeting in "Washington, form, with the Treasury of the United States, the central board of control. The organization is similar to the marketing system adopted in Australia where boards operate in each State and delegates from the State boards constitute the federal board. Although financial crises have occurred in America since the Reserve Bank was established, they have not been of sufficient magnitude to upset seriously the finances of the country, and the recent bull and bear speculations on the New York stock exchange, which might otherwise have been disastrous to the country, were successfully negotiated. During the great war, the Federal Reserve Bank was able to buy up American bonds and securities that were held abroad, and through the advantages which have accrued from its operations the United States of America enjoys a degree of financial stability and order that were unknown in its previous history. The outbreak of war in 1914 led to the complete collapse of European banking systems. Germany, Austria, France, and other countries resorted to a system of inflation which produced a chaotic state of affairs. In 1922, following meetings of the International Economic Commission, central banks were established in Austria-Hungary and Germany as part of the Dawes Plan, and- a. new credit system was adopted. In 1921, the South African Reserve Bank was established; in 1923, it was amended, and in 1927 further  amended, and is now operating very successfully. </para>

                    </continue><para>A remarkable change has occurred in the attitude of the private trading banks to the proposal for the establishment of a central reserve bank. A few years ago the associated banks found that the Commonwealth Bank was interfering seriously with their profits. In answer to a question asked by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lewis)</inline> in this House a few weeks ago, the Treasurer stated that the profits of the Commonwealth Bank since its inception totalled £18,125,000. One can imagine with what alarm the private banks, whose object is to make profits for their shareholders, viewed this intrusion upon their preserves. Their jealousy of the Commonwealth Bank found expression in consistent antagonism, usually passive but sometimes active ; and particularly since the war the animosity of the trading banks toward the Commonwealth Bank has been displayed in many directions. Knowing the value of the central banks created in other parts of the world under the Dawes plan, the success of the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States of America, and the effectiveness of the Bank of England as a great financial reserve power, the private banks have clamoured for the establishment of a central reserve bank in Australia. But they hoped by the creation of such an institution to terminate the competition of the Commonwealth Bank in ordinary trading and to enjoy the advantages of " a bank of banks " which would finance them, increase their resources, allow them to use Commonwealth notes for their own purposes, and so enable them to increase their profits. </para><para>The National Bank of Australasia publishes monthly a valuable statement dealing with the financial position of the Commonwealth, and a few years ago that publication consistently urged the establishment of a central reserve bank by which credit would be expanded, the gold reserve would be increased, and exchange abroad would be organized. The  financial writers in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and other conservative journals also then advocated that policy, but always subject to the condition that the Commonwealth Bank should discontinue ordinary trading operations. In order to support that advocacy the Commonwealth Bank brought to Australia in 1927 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey, Comptroller of the Bank of England, to report upon the establishment of a central reserve bank. I have tried in vain to get a copy of his report. After it was presented questions were asked repeatedly in Parliament as to when it would be made available. The answers of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> and the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> who was then Treasurer, were to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey had come to Australia by arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank to conduct a confidential inquiry, and that his report was not intended for Parliament. The report remained a secret, and at no time were honorable members able to get any information about it. But I have been fortunate in discovering the report of an address he" delivered before the Economic Society of Melbourne on the 8th April, 1927. My friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> C. Dyason, a leading Victorian financier, presided. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey was not able to give the society in detail the contents of his report to the Commonwealth Bank, he clearly indicated the nature of it, and his address is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Insurance and Banking Record</inline> of the 21st May, 1927. My time does not permit me to read the whole of his address, but the headings show how consistently the bill now before the House follows his advice. </para><para>I have already referred to the advocacy of a central reserve bank by the National Bank of Australasia.

It is  significant  that the banks of Australia are united in desiring that under existing financial conditions there shall be no disturbance of the constitution and status of the present Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                        Grice does not now want a central reserve bank, in addition to a Commonwealth Bank competing with the trading banks in ordinary business. He knows that if the Commonwealth Bank is relieved of its reserve functions as the Government proposes, it will enter into keener competition with the private banks. They would prefer a continuance of the present hybrid institution, partly engaged in reserve work, but without final authority as a central reserve bank, and with 72 branches engaged in ordinary trade, rather than that a separate reserve bank should be established which would leave the Commonwealth Bank free to compete for ordinary business. Yet the demand for the Commonwealth Bank to engage in ordinary trading has 'been heard on all sides.

                        <para>Before reviewing these principles, however, let us for a moment consider the advantages claimed foi- a system based on the centralization in one institution of the banking and currency reserves of the country. What is the alternative? It is the decentralization of reserves or the holding by each bank in the country of its own reserves. When, under this latter system, decentralization, the need arises for a bank to strengthen its reserves, it can only do so by calling in its loans and overdrafts or by disposing of other assets, and unless the general volume of credit is to be curtailed, the loans or overdrafts called in or the assets disposed of must be taken over by another bank. </para>

                    </quote><para>It is not improbable, however, that the very circumstances which have given rise to the need for a strengthening of reserves in the one case are common to all banks, and that the need of one is in greater or lesser degree the need of all. Yet the strengthening of one bank's reserves can only be accomplished at the expense of those of another bank, and unless reserves happen to be very unevenly distributed between the banks, contraction by one bank may compel other banks to take similar action for their own protection. It must not be forgotten that the need for strengthening reserves may arise from causes quite outside the control of the banks. It may be due to such occurrences as droughts, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other climatic or natural phenomena not necessarily in the country in which the banks are operating. </para><para class="block">Recently  it  was  the Hatry  case in London, and the bulling  and  bearing on the New York stock exchange  that  caused financial  tension. Continuing, the extract  reads - </para><quote>
                        <para class="block">But it may be in lands thousands of miles away overseas, with which the country happens  to  have large and important trading interests. In circumstances such as these, attempted action by one bank may precipitate similar action by the rest, in which case even the most liquid assets become unrealizable, confidence may be shaken, credit become unobtainable at any cost, and a crisis which could under an alternative system have been avoided, may result, even bills of exchange, which should provide the most liquid form of assets, cannot be turned into cash where the rediscount facilities afforded by a central bank do not exist. To sum up the position, with decentralized reserves actual cash is the only asset which can be relied upon as an effective reserve in time of general crisis, and the amount of cash, unemployed and unremunerative, which must be held is considerably greater than would be necessary if the banks could hold other short assets such as bills of exchange with the certain knowledge that in' case of need they could immediately be turned into cash through the medium of a central bank. On the' other hand, where there exists a properly conducted central bank a trading bank can, in such circumstances as I have described, turn to it for assistance and obtain the support which it requires without detriment to the position of any other bank The central bank, if its business has been conducted in conformity with the principles of true central banking, will probably not itself be involved in the causes which have rendered it necessary for other banks to turn to it for assistance, and it will be in a position to bring the whole weight of its resources to. bear in any direction in which help is necessary. </para>

                            <para>- Whether it is the policy of the Labour party or not, it is the country's policy. We may not be a good party in the opinion of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> but the country has declared that we are the best party. That is indicated by the composition of this House. If the honorable member is prepared to accept the principle of democratic government, he must accept the decision of the people last October. By that decision the policy of the Labour party is Australia's policy. We must remember that our country and the whole of the world is at present  in bond to the monied powers. A sum of 21 billion pounds were raised for war purposes. That is a permanent mortgage upon the industry, commerce, and shipping of the world, and it has to be paid off. Even if we create a sinking fund and pay off all our debts, a similar debt will' exist somewhere else. These debts cannot be eradicated. . Perhaps some four or five billion pounds of that stupendous sum represents the savings of the people in savings banks, life insurances, and so forth, but the remainder is an absolute charge for all time on the industry of the world. The peoples of the world think that they are independent, but finance controls and crushes them. It is necessary to face this permanent incubus, and the best way to do so is by organizing our resources and credit in the form of a central bank. </para>

                            <para>- Both I and the Government do. Consequently the Government has separated completely the trading banks from the central reserve bank section. I point out that the Bank of England has nineteen branches trading all over Great Britain, and that the Central Reserve Bank of South Africa has many branches which are trading separately. Also, the Bank of Sweden, which is the most successful central reserve bank in the world, has seven trading branches. We are adopting the strict attitude that the central reserve bank shall not ordinarily compete with the trading banks for general banking business. What is the alternative? Does any honorable member opposite suggest that the Commonwealth Bank should be absolutely disbanded? When the central reserve bank has been established, what is to happen to the Commonwealth Bank, with its 71 branches? Are we to hand over to the private banking institutions the goodwill and organization that have been built up over. a period of years, and that have enabled the Commonwealth Bank to make substantial profits? Honorable members opposite must either accept this proposal to have a central reserve bank, of which the Commonwealth Bank will be a constituent part, or propose that the Commonwealth Bank, which has rendered wonderful service to Australia, and has made profits aggregating over £18,000,000, shall be thrown on the scrap heap. No one should be more grateful to the Commonwealth Bank than the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> During his regime' as Treasurer he was able to show, in more than one budget, that a large portion of the national debt had been wiped off out of its profits. Thus the trading banks, by the consequential reduction of their taxation, in common with the community as a whole, were- relieved from additional taxation. </para>

                            <para>- There is a provision for two months' bills. The majority of central reserve banks issue bills at 90 days. Unfortunately, we have not a bill market in Australia. But neither has New York. That is one of the reasons why it cannot establish itself as a foreign place  of exchange, and why London still remains the financial centre of the world. The bills of the world are drawn on London ; they still pass through that recognized channel. It is quite correct, as the Leader of the Opposition said, that we have not a bill discount market, and we cannot make one, because we have not the foreign trade that other countries have. Any one who reads the <inline font-style="italic">Insurance and Banking Record</inline> will know that recently the Bank of France made a serious attempt to attack the position of the Bunk of England as the world's discounting centre by establishing a bill market; but it was unable to do so. The Leader of the Opposition merely tells us what we already know, and what has been deplored for years, when he says that Australia has not a market for the discounting of bills; but that cannot be used as an argument against the establishment of a central reserve bank. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline></para>

The South African Reserve Bank is a State institution. The Reserve Bank of the United States of America is under the direct control of the American Treasury, Although the Bank of England is a private corporation, there can be no doubt that, if it did not exist in its present form, no authority other than the State would undertake the control of national finance in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>. - There would be little objection to a central reserve bank if the Commonwealth Bank were to function exclusively as a reserve bank, and if its management and control were entirely divorced from politics. Unfortunately, the assurances of Ministers in this regard has been lame and unconvincing. The Commonwealth Bank building in Sydney will house under the one roof, a central bank in which the trading banks are required to make certain deposits, and to which they will have- to make available the most confidential information regarding their activities, and a Commonwealth trading bank which will be competing in every avenue of banking with the utmost keenness. The management of both the Central Reserve Bank and the trading branch will be controlled by a directorate and officers appointed by the political party in power, a practice which is contrary to the principles of sound banking as conducted in other countries of the world. In addition to these defects, it must be remembered that the scheme has emanated from a Labour Government, which, according to its own party platform, favours the nationalization of banking, and the extension of the functions of the Commonwealth Bank until control of banking is -entirely in the hands of the State-. Moreover, there is a large section of the Labour party, and even a percentage of the Federal Labour caucus, if not a majority of it, that favours the inflation of the note issue and other radical and unsafe banking methods. The widest difference of opinion exists as to what will really happen when the Central Reserve Bank is established. One section of the community seems to believe that when the system is in operation, money will ,be advanced to industrial organizations and enterprises without the inconvenient though usually insisted upon condition that there shall be adequate security. Others, again, think that loan money will be made available for all sorts of undertakings in unceasing quantity. Then -there are the manufacturers who have been favored with protection by embargoes and high duties to the extent of removing all competition and who now find that the public are not able to pay the high prices demanded. They are hoping that under the new regime it will be possible for members of the public to obtain without earning it, money to buy the goods they purvey. In view of all this, it is not surprising that thinking people arc asking that we shall proceed slowly with this alleged reform. </para>

                            <para>- Did the Treasurer mean by his statement that it was not the intention of the Government to carry out the Labour party's banking policy; that the new scheme would not serve the purpose which the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> will advocate presently - namely, the inflation of the note issue; that it will  not be used for the de-valuation of the pound, .as advocated by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> in a circular to members of this House; and  that the Government will not use the Central Bank to make available £20,000.000 for unemployment relief as advocated at a recent Labour conference? Probably the Treasurer meant to convey the impression that the Central Reserve Bank Bill is a measure designed merely to continue the banking business of this country on the same sound lines as those upon which it is being conducted now by the trading banks. An authoritative statement by the Treasurer or the Prime Minister on these points would greatly relieve the public mind. There is no doubt that there is a vast body of public opinion which views these proposals with the strongest misgivings, and which hesitates to place in the hands of the Government the power which it seeks in this bill. The Government should endeavour to dissipate that distrust both in the minds of the public and of honorable members of this side of the House - though I have no hesitation in saying that the Treasurer would have great difficulty in removing all suspicion from my mind. Nevertheless, it might be worth the Treasurer's while to give an assurance that the scheme has not been evolved in the interests of any one section of the community, that it will not be used to further wild plans for note inflation, or for the devaluation of the £. Above all, the public must be assured that their savings will be in no wise endangered. In the course of his second-reading speech, the Treasurer said - </para>

                        <para>Ever since the war, the Commonwealth has been living beyond its means, overspending and over-borrowing. An artificial standard of living, based upon borrowed money, and sheltered behind an ever-rising wall of tariffs, resulted in high costs of production and handicapped the export trade, which had not only to iwy for a large volume of imports, but also to provide interest on a huge and increasing debt abroad. So high have the costs of production soared that the export trade in many primary products could only be maintained by artificial schemes, under which Australians paid high prices for what they consumed in order that the balance could be sold abroad at prices sufficiently low to command a market. A succession of good seasons with good prices for Australia's staples, wool and wheat, helped to disguise the essential unsoundness of the system; but, even so, it was only kept going, and could only be kept going, on borrowed money. </para>

It would further be the duty of a central bank to effect, as far as it could, suitable contraction and suitable expansion in addition to aiming generally at stability, and to maintain that stability within as well as without. When necessary it would be the ultimate source from which emergency credit might be obtained in the form of rediscounting of approved bills, or advances on approved short securities or government paper. </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Bank already functions as a reserve bank in that it is charged with the responsibility of maintaining the currency at due parity of gold by the control of the note issue and gold reserves ; and its functions could easily, and without very much criticism, be extended to include the holding of reserves and' the dealing with exchanges, bills, &amp;c. if it. confined its operations to those of a central reserve bank. I do not think that the trading banks can decline to lodge with the proposed reserve bank a proportion of their reserves. Whether the proportion proposed by the Treasurer is too high has to be considered; but he has already indicated that he is prepared to reduce them if it can be shown that the demands of bill money and other ordinary trading will not permit the lodging of the amounts which he has mentioned without causing inconvenience.I consider that the proposed percentages are too high for Australia, because the trading banks have established many branches for the convenience of the public in all parts of Australia, which they are required to maintain at considerable expense.

                    <para>To overcome this prejudice, it may be necessary to insist on a scheme for obligatory deposits by the commercial banks with the central bank, for if these deposits are withheld the central banking organization cannot achieve its full purpose . . . </para>
                    <para>If we had a central reserve bank in this country, it is obvious that the trading banks would have to lodge a percentage of their reserves with it. But, as [ have already pointed out, it would be anomalous to have operating in the same building in Sydney a central reserve bank with which the trading banks would have to place their reserves, and to which they would have to supply information, and the Commonwealth Bank, with which the private hanks would have to compete and which, with the help of its quasi government facilities, would endeavour to drive them out of business. The Treasurer admitted in his second-reading speech that the difficulty experienced in obtaining full and -confidential information from the trading banks was due to the fear that the Commonwealth Bank would use it in competition with them. He also admitted that such fear was not unnatural or unreasonable. I wish to know how the honorable gentleman proposes to get over that difficulty by permitting the Commonwealth Bank to continue its competition with the private banks, and at the same time setting up a central reserve bank with a directorate which may be political in character. I appreciate the fact that the Government moy desire to use the Commonwealth trading bank in order to lead the way to new developments of banking, which it is claimed that the conservative control of the commercial banks will not permit to be used-; or, to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey, " To ensure to the public the provision of adequate banking facilities on reasonable terms." But I do not think that there are any safe banking methods that can he adopted that the trading banks do not already employ, or are not. willing to employ; nor do I think that the public lack " adequate banking facilities on reasonable terms."' Increased competition by the Commonwealth trading bank will only lead to a reduction of the facilities which are now enjoyed in many country centres, and to an increase in the general cost of banking facilities to the public. </para>
                    <para>I can also well appreciate that the Government must be in constant communication and co-operation with the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank, but its action in seeking to adopt the hazardous course of controlling and operating a central reserve bank, and of carrying on a trading bank, may easily be interpreted as a desire and an effort to remove the competition of the existing commercial trading banks with the Commonwealth Bank, and to make banking entirely a Government monopoly. </para>
                    <para>The Treasurer has brought down an amendment to the Commonwealth Bank. Act so that honorable members may have a full view of the Government's banking intentions; but the contents of the bill are far from reassuring. I suggest <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> Treasurer that he should give earnest reconsideration to the proposed management and direction of the reserve bank if he wishes to gain the confidence and co-operation of the existing banks and the general public. </para>
                    <para>It has been argued in favour of the bill that the establishment of a central reserve bank will introduce an alteration in the banking system of Australia in relation to borrowing, in that it will involve the adoption of the American system of working on promissory notes and bills and enable borrowers to get money at a cheaper rate of interest. But while this may be so, it is also true that under that system the borrowers will have to pay for the money whether they use it or not. It is doubtful whether these new methods will be appreciated by the public unless they are introduced slowly, and are accompanied by a substantial reduction in stamp duty. Bills are not used to any extent to-day in Australian banking. </para>
                    <para>This bill may be much more effectively discussed in committee; but there is one other vital point to which I would refer. It is a fundamental principle of central reserve banking that the directorate should be entirely free from political control. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> endeavoured to show, by referring to the Swedish Bank - which is not a very considerable institution as banks go - and to the Yokohama Bank of Specie - which is an institution peculiar to Japan, and is hardly a suitable model upon which western people should build - that there was no danger in giving effect to the proposals in the bill. But on this point, I quote again from Kisch and Elkin's <inline font-style="italic">Central</inline><inline font-style="italic">Banks</inline> as follows : - </para>

                        <para>The theory underlying the conception of a State bank centres on the proposition that 3ince a wise central banking policy is the basis of a sound national economic life, the bank should be under the control of the national government. But the dangers of this course are great. Just because the decisions of the bank react on every aspect of the economic activities of the country, it is essential, that its direction should be as unbiased as is humanly practicable, and as continuous as possible. But clearly if the bank is under State control continuity of policy cannot be guaranteed with changing governments, nor can freedom from political bias in its administration be assured. In their report in support of the bill creating the Central Bank of Chile, the Commission of Financial Advisors, under the presidency of Professor K W.  Kemmerer,  pointed out that there was a widespread and pronounced fear lest the success of the bank should be wrecked by politics and undue governmental influences, a fear which the past banking history of many South American countries has shown to be fully justified. . . . </para>

This is the line generally adopted for those banks that combine a nominated and elected element on their governing boards. </para>

                    <para>The bill provides for the appointment of a Governor, two Deputy Governors, the Secretary to the Treasury, and five others, representing commercial banking, labour and other interests in Australia. These are all to be appointed by the Government. Therefore, in this respect, the bill is clearly in. conflict with the opinions that I have quoted, and contrary to all sound principles of reserve banking. This is government control in <inline font-style="italic">excelsis</inline> What need is there for two Deputy Governors? The reason given, by the Treasurer is most unconvincing. He 3aid that it was necessary that there should be two experts with special knowledge of two separate branches of banking. This, of course, is absurd. If we appoint a governor of a bank, we expect him to have a general and intimate knowledge of all aspects of banking, and any knowledge that he may lack can be supplied to <inline font-style="italic">him</inline> by the experts in the bank, who need not be made deputy governors. I hardly like to suggest that it looks as though the Government had two officials marked out for these positions, men who had already given it assistance in connexion with this matter. If that is so, it indicates, indubitably, government control. There is no need, in my opinion, for two deputy governors, and the board should be left to appoint its own deputy  chairman. </para>

The South African banking system is not analogous to that of Australia, and we cannot look to it for useful guidance. In my opinion, the best men should be appointed irrespective of sectional representation, which I contend has never been a success. In Great Britain, the private banking houses and financial institutions, whose operations have extended over years - almost centuries - provide the type of man required for bank directorates in greater profusion than is to be found here.

They are often described as merchant bankers, but it is important to remember that they are not bankers in the strict sense of the term - that is, they do not pay cash across the counter against cheques drawn on them - because it is from their ranks that the directors of the Bank of England are chiefly recruited ... </para>

Their reserves will not be kept in the vaults of (the bank in cold storage, but will be the funds on which the bank will operate, *nd, therefore, it is fair and reasonable that they should have some representation on the board. I commend this suggestion to the Government in order to break down the deep-rooted objection to a government-appointed board of partisans or political friends. </para>
                    <para>It is also proposed in this bill to appoint an executive from the Bank directorate. I am opposed to that for three reasons. The first is t&amp;at the executive would do all the work, the board meeting once a month merely to confirm what had been done by the executive. In the second place, if a member or members of the board expounded views in opposition to the official opinion an executive could be formed that would deprive them of active participation in the government of the bank by the simple process of leaving them off the executive, if it were considered inconvenient or inadvisable to have them as members. Thirdly, an executive of three officials, if the deputy governors and the Secretary to the Treasury were retained on the board, would make a purely official triumvirate that would bo government-controlled, and destructive of public confidence. For these reasons I contend that there should be no executive, but that there should be weekly, or even more frequent, meetings of the board of directors. There are a number of amendments which I consider essential, and I shall submit them when the bill is in committee. </para>

If it does, that is a further reason why the bill should be rejected, and shows that all the distrust and suspicion in the mind of the public to-day is absolutely warranted.

Indeed, the Government has no intention of interfering with them. The bill has been introduced because the Government believes that it will alter economic conditions. I hope that it will attain the results expected; but I do not think that it will. What is banking? It is toying with results of the labour of the workers. I know that a certain amount of bookkeeping is associated with banking;but bookkeeping is not banking. The headquarters of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales is a fine example of architecture. It is wealth <inline font-style="italic">in excelsis.</inline> One would almost expect to find the assistants in such a building with haloes round their heads. That magnificent building, which is the result of the toil and industry of the workers in the community, is only one instance of the many fine buildings which the various banks have erected in different parts of Australia. When I see such fine buildings and reflect on the use to which they are put, I am reminded of the way in which the temple at Jerusalem was desecrated by the money changers, whose tables Christ overturned when He exclaimed that "they had turned the house of God into a den of thieves. That is what is happening in our banking institutions to-day; and that is why this bill leaves me stone-cold. </para>

                    <para>This bill proposes to alter our system of banking by establishing a central reserve bank. When we have that bank, shall we be better off as a people? In the United States of America and other countries there are central reserve banks, but those countries have also their large armies of unemployed. Will the establishment of a central reserve bank in Australia so alter economical conditions that those now in want will find food ? Will it render unnecessary the housing of workless men in military tents during the winter months? If a central bank will relieve unemployment and alleviate suffering, let us have it; but I do not think that it will do so. The establishment of a central bank will do no more to remedy existing conditions than will the shifting of a piece on the chess board. I do not think that honorable members opposite are very fearful regarding this bill. The speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> showed no marked hostility to it. It may be as the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> said when commenting on that speech, that that honorable gentleman's brief had not been properly prepared. The speech of the Leader of the Opposition amounted to a blessing of the bill, provided that the Treasurer would alter the proportion of the trading banks' assets which must be deposited with the central bank from 10 and 5 per cent. to 7 and 3 per cent., respectively, of demand liabilities and time liabilities. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> expressed the real fear of the Opposition when he said that this bill would place banking under political control. Honorable members opposite fear that the business of banking will be interfered with so drastically that the depredations of bankers will be curtailed, and that the people will derive some benefit as the result of the proper control of the life blood of this country and the discontinuance of the present rake-off. This country is in a deplorable state, the remedy for which we are told is that we must work harder and produce more. More than once I have stated in this House that this country was never more wealthy and' had never produced more than, during the last ten years. But, in spite of that greater production, there is more unemployment and poverty to-day than has ever previously existed. </para>

                            <para>- The money changers and big business generally, which made fortunes by the high prices they charged when the nation was at war, do not want to let go the profits which they made then. That is why I want to expand the credit of this country. If the Commonwealth Bank has not been instituted to do the work of the Commonwealth, why was it instituted? The assets of the banks are the assets of Australia. Bankers are growing opulent as a. result of the energy expended by the workers of this country. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> mentioned eleven of the principal banks, although he did not enumerate them. Why did he pick out eleven and exclude the others? It could not have been that he was unable to find statistics concerning them, for they are all to be found in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Book.</inline> As the honorable gentleman did not give statistics for all the banks operating in Australia, I shall do so, but not in detail. In 1918-19 the paid-up capital of the banks trading in Australia was £35,696,904. At that time 23 banks were operating in Australia, exclusive of the Comptoir National and the Yokohama Specie Bank. Their half-yearly dividends amounted to £1,863,772, and their reserves to £23,543,496. In the short space of ten years those 23 banks have increased their paid-up capital to £69,153,442 - nearly double what it was in 1918-19. I leave it to honorable members to say the methods by which those results were obtained. Their half-yearly dividends increased during the same period to £4,795,224, and their reserves to £48,384,120. That is what the <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book</inline> shows. Evidently there is no better industry in the Commonwealth. Honorable members can work out for themselves the ratio of dividend to the paid-up capital. Needless to say they know how the profits are made. This is why Australia is in its present position. The Government has no intention of exerting political control over the bank as inferred by honorable members opposite. No Labour government has ever been " cranky " enough to do anything that would leave it open to that charge. </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth Bank Act, 1924, was assented to on 20th August, 1924, and was brought into operation on 10th October, 1924. This act was passed to broaden the scope of the Commonwealth Bank and to enable it to perform the functions for which it had been established. Five main amendments to the Bank Act 1911-20 are included, in accordance with which the following changes have* been made: - (1) A board of directors has been appointed to control not only the general business, but also that of the note issue. The board consists of the governor of the bank, the Secretary to the Treasury, and six others who are or have been actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance or industry. In addition to the above board there is a board of advice in London. (2) The bank has been strengthened by the capitalization of £4,000,000 of the accumulated profits, and the Treasurer is authorized to raise by loans sums aggregating £6,000,000 and to lend the proceeds to the Commonwealth Bank as additional capital. The Ministry does not propose to interfere with the authority already included in the Commonwealth Bank Act to issue debentures up to £10,000,000. (3) The board is to fix and publish its discount rate. (4) The associated banks settle their exchanges through the Commonwealth Bank. (5) The associated banks supply to the Treasurer each quarter a statement of average weekly liabilities and assets in accordance with the schedule prescribed. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">The Bruce-Page Government made the Commonwealth Bank a bankers' bank. Lt changed it from a people's bank; capitalized £4,000,000 of its profits; and authorized the Treasurer to borrow £6,000,000 and loan it to the bank. It permitted outside institutions to get a " rake-off." If the policy of the Bruce-Page Administration did not give evidence of political control of the bank, then. I do not understand the meaning of the printed word. I say unhesitatingly that any government would be entitled to use the bank to give effect to its policy in the interests of the people. That clearly was the intention when the bank was established. </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition paid particular attention to the possibility of an expansion of the note issue. Honorable members opposite are afraid that this proposal will mean inflation. I wish I were as confident as they are fearsome that there will be an expansion of credit under this proposal, but I know the Government has no such intention. Its purpose is to meet the banking situation as it is met in other countries in like circumstances. This policy does not meet with my approval. We are told that it is a " safe " policy. I should like to hear the views of the Leader of the Opposition concerning the efficacy of note issue expansion under judicious direction and. control. The honorable gentleman referred to the situation in France, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Poland, following a policy of note inflation. I know nothing about those countries. The banking authorities may have used the note issue in a manner detrimental to the best interests of the country, but can any honorable members say that the position of those countries is worse than that of Great Britain or Australia? Can they show that the manipulation of credit materially injured the economic position of those nations? No one can deny that Australia would have been in a much more parlous state than it is to-day if, during the war, the Government had not been in control of the note issue. It is, of course, impossible to say what might have happened had the Commonwealth Bank not been in existence. I can, however, say with confidence that if the proposal submitted by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> had been accepted by the Government the nation's credit would have been expanded by £10,000,000, and we should not have been called upon to-day to pay such a heavy interest bill on our indebtedness. I challenge any one to say, in the light of subsequent experience, that that policy would not have worked out to the benefit of the Commonwealth. </para><para>What happened to our note issue during the war period? When it was first proposed to issue Australian notes the precaution was taken that the Treasurer must hold in gold coin a reserve to an amount not less than  one-fourth  of the amount of Australian notes issued up to £7,000,000, and to an amount equal to the amount of notes issued in excess of £7,000,000. But during the War our note issue went up to £58,000,000. No one knew how it came about. I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook warning the Commonwealth that the danger-point was being approached in issuing notes to a value exceeding £13,000,000, nevertheless, the issue went up as high as £58,000,000. After the war, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> said that it must be contracted to £15,000,000, but that has not yet been done, and the country has suffered no ill effects. In a circular recently issued by myself, I pointed out that but for the political interference with the note issue in another five years from now the profits on the issue would have cancelled all debentures, or, in other words, the notes themselves with the exception of the currency of the moment. What industry in the country could show a like result? The note issue, conjointly with the Commonwealth Bank, helped to save Australia during the war. How can any one talk of being frightened at a possibility of inflation? </para><para>In this connexion, I have a quotation to make from a speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> on the 2nd November, 1911, as reported on page 2869, volume 62, of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> was speaking about the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, and like others, not being a banker, he quoted some one who was supposed to know something about banking.

                        <para>I was looking through some of the lessons of the financial crisis, in connexion with which the great name of Hamilton is referred to with very great respect. Perhaps I might read to honorable members what he said . . . on banking in general. Dealing with what issue really means, he showed that there is no difference between a note issue and deposits, bills of exchange and cheques, which constitute 97 or 98 per cent, of the currency of London, and,. I believe, a, still greater percentage of that of Australia, where banking is very highly developed and very sound. Hamilton said, in 1790 - </para>
                        <para>Every loan which a bank makes is in its first shape a credit given to the borrower in its books, the amount of which it stands ready to pay either in its own notes or in gold or silver at its option. But in a. great number of cases, no actual payment is made in either. The borrower frequently by use of a cheque or order transfers his credit to some other person to whom he has a payment to make. This man in his turn is as often content with a similar credit, because he is satisfied that he can, whenever he pleases, either convert it into cash or pass it to some other hands as an equivalent for it. In this manner the credit keeps circulating, performing in every state the office of money until it is extinguished by a discount with some other person who has a payment to make to the bank to an equal or greater amount. </para>

"When war broke out, the Bank of England, with all its reserves and power, could not carry on. It shut its doors and the British Government was obliged to issue notes for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the country. There was no gold behind the notes it issued ; the only backing they had was the confidence of the people in the need of the nation at the time.

The notes issued when Great Britain was struggling in a tremendous war, are still the currency of the country. But there is a more pleasing feature of the British note issue applied, as the Australian note issue has been, to meet the needs of currency. In my opinion, if our note issue were applied to meet government requirement it would  show a like result to that shown in England during the war.

To what extent those profits have continued since the war, I cannot say, but the paper currency continues. Prior to the war, only £5 notes were issued by the Bank of England, and they were legal tender to only a limited amount, but to-day the <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> and 10s. notes are legal tender to any amount.

                        <para>The honorable member who spoke on behalf of the Bank suggested that there was something irreligious, almost blasphemous in discussing the Bank of England, and that it was an institution above reproach and above discussion. But it is only an ordinary business like any other business in this country, except that it has special privileges granted to it by the State. It uses its special privileges and powers to make profits like any other capitalist institution. Since the War, because it was incapable of doing the job it was set up to do, the governments of the post-war period had to set up the Trade Facilities Act. The Government had to come in and do the banking business that the big national banks were unfit or unwilling to do. Millions of pounds were advanced to various commercial 'enterprises because the bank was not doing its job. Since that time we have had the sugar beet subsidy. Surely, if there is one defence for private enterprise banking it is that this institution will advance' money to encourage a new and somewhat risky enterprise to establish itself. But private enterprise banking, including the Bank of England, would not face up to the establishment of a new industry like the growing of sugar beet and the production of beet sugar, although the Government and the Government's advisers were all of opinion that both from an industrial and a national welfare standpoint this was an industry that should receive financial backing. This House had to vote out of the public purse moneys to support private enterprise, because private enterprise, which is supposed to do the job, would not take it oil. I might mention also the position of the mining industry, which got right down into ruin. Private enterprise in mining ought to make its arrangements inside private enterprise in banking to get its financial support, but what did they do? They caine running to this Government, that is now saying that the Bank of England must bc trusted with all the Government's financial operations, and the Government handed them, again out of the public coffers, some £20,000,000 that the banks were afraid to advance to this derelict industry. Industrialists in the one department could not run the business efficiently, the financiers in the Bank of England would not advance them further credit, and they came to the Government and took money out of the pockets of the ratepayers, which means the rest of the working class, to subsidize the mine-owners of this country. It is one great regret in my life that I have to use my position in this House to patch up the evils of capitalism in order that the workers may not suffer starvation. </para>

The Bank of England and the private bankers generally would not do their job, and the British Government had to issue an additional £20,000,000 of currency.  Where  did they get that currency? They obtained it by paying the money lords exorbitant interest, which had to be met by the taxpayers. The Bank of England, the institution which is lauded to the skies as the head, body, limbs, feet, tail, the everything, the grand panjandrum of high finance, fell down on its job.

                        <para>.- The majority of honorable members must be disappointed with the speech that has just been delivered by the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates).</inline> It was a rare opportunity for him to make a full statement of his plans for giving the people plenty of money without their having to work for it.

                    <para>We can afford to discuss this question on its merits. If honorable members who sit on this side disagree radically with those who sit opposite, that fact must not be attributed to party prejudice. It is well known that the policies of the Labour party and the Nationalist party differ materially. The Labour party stands for the socialization of industry, while members who sit on this side believe that the best method of conducting the affairs of this country is by private enterprise. I admit that the Commonwealth Bank has been singularly free from political influence in the conduct of its business. It has been fortunate in having had, as a board of directors, business men who have not shown any pronounced political partiality. As a matter of fact, it has exercised the principal functions of a central bank with a considerable degree of success. There is no reason to doubt that if it continued to develop in cooperation with the private banks it would assist Australia through the difficult times that are ahead, just as effectively as could a reserve bank. </para>
                    <para>The bill proposes that an entirely new financial institution shall be established.

                    <para class="block">It is generally conceded that the Treasurer made an excellent speech. Beading it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> one could be pardoned for concluding that the present Government intends to act as a godfather to the trading banks. The honorable gentleman cannot be attacked for what he said; but I believe that he can be attacked for what he failed to say. It is suspected that this Government will endeavour gradually to weaken the trading banks, with the object of establishing a Government monopoly in banking. The objective of the Labour party is clearly laid down in its platform. It is, the socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange by various methods. In regard to banking the platform says - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>So far, the experience of this House and of the country has been that the Government does not regard its platform as ornamental. It believes that it is free to act in the way that it conceives to be in the best interests of the people. It has behind it in the country various organizations which, from day to day, are clamouring for some plank or other to be given effect. </para>
                    <para>The Treasurer may say that there is no intention on the part of the Government to interfere with the trading banks, and that their rights will be recognized; but one naturally would like to know how long that state of affairs will continue. There can be no doubt that, sooner or later, there will be a conflict of policy. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> made no secret to-night of the fact that, if he had his way, he would abolish the private trading banks and have a government monopoly in banking. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> makes so many extravagant statements that I do not think even the members of his own party take him very seriously. It cannot be said that the existing banking and financial system has proved defective. The present crisis was brought about by a steady depreciation of the values of our principal exports. The cost of production has been so high that our primary producers have not been able to export except at a loss. The Government recognizes that that is the case because, by means of the Wheat Marketing Bill, the wheat-growers  of Australia are to be assisted; and its willingness to pay half the salary of a member of the Development and Migration Commission while he is engaged in an investigation of the wool industry proves that it recognizes the necessity of assisting the wool-growers. Various political parties also have been partially responsible for our present position. There has been unwise borrowing by both State and Federal Governments, with the inevitable result that there is a shortage of money in the community. Before we can return to prosperity there must be a general recognition of that fact by every section of the community. When we talk about reducing the cost of production, certain honorable members opposite immediately accuse us of favoring a reduction of wages. I go further than that, and say that before we can return to a sound economic position we must consider not only wages but also rents, profits and interest. All these must be reduced before we can hope to get back to a sound footing. </para>
                    <para>It has been said that the Commonwealth Bank cannot function as a reserve bank while it is in active competition with the * trading banks. If that is true, honorable members on this side of the House would prefer to eliminate the trading operations of the bank, and allow it to develop as a central reserve bank. The private banks in Australia control a large amount of capital, and enjoy the confidence of the public. Leading authorities from England and other countries have commented favorably on the excellent way in which our financial institutions have 'been conducted. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> quoted what he described as returns from twenty-three separate banks in Australia. Personally, I have been unable to find out anything about any bank other than the eleven principal banks which have between them no fewer than 2,500 branches. Their authorized capital is £77,000,000, and of this amount £44,643,000 has been paid up. They have reserves of £34,000,000. and there is a reserve liability to the shareholders of £29,789,000. The paid up capital and reserves are used in the business of the bank. At a Labour conference held the other day in Canberra, mention was made of the alleged restriction of credit which, it was said, was responsible for unemployment. The following report of the proceedings of that conference appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times -</inline></para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The report of the Unemployment Committee stated that preventable unemployment had been aggravated by the restriction of credit due to present banking practice. This has operated to prevent potential employers, i.e., manufacturers, agriculturists, local ' governing bodies, and the like, being able in the case of the first class, to extend their factories in order to supply the home market which recent tariff policy has secured to them; in the second instance, to crop increased areas for primary' production which supplies the great bulk of our exports, and in the case of the municipal bodies, to carry out necessary works for the comfort and the good of the people. Undoubted securities apparently as a matter of financial policy have been rejected. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Little reliance can be placed on those statements in view of the fact that during the two years ended 1929 there was an increase of deposits in the various banks of £20,000,000, whereas the increase of advances was no less than £41,000,000. These figures show how generous the batiks have been, in the matter of advances. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,</inline> the banking figures for the quarter ending 31st March, showed that the total deposits in the eleven trading banks amounted to £292,000,000, while the total advances were £291,600,000, showing that the banks have met the demands for money to the utmost of their resources. If this bill is passed, and a new financial institution is established, a very considerable amount of money will be taken from the trading banks to be placed in the proposed central reserve bank. So far as I have been able to find out, approximately £20,000,000 will be needed for this purpose. How will it be possible for the Treasurer to take this money from the trading banks without injury to the credit of the country? I have already pointed out that the fixed deposits with the banks have just about been exhausted by the advances made against them. Paid-up capital and reserves amounting to £42,500,000 are held in coin, bullion, notes and cash in the Commonwealth Bank, and a balance of £14,500,000 represents value of promises, notes, bills, &amp;c. The Treasurer proposes to require the trading banks to deposit 10 per cent, of their current accounts and 5 per cent, of fixed deposits with this central reserve bank. If this is done it will tend to restrict the credit still further. </para>
                    <para>The private trading banks have been of considerable assistance to the Commonwealth Government in raising loans. I particularly remember one loan of £10,000,000 which they underwrote towards the end of last year. The fact that the Commonwealth Bank has developed a large business, and has a considerable number of branches throughout the Commonwealth, is used as an argument by some persons in favour of its continuing its trading operations. I would have no </para>

I am not against central reserve banking of some kind, but I do not favour the creation of a second Commonwealth financial institution with the object of extending the trading operations of the Commonwealth Bank.

                            <para>- The honorable member for Corangamite must have been absent from the chamber when I said that I did not believe that there should be two government-controlled banks operating side by side, and that I would rather have the proposed reserve bank, and so would abolish the trading bank. I do not desire to be misunderstood on this subject. In my opinion the private trading banks have given a very good account of themselves, and they would have no quarrel about having to meet the Commonwealth Bank in fair competition. But it is only natural that as the policy of the Government is the nationalization of banking it should endeavour to give the Commonwealth Bank preference over and to endeavour to weaken the private banks. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but there appears to be an important exception. It is rather regrettable that honorable members opposite should try to disguise the fact that in introducing this bill the Government is seeking to give effect to the Labour party platform. It is amusing to us on this side of the chamber to find that whenever the Government is credited by us with seeking to give effect to its policy, there is an outcry from its supporters. I should not think much of the Government which did not strive to give effect to its platform. If its platform is acceptable to the people, there should be no argument about the wisdom of giving effect to it; if it is not acceptable to them, they will doubtless say so when they have an opportunity to express their opinion. There is no doubt whatever that the policy of the Labour party is to extend the operations of the Commonwealth Bank until the private banks are completely stultified. It has already taken some steps to that end, for it has obliged the private banks to hand over part of their gold reserves, on the plea that it is seeking to mobilize the gold of the country. Now it is seeking to compel the private banks to lodge with the central reserve bank 10 per cent. of their current accounts and 5 per cent. of their fixed deposits. If they have to do this, it will, of course, cripple them for the time being, and possibly injure them permanently. </para>

                    <para>I do not propose to enter upon a discussion, of the intricate and difficult subjects mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey. I am sure that the Treasurer has considered all these arguments. He has evidently agreed with some of them, but disagreed with others. The plain fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey does not think that there is any particular need for a second government financial institution in Australia, and, as I have said, I believe that the Commonwealth Bank could be developed into the kind of central reserve bank that is necessary in Australia. </para>
                    <para>I wish, however, to make a few remarks in connexion with the proposed management of the bank. The bill provides that there shall be a board of directors consisting of a Governor; two Deputy Governors; the Secretary to the Treasury; and five other persons representing respectively the following interests :  - Banking, commerce, labour manufacturing and primary production. I do not think that it is necessary to provide for the representation of all these interests. It would be better for the Government to find the best qualified men to do this work and appoint them to the board. It appears  to me to be unnecessary also that there should be two  Deputy  Governors, for they would undoubtedly be able to over-rule the Governor if they desired to do so. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but to-day banking is a highly specialized business which calls for a long and careful training. I suggest that the Government should, if the bill is passed, look for the very best men it can find in the community and appoint them to the board. When the Commonwealth Bank Savings. Bank Bill was before the House on the 7th of October, 1927, the present Prime Minister showed that he was not favorable to the appointment of a huge directorate for the bank. His remarks in that connexion, as reported in volume 116 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> at page 868, were - </para>

                    <para>I know of nothing that has been done by the bank directorate that was not being done formerly by the Governor, his deputy and his staff, who did the pioneering work, and they controlled the bank without the assistance of a directorate. There has been no subsequent improvement because of the directorate. </para>
                    <para class="block">Apparently the Prime Minister changed his. mind about having a big directorate for this bank between the time when he made those remarks and when he was consulted by the Treasurer regarding the bill. </para>
                    <para>The Treasurer was not convincing in his advocacy of two deputy-governors. He said that one was necessary to consider loans and advances and the other should be a specialist in currency and gold reserves. I cannot imagine that one man would find great difficulty in dealing with all four subjects. They are intimately related to one another, and there are many men in the banking world who might be selected for such a position. It is quite unusual' to have a general manager of a business, with two deputies who could upset his plans at any time they chose. Many clauses of the bill will no doubt be discussed in committee, but I propose, at this stage, to refer particularly to the provision for making unsecured loans or advances to the Government. Financial institutions could, of course, be used for the purposes of the Government, and could be influenced by a government in a way that would probably create disastrous demands for credit. We know well that all political parties are subject to pressure of some kind. We had evidence of that recently when the conference of the Australian Labour party was held at Canberra. A report published in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> of 80th May, referred to a discussion by the conference on this subject.

                            <para>- We all sympathize with those who are out of work or in want, but if we are to make progress we must proceed on sound lines. Financial stability cannot be brought about merely by the use of the printing press. Many representations have been made to the Treasurer from various sources. I have resolutions passed by the wool-growers. The Treasurer has been communicated with by the various banks and the chambers of commerce, and has been asked to postpone this legislation until a more suitable time than the present. The Minister mixes with the business world, and is well acquainted with the difficulties of finance. If he has not prosecuted thorough inquiries in every possible quarter, I urge him to make them. It is not too late to withdraw the bill; but if the Government insists on proceeding with it - I realize that it has been put into office by the vote of the people - it must accept responsibility for its action. When the committee stage is reached, I hope to submit a number of suggestions to the Government, and if a reasonable spirit is shown, it will help to give the people outside some confidence in the measure. </para>
