Department to investigate all complaints of profiteering under the tariff or bounty laws ; wherever possible, he will utilize the services of the investigating officers in the various States. Already many investigations have been made, and nearly all have proved that the manufacturers have not been profiteering. </para>

                        <para>- Every honorable member must sympathize with those who have suffered as the result of the floods in the Hunter river district, but it is not one of the functions of the Commonwealth to grant relief in connexion with disasters of this kind. This is primarily a concern of the State, and, usually, if the Commonwealth intervenes at all, it is only after representations by a State Government. I remind the honorable member for Hunter that already the Commonwealth Government has made a substantial amount available to assist the surplus coal-miners in the coal-mining areas of New South Wales. I would further remind the honorable member that Australia is a very large continent. </para>

                        <para>- The report is unfounded. Rationing was introduced in connexion with the Defence Departmenr, because there was a clearly established surplus of men, and the Government had the option of discharging about 300 of them or rationing the work amongst all. There is no evidence that other branches of the Public Service are overmanned. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the statement. Most of the clothing issued was in first-class condition. Before being issued, it was washed, fumigated, and dyed. A small number of overcoats which were not suitable for other use were distributed to women to be cut up for clothing for children; possibly those are the articles to which reference was made. The department has received numbers of letters to the effect that the overcoats and other clothing which have been distributed have been highly appreciated by the recipients. </para>

I presume that what is at the bottom of the honorable member's mind is the opinion that I should have informed him of my visit to his electorate; but I merely called at the barracks on my way to inspect a much more important work, and was accompanied by the honorable member representing the district concerned. The Victoria Barracks are considered by the military authorities to be suitable for their particular purposes, and I assure the honorable member that certain work is contemplated which, when completed, will make him proud of having such an institution in his electorate. </para>

But these two gentlemen have made statements which are entirely incorrect, and require a definite reply. I take no exception to honorable members expressing their opinions in Parliament, for they can then be replied to effectively; but it is not cricket to carry on the kind of propaganda that has been indulged in lately in regard to the voluntary recruiting' movement. </para></talk.start><para>Iwish to refer, in the first place, to statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> at Launceston. This gentleman is an officer of the. Military Forces. I had the doubtful privilege on the 17th of April last of granting an extension of twelve months of his term as commanding officer of the 12th Battalion, Tasmania. I quote the following pressreport of the remarks which I consider to be objectionable:- </para><quote><para>The number of young men who have enlisted in the voluntary forces in Australia is not so satisfactory as the public has been led to believe, and the services of 9,000 more are required before the authorities will have reached their objective. Statements to this effect were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator B.</inline> Sampson, when responding to the toast of his health at the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Launceston Battery of Artillery on Saturday night. </para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline>overstated the requirements by 1,000; we need 8,000 more enlistments to reach our objective. The report of the speech continued as follows :  - </para><quote><para>Last year there were 48,000 men in training, and, on' top of that; therewere 17,000 or 18,000 cadets who would have been signed on in due course. However, the new regulations did away with all those men and it was thought that 35,000 men, which was the number hoped for by voluntary enlistments, would be suflicient for the needs of the country. But the objective which had been set for the authorities last November had by no means been reached by a long way, and there were only 26,000 in training. </para></quote><para class="block">In mentioning 48,000 men <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> made another mis-statement; the correct number was 47,000. But the statement to which I object most of all is the following: - " We read in the papers," said <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> " that voluntary enlistmentshave, exceeded the most sanguine expectations, and that everything is going very well. ButI want to give the lie direct to these statements which are damnable rotten, mean lies." </para><para class="block">I will not permit a member of either this House or another place to make such statements without replying to them, for I consider that they are made with the object of playing what the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> described, the other day, in a leading article on our defence system, as the " dirty party game."

The Government believes that the voluntary system will ultimately prove to be the most satisfactory method of providing for the defence of this country, and persons who are supposed to support the recruitingmovement should not, at the same time, be playing the party game. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> stated that under the old system 17,000 or 18,000 cadets would have signed on in due course," he neglected to state that more than 100 per cent. of the number required under the voluntary system - - 7,000 cadets - has already been obtained. </para></talk.start></continue><para>In order to reply authoritatively to the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> I have obtained a report on the whole subject from the Adjutant-General. I trust that the figures that I shall quote from it will be sufficient to put an end to the misstatements that are being made, particularly by some senators at political gatherings, for party purposes. </para><para>The enlistments to the end of May, 1930, under the voluntary system, have been as follows :  - </para><para class="block"><graphic href="125331193006246_8_0.jpg" /></para><para>Although the voluntary system has been in force for only five months, 77 per cent. of the requirements have been secured. It is significant that in Victoria, where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has been speaking against the system, and Tasmania, where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has been speaking againstit, the response has been lowest. This, of course, was to be expected from such propaganda. The recruiting results each monthare as follow :  - </para><para class="block"><graphic href="125331193006246_8_1.jpg" /></para><para class="block">It will be noticed that in Tasmania, where they require an establishment of 113 senior cadets, they have obtained only 51 per cent. of their requirements. That is not the fault of Tasmania, but is the natural outcome of the efforts of a man who has been endeavouring to discourage voluntary recruiting and to decry the present defence system. In connexion with recruiting, Major-General Dodds states that - </para><quote><para>From the above it will be noted that there has been in the past six months a regular increase in the militia and senior cadet forces amounting to 9,400 militia and 2,232 senior cadets. </para><para>It is considered that, up to the present, recruiting has been quite satisfactory ; indeed, more satisfactory than might be expected under the complete and sudden change from compulsory' service to a voluntary system without any transition period when the Force was practically disbanded and a new force brought into being. </para><para>It might reasonably have been expected that the effect of the sudden release of practically 65,000 from compulsory training, would have hada much greater reaction, and have militated against successful early recruiting. </para><para>The position with regard to officers is considered very satisfactory indeed, the strength being 2,647 out of an establishment of 2,807, i.e., 94 per cent. </para><para>The position as regards warrant and noncommissioned officers is that the present strength, 5,229 out of an establishment of 7,410, or 71 per cent., is not unsatisfactory, but encouraging. Apart from those who actually held non-commissioned rank and reenlisted under the voluntary system, the number of whom was approximately 4,000, aspirant's for non-commissioned positions had to be selected and trained in order to reach the examination standard, which they have to pass before being appointed. If would not have been wise tofill the appointments until sufficient time had elapsed for commanding officers to assure themselves of the capacity for leadership disclosed by aspirants. Under these circumstances it is considered good work has been done during the past six months. </para><para>The position with regard to the rank and file is 19,180 out of 24,783, or 77 per cent.

The actual figures in this regard will not be available until early in August. </para><para>Recruits will, however, be coming in from the. senior cadets and outside. The holding of camps during the next financial year will be most helpful in stimulating the recruiting.

In some countries, especially India, certain varieties of the flax plant are grown mainly for the production of linseed. .

In New Zealand a different kind of flax, <inline font-style="italic">Phormium tenax,</inline> is produced, which is much coarser than the Australian flax, and is grown chiefly for the seed and also, to a slight extent, for the manufacture of a rough cordage.

                            <para>- Yes. The conference and those who made representation were of the opinion that, in order to establish this industry on a firm footing rand give it a chance of success, it was necessary to pay this bounty for at least a limited period. It has a much better chance of succeeding to-day, because of the introduction of more modern machinery, scutching machines and so on, than was formerly used. An effort is being made, I believe with every chance of success, to establish a canvas mill in Tasmania for the purpose of manufacturing many lines now imported. </para>

                    <para>A large proportion of linen piece goods, twines other than cotton, nets and nettings, cordage and rope, is also made from flax. Taking the flax proportion of these at as low as one-half, this would mean another £206,018. Therefore, it is estimated that in 1928-29 £987,685 worth of flax products was imported into Australia. These figures show that if flax-  growing and the flax-manufacturing industry can be established in Australia they will be of immense benefit, not only from the point of view of land settlement, but also because of the employment they will afford and because less money will be sent from Australia to pay for imported goods. At this time we are anxious to establish new industries. This is one that I think can be satisfactorily put on its feet, giving employment to primary producers and secondary workers. </para>
                    <para>Taking the linseed and linseed oil positions alone, the Tariff Board has calculated that 150,000 acres of flax plants would require to be cultivated each year in order to provide the 23,000 tons of linseed now processed in Australia by manufacturers of linseed oil, linseed meal, oil cake, &amp;c. Flax-growing is best carried on as a three-year rotation crop. Therefore, under ideal conditions, 450,000 acres of suitable flax country is necessary, and the 300,000 acres not used for flax in any given year could be used for other crops. The estimated areas of land suitable for flaxgrowing are - </para>

                    <para>The industry has been carried on in Australia in a somewhat desultory fashion in Victoria and Tasmania for some years. In 1907, the Commonwealth granted a bounty of 10 per cent. of the value of flax fibre and linseed produced ; but the results were meagre, only £2,376 being paid up to 1917 when the act ceased to operate. From 1918 to 1922 the Commonwealth Government guaranteed the flax-growers from £5 to £6 a ton, and the area under cultivation increased to 1,640 acres. It was essentially a war-time measure, and, as such gave the industry no assurance of continuity. One of the problems in those days was the difficulty in retting. That will be overcome by the use of modern machinery. Money was lost by the Government under that guarantee, and the industry did not prosper. </para>

                            <para>- I shall give the whole of the figures showing the amount lost. The failure between 1918 and 1922 seems clearly to have been due to the much higher prices then being received by the farmers for other farm produce, which made the returns from flax comparatively unattractive. Moreover, there was insufficient pure seed available to meet the suddenly increased demand by farmers at that time for flax-growing, and in consequence, the yield of flax plants per acre was abnormally low. Now, however, every effort possible will be made by the State Agricultural Departments to provide expert advice to flax-growers, and to co-operate with the farmers with a view to bringing success to the industry. In view of the recommendations of the Tariff Boardand the views of the Development and Migration Commission, as well as the introduction of modern machinery, I believe that the Commonwealth Government is justified at this stage in doing something practical to give this industry a chance of success. </para>

                    <para>During the last four years, further attempts have been -made to revive the flax industry, and it is now organized on a much better basis than at any previous period. Moreover, other farm products have diminished in value and flax plants, at £5 a ton, are generally recognized as being a payable crop, and quite attractive compared with other crops at current values. The principal manufacturers of flax fibre and linseed in Australia include the following: - Flax Corporation of Australia Ltd., Launceston, Tasmania; Flax Proprietary Ltd., Drysdale, Victoria, and Linen Flax Products Coy., Colac, Victoria. There are several other manufacturers, operating mainly in Gippsland, Victoria. At the present time there is great activity in the industry. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> is probably aware of recent activity in this direction in his electorate. The people engaged in flax-growing anticipate that by the payment of a bounty their industry will be resuscitated. </para>

                            <para>- .1 speak comparatively. The industry has shown considerable activity compared with its progress some ten years ago. The Government offered an incentive to the farmers to engage more actively in flax-growing by promising to introduce a bounty on the production of flax and linseed. As a result, farmers are now planting larger areas. That is strikingly borne out by the fact that the area under cultivation in Tasmania increased from 8 acres in 1926 to 87 in 1927; to 225 in 1928; to 1,181 in 1929; and, if this bounty bill is passed, it is anticipated that 3,000 acres will be under cultivation in 1930. The area under cultivation in Victoria has increased from 200 acres in 1926 to  approximately  2,200 acres in  1930. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister, after a careful investigation has been made by the responsible officers. That will ensure that farmers will not be fleeced by manufacturers. The provision is similar to one contained in the Wine Export Bounty Act, which has operated successfully. Flax-growers are therefore assured of assistance and protection under the bill. The chief difficulties now operating against a large expansion of the industry are' the lack of any assurance that the payable price of £5 per ton will continue for a reasonable term of years, and the' uncertainty as to the future which precludes the manufacturers from raising capital to install the latest improved machinery. That is a very important consideration. ' Factories that have been operating during the past four years have been turning out high quality products and disposing of them, but without profit, owing to the entire lack of assistance from the Government by way of bounty, or protection, and also to the fact that their output was insufficient. The Tariff Board and officers of the department over which I temporarily preside, are of the opinion that the flax industry is well deserving of assistance for a developmental period of five years, in order to give it an opportunity to demonstrate whether the industry can be permanently established here on a large scale. </para>

                            <para>- No. Theannouncement in March, 1930, that the Government intended to introduce a bill to Parliament providing for bounties on flax and linseed has already produced evidence of the benefits of the proposal. In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 25th March last, the managing director of a new company, called the " Linen Flax Products Company," operating in the Colac district of Victoria, announced that a minimum of 1,000 acres will be set aside for flax-growing in the coming season, and that much enthusiasm is being shown by the farmers. The project will result in 45 men being employed in the Colac mills, and their wages will amount to about £10,000 per annum. That gentleman also stated that his company proposed to establish a chain of mills in the Colac districts, with subsidiary mills in outlying centres. These will be scutching mills, where the deseeding, retting and fibre extraction will take place. I have in my hand some samples of rough fibre, fibre after scutching, and cordage and rope made of Australian flax at the Drysdale factory. Last year there were in the Australian flax industry approximately 60 farmers, 60 permanent field-workers, and 100 mill employees, making a total of220. This year there has been a slight increase in numbers, and it is hoped that there will be asubstantial increase next spring. The potential market for flax products in </para>

                    <para class="block">When the industry expands to a sufficient extent it is the intention of some of the present manufacturers to engage in the production of canvas and linen piece goods, and to endeavour to sell a good deal more flax for the production of cordage, twine, netting, &amp;c. I think that it was the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley)</inline> who paid a visit to Tasmania and was much impressed with the possibilities of both the primary and secondary branches of the Australian flax industry. The honorable member cannot be accused of making the statement in an endeavour to influence votes in his favour. It is important to note that an Australian market already exists for 23,000 tons of linseed per annum, all of which is now imported, and is used to make linseed oil, linseed meal, oil cake, &amp;c. If this quantity of linseed were to be produced from locallygrown flax plants, there would also be produced about 25,000 tons of flax fibre, which is substantially more than Australia could now use for the manufacture of cordage, twine, rope, canvas, linen and soforth. However, the experts engaged in the flax industry consider that a large demand could be created in Australia for flax fibre, for various manufacturing purposes, and that any surplus over local requirements could be profitably exported to other countries when the industry eventually became well established. </para>

                            <para>- During the next five years, before the big mills are established, some encouragement should be given to the people who are prepared to' invest their money in reviving the industry. Particularly at this time the Federal. Government has a responsibility to endeavour to assist an industry that will give additional employment. By the time the industry is well established, and, in addition to supplying local requirements, is able to export the surplus, local costs of production will have been reduced by the adoption of better machinery and methods, and lower overhead costs will naturally result from large scale production. </para>

                    <para>Flax is not a one-sided industry. Its value lies in the fact that it will create new wealth and- employment both in primary and secondary industries, and will help to place many more settlers on the land. A further consideration is that this crop is specially suitable for production in Tasmania, and will help that State, whose, financial position is generally recognized to be weak. Tasmania claims to have suffered as a result of federation, and the present Government is prepared at all times to give sympathetic consideration to any industry that will help to lift the State out of its difficulties. The development of this industry will tend to modify the present necessity for the younger generation of Tasmanians to depart for the mainland in order to secure employment. Without the proposed bounties, the industry has neither stability nor a sufficient inducement to expand on a large scale. With a bounty it is believed that rapid expansion will be possible, which, in turn, will conduce greatly to lower costs of production and distribution, and so render the bounty unnecessary after a few years. </para>

When the honorable member was  chairman  of a wages board in Victoria he arbitrated between the claims of the employees on the one hand and the employers on the. other. . I, likewise, arbitrated between the requests of the deputation and the interests of the general community. The bill provides for bounty on a diminishing scale ranging from 15 per cent, to 10 per cent, and finally 7£ per cent, of the net Australian market value.  The manufacturers concerned have accepted these reduced rates. I pointed out to them that, having regard to the present economic and financial position of Australia, they must be reasonable. At the present time the net Australian market values are approximately.: Flax, high grade raw material, £60 per ton; flax, low grade, £35 per ton; linseed, average, £20 pelton . </para>

                            <para>- The bill is based on the board's recommendation. I shall consider further the merits of <inline font-style="italic">Phormium tenax,</inline> and, if desirable, it will be included. My advice is, however, that that variety is not suitable to Australia. The production for 1930 is variously estimated at from 400 tons to 500 tons of flax, and from 380 tons to 450- tons of linseed. In this regard, the Tariff Board originally recommended that no bounty should be paid until the annual flax production is worth £20,000 and linseed £70,000. On the 18th January, 1929, however, the Tariff Board advised that minimum quantities of 200 tons of flax, and 4,000 tons of linseed should be stipulated. After the most careful consideration, the Government decided that the existence of a hard and fast condition regarding minimum production would militate against the development of the industry. If producers could get no encouragement or assistance until their linseed production reached the high total of 4,000 tons per annum, this factor, together with past disappointments, would be an obstacle to development. Furthermore, an important practical point to be borne in mind is that a given quantity of flax crop produces approximately equal quantities of flax fibre and linseed. Therefore, the proposed stipulation  of a minimum of 250 tons of flax, and 41,000 tons of linseed, was not consistent; it meant that producers would qualify for the flax bounty years before they could obtain bounty on similar quantities of linseed produced at the same time. The Government has decided, therefore, that, in the best interests of the industry, no quantity restrictions should be imposed, especially as inquiries show that the minimum production of 250 tons of flax will be considerably exceeded for 1930, and that production will be appreciably greater in the following year. On the basis of a production in 1930 of 500 tons of flax and 450 tons of linseed, the bounty payments for 1930 will be about £8,000. Allowing for reasonable increases in subsequent years, it is estimated that the following amounts of bounty will be paid under this bill:- 1930, £8,000; 1931, £15,000; 1932, £13,000; 1933, £15,000; 1934, £15,000; total, £66,000. The percentage decrease in the rate of bounties will prevent an increase in the annual liability. The total appropriation proposed is £20,000 per annum, or £100,000 for the five years. This leaves a margin of £34,000 to cover a larger expansion in the industries than is forecasted in the foregoing estimates. </para>

                    <para>The farmer will be protected by being assured of a reasonable price for his flax plants. The bill also gives protection to consumers of flax and linseed and to employees. The Minister may, under clause 12, withhold the whole or part of the bounty, or obtain refunds of bounty already paid, if the claimant does not sell <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> flax or linseed at a reasonable price. Further, under clause 13, the net profits of claimants are limited to 15 per cent., and the Minister may withhold the payment of any bounty, or obtain refunds of bounty already paid that would otherwise result in the claimants earning more than 15 per cent. profits. </para>
                    <para>In regard to employees, clause 14 provides that the Minister may withhold the whole or any part of the bounty if he finds that the conditions of employment or rates of wages observed by manufacturers of flax, or linseed, or by growers of flax plants are below the declared or standard conditions or rates prescribed by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or by any other industrial authority of the Commonwealth or a State. That provision is similar to the industrial clauses recently adopted by the House in respect of the "Wine Export Bounty Bill and the Cotton Industries Bounty Bill. Sub-clause 1 provides that a Commonwealth authority, to be appointed by the Minister, shall not be appointed unless there is no Federal or State award or determination, or registered industrial agreement applying to the industry. An appointment would be made by the Minister only in exceptional circumstances. Under sub-clause 8 such a Commonwealth authority will be composed of one representative of the employers, one representative of the employees, and a  chairman  appointed by the Minister on the joint nomination of the representatives of employers and employees. </para>
                    <para>Having regard to the considered opinion of theTariff Board " that if the establishment of the flax industry can be achieved, even at a maximum bounty cost of £30,000 per annum, the cost would be small in comparison with the result obtained," and in view of the views expressed by those engaged in the industry, the officers of the Development and Migration Commission, and others who have been consulted, I submit the bill to the House in the confident hope that it will be acceptable to honorable members, as a measure that has reasonable expectations, even with the reduced expenditure limit of £20,000 per annum, of establishing an industry of a potential value to Australia of £1,000,000 annually. </para>

It will have the opposite effect, despite the revision of the tariff in the interests of Australian industries generally. Today a bill was introduced in this House for the purpose of giving a bounty to even another industry. So the thing goes on. Goodness knows from where the money is to come. This legislation will go a long way towards paralysing industry. It is the duty of this Parliament to endeavour to see that equal justice is done to every section of the community. Why did the big timber strike take place? It was not because the trade unions wanted to interfere with the wages of the timber- worker in the country or his working hours of 48 hours a week. It was because the city worker objected to work 48 hours a week that the trouble started. Can we give every person in the community the same conditions? Can we give the man on the land the same conditions as are enjoyed by the men in the city? While it is our duty to look after the interests of the poorest people, and to give them some little concession, if necessary, it is also our duty to see that equal justice is done to every section of the community. This legislation is not likely to accomplish that. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows that if we applied the conditions of the city worker to the worker in the agricultural areas the farmers would immediately be driven off the land. Recently this House passed legislation with the object of giving a guarantee in connexion with the production of wheat. The cost of production has become so high that the farmers cannot carry on, and consequently this Parliament has had to come to their aid. During the British seamen's strike, which took place some five years ago, I was addressing a meeting, and a man in the audience wanted to know whether I considered that £8 a month was a fair wage to pay a British seaman. I told him that that was not his business or mine, because the British ship-owners and seamen were quite capable of settling their own differences without outside interference. This man was a farmer in the district, and I asked him what wage he paid to the men that he employed on his farm. Instead of answering he left the meeting amid roars of laughter from the audience. I discovered afterwards that the wages of his labourers were 35s. aweek and board, while that of the British seaman was £2 a week and board. This man was like many honorable members opposite who seek popularity no matter what the cost may be to the nation. The industrial position of Australia is serious, and I did anticipate that this Government would, at least, show some little sympathy with the unemployed. The introduction of the bill itself is an impertinence. If the </para>

It is proposed, under this legislation to appoint conciliation commissioners. It is suggested that this is conciliation legislation ; but there is no mention in the bill of conciliation except in the term " conciliation commissioners." Under this bill we are substituting coercion for co-operation, and injunctions for voluntary contracts. The whole billteems with coercion so far as the Worker is concerned. A conciliation commissioner is to have almost the same power as a judge. The Government may appoint any person that it likes as a conciliation commissioner, and' I certainly should not care to see industry at the mercy of the commissioners who are likely to be appointed. We should deal with conciliation as it is being dealt with in other countries. According to <inline font-style="italic">Webster</inline> the definition of the word " conciliate " is - </para>

                    <para class="block">Is that the idea underlying the appointment of conciliation commissioners? Is there any intention of, bringing the parties together for the purpose of getting them to come to an agreement? Certainly not, because these conciliation commissioners are ito be given the most absolute power to reduce wages and hours and to vary any award that may be made by a judge of the court. I have looked through the bill in vain to find any proposal to settle disputes in industry by conciliation. The Government claims that it has amandateforthe introduction of this legislation. I say that it has not. Much has been said about the mandate that was received by this Government at the last election, but at that time there were innumerable questions at issue before the people, particularly the question of taxation. </para>

Yetduring the election campaign, whilst it was difficult even with the aid of the press to coax more than 50 or60 people together in our various towns to listen to " the merits or the demerits " of the arbitration question) or the " Faults of the Bruce Government", our picture theatres were crammed nightly and canvassed in favour of the present Government. No wonder the sweeping Labour victory! No wonder the greatest political landslide in the history of the Commonwealth! It was the first time a government crossed swords with the picture magnates and their audiences, and the result of the elections revealed the mighty power of the picture theatre. </para>

The issue of the last referendum was the taking over by theCommonwealthof full industrial powers. On that occasion even the Attorney-General himself had a little surprise in his own electorate. In addition, the Prime Minister's majority was lessenedby about 10,000 votes. When that question was put before this Parliament only two members, the then honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> and myself, opposed the Government. Every member of the Labour party voted with the Government. They pledged themselves to support the issue that was being placed before the country.The people, By an enormous majority, decided against giving to the Commonwealth full control of industrial matters. </para>

                    <para>Since 1904, the Commonwealth Parliament has been called upon to consider measure after measure to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. All these legislative proposals have had industrial peace as their objective, but I suppose in no country in the world is -there so much antagonism between employer and employee as in Australia. The very atmosphere of the Arbitration Court is provocative of trouble. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> when moving the second reading of one of the many bounty bills that have been introduced during this session disclosed, perhaps unwittingly, the methods which were responsible for so much of the dissatisfaction that exists with regard to arbitration court awards. He said the usual practice was for the employees to ask for something more than they anticipated they would get in the way of shorter hours and higher wages, and the employers, acting on the same principle when they approached the court, endeavoured to make out a case for longer hours and lower wages. As a rule the judge gave something to the workers, who then took the view that they owed nothing to the "boss" because he had tried to increase their hours of work and reduce their wages. As a result, the men were antagonized by the Arbitration Court proceedings, and determined to give as little as possible in the way of labour output for the wages received. No one can doubt that this attitude is taken by a considerable section of the industrial workers in Australia. We all remember the difficulty which the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had to meet during the war, because of the persistent trouble in the coal-mining industry. Eventually he introduced and passed the Industrial. Peace Act, under which a specialtribunal was constituted to deal with disputes in the coal-mining industry. What has been the result? There has been nothing but chaos and trouble for the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>This industrial unrest appears to be without end. Only the other daythe Tyldesley colliery, near Lithgow had to be closed down. It appears that there were 47 strikes in fourteen months, and in only one instance was there a difference between the management and the men. All the other stoppages were due to disputes between the men themselves. The management stated that there had been so many interruptions during the year that it was found impossible to compete with collieries in other parts of the world. Consequently the mine was laid idle. </para>

                    <para>Mr.GREG ORY.- I assume that these men were working under the Industrial Peace Act. Ifnot, theArbitration Court was available to them, but apparently they did not approachit. These disputes in industryare costingthe workers of Australia millions of pounds. If the men engaged in coal-mining had remained at. work instead of striking so often during the last few years, the money which they would have earned would have enabled them to purchase shares in all the collieries, and many of them would have been wealthy men to-day. </para>
                    <para>I have always opposed this class of legislation, because I am convinced that thef ramers of the Constitution never intended the Commonwealth to seek legislative control of industry in the various States. No one can doubt that our legislation in this direction has caused a great' deal of friction between the Commonwealth and the States, particularly because ofour interference with State instrumentalities. The several State Parliaments are supposed to scrutinize the receipts and expenditure of their respective governments, and yet they have no control over railway employees, whose conditions of employment and wages are determined by the Federal Arbitration Court.

                            <para>- I must, of course, accept the Minister's assurance; but we have so much evidence of trade union influence in industriallegislation that we are almost forced to the conclusion that the Government has brought forward these proposals to placate certain industrial organizations. Onlya few weeks ago the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne attacked the Hogan Ministry because of its action in connexion with the waterside workers' dispute. The following resolution was adopted by. that body:- </para>

                            <para>-What is this bill but coercion ? Apparently this Government believes in coercion in everything except the means to defend . Australia. This is no time for all the cant and humbug which we hear about the destruction of the temple of labour. This is no time for the "sob stuff" we have been getting lately from Ministers and their supporters to appease the unthinking people. We have tens of thousands of unemployed persons in Australia. Our trade is languishing, and our basic industries are imperilled. I am one of those who desire to keep taxation as low as possible, so that industry may be built up, and the country developed. Recently there have been heavy deficitsin both State and Federalbudgets.Public credit is endangered; we have a public debt of £1,100,000,000;and an annual interest bill of over £55,000,000. At a time like this we dare not pass any legislation tending to injure the great primary industries upon which Australia's solvency depends. I cannot see how industrial conditions will be improved if this hill is passed, nor can I see how the removal of penalties from the Arbitration Act can aid primary production. Members of the Waterside Workers Federation, who defied the law and proved themselves unworthy of Australian citizenship, will, however, be enabled to displace the men who came to the rescue of. their country in a time of industrial upheaval. Recently, Judge Beeby said that the industrial history of the federation had made it impossible, to legalize control by the federation of waterside labour; yet, within a few weeks, the members of that organization will be back again on the waterfront, and the volunteers will be displaced. </para>

                            <para>- I would give them the right to go back to work, but not the right to force from their jobs those men who served their country well in time of need. Under this bill, the conciliation commissioners to be appointed will bo given practically absolute power. In Canada a system of conciliation is in operation, but there is no provision for arbitration. Under the law there, if a dispute occurs, the Minister may appoint a committee consisting of a judge and two other persons to inquire into it. They have to make a report as soon as possible, and endeavour to bring the parties together. If an agreement is reached, it can be registered, and it will then have the force of law, but only so far as the contracting parties are concerned. </para>

                            <para>- In Canada, where the conciliation system operates without compulsory arbitration, wages are, in many instances, higher than in Australia. For instance, in. 1927, bricklayers working 44 hours a week received from £9 3s. to £1111s. per week; carpenters, from £4 18s. to £9 3s. for 48 hours; plasterers, from £9 3s. to £1111s.; and conductors, 2s.1d. to 3s.1d. per hour for a 60-hours week, which works out at about £6 5s. a week. </para>

It is difficult to make an exact comparison because they work on different index numbers. Mention has been made during the debate of the Canadian railway system. In Canada the locomotive men and traincrews are paid so much per train mile. It is worth noting that while Freights on wheat are practically the same in Canada as in Australia, those on live stock, machinery, fencing wire, and wool are only about half what they are here, while, speaking generally, there is no friction between employer and employee. </para>

                        <para>Australians were mistaken in accepting compulsory arbitration, thus permitting politicians to control economic questions and the conditions of the workers. The only effective machinery to deal with such matters was economic machinery mutually established between employer and employee. The compulsory Arbitration Court established in the State of Kansas was bitterly opposedby the Federation of Labour, and the  president  of the Kansas Miners Union and other unionists' went to gaol for contempt of court in declining to be governed by the court. The court was afterwards withdrawn. This fight prevented the idea of arbitration courts spreading throughout the States. Machinery for settling industrial disputes must be available on the job when the problems arose. If the mission found a plan to replace class hatred with mutual co-operation, aiming at an equitable division of production, it would fulfil its purpose. </para>

                        <para>.-Almost every member of the Opposition who has spoken on this bill has said something like this - " Theworkers must not expect to get more out of industry than they put into it," Other outstanding pronouncements have been " shorter hours are being sought all the time;" "unemployment is world wide ; " " longer hours and lower wages arenecessary." The honorable member who has just resumed his seat spoke of an eternal economic law. Another honorable member said it was true that, to a great extent, machinery had displaced labour. Another said, " This bill gives the owners an open go ; there is no penalty for lockouts." Of course we know that no lockout has been proved against an owner in this country, so it is just as well to remove a penalty provision that there is no prospect of ever enforcing. After dealing with the general principles of the bill, I propose to return to these pronouncements of honorable members, and discuss them one by one. The primary object of the bill is to make our arbitration law more effective, to promote goodwill in industry, and to repeal the penal provisions of the 1928 act. One of the objects of the act is, " The prevention of lockouts and strikes in relation to industrial disputes." The present measure provides that those words shall be omitted, and its primary object is to be the promotion of goodwill in industry by conciliation and arbitration. In order to achieve this the bill provides for the repeal of those sections prohibiting lockouts and strikes. Under section 18a of the act, three judges are required to hear any case with respect to the increase or decrease of the standard hours in industry. The bill provides that three judges shall hear a case in which an increase in the standard hours of work- </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that. Three judgesare to hear a case in which an increase in standard hoursor a reduction in the basic wage is involved ; but a reduction in the standard hours of work may be decided by one judge. The bill also increases thepowers of conciliation commissioners so that they shall have all the powers of a judge for the purpose of settling or preventing industrial disputes, with the exception of those powers enumerated in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 8 of the bill. Under this measure the Arbitration Court judges are given power to determine whether an industrial dispute exists, which, under the act, is a matter to bedetermined by a judge of the High Court. Under the act the  court is compelled, before making an award, to take into consideration its probable economic effect; but under clause 17 of the bill this provision is to be repealed. It is also proposed to repeal the following sections of the act: - Section 33, power of the judge to require security for observance of awards; section 38c, court not to hear disputes where State authority is more desirable; power of court to suspend or cancel award; section 47., issue of process against property of "organization ; section 48, power to make orders to compel compliance with awards ; section 50, disability upon wilful non-compliance of award; sections 56a-56o, secret ballots ; section 58b, rules, &amp;c, of organizations not to prevent agreements; sections 62-64, extension of act to proclaimed organization; sections 70a and 70b, suspension or expulsion from membership of organizations; section S6a-86b, certain offences as to boycotts. &amp;c ; section 87, counselling or procuring offences; section 89b, penalties for certain offences. The Government believes that by the repeal of these punitive provisions goodwill in industry will be promoted and that the Commonwealth arbitration- system will become far more effective. </para>

                    <para>I now wish  to refer to the industrial position in New South Wales and throughout Australia generally, with respect to that chorus of protests heard every day, to the effect, that the 44-hour week is ruining industry in Australia. That is one of those untrue statements made by some politicians and public men, and appearing in the Australian press, which should be refuted,' not only on the floor of this House, but all over Australia. I, therefore, intend to quote some interesting figures to show that a 44-hour week is not ruining industry in Australia as some contend. It has been freely stated in the New South Wales press, particularly in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney. Morning Herald,</inline> that the 44-hour week in industry in that State is a huge handicap to employers; so much so that they find it impossible to compete, with Victorian secondary industries. What are the facts? According to the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh,</inline> the production per employee in, secondary industries in that State' is higher than in any other State, while Queensland, another State in which the 44-hour week is in operation, comes next. The output per worker in the secondary industries in each State for the year ended 30th June, 1920, the latest figures available, are: - New South Wales, £993; Victoria, £801; Queensland, £979; South Australia, £885; Western Australia, £798; and Tasmania, £667. According to the same publication, 43$ per cent, of the total output of Australian factories is produced in New South Wales. In 1928, there were 8,361 factories in that State, employing 1S2,660 workers - 137,936 males and 44,724 females - of whom 8,763 were children under the age of sixteen years. In factories employing more than 100 workers, 83,760 employees were engaged. It is interesting to note that productivity was considerably higher in the larger enterprises. The output per employee for the year ended 30th June, 1928, was as follows : - </para>
                    <para class="block">

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The decrease in the production per employee in factories employing 51 and' under 100 workers was due to the fact that highly-developed factories in that division are not numerous. In 1918 the surplus of production, after paying for raw material and wages, was valued at £14',798,599, and in 1928 the amount was £33,986,373, or more than double that in 1918. In ten years, the factory-owners of New South Wales, more than doubled the value of their surplus production, although during that period the 44-hour week became operative. What becomes of these huge surpluses each year? A portion is absorbed in overhead costs, depreciation of plant, government taxes, interest to banks, and some to landlords, as factories are often leased to the occupiers. In 1918, the value added to raw materials in process of manufacture was £244 4s. per worker, and in 1928 it wa» £393 4!s., or an increase of £149 per worker. That is highly satisfactory when one considers the complaints that have been made concerning a 44-hour week and the slowing up in industry. In 1918, the average wages paid to each worker was £126 3s. 7d., and in 1928 it was £215 4s. 9d., or an increase of £89 1s. 2d. In 1918, the surplus production per worker was £1180s. 5d., and in 1928, £177 19s. 3d., or an increase of £59 18s. 10d. per worker in 1928 as compared with 1918. Surely that is an answer to those who contend that the introduction of the 44-hour week has had the effect of ruining industry. Recently I read of an English coal company - the Powell-Dufferyn Steam-coal Company - the  chairman  of which, after he had gratified the assembled shareholders by announcing that their trading loss of £36,000 for 1928 had been converted into a trading profit of £307,000 in 1929, made a few remarks concerning the Coal Bill which was then before the British Parliament. He said - </para>

The shortening of hours must of necessity increase the cost. Our competitors will be put in a stronger position at the expense of the British coal trade in the foreign markets. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I am not concerned with this particular company or its  chairman. His  is only one voice in the chorus of insistence that if Australian industry is to hold its own in the markets of the world our wage-earners must work longer and harder and consent to wage reductions. I do not wish to argue the economic aspect of this subject with such persons. On the contrary, I am inclined to agree with them that capitalism has nothing else to offer the worker. In the competitive scramble in a capitalistic world, one who asks for a high standard of life and human leisure receives the inhuman leisure of wageless unemployment. The process is surely obvious. There will be no work unless the product of labour can be sold, and. it cannot be disposed of in the markets of the world unless it is as cheap as that on a competitive stall. If orders are to come in for our goods, and employment is to be secured for Australian workmen, our labour costs must be lowered so that our goods can compete with those on the next stall. That is quite true, and I do not see how a govern ment of archangels could obtain any other result from the capitalist method of supplying the world's needs. I would like to point out to those who are constantly harping in this way upon the worthlessness of capitalism that to any worker desiring a full life the matter does not rest there. They seem to think that the chance of drudgery for other men's profit is all the worker wants, and that when they have proved that wage cuts and longer hours are necessary to ensure employment in competition with cheap production elsewhere, the matter is settled in the minds of all sensible people. The simple fact which I put to these orators is that, so far from ending the matter, their demonstration of the need for longer hours and lower wages is the Labour demonstration of the inability of capitalism to serve the needs of human life. The more conclusively they prove their point, the more they strengthen our case that capitalism means the abandonment of any hope of a fine and spacious life for the world's workers. </para>
                    <para>All this takes us down to the foundation of things - to the single and elementary truths that are at the core of human purpose and human action. The Labour movement, in its final analysis, does not owe its strength merely to economic calculations; but to the quite simple and elemental perception that, in relation to the now known and available resources of the world, the kind of life to which this capitalistic reasoning would condemn us is not good enough. Why should we, in response to such reasoning, abandon our belief in the possibility of a fine and spacious lifefor the world's workers? </para>
                    <para class="block">We are living in a new world - a world of abundant resources and wonderful powers. The sole purpose of work is to supply the needsof human life. Until quite recently that had to be done by long drudgery. To-day, with the new powers and new instruments at our disposal, an hour of human labour is as productive in the supply of those needs as a thousand hours of hard toil were only a few generations ago. We are furnished to-day with the knowledge and the implements of possible resplendent abundance for all human life. Living in such a world with such resources we know by the clear instinct of sanity and sequence of things that there must be a lie at the core of any reasoning whatever which leads to the conclusion that spacious living is impossible for men in such circumstances. Whatever may be the process of such an argument, whether it be simple or complex, plausible or ridiculous, if it comes to that conclusion we proceed with perfect confidence in the sanity of things to append to it the old tag, " which is absurd ", precisely as Euclid appended it to such conclusions as " the whole is less than its part ", or " things which are equal to the same thing are not equal to one another ". </para>
                    <para>Capitalism dares not use the productive powers with which science has equipped us. It only produces for a market in which the purchasing power of the mass of the people is at a minimum far below the full satisfaction of their real needs. If, for a single year only, we were to produce goods up to the full capacity of our powers and resources, the whole capitalistic system would collapse under a glut of commodities of every sort. It is very doubtful whether the entire production of the world under capitalism is so high as even 10 per cent. of the world's capacity for production. </para>
                    <para>But while that sort of full-capacity production would ruin capitalistic commercialism would any one be mad enough to say that the distribution of produce on that scale into the lives and homes of men and women would be other than an enormous enhancement of the world's life ? Production indeed ! We can produce up to the requirements of a scale of life far beyond the dwarfed imagination of a starveling capitalistic world. When, therefore, we are told that in order to find any employment and livelihood at all, We must accept a low standard of life and leisure so as to make our produce cheap in the markets of the world, our reply is that the fact that it is so under capitalistic conditions of production and distribution is the final and convincing proof of the sheer imbecility of the capitalistic way of handling the resources of the world. The only sane way of handling the resources of the world is in relation to human needs and for the full satisfaction of human life. No capitalist producer would dare to dream of producing in relation to human needs. If he did so he would be bankrupt inside a month, for he would be producing beyond the capacity of his market - a market unrepresentative of human needs, because the mass of the people are stripped of effective purchasing power by the low standard of living which these capitalist apologists insist upon as a condition of keeping their trade going at all. </para>
                    <para>I ask those who are constantly talking about keeping labour costs down, to answer me one very simple question. If the essential condition of keeping trade prosperous is that the worker must not ask to share in it - if leisure and a high standard of life for the worker would, as they assureus jeopardize prosperity - why in the name of all miracles, should the worker care a hang about it? </para>
                    <para>Just as other honorable members who have participated in this debate have wandered from Australia all over the world, I propose to go some distance afield to discuss the subject of rationalization ; but my remarks will have relation to the subject of wages, hours and arbitration. In my opinion there has never beena time in the world's history when arbitration was as much needed as at present. We have been told that rationalization will solve the world's economic problems, but, I deny this. I remember reading years ago a noble speech which Lord Byron delivered in the House of Lords against the persecution of the Luddites, when, between the years 1811 and 1816, they revolted against rationalization. From that speech I make the following quotation :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">Bationalization, like most theories, is best judged by results. What is meant by rationalization ? I think I define it fairly as any scheme which secures the maximum production of goods with the minimum amount of labour. This, it is argued, will so cheapen the cost of the goods produced that British manufacturers will be able to undercut any competitor in the world's markets and thus secure more employment for British. workers. This is the theory advanced by all advanced employers of labour in Britain, Germany, Poland, France, America, and, indeed, in every country where there is already a surplus of goods. In the ship-building industry in England the inventor and the new system of costing have succeeded in adding 100 per cent. to the efficiency of the individual. A revolution has thus been effected in this industry compared even with 1914. To-day, a liner is built in less time than it took formerly to build a trawler. Two men to-day are able to place a given steel weight on a ship in less time than 30 men formerly took to do it. New methods have displaced riveters. The hydraulic machine and the pneumatic gun worked by two apprentices, will crush red-hot rivets into place in a tenth of the time required by the hand hammer; the caulking machine and the acetylene burner have also revolutionized the work of cutting and caulking and cutting the steel plates. But perhaps the greatest revolution of all is in the method of templating. In one afternoon more templating is done than was formerly done in three weeks. Professor C. Delisle Burns made the following statement on the 25th January, 1930 : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In the Clyde engineering and ship-building trades, the same production as in 1914 can now be obtained with only about 60 per cent. of the labour. There was an indication of the new situation when an engine was placed in a ship in one afternoon which it would have taken three weeks and perhaps six times the number of men to place in a ship in 1914. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">But what does the workman, as an individual, get from his power to increase production? If he is a piece-worker, he is supplied with a machine which allows him to double his output in a working day. In that case if, say,1s. per foot was required to earn 10s. per day by hand, he can now obviously earn 10s. if he only receives 6d. per foot; and so he receives 6d. per foot. The value of his increased production has all gone into the pocket of some one else, and although all economists tell him that he has cheapened the cost of the ships and thus reduced the cost of carrying his food and clothes, he is still unconvinced, for his grocery and clothing bills are actually higher than in the days before he began to reduce the price of ships. But if the individual gets nothing as a result of increased production, there is still the hope that the mass may benefit. A study of the tonnage figures will make this clear, and it will also help us to judge the soundness of the contention that cheapness provides additional employment. The way in which this theory actually works out in practice is shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Hill in the February number of the <inline font-style="italic">Boilermakers Society Journal.</inline> He says - </para>

                        <para>We do get the annual output in ships and here wefind an increase of work and a diminution of men employed. In 1921 the tonnage of new ships built was about the same as in the year 1929, yet the number of men employed was much less last year than in 1921. The figures are- - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>From these figures it will be noted that with an increased output last year of over 22,000 tons we had 72,000 less men employed. Our output per man is increasing year by year and as a consequence every one is being squeezed out except the strongest and most efficient. In 1921 the registered number of men in the ship-building and ship-repairing industry was 358,278. In 1929 the number had dropped to 204,613. Thus, in the last eight years 154,337 men in this one industry have died or have been eliminated by rationalization. At this rate in another ten years we shall be able to further increase our output without human labour. This is a bit of the rationalization which we are told is going to solve the problem of unemployment. </para>
                    <para class="block">And so one could go on, and point out that in other industries such as the cotton, the woollen, and the engineering industries, the same thing is happening. The lesson to be learned is that, so long as capitalism exists, rationalization means a further degradation of the worker in industry. While thousands of men in Great Britain are going about poorly clad, the consumption of woollen goods has dropped 40 per cent., as compared with thepre-war consumption. In its annual review of 1928, the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> Trade Supplement stated - </para>

                    <para class="block">The only remedy suggested by employers is more rationalization, or  less  purchasing power. On every hand we hear the cry-" The worker must not expect more from industry than he puts into it." </para>
                    <para class="block">What has been the effect of rationalization in. the iron and steel industry? The experience of the workers in that industry shows the necessity for a- properly established Arbitration Court in .order that Australian workmen may receive fair treatment. In 1920 each, man employed in the pig-iron industry in England produced 199 tons of metal. By 192S the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> production had increased to 298 tons. In 1920, 40,250 men were employed in this branch of the "engineering industry, but that number had dwindled to 22,160 by 1928. In other words, over 20,000 men who formerly found employment in the iron and steel industry produced so much steel that nobody needs them any longer, and now they are enjoying England's incomparable system of social services- - they are receiving the dole. </para>
                    <para>Now let us see how the increased output has improved the workers' wages. Again let me repeat the parrot cry - "Workers must not expect more from ari industry than they put' into it." That has' been said so often in' this House that by this .time it must be true! Let us see what the steel-worker receives and has received. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Baker, a member of the House of Commons, stated recently that every steel-worker to-day is 20,000 per cent, more efficient than' was the steelworker of 1873. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker</inline> said-  " In 1873, in all probability the average wage for blast furnace men would be between 25s. to 308. a week. An elaborate return for South Wales for 1923 gives an average of about £2 19s. per week, and in 1929 about £3. In a period in which the efficiency of men had increased over 20,000 per cent., the wages had only doubled." </para>
                    <para class="block">This wage of £3 per week is a terrible commentary on our whole social system, and our hopelessly wrong ideas of social value. The steel-worker who is engaged on heavy, arduous, and skilled work, which keeps him in a bath of sweat for long hours each day, receives only £3 per week. To-day the British worker is told that he is poor because the capacity of the average French furnace is 30 per cent, greater than that of the British furnace; that Belgium's average furnace capacity is 37 per cent, greater; Germany's 129 per cent, greater; and that of the United States of America 276 per cent, greater. Great Britain's problem  now  is' how to make her men more efficient than the American. . Obviously,  it  would be  useless  to  increase his efficiency the bare 276 per cent."; it must  be  brought, to at least one point higher than the American  or  he would be  no  further forward. How many years  .it  would, take to obtain that result, nobody has yet attempted  to  estimate, even  assuming  that  America  stood and waited until Britain caught her up. The passing  of  this legislation will do much  to  promote peace in industry. It will,  at  least, give . the workers an opportunity  to  obtain decent conditions in their employment. I congratulate the Government  on  having brought the bill forward, and shall give it my support. </para>

                        <para>.- While many honorable members on the Government side have shown evidence of a detailed knowledge of trade union matters and arbitration, law as it affects trade unions, there has been little or no attempt on their part to examine closely the proposals submitted and to convince honorable members . of the 'Opposition that the amendments proposed in this bill for amending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are justifiable or in the best interests of Australia. It is true that the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> E. Riley) put forward a constructive proposal which apparently was given some attention by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan).</inline><inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed ]</inline> The honorable member made a suggestion that the best kind ' of arbitration tribunal would be one comprising a judge, a representative of the employers and a representative of the employees. I was particularly interested in the suggestion because it appeared to me to be a means of making the Federal Arbitration Court in its make-up and in its working, approach more closely the wages board system than has hitherto been attempted. I hold strongly the view that the State wages board system, as operating in Victoria, is a much sounder method of determining industrial conditions than is possible under the federal system, so long as the latter is confined in the constitutional strait-jacket in which it finds itself to-day. And I do not believe the  people of Australia are prepared to increase the powers of the Commonwealth in respect to industrial matters; at any rate it does not look as if the Government thinks the people will do so, if one is to judge by the indefinite postponement of the referendum proposals. Whatever chance there might have been to obtain from the people greater powers in industrial matters, that chance has been greatly lessened by the introduction of a bill so obviously biased as this. I think it is a fair assumption that the shackles will remain on our constitutional authority with regard to industrial affairs. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that long before I have finished the Attorney-General will have realized the truth of my charge that the bill is biased. The shackles which have been imposed by the Constitution upon federal powers in connexion with industry are likely to remain, and as a result the Federal Arbitration Court, even though the legislation under which it functions is amended in various ways, will be unable to do many things which wages boards may readily do. I do not condemn the federal system simply because it is a federal system; neither do I extol the Victorian State wages board system simply because it is a State system. I am not what is known as a great States-righter, but I take up this attitude because the State wages boards have behind them a complete charter of powers which enables them to do their job completely, whereas the federal arbitration system has a most incomplete charter under which it cannot deal satisfactorily with all the troubles that arise in industrial matters. </para>

                    <para>I want to contrast the two systems. A State Wages Board is in a position to make a common rule; it can lay down the wage to be paid to all plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and so forth in the State; whereas it is generally recognized that the Federal Arbitration Court is onlyable to make its awards apply to those individuals, unions, or employers who have been cited before it. Sometimes, in one town, three factories engaged in the same class of manufacture may be working, one under an arbitration award, another under a variation of that award to which the first is not subject, and a third, which has started business after the award and variation have been made, subject to neither. One can readily imagine a great deal of dissatisfaction being caused when a position of that kind arises. It cannot arise under awards laid down by State Wages Boards. These boards can operate without the necessity for a dispute, whether it be real or manufactured, whereas the Federal Arbitration Court can only operate when a dispute has occurred, either a bona fide dispute in the ordinary acceptance of the term, or a paper dispute manufactured for the purpose of getting access to the. court, and it must have occurred in more than one State. Through the machinery of State Wages Boards an award can be obtained at very much less expense or delay than is possible when the federal machinery is invoked. Under the State wages board system fair conditions can be secured without all the waste of time, energy, and money involved in an endeavour to secure an award from the Federal Arbitration Court. Honorable members on both sides of the House know of the enormous sums of money that have to be expended by trade unions in an endeavour to secure certain awards, or sometimes by employers in an endeavour to resist the efforts of the unions to obtain those awards. No one will gainsay that satisfactory conditions of labour can be obtained with the simple State machinery of wages boards without involving a tremendous loss of time and expense. If all the time, talent, money, and energy which are to-day devoted to fighting for and resisting attempts to. obtain awards in the federal sphere were devoted to bringing about greater production in the industries themselves, this country would soon lead the world, and be an exporter of manufactured articles, instead of having to confine its production of them to the limited and sheltered market of Australia. </para>

I am simply using this as an argument to show honorable members that the State wages board system is preferable; that it is sounder than the federal arbitration system, working as the latter does under constitutional shackles. </para>

                    <para>To my mind, the most important difference between the State wage3 board system and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is that, under the former, there is an impartial chairman Avith representatives of employers on one side of the table and an equal number of representatives of employees on the other side. The representatives of the employers and those of the employees deal with each other. The representatives of the employers are able to realize the grievances of the men, and the latter can be made to see that the employers have their difficulties. The impartial chairman has a casting vote if the position should reach a deadlock. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but there is always the suspicion, particularly in a measure couched like this one, that the persona appointed as conciliation commissioners may be men who, with the best intentions in the world, have been brought up in an atmosphere which sees only one side of a case. Under the State wages board system the employers and employees can deal directly with each other, whereas under the federal system they arc compelled to go into opposing camps and deal, not with each other, but with a third party, a judge, a gentleman of high standing, trained in the law, but in many cases, ignorant of much of the technique of the industry in connexion with which he is asked to make an award. The result is that awards are sometimes brought: down which are difficult for either the employer or the employee. There may be in them harassing conditions to the employer or to the employee. </para>

                    <para class="block">One illustration of  that  which comes to my mind is the condition which was laid down in connexion with pick-ups in a recent dispute. No doubt that was a condition which was irritating to the employee. I can hardly recall an instance of a strike occurring in connexion with a wages board determination, due, I think, to the fact that every such determination is arrived at by men who understand all there is to know about the technicalities of the industry concerned. Any body made up of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees must come to a decision which is reasonable, practicable and workable. </para>
                    <para>Many attempts have been made to improve our arbitration system. The first step taken was to ask the people for additional powers. That has been done on no less than four occasions, and on no less than four occasions the people have said "No". Yet without the power which is necessary to make a federal arbitration system simple and successful we cling to a- discredited system, and again and again have attempted, by amending the legislation within our narrow constitutional limits, to attain the unattainable. The most notable attempt to amend, in a comprehensive manner, our arbitration legislation, was that which was made in 1928. On that occasion we approached very closely the highwater mark of constructive amending legislation in this field. The only mistake we made on that occasion was by retaining - I stress the word "retaining" and do not use the word "imposing" - penalties for strikes and lockouts. There are, no doubt, good theoretical reasons why these penalties should be retained. Some years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs said - "If parties are compelled by law to resort to law, it necessarily connotes that, they cannot lawfully resort to force." No one disputes the logic and theoretical soundness of that dictum, but many of us have been forced to the conclusion that penalties in connexion with strikes and lockouts are absolutely futile. It is impossible to make men work by imposing penalties on them.- It is equally impossible to compel employers to open their factories or mines by imposing penalties on them. In my opinion, therefore, the bill of 192S would have been improved by the deletion of the penalties in connexion with strikes and lockouts. I want to make it abundantly clear that what I say with regard to penalties applies only to penalties dealing with strikes and lockouts. It does not embrace the deletion of some of the penalties that have been withdrawn in a later part of the bill, when they should have been left in the act. Had the present Government confined itself to amending the 1928 bill by merely deleting the penalties with regard to strikes and lockouts I should have said that the highwater mark of constructive legislation had been reached in this bill. But one does not need to go very far through the measure to realize that that high level is rapidly falling. I believe that if the. bill as it stands to-day is passed into law we shall soon reach the lowest level of arbitration legislation yet seen in this country. </para>
                    <para>I propose briefly to review the principal amendments, a procedure that very few honorable members of the Government side have troubled to follow. I have already stated that I agree with the amendment that involves the withdrawal of the penalties in connexion with' strikes. and lockouts. But I concur with what was said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> that it would be wise if these penalties still applied to what may be regarded as essential industries, so that, those engaged in . them may not be encouraged to hold the community to ransom owing to the absence of the penalties. </para>
                    <para>The second point that I desire to 'make is that the conciliation commissioners under this bill are to have  extraordinarily  wide powers, powers very little inferior to those of the judges themselves. Special qualifications apparently are not regarded as necessary; yet these gentlemen are to fill the role of conciliation  com-missioners,  a position requiring the strictest impartiality. To be appointed an arbitration judge, a. man must have very definite qualifications. He must have been a barrister or a solicitor of the High Court of the Commonwealth, or a State Supreme Court for at least five years. So that he must b«; a man of some standing. Again, his appointment is of a 'permanent nature, which makes him more or less  independent  of criticism. While I am quite willing to admit that a legal training does not necessarily make a man the best that can be obtained to deal with purely industrial matters, it at least enables him to realize that there are two sides to every question. A man trained in the legal world realizes that evidence must be called from both parties, and that there are two sides to every question. Contrast that with the position of these commissioners. They are not required to have any special qualifications, at any rate substantial qualifications that can be written  down  in black and white, but I realize that any government that wished .to make the bill workable would endeavour ,to appoint commissioners who had. alt least some qualification, even though those qualifications could not be reduced to writing, as in the case of arbitration court judges. The appointment of the  commissioners  may be for a limited period. I know that it will be .said by- the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> that that has been the practice in the past; that the former conciliation commissioner was- appointed for a limited period.. It is safe enough to do that kind of  thing when a commissioner is entrusted with limited powers such ' . as: were granted to the former commissioner, but it is entirely a different matter when, the status' of the commissioner is to be raised practically to the level of that of the arbitration judges. In one respect; the commissioners, arid indeed, the judges  too, are to have considerably greater powers than were formerly exercised by the judges alone. I refer t'o the. amend; ment to section 3S of the' principal by the addition of new paragraph <inline font-style="italic">oa</inline> giving the judges and conciliation commissioners alike power to " set aside an award or any of the terms of an award." It appears to me that a provision of that nature will mean that finality will very rarely be reached. Awards will be  more  or less always in a state of flux, a condition dear to some official hearts, but a very bad thing for industry. </para>
                    <para>Another thing that I desire to emphasize in connexion with the appointment of these commissioners is that :i conciliation commissioner may, under the  powers granted to him by this bill, do what it will take three judges to undo, or undo something that it has taken three judges to do. A commissioner may reduce hours, but it takes three judges to increase them. Also a commissioner may, on his own initiative, increase wages ; but it takes three judges to reduce them. Formerly there was a magnificent impartiality about our industrial legislation - an honest attempt to treat both sides alike and to put the position of the employer and employee on exactly the same footing with regard to penalties and everything else mentioned in the act. That satisfactory state of affairs has disappeared. The bill is now heavily loaded against the employer. That is one of the arguments that I advance to the Attorney-General in support of my contention that the measure shows a definite bias. </para>
                    <para>A commissioner "may do many things. One can speculate as to how his powers are going to be used. Take, for example, section 40 of the principal act, which is amended by clause 31 of the bill.  It  reads - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is proposed to delete the words " other things being equal". That may result in a judge or a conciliation commissioner awarding absolute preference to unionists, regardless of their capacity or incapacity. To give a concrete illustration, we will assume that a pastoralist wished to have his sheep shorn andwas engaging men to do the work. Along came a unionist able to shear 80 to 90 sheep a day and a non-unionist, a capable man able to machine shear 200 sheep a day. The pastoralist had this protection, that even if the judge had awarded absolute preference in the industry the four words " other things being equal " afforded him a safeguard and enabled him, if unable to obtain efficient union labour, to employ efficient non-union labour in its stead. That protection is taken away by the dele tion of those four words, and it may mean that absolute preference has to be granted, regardless of capacity or incapacity. Under this clause a zealous conciliation commissioner might compel absolute preference to unionists, whether capable men were available or not. It puts a tremendous power in the hands of ambitious secretaries if a man's only chance of obtaining a job is through the medium of a union secretary. I wish to say at this stage that I believe that union secretaries are no worse than any other people. That may be of some satisfaction to the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keane)</inline> who valiantly fought for the trade union secretary, his integrity and so forth. But I think that even the honorable  member  for Bendigo will admit that among union secretaries there are men who would not scruple to profit by the absolute dependence of their members upon them to provide employment. Again - and I put this question to the Attorney-General in the hope that it will elicit a reply from him, perhaps at a later stage - could not this power to grant absolute preference to trade unionists by the exclusion of those four words be used as a backstairs method of defeating preference to returned soldiers ? </para>

                            <para>- I merely ask the question. Another very bad and inexcusable feature of the bill is what is, in my opinion, the craven acceptance of the decree of officialdom that the secret ballot must go. Wrap that up as you will in all the sugar coating of ingenious sophistry", yet the plain fact cannot be concealed that this will take away the undoubted right of the trade unionist to claim a fair share in the control of his union without a possibility of victimization. I know that honorable members opposite will say that trade union rules to-day provide for secret ballots to be taken, that secret ballots are taken, and so forth. But it must be admitted that there are occasions when a man, if he were to ask for a secret ballot to be taken, would subject himself to victimization. It is because of that that the Bruce-Page Government included in the 1928 amendment of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act the provision relating to secret ballots. </para>

That was done to protect the union just as much as to protect the unionist. </para>

What will the fair-minded trade unionist say in connexion with the deletion of the secret ballot provision contained in the 1928 amendment? Is it evidence of the great natural law of self-preservation among trade union officials who have reason to fear a silent vote? Might that silent vote result in condemnation of their official policy? Is it too great a risk to be taken? Truly, judging by the deletion of that safeguard from the act, the Bumbledom of Dickens' day is as nothing compared with the modern officialdom of Australian trade unionism. </para>

                    <para>We have heard a good deal from honorable members on the Government side and their Ministers asto the mandate that they have in. connexion with federal arbitration. I agree that they have a mandate to continue federal arbitration. But have they any mandate from the rank and file of trade unionism to take out of the bill provisions designed to give unionists -an opportunity to obtain a secret ballot? Are the rank and file of trade unions not to be trusted to use the secret ballot properly? It makes one ask if this is really a democratic country. I wonder if the Attorney-General is really proud of this particular amendment. Is he willing to father it? Will he loudly proclaim it all over the country or remain discreetly silent on that particular part of the amending bill, while dilating the while at considerable length on other sections of the measure? </para>

                            <para>- It is an action that would make any decent, fair-minded Labour man ashamed of his party and of his Government that has so meekly submitted to the dictation of union officials. I hope that the trade unionists all over Australia will realize what is being done, will grasp its significance, and understand that steps are being taken to withdraw from them the measure of control of their own unions that was their right. Such an action is the very antithesis of democratic government; it is the last word in abject craven submission to trade union bureaucracy in its most high-handed, intolerant, and tyrannical mood. If the Government values the respect of the rank and file of trade unionists it will, even at the eleventh hour, repent of its mistake and leave that provision in the act. </para>

                    <para>We have seen an announcement in the press stating that the Amending Arbitration Bill now before your honorable House proposes to re-enact clause61 of the original act, which provided that no member of any federally registered trade union could resign or be discharged from his union whilst the organization had any plaint before the Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para class="block">But whether this provision is of advantage or not, I suggest to the Minister for Home Affairs that the deletion of it causes a certain amount of suspicion and distrust. </para>
                        <para>By another provision of the bill the Arbitration Court is to supersede the High Court in respect of some functions which the latter tribunal has exercized in the past; the Arbitration Court is to decide for itself whether a dispute is interstate, whereas hitherto that matter has been decided for it by the High Court. </para>
                        <para>One of the most amazing proposals in the bill, particularly at a time of great economic depression and unparalleled unemployment, is the amendment deleting the words which require the judge, when making an award, to take into consideration its probable economic effect. Australia is already suffering because too little attention has been given to economic facts; but, apparently, still less attention is to be given to them if the judges are to interpret the amendment as a deliberate instruction to them. The honorable member for Bendigo endeavoured to justify this course by saying that the omission of the instruction would make no difference; that arbitration judges had always paid some regard to economic facts, and under this bill the arbitration judge or conciliation commissioners would continue to do so; therefore, a definite instruction was not needed. Had the honorable member been in this House when the amending bill was under discussion in 1928, that argument might very well have been employed by him as a valid reason why, in his opinion, an instruction to judges was not necessary, but it is useless as an argument in favour of the deletion of that instruction. The judges and conciliation commissioners will ask why this provision has been taken out, and they will naturally conclude that it is a deliberate instruction to them to ignore entirely the possible economic effects of their awards. Australia is suffering from arrested development. Why? In the sphere of rural development, particularly pastoral and agricultural, great improvements are left undone because the cost of doing them is more than they are worth. Neither the primary nor the secondary industries are expanding as they should because we are attempting to ignore the competition of the world. Yet at this time of unparalleled depression and economic difficulties, the Government is, in this bill, instructing the judges and the conciliation commissioners to push their heads still more deeply into the sand. In this way we shall never find employment for our people or develop our country. </para>

                                <para>- It is a logically sound deduction from the facts. Despite the sufferings of the unemployed, the Government still clings tenaciously to the old dictum that if an industry cannot afford an impossible standard of working conditions the wiser course is to close it down. We shall not increase the avenues of employment in that way. I believe in the highest wages that an industry can bear. But we cannot take more out of a pot than is put into it, and the industrial and financial condition of the country will not be improved if judges and commissioners, acting on the instruction of the Government, deliver awards that disregard economic facts. I appeal to the Government to discard this fetish and face realities. </para>

I hope that the Government will, even now, put those words back into the bill, otherwise it will be impossible to place on its purpose any interpretation other than the one which I have given to-night. If the bill is passed in its present form it will aggravate the problem ofunemployment and augment the number of unemployed. </para>

                        <para>In conclusion, I wish to say that apart from one amendment which I mentioned earlier in my remarks, namely, the amendment repealing the penalties in regard to strikes and lockouts, I regard this measure as a retrograde step in legislation. I consider some of its provisions as so dangerous and so biased that, instead of promoting peace in industry, it may work great havoc, and possibly even destroy the system it was designed to further develop. There is little or nothing in the bill to justify its title or its claim to promote goodwill in industry. Unless it is drastically amended, I shall certainly oppose it as a biased, mischief - making measure, unfair to trade unionists and employer alike, and introduced almost solely in the interest of trade union officials. </para>

                            <para>.- In speaking in support of this bill, I wish to emphasize that I shall not attempt to discuss it from a legal standpoint, or from the point of view of a trade union official, but from the standpoint of a man who has workedin industry for the whole of his life, and is familiar with the effect of the Arbitration Court awards upon the rank and file. Conversant as I am with the industrial life of the Commonwealth, it, is amusing to me to listen to the yes-no utterances of honorable members opposite and to contrast what they are saying now, in criticism of this bill, with their remarks only a few months ago when they supported a government that did its utmost to kill all attempts at con ciliation and arbitration by endeavouring to pass the iniquitous Maritime Industries Bill, which wrecked the Government. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> and one or two other honorable members opposite, say now that they are in accord with the wish of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> to delete certain penal provisions from the act. Why did not they take this stand when the Labour party was protesting against the attempt of the Bruce-Page Government to penalize a large number of men and women engaged in industry? Instead, they applauded the Government for its action, and when finally there was an appeal to the people, the election was fought on this issue. The electors returned the Labour party to power, and this. Government, in furtherance of its declared industrial policy, has introduced ' this measure to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act with the object of ensuring to employees improved conditions to which they are fully entitled. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Gippsland a few moments ago made a point of a judge of the Arbitration Court, in making an award, having to pay due regard to its economic effect. I have no wish to make an attack upon any individual judge of the Arbitration Court, nor is it my desire to speak disrespectfully of the judiciary.; but  1  direct the attention of the honorable member for Gippsland, and the attention of other honorable members, to the fact that not long ago one of the judges of the Arbitration Court made one of the most vicious, cruel, and cowardly awards ever delivered in this country. I refer to the award relating to timber workers made last year. </para>

                                <para>- I bow to your ruling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> I contend, however, that I am in order in referring to the effect of an award upon the industries of this country, and I mention particularly the timber-workers' award, which was responsible for a reduction in wages from 4s. to 26s. a week per individual, and an increase of four hours in the working week. If honorable members opposite believe that this is the way to bring about peace in industry, then this Government and its supporters want none of it. </para>

                        <para>The bill provides for the appointment of conciliation commissioners, who by reason of their knowledge of conditions in a particular industry will be competent to deal with any dispute that may arise. In this way it should be possible to ensure some measure of industrial peace. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> emphasized the fact that it was proposed to delete from the act the words requiring Arbitration Court judges to pay due regard to the economic effect of all awards upon industries. To show that this is not worth a second thought I direct the attention of honorable members to certain information contained in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh</inline> relating to the secondary industries of Australia for the years 1925-26 and 1926-27. In 1925-26 the total value of the output of the manufacturing industries in Australia was £400,342,392; the wages paid to employees in those industries amounted to £S6,724,683, leaving a balance of £313,617,103 to be received by someone, and the average wage paid to each individual was £227 10s. In 1927-28 the total value of the output was £416,994,009 ; the salaries and wages paid amounted to £91,365,319, leaving a balance of £325,628,690 and the average wage paid per employee was £205 10s. Thus it will be seen that during these two periods wealth production increased by £16,651,616, and the wages paid during the same period increased by only £4,640,636; but it must be borne in mind that the actual individual wage paid per annum showed a decrease from £227 10s. to £205 10s. It has to be remembered also that of the total number of employees engaged 22,565 were children of both sexes, so the need for protective legislation is apparent. </para>

                                <para>- Some honorable members opposite have suggested there is no need for our arbitration system and no need for governmental control in industrial matters. I need  only  remind them of the situation in the early '90's . when the law of supply and demand was operative. Being then without the protection now afforded by our Conciliation and Arbitration Act the workers were forced to accept practically anything that would never lift them above the breadline. It is true that we have at present a. huge army of unemployed in Australia, but the sam,3 conditions obtain in practically all civilized countries, so it cannot be urged that the Commonwealth Labour Government or our system of arbitration is responsible for Australia's present economic and financial difficulties. Other factors have to be taken into account. No one suggests that we shall be able to check the  evolutionary  march of science, and the application of scientific methods to production. At the present time machinery is coming in at the front door and man-power is going out at the back, and, unfortunately, there is no redress for workers who are supplanted in any particular industry. I am a practical boilermaker, only two years removed from the industry. When I followed that avocation, two boilermakers, a labourer, and a rivet boy were required to rivet the end in a boiler. Today that work is done by one man working a pneumatic hammer with one man inside holding up the rivets and a rivet boy heating rivets. Under modern conditions these  two  men and a boy can do three times the work formerly done by two boilermakers, a labourer and rivet boy. It follows therefore that a considerable number of men in that industry are today unemployed. They reap no benefit from the application of scientific methods to production. Practically all men engaged in that particular occupation are suffering from the reactionary effects of scientific machinery, being affected with nerves or deafness. No one can deny that one of the results of the application of scientific methods to production is the need for a universal shorter working week in all secondary industries, and it should bo mandatory from the court. </para>

Let us come together in a conciliatory spirit and see if it is not possible to reach a common understanding about our economic problems. If we cannot agree, then let us agree to differ. Let us cease vilifying one another and making all sorts of innuendoes concerning men who spend their lives working in the industries of the country. Any man who belittles the attempt by this Government to give some measure of protection to employees through an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has little or no understanding on the subject. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> referred to State wages boards, but with great respect I must differ from the conclusions he drew. I have no quarrel with the honorable member for Gippsland, and apart from his politics, I regard him as a friend. I recognize that he holds views of his own, just as I do myself. I cannot agree with him that conditions are any better under State wages boards than under the Federal Arbitration Court. I have been unable to learn of any State which is free from industrial discontent. The conditions of the workers under wages boards are not better than under the Arbitration Court; in fact, in wages board States they are worse. The honorable member for Gippsland said that with the Federal Arbitra- tion Court in existence there was interlocking and overlapping of awards. I agree with him, but point out that that constitutes one of the soundest arguments in favour of the abolition of State industrial courts in favour of a Federal court with jurisdiction from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. </para>

                                <para>- Well, I still regard that as a reason for getting rid of the State courts. Under the present system there is a 48-hour week in some States, and a 44-hour week in others. If industry is to progress on a sound basis in all parts of the Commonwealth, it should be governed by uniform legislation. As things now are the industrial courts of the different States are pulling against one another. Members of the Opposition pray that the Federal Arbitration Court will never bc in complete judicial control of industrial affairs throughout the whole of Australia, because when that day comes the workers will be able to apply to the court with the confident expectation of getting a fair deal, something which honorable members opposite would like very much to deny them. </para>

                        <para>The time has arrived when something must be done to substitute beneficial industrial legislation for a system which has led only to costly litigation. The trade unions have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds fighting for awards, and there is still discontent in the ranks of the workers, and rightly so. They are discontented, not with the principle of arbitration, but with the manner in which it has been applied during the last few years. I received a letter from the Tramways Union a few days ago pointing out - and I hope the Attorney-General will listen to this - that they have had an application before the court for over twelve months, and have been unable to get it heard, while the Chief Railway Commissioner of New South Wales, within one month of the lodging of his application, had his case dealt with, and the working week for the tramway men increased from  44  to  48  hours. Under a rationing system recently introduced, the members of my own organization are losing 26s. a week, but although they have lodged an application with the court they have not been able to get a hearing. These things are very naturally causing discontent. One of the great benefits which will follow from the appointment of conciliation commissioners will be the more expeditious despatch of business. I do not expect that this bill will result in the workers getting everything they are entitled to, but it will, at any rate, remove many of the anomalies from which they are suffering to-day. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Gippsland referred to the proposed deletion of that section in the present act providing that any ten members of an organization may apply to the court for an order requiring that a secret ballot of members be taken. He mentioned the word "democracy", and said that this was a democratic country. </para>

                                <para>- I have said that it is by secret ballot, and I mean it. Reference has been made to one trade union which has objected to the deletion of the section referring to the holding of secret ballots. There are  149  unions registered with the Federal Arbitration Court, and it is certainly significant that out of that number only one has been found to support the retention of this section. I was at Eveleigh workshops during the  1917  strike, when this union came into being. A scab organization from the start, it grew by stealing members from other organizations which were on strike fighting for their rights. </para>

                        <para>Earlier in my speech you checked me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> when I was referring to members of the judiciary. I may be permitted, however, to say something of the salaries which are paid to judges of the Federal Arbitration Court. The workers all over Australia are being asked at the present time to make sacrifices by accepting less pay and working longer hours, but one judge of the Arbitration Court receives £3,000 a year, and two others £2,500 a year each, besides being entitled to retiring allowances after a certain, period of service. The workers are asking, not without reason, why the judges are not required to make some sacrifice when they themselves are made to feel the economic pinch so keenly. I am aware that there is nothing in this bill providing for a reduction of judges' salaries, but the matter seems to me to be worthy of attention. </para>

                                <para>- It is. hard to believe that the professional fees which they received when practising their profession totalled in one year more than they now receive as judges. I do not think for a moment that in accepting their present positions they ma.de any sacrifice. With all respect to these judges I may repeat what wa3 said previously- they may be qualified but not competent to deal with industrial conditions. Whatever they are receiving does not alter the fact that at present they have to keep in view the economic effect of awards upon industry. It would be interesting to know to what extent economic conditions were considered when their salaries were fixed. The only time when the economic effect of an award upon industry is taken into consideration is when the wages of men and women engaged in industry are concerned. It is time we had progressive industrial legislation, embodying more conciliation in the settlement of our industrial problems. I do not quarrel with those who are endeavouring to get a fair return for what they may be doing in developing the industries of this country. During this debate unwarranted attacks have been made upon trade union officials. Any one would think from the remarks of some honorable members opposite that they are persons to be feared, but they know that the statements they have made are not in accordance with facts. They should remember that such persons are the paid officials of the rank and file. </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; and those who prate about their patriotism and loyalty should give a practical illustration of it when the workers of this country are involved. They should endeavour to make the conditions of labour the best possible, and to assist the men and women who are proving their patriotism by giving their lives to the building up of the industries of this country. I trust that when the measure reaches the committee stage honorable members opposite will not retard its progress but support the Government in placing it upon the statute-book. By doing so they will be assisting in giving the workers of this country better conditions than they have enjoyed in the past. If any honorable members opposite submit logical amendments which will be beneficial to the people to whom this measure is to apply, they will find that many  honorable members on this side of the chamber will be willing to support them; but if they are similar to many of the provisions  in  the act as it stood under the last Government they cannot expect our help. As the measure will prove of some benefit, to the workers of this country I sincerely trust that  it  will have a speedy passage. </para>

                    <para class="block">With the object of providing houses at low rentals in Canberra, the Government referred to the Public Works Committee the question of constructing groups of cottages. That committee has investigated and reported upon the erection of 30 semi-detached cottages at Manuka. The estimates provide for the building of 5-roomed cottages which should be made available at from 30s. to 33s. per week. Provision has also been made for the erection of four buildings, each containing three flats, which it is anticipated will be let at 25s. a week each. The estimated cost of the semi-detached buildings is £1,800; but when allowance is made for the erection of fences, construction of footpaths, provision of plantations and overhead charges, the cost will be approximately £1,985. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that phase of the question shortly. At present, a number of men receiving the basic wage or a little more are occupying cottages costing £2, £2 5s., and £2 10s. a week, and it is anticipated that a number of such persons will leave the higherpriced houses and occupy those which it is now proposed to erect and make available at lower rentals. There are also a number of persons occupying other cottages in the various areas who desire to rent houses of a better type, and it is thought that those to be constructed will meet the demand. It is proposed that the first group of eight pairs shall be built by day labour. The Government is not yet ready to call for tenders for the other groups, and it is desired that an early start should be made upon levelling the land on which they are to be built and also on the work of actual construction which would be. delayed if the work were simultaneously carried out bv day labour and under the contract system. One of the urgent needs of Canberra is the provision of cottages at low rentals for workers and their families.. Every £25 increase in the estimated cost will mean an additional ls. a week or £2 12s. a year in rent. In these circumstances, it will be recognized that every care will be exercised to have the cottages constructed at the lowest possible price in order to bring about a reduction of rentals. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murdoch,</inline> the late Director-General of Works, who also occupied the position of Second Commissioner on the Federal Capital Commission, is designing a cottage which it is anticipated will provide four rooms and a kitchen at a rental of 25s. a week. These cottages will be of the single brick type with studs and lining of a material to be determined upon. </para>

                        <para>.- Honorable members who have read the report of the Public Works Committee will acknowledge that they have rendered a useful service in investigating the proposal for the erection of cottages at Canberra. I am inclined to think that the Minister has not been quite candid with the House in stating that it is proposed to commence by building eight pairs of cottages on the day-labour system. Honorable members should realize that if this motion is carried the Minister will have complete authority to build all the 36 cottages by day labour. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the Minister's assurance ; but I did not understand him to say that that is what is proposed. I wish to emphasize the importance of carrying out the recommendations of the Public Works Committee, particularly when we realize the disabilities experienced by many public servants in having to pay high rentals for their homes. We know perfectly well that these high rents are being charged because of the high cost of construction. Probably all honorable members have not read the report, and do not realize that the price of bricks is principally responsible for the high cost of building at Canberra. </para>

                        <para>One of the contributing factors to the high cost of building in Canberra is the price charged for bricks. It is generally admitted that the Canberra brick is a very fine, high- class brick, but, owing to the shale from which it is manufactured containing a' large percentage of lime, the material must be carefully picked over, and what is called the "wet plastic process" of manufacture adopted which demands more coal in the burning, and is consequently more costly than the "dry press process" usually followed in Sydney and elsewhere where the raw material is suitable. </para>

                    <para>Two or three other paragraphs in the report contain a wealth of information which accounts, to some extent at least, for the high cost of construction in Canberra. In this connexion I quote the following : - </para>

                        <para>Labour at the brick works is said to bc 17 per cent, higher than in Sydney, and the cost of cartage from the brick works is also high, being lis. per thousand per mile for the first mile and ls. 3d. per thousand per half-mile thereafter. </para>
                        <para>It was stated in evidence that the  cost  of preliminary investigations and experiments before the" brick works were established has been added to the capital cost of the plant which has a ledger value of £85,000. It is represented that this contributes to the higher cost of bricks, which, if the capital cost were to be written down to £55,000, which is stated to be a fair present-day valuation, the cost of production with the plant in full operation could bc reduced by approximately 3s.  6d.  per thousand. </para>

                    <para>The report goes on to say that the bricks for this work will be supplied at £4 16s. a 1,000, although the actual cost of them to the Commission is £5 5s. 7d. per 1,000. </para>

                            <para>- That is bo. A table which appears on page 6 of the report states that the average cost of bricks in 1929 was £10 ls. lOd. a 1,000, including interest and depreciation charges, although the cost was "reduced to £8 5s. 4d. a 1,000 for the last three months of 1929, duc to re-organization and reduction in management charges." I lay particular stress upon the wisdom of calling for tenders for the erection of some of these cottages, because bricks can be supplied from Sydney at £2 18s. 6d. per 3,000 plus freight, &amp;c. </para>

                    <para>It appears to me that sooner or later the Government will have to face the high cost of building construction and also the high cost of land in Canberra, for it is at a considerable disadvantage at present in having to pay large sums of money in cost of living allowances to public servants because of the high cost  of living here. According to the report the land upon which these cottages will be built will represent about £150 for each of the blocks for the two-storied semi-detached houses. I cannot for the life of me see why it is necessary to maintain these fictitious values. I realize that interest and redemption costs must be paid on the many miles of expensive roads, sewerage and lighting; but these modern conveniences were provided from the national rather than the civic necessity, and other provision should be made to share the cost. From a statement in the press I was led to believe that the Government proposed to proceed with the whole of this work by day labour, but the Minister's speech this evening has disarmed me to some extent. I emphasize, however, that day labour in Canberra has been expensive. This policy is discredited throughout the Commonwealth. It is somewhat surprising to find that, although Labour governments usually stand for the day labour policy in the expenditure of public moneys, the Ministers of those governments do not adopt it in their own private undertakings. </para>

                            <para>- This shows that they believe the contract system to be less costly. That is easily understandable, for even when we were boys we used to hear about " the government stroke." The trouble with the day-labour system is that there is associated with it a lack of proper supervision. In the circumstances, I do not propose to labour this question, but I feel strongly that the Government should not proceed with any of these cottages by day labour, but should, at the earliest possible moment, call for tenders for the work. If it does so, I am satisfied that the public officers who will occupy the houses when they are erected will reap the benefit. </para>

                        <para>. -  I also was led to believe that it was the intention of the Government to have all this work done by day labour, and I had intended to speak very strongly against the adoption of that policy. I think the Minister is justified, owing to the great need for houses here, in adopting the course which he has proposed. The members of the Public Works Committee visited many of the homes in Canberra, and it realizes that there are many structures here which are no credit to the city. It will be remembered that the estimated cost of Parliament House was £220,000. For many years the estimates of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murdoch,</inline> while he was the Commonwealth Director-General of Works, were sound. It is true that certain alterations were made in the plans and specifications of this building, particularly in the rear portion of it, which might have been expected to add £30,000 or £40,000 to. the cost of it ; but nobody ever dreamed that it would cost £660,000, particularly as all the glorious timbers in it were bought in 1913 and 1914, when prices were very much lower than after the war. The huge waste of money in connexion with the remodelling of Yarralumla House to convert it into a residence for the Governor-General was, perhaps, the greatest scandal that has occurred here. </para>

                            <para>- I am not reflecting upon honorable members opposite, but merely pointing to the fact. It is extraordinary that bricks cost £101s.10d. per 1,000 to produce here last year. I am aware, of course, that a comparatively small quantity was produced and that made the overhead cost high. But tiles cost £34 a 1,000 here, which is far beyond a reasonable price. The members of the Public Works Committee visited Yallourn in the course of their inquiry into the proposal to build these cottages, and inspected some very fine weatherboard homes there. We could not build the same type of home here; but I am sure, if the Minister would study the report of the committee, he would realize that we could, with advantage, adopt a cheaper type of construction in Canberra. </para>

                    <para class="block">Some of the buildings here are particularly good. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath,</inline> for instance, built his own home of special patented reinforced concrete, but the Federal Capital Commission refused to allow him to build any more homes of the same kind. I cannot understand this, for the man himself would have accepted the responsibility. If the dwellings were unfit for occupation they could have been condemned. But some stupid blunders have been made here and a great deal of money wasted. The houses in which some of the people here are living are an absolute disgrace, and fit only for slum areas. As honorable members are aware,' I have no attachment for Canberra, and I do not want to see too much money spent here; but I recognize that these houses are essential, and I hope that they will be erected quickly. I accept the Minister's assurance that he will call for tenders in the terms he outlined. We do not want poorly built houses here. </para>
                    <para>If the brick kilns could be put into operation under proper conditions it should be possible to reduce the price of bricks. When the Electricity Commission was operating the two brick kilns at Yallourn bricks were being produced at  £2  8s. 6d. a thousand. The kilns have since been leased to a private person and he is turning out bricks at  £4  0s. 3d. a thousand. The quantities required are not so large now as in the peak constructional period. The Yallourn bricks are carted for 8s. 6d. a thousand, whereas the charge here is lis. a thousand for the first mile and ls. 3d. a thousand per half-mile thereafter. Those figures are altogether too high. I hope that the Minister will do his best to bring the costs down to those which prevail in other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - I did not expect that we should be called upon to debate, on this motion, the relative merits of the day labour and contract systems; but a very good case could be made out in favour of day labour. " I am living at the Hotel Kurrajong, which was built by the contract system, and we all know how the work there was scamped. Many of the walls have had to be papered to hide the poor workmanship of the builders. Numerous alterations have been required in that building, and almost directly after the contractor had finished the job expense had to be incurred to correct faults. We well remember that certain foundations were put in, under contract, a hundred yards or so from this building for the first permanent administrative block, and the quantity of cement- used was cut down, * which increased the risk of putting a big building upon them. I thing the Government is acting wisely in building the first eight of these houses by day labour. I do not see why the whole lot of them should not be built by that method. </para>

                            <para>- We all know that supervision is the main thing. I agree with honorable members who have said that the cost of land here is too high. The Government acquired the land for about £4 per acre, and there does not seem to be any justification for charging such an extremely high price for it for residential purposes. It is also unfair that the price of bricks should be so high. We have two very expensive kilns and a large quantity of machinery .Which have been unproductive for many months. The overhead charges in these circumstances should not be added to the price of the bricks. It is true that the Canberra bricks are of excellent quality; but there is no need for them to be first-class for internal walls. We should be able to turn out seconds and thirds which would be suitable for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; and yet the bricks are covered with rough-cast and cement. These are good plastic bricks - almost face bricks - and there is no reason why they should be smothered with whitewash and cement, which only adds to the cost of construction. Tuckpointing would give a much neater job. I hope that the first eight of these cottages will be constructed at a cost which will justify the Minister in proceeding with the remainder of them by day labour. Let the Government pick its own men,  and if they do not suit, let others be employed. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to refer to a matter which, at first sight, may appear insignificant, but is, in fact, important in connexion with the building of homes. In Canberra the custom has grown up of having floors of polished hardwood or of some form of cement construction. Such floors are exceedingly dangerous. The floor in King's Hall is an example of the dangerous nature of such materials. </para>

                            <para>- Many of the floors in the hotels of Canberra are constructed of ironite, or some similar substance. They are so slippery and dangerous that already numerous accidents have taken place through people having slipped on them. When I first lived in Canberra, the rooms which I occupied had attached to them a balcony or verandah with a floor of ironite. The floor was so slippery that I scarcely used the balcony at all. Now I have a balcony with a wooden floor, which is so pleasant and safe that I use it frequently. I recognize that wooden floors involve more work in cleaning them; but I suggest that the authorities concerned should invite the opinion of the housewives of Canberra as to whether they would prefer their verandah floors, at least, to be of wood instead of hard, unfriendly and dangerous cement. If a person has a projecting nail in the heel of his shoe, he runs a risk of slipping and seriously injuring himself when walking over these cement floors. At the Hotel Canberra it has been found necessary to treat the cement surfaces with an acid preparation from time to time in order to make them safe to walk upon. The recommendation regarding the floors of these houses is - </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but then it loses its sanitary virtue. The rougher surface may be satisfactory from a sanitary point of view where it will be washed by rain or by water from a hose, but it is not satisfactory for use indoors. A wooden floor in a verandah is infinitely more comfortable than is one of cement. I do not like occupying the time of the House in discussing what may appear to be a minor detail of house construction; but in a house in which young children may run about, we should provide floors which are not dangerous. </para>

The bricks which are being placed in the new Presbyterian Church are the best I have ever seen. While I realize that nothing is too good for a church, such bricks are not necessary for inside walls. Realizing that because of the large expenditure already incurred we must go on with the development of this city, I support the motion. </para>

                        <para>. -  I wish to emphasize the remarks of the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> regarding the high cost of bricks in Canberra. He attributed that cost largely to the heavy capital expenditure incurred in connexion with the 'brickworks. It is not fair that the people who come to live here should be saddled with the total cost of those works, which I understand is about £86,000. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has shown how practically every building and public work undertaken in Canberra has cost more than was anticipated. That additional expenditure has been borne by the people of Australia as awhole in the form of taxation. Why then should bricks be singled out for different treatment? Why should the people of this city have to meet the excessive cost of the brick kilns, and also the heavy overhead expenses in connexion with them? The Government would do well to write down the capital cost of the brickworks to a figure which would enable bricks to be made and sold at areasonable price. The Minister said that many residents of Can berra in receipt of the basic wage, or a wage slightly above it, are paying from £2 to £2 5s. a week in rent. No man in receipt of the salary mentioned, should pay such an amount for the right to occupy a house. He cannot do so and have sufficient left to clothe and maintain his family properly. It has long been recognized that any person who pays more than 25 per cent. of his earnings in rent, pays an excessive amount. </para>

The Minister spoke also of the suggestion that while the outer walls should be of brick, to conform with building requirements, the inner walls might be stud-lined with some other material. I know of no better material for the purpose than celotex. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Celotex is among the good things with which Queensland has provided the Commonwealth. A wooden partition is far from satisfactory in a house, whereas celotex has the advantage of being almost soundproof and is also warm in winter. I hope the Minister will carry the idea further in his endeavour to obtain for. the workers of this capital and those men in the government service in receipt of little more than the basic wage, a type of cottage which will enable them after they have paid their rent to have sufficient to feed and clothe their children as they should be fed and clothed. </para>

Honorable members should view Canberra in a national spirit so that those who come after us will be proud to realize that their fathers had a better idea of Australia's future than some who are envious because the Federal Capital has not been established within the State they represent. </para>

                    <para>The bricks made in Canberra are, I understand, double-pressed and faced. A less pressed brick would not cost much less. I do not think it would represent a saving of more than £1 5s. a 1,000. A well pressed brick is essential for 41/2-inch. partitions, and nothing would therefore be gained by turning out a lower quality brick. In regard to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> about slippery verandah floors, concrete work makes a very much nicer exterior flooring than timber. It is also more hygienic and impervious to borers. </para>
                    <para>Complaint has been made about the price of land in Canberra. At the last auction sale 398 blocks were offered. Some were business blocks and some cottage sites. The upset price fixed by the Government totalled £13,500, but the price realized at auction was nearly £60,000. The Public Accounts Committee which inquired into the annual rental value of city blocks recommended 5 per cent. as a fair annual rental value. The difference between £13,500 and nearly £60,000 is what many of the tenants in the city have to pay. Those who have been responsible for the high cost of blocks are those persons who competed against one another to obtain business and cottage sites. When the Public Accounts Committee was inquiring into the re-appraisement period I secured information from Great Britain which showed that in most cases the reappraisement period there is 25 years. In Birmingham it is 35 years, and in the Duchy of Cornwall Estate, from which the Prince of Wales derives his revenues, it is 50 years. If certain conditions are complied  with  the lessees have the right of renewal. The Public Accounts Committee ascertained that the period was fixed at twenty years in Canberra because no one had any idea as to what the future of the Territory would be. </para>
                    <para> Nothing causes me to laugh more than statements frequently made about the number of bricks a bricklayer ought to lay. About twelve months ago I was interested in a contract in Brisbane. The contractor, a smart man, was quite satisfied when his bricklayers laid on an average 360 bricks a day. On a side wall with only one joint to strike they did 420 a day. When I was a boy  I  saw, in London <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> a cartoon, which I have never forgotten. Some men were engaged building a cottage when the owner came along and asked them when he was likely to be able to get into his home. One of the bricklayers replied, "I cannot tell you exactly because the boss is away. He has just gone down town to try to get another job. If he gets the job it won't be long ' before we finish here. But if he does not get it, I can't tell you when we are likely to finish." There is a good deal of stupidity in the talk of what bricklayers can do. Some bricks weigh 61/2 lbs., others weigh 9 lbs., and good black stuff weighs 10 lbs. Only a lunatic would expect a bricklayer to stoop down, pick up a 10-lb. brick, lay on the mortar, strike a joint and keep on doing that at the rate of 1,000 a day. </para>
                    <para>I should like all the cottages and buildings in the Territory to have brick or freestone fronts. There are very few cities in which the houses and buildings have what I call mud fronts - plaster on brick. Everybody in Canberra would have a brick house if he were afforded a reasonable opportunity to obtain it. Wooden buildings are uneconomical, and have to be painted continually to keep them presentable. I draw attention to the magnificent brick and freestone buildings in the cities, many erected by insurance companies, and particularly to that of the Australian Mutual Provident Company, one of the finest architectural structures in Australia. The Bank of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney also have very fine edifices, but I marvel at the architectural monstrosity erected by the New South Wales State Savings Bank Department. Although erected at tremendous cost, it is atrociously lighted. I do hope that the architects will ensure that these Canberra cottages will be well lighted. When you have plenty of light you have adequate ventilation. </para>
                    <para>I hope that these houses will be proceeded with as quickly as possible. Honorable members frequently refer to the high cost incurred in constructing the buildings originally erected in the Territory. They fail to realize the conditions that then existed. At the time plasterers, bricklayers,and other tradesmen were drawing £7 and £8 in our capital cities. Could it be expected that they would incur the heavy expense of coming to Canberra without demanding adequate compensation? Consequently, an additional inducement had to be offered to them, and that resulted in labour costs in Canberra being 25 per cent, higher than in the principal cities. The cost of construction was also inflated because of the high railway freights. </para>
                    <para>I hope that eventually we shall have a well-staffed Works Department, with highly-qualified tradesmen at its disposal. They will become permanent residents here, an acquisition to the business people and to the Territory itself. </para>

I suggest to the Minister that, as architects are being retrenched from the War Service Homes Commission, their services might well be utilized as clerks of works or in some other similar capacity in connexion with the erection of these cottages. I feel sure that my suggestion is conveyed to a receptive disposition, and that neither the Minister nor anybody else desires to see men who have been in the service of the department for a great number of ; years discharged at such a time as this, when they could do useful work in Canberra. </para>

                            <para>-- If it is trying both methods as an experiment I have nothing to criticize in that regard, but I desire to draw attention to the type of roofing material used. I am not asserting that either the works committee or the Government is responsible for it. It seems to me to be part of the bad tradition that has grown up in Canberra of building for ostentation, rather than for service. It is provided that these houses shall have tiled roofs. Tiled roofs in a climate such as this are unnecessary, except, perhaps, to afford a congenial outlook for the neighbour or for the tourist. Their utility amounts to about 10 per cent., and their ostentation to about 80 to 90 per cent. It is unfair to expect people earning little more than the basic wage to bear this additional charge entirely for ostentation. Approximately 90 per cent, of the people of Australia, whether in hot or cold climates, live comfortably under iron roofs. They are quite serviceable and much more economical than tiled roofs. An additional cost of £50 a cottage because of a tiled roof means more than ls. a week in rent to the occupant. I do not know the precise difference between the cost of an iron and a tiled roof, but I know that it must represent an appreciable extra amount in rent at the end of the year. I endorse the remarks of the honorable members for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> and East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> regarding stucco walls. Any honorable member who has travelled in other parts of the world must have been struck with the beauty and durability of brickwork even in climates much more severe than that of Canberra. One portion of the institution which I was privileged to attend was built of brick, and although it was 600 years old it was as solid as granite, and its appearance was as good as any stone I have seen. Canberra produces a magnificent brick but mainly for reasons of vulgar ostentation many of the brick cottages have been covered with stucco at additional cost. This is needless extravagance. I support the construction of the cottages at Manuka and hope that the Minister will be able to commence the work at an early date. </para>

                        <para>.- The writing down of housing costs in Canberra is at present under consideration. The Public Works Committee has suggested that the brickworks should be written down from £85,000 to £55,000 ; I am not sure that the reduction should not be even greater. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> rightly drew attention to a fact which must be taken into consideration when discussing the high cost of building in the early construction stage of Canberra.

                    <para>Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Hobart, during the period 1923 to 1927, were experiencing a building boom, with the result that when the construction of the Federal Capital was undertaken the demand for artisans was abnormal. The result was a foregone conclusion; a big job like the building of a city cannot be carried put efficiently and cheaply without expert tradesmen. The public servants who have been compulsorily transferred to Canberra should not be expected to pay for ever,1 interest on the- excessive cost of buildings erected during the initial stages of Canberra. I am informed that one group of cottages has been written down by £86,000, and that to bring them to present-day values a further £20,000 or £30,000 should be written off. The Government is now erecting cottages with greater and more comfortable accommodation, which can be rented at from 10s. to £1 a week less than older cottages situated within 100 yards of them. </para>

                            <para>- The experience of cottage construction at Canberra has shown that even the best qualified architects may err. An Australian-wide competition for a group of 100 cottages was held by the Commonwealth Government, and the competitive plans and specifications were adjudicated on by a committee of three of the foremost Australian architects. The prize was awarded, and the cottages were built in accordance with the winning plans and specifications. We have since found that they are not of a type suitable for Canberra, and we have developed a different and much improved cottage. The Canberra type is different from that of Melbourne and Sydney; a large living room is one of the essentials. Some of the best architects in Australia put on paper their ideas of what would be most suitable for this city, but, apparently, they were wrong. The residents of Canberra have discovered the type of comfortable home that they require, and the Government is providing it at a cost much below that of the earlier cottages. The motion before the House relates to cheap but commodious cottages having five rooms, kitchen, bathroom and all conveniences. The comfort of the housewife has been carefully considered by the designer. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> suggested that architects now being retrenched by the War Service Homes Commission should be taken over by the Works Department and employed as clerks of works. Unfortunately, the services of many architects who were employed by the Federal Capital Commission have been dispensed with. Honorable members will recognize that the first stage of the development of Canberra - the erection of Parliament House and office accommodation, and the making of roads, parks, and gardens - has been completed, with the result that whereas three years ago about 3,000 men were employed on the constructional programme, now comparatively few are employed. Most of those remaining are on the office staff, with the exception of the artisans engaged on cottage construction, which is the only work in progress in Canberra to-day. Therefore the staff necessary for present requirements is already in Canberra. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> advised the use of a cheaper roofing material than tiles. The wooden cottages at Reid are roofed with iron, but I think that in the brick areas tile roofs are to be preferred. We hope to be able to evolve a brick cottage with tiled roof that can be rented at 25s. a week. The cottages at Manuka will have an attractive elevation, plenty of space at the rear for gardening, and many other desirable features. </para>

He has informed me that on the back of the application form which is used when applying for a commission are the following words in brackets : - (Applicants must come up to an educational standard of a university, or Melbourne intermediate examination, and be between the ages of 18 and 20 years, and unmarried). </para>

                        <para>. - This afternoon I asked the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> a number of questions concerning the working and purpose of the Borstal Institute in England. I asked him particularly if inmates of the institution referred to were sent to Australia, and if so would he endeavour to prevent this class of migrant from coming to the Commonwealth. In his reply the Minister said he had no detailed knowledge, but understood that endeavours were made by the Borstal Institute to effect reform in young offenders sent to it from the courts ; also that inmates of the institute had not, since the inception of the joint Commonwealth and State migration scheme in 1921, been brought to Australia as assisted migrants. I should have accepted the right honorable gentleman's statement as accurate if he had not mentioned the date 1921, and if I had not obtained some knowledge of the institute when I was in England in 1924. During my visit to the Mother Country in that year, I was engaged in a Labour concert in the constituency of Lewes in the south of England, and came across one of the institutes near the town of Portslade.  I learned that nineteen of the lads had been sent to Australia as migrants the previous week. I knew nothing then of the working of the institute, and upon making inquiries I learned, as the Prime Minister stated this afternoon, that its purpose was to effect reform in first offenders sent to it from the courts, and the custom was, if these young people did not misbehave, to encourage them to migrate to the dominions. About two years ago I obtained copies of the annual reports of the institute but could find no reference in them to the migration of inmates, although from time to time I have seen press statements of the success of the Borstal Institute, and the fact that young men committed to its care were sent to the dominions if they proved satisfactory. The Prime Minister  has informed us that there has been no migration of unfit immigrants since 1921, but statements have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Culpin,</inline> who at one time was a member of this House, and is now a medical superintendent in a Brisbane hospital, that some are being sent out to Australia, so I suggest that further inquiries be made. When I was in England in 1924,Itook advantage of the opportunity to investigate the emigration methods adopted, not only at Australia House, but at an agency in the Strand. The advertisements of this agency appeared all over London and at all the approaches to Australia House. I learned that the agent in the Strand was working in the interest of a certain shipping company. This method seemed to me to be rather lax. Instead of intending migrants obtaining all the information necessary at Australia House they were being induced to apply to the shipping agent who was interested in booking passages for migrants under the assisted migration scheme, and he cared little for the health or character of the migrants so long as he obtained their passage money. On the steamer on which I returned to Australia there was a young man, suffering mentally, who, I understand, had been refuseda passage by Australia House officials, but was sent out by the agent referred to. I believe he is now in Tasmania. I have been informed that of the total number of migrants sent from England to the dominions in February and March, 838 or 60 per cent. came to Australia, and 370 went to Canada. This suggests the need for stricter inquiries. It should be the duty of some one to see where the leakage is on the other side, because of the risk of physically unfit, and perhaps undesirable migrants whom the Mother Country is glad to get rid of, coming to Australia. No doubt the answer of the Prime Minister was based on information supplied by his department, and was given in all good faith. I urge, however, that a stricter examination be made of immigrants on the other side. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Long)</inline> referred to the educational qualification required for cadetship in the Royal Australian Air Force. In a question addressed to me the other day he suggested that university qualifications were required. I replied then that a student was not required to attend a university; that an ordinary high school education was sufficient. The standard insisted on is what in some States is known as the Intermediate Certificate, but in others as the Junior Public Certificate. It is necessary that cadets should have a fairly good education in view of the work they are required to do. There are usually ten to fourteen cadetships advertised, and there are frequently from 300 to 400 applicants. It is necessary, therefore, that a fairly high standard of qualification should be required. At the last examination 400 applicants presented themselves. Only fourteen passed, and of those only one was a student from a university. The others were from State high schools, or from other secondary schools. I shall be pleased if the honorable member for Lang will give me the letter which he read. The case mentioned therein might have some special personal features which it would be desirable to consider. </para>

                        <para>. -  The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> stated that he had learned authoritatively that boys from the Borstal Institute had obtained assisted passages to Australia in 1924. The reply which I gave to his question was based upon information received from my department, and accepted by me in good faith. It may be that these boys would not receive assisted passages. I assure the House that the answers I give to questions I understand to be accurate. In this case I shall have further inquiries made. </para>
