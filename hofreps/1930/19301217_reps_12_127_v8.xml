            <para>- As the type from which the notices are printed is kept standing, would any saving worth mentioning be effected by adopting the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition? I would suggest, however, that it would save time, if members having motions on the business paper could have a division taken on them without previous debate, at any time, if they thought fit. That would expedite decisions upon the matters brought before Parliament, and would also reduce the quantity of standing matter on the notice-paper. </para>

          <para>- I understand that there is some misapprehension respecting the right of the  Speaker  to leave the chair under the circumstances in which it was vacated this afternoon. From the early sittings of the first Commonwealth Parliament until the present day, every  Speaker  has  adopted the practice which I then fol  lowed.  There is no provision in our Standing Orders under which a motion  may  be made for the suspension of proceedings, and a motion for the adjournment the House, if carried, closes a  sitting.  This afternoon, as there was no  longer  any immediate business to transact, it was desired by the Acting Prime Minister that the sitting should be suspended for  a  brief period to enable a conference with another place to proceed. My action in leaving the chair was in accordance with the practice of the past, and was the only procedure possible to bring about the suspension of a sitting to meet the general convenience of members. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leaveThere</inline> is no need for me to make any statement in the direction of enlightening honorable members of this House respecting the deplorable condition of many of our fellow citizens owing to the prevalence of unemployment. This is the time of the year when our hearts are filled with goodwill and kindly feeling towards our brothers and sisters. It is most distressing for any individual who has reached the age of discretion and judgment to see tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters, particularly women and children, throughout Australia suffering acutely because of a lack of employment in this land of plenty. The Government realizes that it can afford comparatively slight relief; but so that it may do what it can, it has decided to allocate for that purpose the sum of £500,000 out of the present year's Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are three ways in which a grant may be made. First, by the passage of an appropriation bill, which would need to be preceded by a message from the Governor-General; secondly, out of the Treasurer's Advance ; and thirdly, by the method proposed, in order that the money may be disbursed through the State Governments, the municipalities, and other authorities that are organized for the provision of employment for our fellow citizens. At page 375 of the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending the 30th June, 1931, honorable members will find figures relating to a Commonwealth grant to the States towards the relief of unemployment. As honorable members are aware, the State of South Australia' this year found itself in such a difficult position financially, that a very strong appeal for assistance was made on its  behalf. at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, held in Melbourne last August. In response to that appeal, some of the States agreed to hand over to South Australia the whole of the amount voted to them by this Parliament for the relief of unemployment, and, in the case of other States, it was agreed that a proportion of the grant should be diverted to South Australia. </para>

              <para>-- No. This is a grant in which, I think, every honorable member will concur. My only regret is that it is not a thousand times greater than the amount stipulated; but in the straitened condition of the. finances, both Federal and State, we are being as liberal as possible. I believe I speak for all honorable members, when I. regret, that the amount is not larger. We hope, however, that it will bring some blessing to hundreds of homes in the approaching season. </para>

I am glad that the Government finds itself in a position to make money available for that purpose; but I confess to being surprised to learn that that is so. That, however, is entirely the responsibility of the Government. We are all aware of the condition of the finances of the Commonwealth; it  is  fortunate, therefore, that this amount;  is  available. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am inclined to think that the wisest method of raising money to deal with' unemployment is the taxation of the wages and salaries received by those who are in employment. That system has already been adopted by the States.  I  shall not, however, raise any objection to this grant on that, ground. </para>
          <para>All honorable members probably will be interested to learn whether the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> intends  us  to understand that the terms and conditions upon which the grant is to be expended are to be determined by the States. Honorable members are aware that there has been a -controversy between those who consider that relief should be given in the form of sustenance, those who hold the view that at least some work should be provided, and those who contend that, when relief work 'is provided, the money is not being wisely spent  if  there is an insistence upon the observance of ordinary industrial conditions and the payment of the basic wage. I understand from what the Acting Prime Minister has said that the intention is to leave all these matters to be determined by the several States. If that is so, I agree that it is the wisest course to adopt.  I  need only add. that I think that all honorable members will agree that grants  of  money are only in the nature of  a  palliative for the evil of unemployment, and that responsibility rests upon the Governments and Parliaments of Australia to find some means of dealing much more radically and effectively with those evils of which unemployment is the symptom. While we may have varying views as to the methods to be adopted, this is perhaps the first and foremost subject which should engage the attention of this House. </para>

          <para class="block">This schedule -provides for an export duty of½d. per lb. on sheep-skins in the wool exported from Australia, and is being introduced with a view to ensuring that more of the work of fellmongering of skins shall be performed in Australia. It  is  estimated by the Tariff Board that  the  net advantage of the export  duty  will be the employment of about 1,109 additional men, and a distribution  of  approximately  £275,000  extra per annum in wages. Unemployment is so acute in the fellmongering industry in Australia to-day that the Government considers it necessary to take this action at once in order to relieve the situation. It is anticipated that any falling off in the value  of  exports of sheep-skins consequent on this duty will be more than  offset  by the enhanced value of the exports of pelts, fellmongered wool, and basils. </para>

Unemployment is so acute in the fellmongering industry in Australia to-day that the Government considers it necessary to take this action at once in order to relieve the situation. It is anticipated that any falling off in the value  of  exports of sheep-skins consequent on this duty will be more than  offset  by the enhanced value of the exports of pelts, fellmongered wool, and basils. </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">.- by leave</inline>- The members of the Country party wish to associate themselves with the remarks of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> While, generally speaking, the responsibility of dealing with unemployment rests upon the State Governments rather than upon the Commonwealth Government, we feel that in the special circumstances in which Australia finds itself to-day, there is reason for some divergence from what might be ordinarily regarded  as  the proper method of dealing with unemployment. . Therefore, the party to which I belong desires to raise no objection to the action proposed to be taken by the Acting Prime Minister. </para>

            <para>That on and after the Eighteenth day of December, One thousand nine hundred and thirty, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, reckoned according to standard time in the Territory for the Seat of Government, Duties of Customs be imposed according to the following Tariff: - the  net advantage of the export  duty  will be the employment of about 1,109 additional men, and a distribution  of  approximately  £275,000  extra per annum in wages. Unemployment is so acute in the fellmongering industry in Australia to-day that the Government considers it necessary to take this action at once in order to relieve the situation. It is anticipated that any falling off in the value  of  exports of sheep-skins consequent on this duty will be more than  offset  by the enhanced value of the exports of pelts, fellmongered wool, and basils. </para>

That amendment removed the specific reference to the Commonwealth Bank, and substituted for it the words, " any prescribed authority." This would not exclude the Commonwealth Bank, but would place it on the same footing as other financial authorities. I do not wish to re-awaken controversy on this point, but it was made fairly clear during the course of the debate on the bill that the intention of the Government was to squeeze the Commonwealth Bank, and to compel it to advance up to £4,000,000. </para>

We on this side of the House protest strongly against any attempt by the Government to bring pressure to bear on the Commonwealth Bank. I shall be delighted to have the assurance of honorable members opposite that it is not the intention of the Government to bring such pressure to bear, and I appeal to them to make good that assurance by accepting the Senate's amendment. </para>

The words, " any . prescribed authority ", would meet the case quite well. That would include the Commonwealth Bank, but it would also include the trading banks and other financial institutions which might bc desirable auxiliaries. </para>

            <para>- I am delighted to withdraw the statement objected to, especially as the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> has given an inferential assurance that the Government and its supporters do not contemplate bringing pressure to bear on the Commonwealth Bank. I could not receive from the . Minister a more welcome assurance. If no pressure is to be brought to bear upon the bank, the bill is not worth the paper on which it is printed. When the bank was asked to accede voluntarily to the request of the Government, it emphatically refused to provide this money; but, in view of the Minister's assurance that no pressure is to be applied to the bank, the only course open to him is to withdraw the bill. The Minister has admitted that, after mature consideration, the bank could not see its way clear to guarantee an f.o.b. price of 2s. 6d. a bushel, even if a guarantee against loss were given, not only by the Commonwealth, as provided under the bill, but by the Commonwealth in conjunction with the six States. The Minister' having practically said that the bank is a free agent in this matter, honorable gentlemen opposite should not be in the least aggrieved if it refuses to find this money. In view of the fact that the' Government does not intend to single out the Commonwealth Bank, and compel it to support this measure, Ministers might well agree to the amendment made in another place. </para>

          <para>. -  The Government, T realize, has sufficient supporters in this chamber to enable it to do exactly as it pleases in this matter. I understand that the object of the amendment is to provide machinery to meet circumstances in Western Australia. If the clause is left as it stands, it will be in the power of the Government to include among prescribed persons the Commonwealth Bank or any other agency it desires to name. Unless the Government wishes to include the Commonwealth Bank specifically, I contend that the amendment made in another place might reasonably be accepted. </para>

          <para>- I understood from the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> this evening, when tabling the proposal for an export duty on sheep-skins, that one portion of the money thus collected is to be earmarked to provide a bounty on exports of canned mutton, and the other portion is to be applied <inline font-style="italic">-to</inline> scientific research in connexion with the pastoral industry. In my opinion the bill for the payment of the bounty should have been approved  by  Parliament before the export duty was imposed. Obviously, the duty will  be  futile, and its effect injurious to the sheep-farmers if the bounty legislation fails to receive the approval of Parliament. There is a great danger that, unless the proceeds of the duty are rigidly earmarked, in the event of the bounty legislation not being passed, the money derived from it may be diverted to some other avenue of expenditure and not returned to the growers. </para>

            <para>- Discussion of those matters would open up a very wide field of debate, and would anticipate business to come before the House later. Any remarks based on the statement made by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> must have direct relation to the schedule lie introduced, and therefore would be out of order. </para>

            <para>- I bow to your ruling, sir, but the rural producers who are affected would have less cause for grievance if they knew that the money to be collected by way of export duty will be returned to them in the event of- the bounty legislation not being passed. </para>

          <para>. - In connexion with the collection of State taxes on salaries for the relief of unemployment, the present practice is to assess the impost on the annual income. If in New South Wales the tax of ls. in the  £1  be collected in a lump sum at the end of the year, a heavy financial strain will be imposed on many Commonwealth public servants living in that State, particularly those on the basic wage. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to consider the practicability of arranging for this tax to be deducted from the fortnightly pay, and so relieve the public servants of the possibility of financial embarrassment at the end of the year. </para>

          <para>. - T am particularly concerned at the spread of. the buffalo fly, in regard to which I have had several conversations with experts in the Commonwealth Public Service. This menace is" more serious than many people may think, and I suggest that the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> should consult the Ministers of southern States with a view to arresting the advance of the fly before -it reaches the finer herds. If u buffer area could be established on the north-west coast of Queensland, much good might be done. Those who have a knowledge of this pest will appreciate the menace it may .become to the .dairy herds, and if it establishes itself in the closely-settled areas along the eastern coast, " it will cause losses which are estimated at several million pounds, and be most difficult to eradicate. </para>

          <para>. - I warmly appreciate the expressions that have fallen from the lips of the Acting Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Stewart).</inline> The task of presiding over this assembly and meting out evenhanded justice is not easy, and the testimony of representatives of all parties that my efforts to be strictly impartial and just have been successful, is most gratifying to me. I acknowledge also the appreciation that has been expressed of the services of the  Chairman  of Committees and the various officers of the House.' By an inadvertence the Temporary Chairmen of Committees were omitted ; we all are indebted to them for "their services, and I desire to express my person al gratitude for the assistance they have given in conducting the affairs of the House. On behalf of myself, the  Chairman  of Committees, and the officers, I reciprocate the wishes that have been expressed for as bright a Christmas as is possible in the present economic circumstances. I hope that when we re-assemble in the New Year the circumstances of Australia will be more prosperous and happy than they are now. </para>
