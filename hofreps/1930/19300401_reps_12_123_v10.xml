                        <para>- One might expect such a question from a mere tyro in politics, but not from one who has been one of His Majesty's Ministers in this Parliament. The person recommended for the new appointment will be one worthy to fill the position, irrespective of his place of birth. The Government will not, however, submit to this Hou3e the recommendation which His Majesty will be asked to consider. Any recommendation will be based, not upon the birth-place of the person concerned, but upon his suitability to occupy the high and honorable position to be filled. The matter cannot be discussed in this House, because the appointment will be- the act of His Majesty the King. </para>

                        <para>- The whole of the amount falling due in December next has not been subscribed, nor was it contemplated that we should raise now an amount sufficient to convert the whole of that loan. The purpose of the Treasury was to invite those who had the money to subscribe to a loan of £10,000,000 for the conversion of a loan maturing in March, and to subscribe towards the conversion of the December loan. The fact that more than half of the money required has now been subscribed has dispersed a heavy cloud which was overshadowing Australia's financial position. The loan has been closed because it was felt that it was opportune to close it. The money subscribed will make the December conversion very much easier. We shall have to go on the market for more money to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth and the States for ordinary public works, and it would be unwise to have that loan and a conversion loan on the market at the same time. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member refers to a tariff schedule brought down in August, but this Government did not table that schedule and several have been tabled since that date. This Government came into office in October, and submitted its first schedule in November. Only two or three weeks of the session remained before Christmas. It is rarely that a new government faces Parliament, except to obtain an adjournment, but this Government met the Parliament for a few weeks, and carried certain emergency legislation. Only another fortnight remains to deal with the urgent measures that we desire to pass before the Easter adjournment. It is not the Government's wish to keep tariff schedules on the table without full parliamentary discussion. </para>

                        <para>- I have nothing to add to the statement that I gave to the press for publication after the conference rose on Saturday. I called the conference for the purpose of bringing the coalmine owners and the miners together to see if they could find a solution of the deadlock. I drew their attention to the seriousness of the continuation of the dispute, pointed out its effect on Australia's credit abroad, and left the members of the conference to thrash matters out among themselves. There were certain proposals and counter proposals, and it was mutually agreed that none of these should be made public. The parties went back to their respective organizations, and there the matter rests. </para>

As to when it will be discussed, I am not in a position to say. We have a very largo legislative programme awaiting consideration, and unless legislation is contemplated in regard to the commission's report, the mere discussion of it would not take us any further. The report and recommendations of the commission generally would seem to involve State rather than Commonwealth legislation. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to a question of privilege. I feel that my rights have been interfered with. At all times since you have occupied the chair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,I</inline> have shown the greatest respect for you as Speaker; but as in your predominant position you warned me, as you did just now, not to transgress again, I feel that I have a right to the protection of the House. I shall relate the circumstances to which I refer. I directed a question to the Prime Minister, and on your declaring that it was not in order, I withdrew it. I then proceeded to ask another question, which you accepted as being in order; but the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> objected to it. You reproved him for some remark that he made, and, turning to me, warned me not to transgress again. I submit that I was thus subjected to indignity, and that that reproof was an abuse of your position. I say this with respect, but I think that it was not right for you, as  Speaker,  to say what you did to me, an ordinary member of this House. If I transgressed in the first instance, I had withdrawn the remark to which objection was taken, and to be warned that I must not transgress again was not fair to my position. I had not the slightest intention to transgress again, and I did not do so. I amended my question to meet your requirements, yet, when the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition interposed, you warned me not t.o transgress again. 1 feel that an indignity has been put on me. I understand that on a question of privilege it is usual to conclude with a motion. </para>

                    <para>- I feel it my duty  io  state the position as I see it as the presiding officer of this House. I desire to show uniform impartiality in the exercise of my duties as  Speaker.  No matter who the member may be, if I consider that he is transgressing any rule of debate, I shall seek to direct him into the proper course. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> rose to ask a question of the Prime Minister, and in framing it he used words which I thought were certainly offensive, and calculated to bring a high office into public contempt. I sought to bring him to a realization of -what those words might convey, and, therefore, I called him to order. He rose to ask the question a second time, and on the latter occasion, lie used the term " broken-down ", which I regarded, taken with the other words employed in his first question, as undesirable. At that moment the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition rose to a point of order, but, whether he had risen at that juncture or not, I would have called the honorable member for Corangamite to order because of the terms in which his second question was framed. I intimated to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that I felt it was unnecessary for him to rise at the moment when I was seeking to correct the honorable member .for Corangamite. I have no desire to humiliate that honorable member, but 1 do not intend to allow anything to be done or said in this chamber that is likely to bring discredit upon it, by a reflection on a high and honorable public position over which we exercise a certain amount of jurisdiction. I have no wish to treat the honorable member differently from any other honorable gentleman in this House. If I have erred at all I have done it unconsciously. I have endeavoured in the most fair and impartial way to carry out my duties as  Speaker,  and I feel they should be discharged to the honour and credit of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>.- Two proposals have been submitted by the Government, one seeking power to amend the Constitution, and the other seeking power in relation to industrial matters. The debate so far has somewhat confused the two measures submitted by the Government for the amendment of the Constitution, and their relation to each other. Legislation of this kind should be approached from a non-party stand-point; but, unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> by the calamity howling in which he indulged last week, has not set a good example. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that on this occasion, as on former occasions, the proposed amendments of the Constitution have been brought forward by the Government for the time being in office. The political system under which we operate necessitates the Government in power assuming the responsibility for the submission of such questions. The  only  alternative would be to have a constitutional convention. On this occasion, time will not permit of the consideration of that alternative, for the serious economic position of Australia makes urgent the consideration of these proposals. I compliment the honorable members for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> and the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> on the tolerant and constructive criticism which they proffered to the Government. Their speeches were in refreshing "contrast to those of the Leader of the Opposition and his followers. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely mentioning a fact. The Government would do well to consider the advisability of submitting a third question to the people, in order to exhaust every means of ascertaining public opinion in relation to. the alteration of the Constitution. In making this suggestion, I realize that it might be contended that the introduction of a third question would further confuse the people; but I submit that public opinion would be crystallized if a question relating to trade and commerce, and the control of corporations were placed before the people. By such methods it would not be difficult to convince them that Parliament is practically helpless in the matter of constitutional reform, and that some alteration is urgently necessary. It should be the object of this Parliament to give the people the utmost freedom in determining the future constitutional policy of Australia. The people should be allowed as many alternatives as circumstances demand. The addition of this third question would give every element in the community an opportunity to determine its attitude towards the Constitution. There are four main sources of public opinion in regard to the constitutional limitations of this Parliament. There is, first, that big section of public opinion represented by the Labour party, which demands unlimited legislative powers for this Parliament - unification, if honorable members prefer that designation. Secondly, there is that section which favours additional specific constitutional powers being granted to this Parliament, preserving the federal system of enumerated powers. That section favours this Parliament being given additional power over trade and commerce, corporations and monopolies. A third section favours vesting this Parliament with full industrial powers. Lastly, there is that section of public opinion represented in this House by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> which favours leaving things as they are; or, preferably, further whittling away the federal authority in favour of the States and destroying the federal spirit of the Constitution. For my own part I hare definitely declared in favour of full power being vested in this Parliament, and I purpose addressing the remainder of my remarks to that aspect of the subject. I believe, however, that the people should have alternative proposals submitted to them for their consideration, because so often have we unsuccessfully experimented in the submission of referendums to ascertain to what extent they will vest in this Parliament additional power that on this occasion we should explore every possible avenue. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>The Leader of the Opposition accused the Prime Minister of inconsistency. I dismiss that charge by reminding him that in its political youth the Labour party as a federal movement pioneered the agitation to secure additional powers for this Parliament.  In his policy speech at the last election, the Prime Minister made it clear that, if returned to power, he would ask for unlimited legislative authority for the Commonwealth, and such delegated powers to the States as the Commonwealth Parliament might determine from time to time. Because of this definite pronouncement, which also is contained in the Labour party's platform, this Government cannot now be charged with inconsistency. The arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition were characteristic of the assumption of melancholy which has been his leading political attribute when addressing himself to proposals brought forward by this Government - an attitude warranted possibly by the circumstances in which he now finds himself. The honorable gentleman now has an ability to visualize unpleasant, but imaginary, probabilities in relation to the proposed constitutional amendments introduced by this Government, which were not apparent to him when he supported the 1926 referendum proposals of the Bruce-Page Government. This Government's proposals are, at all events, simple and straightforward. There is about them a directness - an audacity if you-like - that challenges public opinion, and indicates with remarkable clarity the distinct cleavage that exists between the Nationalist and Labour parties concerning constitutional policy. The power to amend the Constitution, which it is sought to vest in the Parliament, will enable this Parliament to alter the Constitution as changing needs and changing circumstances demand. Whatever may be said by the opponents of the Government's proposal, the fact remains that, whether we call it unification or by any other term there is an overwhelming body of public opinion which believes that Australia is over-governed. At present the people are groping, so to speak, in constitutional darkness, seeking to be led into the light of political and constitutional freedom. They are weary of the litigious and farcical uncertainties of the present constitutional system, and, I think, they will be prepared to accord this Government a full measure of support when these questions are submitted to them. I do not share the pessimism that has been expressed concerning the first proposal. The Government, instead of tinkering with the Constitution, instead of trying to patch it up, instead of endeavouring painfully to unravel the tangled skein of constitutional uncertainty, seeks boldly to cut the Gordian knot. It gives the people an opportunity to free this Parliament for  all time from the difficulties which to-day prevent it from functioning for the entire nation. </para><para>It might well be said that we stand at the cross-roads in the evolution of our constitutional history. We are at the moment facing a grave crisis. During the war period, the people of Australia endured much travail, suffering and sacrifice, and the High Court, by resorting to .legal fictions and by widely interpreting the defence powers of the Commonwealth to meet the national emergency vested in this Parliament something in the nature of sovereign legislative authority. To-day that power is lacking, and yet Ave are confronted with a serious economic position that calls for united action and the co-ordinated effort of the entire nation with a view to extricating it from its peril. The Government could have taken three courses. In the first place, it could have adopted the doctrine of <inline font-style="italic">laissez-faire.</inline> the policy  endorsed by conservative-minded public men, such as the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> by leaving things as they are. But no one, apart from the honorable member mentioned, is disposed to allow the present uncertain constitutional position of the Commonwealth to continue. With the exception of the honorable member for Swan, all honorable members, I think, agree that additional powers should be conferred upon this Parliament. Even the Royal Commission on the Constitution grudgingly suggested that certain additional powers were necessary. Such a conclusion is inescapable, because unquestionably we have outgrown the constitutional clothes which were tailored for us 30 years ago. Remarkable developments in aviation and in the provision of other public utilities in the evolution of civilization have found the legislative authority of this Parliament seriously circumscribed. Consequently, . almost every one realizes that additional power is now needed. The Labour party differs from the party represented by honorable members opposite as to the precise nature of the amending measures that are necessary. It declares that it is better to cure the disease than to drug the patient. There are in Australia still a few misguided people, mainly in "Western Australia and Tasmania, who talk secession. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- They forget, too, that federation postulates an indissoluble union, and involves certain duties and obligations. We can, I think, afford to disregard that section of public opinion, but in doing so we must take into consideration the reasons which have caused those people in the States mentioned to become dissatisfied with the federal system. The cure for this discontent, .in my opinion, is a new orientation of powers from the States to the Commonwealth. I have said, and I repeat, that there is need for a co-ordination of public utilities and services, and for the elimination of duplication and waste. That can be overcome by vesting sovereign legislative power in the Commonwealth. If a business were faced with heavy losses, "due to bad management, it would be reorganized on proper lines. We have a business with six branches under divided control. How can we hope to pay a national dividend in such circumstances? In the face of this, the lazy doctrine of <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> must bc abandoned. </para>

                    </continue><para>The second alternative which confronts the Government is to accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> to re-submit the 1926 Constitution proposals, or seek power in respect to certain specified subjects. I have, for the reasons that I have given, proposed a compromise, namely, that we should give consideration to the submission of a third proposal. At the same time, I can see no justification for the re-submission of the proposals of the Bruce-Page Government, which were so decisively rejected by the people. Those proposals were rejected, in my opinion, because they involved the vesting of power in authorities outside of Parliament. This would have led to the undermining  of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty for which the Labour party stands. This party accepts it as an axiom that parliamentary sovereignty is a fundamental principle of responsible government, as we have inherited it from Great Britain. Because the 1926 proposals sought to undermine this principle they were rejected. </para><para>The seeking of power in respect of specific subjects is, I submit, an awkward method. It is objectionable also because it involves an irrevocable transfer of power. It would not make the Constitution flexible. It is the rigidity of our Constitution which is its greatest defect. On the one hand, Parliament has vested in it powers that it does not exercise, and has never sought to exercise; on the other hand, it sorely needs other powers in regard to cinemas and things to which I have already referred which the States, because of jealousy of the Commonwealth, will not voluntarily surrender. I arn against the second alternative, because it, would still leave this Parliament in a position of vassalage, more or less, to the States. </para><para>It might be said that we could re-su b.mit the Constitution alteration proposals  of the Fisher and Hughes Governments. Those proposals were submitted in the form of five or six questions, whose multiplicity and complexity caused a confusion of public opinion. There was a hesitancy and a Tearfulness on the part of the people to grant the additional powers, and there was also a recognition by them that if they transferred the power to the Commonwealth it would bc irrevocably transferred. </para><para>My general criticism of the proposal to submit specific questions asking for additional power along defined lines is that it would not alter or determine the power of constitutional interpretation possessed by the High Court of Australia. The High Court has the power to determine the constitutional limits within which this Parliament may function. To my mind it is the pre-eminent position of the High Court in interpretation which is the real weakness of the Constitution. The High Court has been given a position of judicial infallibility. It exercises an authority which is foreign to any other British institution. In no other British self-governing dominion does a court exercise the same measure of constitutional veto, by interpretation, as the High Court of Australia. But the High Court has not been even consistent in its decisions. It has, as a matter of fact, helped to cause the instability of constitutional principles under which Australia labours. In its early days the High Court affirmed certain principles, among which was the doctrine of the immunity of State instrumentalities - implied prohibition and necessary implication were the terms used - under which it limited the power of the national Parliament to legislate in regard to State undertakings. In recent years the court has abandoned that doctrine and reversed its earlier constitutional views, for, unlike other systems of British jurisprudence, our High Court i? not bound by the judicial decisions of preceding justices. The only other exception to the principle of invoking precedence is the Privy Council, which also is not bound by its earlier decisions. The right of the High Court to continue to exercise this dominant constitutional power and the retention by it of the power to veto the manifest expression of the people's will, is something that can only be changed by the conferring upon this Parliament of sovereign legislative power. </para><para>I have heard honorable members opposite talk about the danger of vesting complete power in this Parliament. Some of them appear to have had a wild vision of what might happen if this Parliament had power to legislate as the changed needs of the situation required. They forget that that danger exists to-day. If an unscrupulous or revolutionary government were returned to power it could pack the High Court bench, and the court, by virtue of its sovereign authority in regard to interpretation,' could stretch the Constitution far beyond its recognized natural limits. That is an answer to some of the criticism of the Government's proposals by honorable members opposite. </para><para>The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> suggested that even to-day the High Court could help this Parliament, in the event of a grave economic crisis arising, by overlooking the existing constitutional limitations. He suggested that it could give Parliament certain increases in its legislative power. That shows the lack of constitutional knowledge with which some honorable members approach this subject. The High Court has no power, no matter how grave an economic crisis may be, to extend the authority of this Parliament, except through the channel of interpretation. Only in war time can additional power be exercised by the Parliament. </para><para>What is the position to-day? Our primary industries are clamouring for relief from depressing conditions. But we can do nothing to give them relief without bearing in mind the possibility of having to face appeals to the High Court on the subject of our jurisdiction. In war time we could create pools,, arrange marketing schemes, and organize production, with a view to helping the nation to victory; but in peace time we have no such power. It is proposed to create a wheat pool in order to save the Australian growers from disaster ; but our effort to assist the primary producers in this way may be checked by a decision of the High Court challenging our power unless we can secure the complete co-operation of all the six States and every wheat-grower. This shows conclusively the inherent weakness of the Federal Constitution. </para><para>I would not hesitate to destroy the federal character of the Australian Constitution. I would say from every platform in Australia, and be proud to say it, that the existing federal system, in its rigidity and unalterability, is something entirely foreign to British democracy. We limit our legislative powers within very narrow confines. The federal character of our Constitution is detrimental to the smaller States. I make that statement in spite of arguments that are frequently advanced to the contrary. To-day, if this Parliament desires to apply remedies to the problems which are facing Tasmania and Western Australia, it is limited to a system of monetary grants. We have no power to do anything in a general way to encourage the economic development of the smaller States, except to make monetary grants to them. Our Constitution lays it down that there must be no discrimination between one State and another, and that there must be absolute interstate freetrade. Many remedies could be applied to the troubles of Western Australia and Tasmania, if it were not .for our constitutional limitations. Let me give a hypothetical case, although I do not suggest that it is within the realm of practical politics. Parliament might consider it desirable to assist Tasmania by a system of special bounties, and Western Australia by a system of modified duties, so as to encourage production and to relieve those States from the economic dependence upon the Commonwealth under  which  they are at present chafing. Naturally they are indignant at having to come to the Commonwealth cap in hand for monetary assistance. But, even if we felt it wise to use either of those methods to inspire the residents in the States concerned to take up with renewed  enthusiasm  their great task of developing and building up the nation, we could not use them under existing constitutional conditions. Consequently, it is proposed by this Government to vest in Parliament sovereign legislative power to do what it considers to be the best thing for Australia. </para><para>We should look at this subject, not as federalists nor as State-righters, but as Australians with a broad Australian outlook. Let this Parliament, drawing as it does its rights to govern from the hearts of the people, be directly responsible to the people. Let it not shelter behind the fact that narrow constitutional limitations prevent it from giving assistance where that should be given. The talk of secession is, in itself, evidence of the unsatisfactory working of the Constitution. An analysis of this dissatisfaction shows that it is based upon the inability of this Parliament to apply to Western Australia, Tasmania, and the smaller States generally, a proper and adequate measure of relief, which will enable them to balance their position in relation to the other States of the Commonwealth. We shall deliberately stultify ourselves by preserving the present system. We have in Australia the ridiculous paradox of the part, as representative of the States, being greater than the whole, as represented by the Commonwealth. Are we to recognize an inferiority complex in regard' to the States? Are we to affirm that we are to be less trusted than the members of the State Parliaments, and that we are devoid of a sense of responsibility and a proper understanding of our legislative obligations to the people? That surely is fallacious reasoning for men to resort to. Those who take that stand show themselves to be unworthy of the great  responsibility  that was vested in them when they were called upon to assist in the government of this nation. </para><para>The State Parliaments possess sovereign legislative power within the ambit of their constitutional jurisdiction. They can amend their Constitutions by a simple act of Parliament. They can do anything in their own legislative domain, though they cannot trespass upon the exclusive power vested, in the Commonwealth in relation to Defence, Customs, and the Department of the Postmaster-General. There are certain concurrent powers exercised by both the States and ourselves; but within the legislative domain which is exclusively their own, the States can do as they like, even as I have said, to the amending of their Constitutions. The States secure their constitutional rights from the people, and exercise them with the knowledge that the people will punish them if proper limits are exceeded. Who will say that the duplication of health and other such services in Australia is desirable? A majority of the Australian people are ignorant of our political helplessness, and we should as a Parliament approach this subject in a non-party spirit, tear away the mask of political prejudice and distrust, and show them the limitations within which this Parliament functions. Whether the present coal dispute is  considered  from the viewpoint of the conservative or of  the advanced radical, it is a serious factor in connexion with Australia's economic depression. What has been the" position ? The Commonwealth Parliament is practically helpless. The lockout on the coalfields might easily have resulted in a vast industrial conflagration, and this Parliament, because of its limited powers, would have been helpless. Our helplessness has been accentuated by decisions of the High Court, which has laid it down that there must be a real interstate dispute before the authority of the Federal Arbitration Court can be invoked. For over twenty years this court has recognized the existence of artificial or paper disputes, but the High Court, by its recent decisions, has helped to undermine the industrial peace and stability of the Commonwealth. In future if the workers want a federal award they will virtually be compelled to create an interstate strike. If the people tolerate a continuation of the limits of authority of this Parliament, I am sadly misguided in my judgment of them. The bogey has been advanced by honorable members opposite that if this Parliament is vested with sovereign legislative powers, it will abuse its authority. This Parliament can abuse its present powers. It has plenary powers in the matter of taxation, and by imposing coercive taxation can undermine the powers of the States. "What is it that checks all parliaments and governments when they begin to abuse their authority? It is the wrath and votes of the people. It will, therefore, be seen that there is nothing behind the suggestion that this Government would abuse additional constitutional power, because the Parliament and the Government are directly responsible to the people. If the Government's proposals were adopted it would mean - this is an aspect of the  matter which appeals to me - that future elections, instead of being fought upon catch cries and political issues of passing significance, would be fought on great constitutional questions. This Parliament would then be regarded as a standing constitutional convention, consisting of federalists,  unificationists  and Staterighters. The representatives of the people would be able to legislate in such a way as to meet the claims and needs of the nation as they arise and to represent the people's opinions as viewed from every aspect. "What is the difference between electing members to a convention to discuss constitutional amendments, and electing members to this Parliament pledged to a certain constitutional policy? In my opinion, there is a difference only in name. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- So it would be in a constitutional convention. If this Parliament could deal with big national issues, by legislating for the whole continent without any limitation of its authority, it would be acting more in keeping with the traditions that we have inherited from the mother of parliaments. There is nothing revolutionary in asking the people for power to amend the Constitution, because similar power has been possessed by the British Parliament for centuries past. Arguments against the proposal such as are urged by Oppositionists were advanced in connexion with the union of Scotland with England over 200 years ago. As honorable members opposite are so often asking us to follow British examples why do not they consider the position of the British Parliament, and study this matter from that view point. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Latham)</inline> referred to the method of government of South Africa, and when these examples are quoted, he airily replies, " Of course, that is different." In South Africa there aru two racial groups animated by divergent interests and deep-seated antagonism, but they nevertheless agreed to subordinate their respective racial interests, and to establish a Union Parliament vested with sovereign legislative power which they have to-day. Surely the reasons which actuated the South African people to form a Union Parliament should apply with infinitely greater force in Australia, where the Parliament is controlling the destinies of an entire continent peopled by the one race. If they do not, we are unworthy of the heritage for which wo were supposed to have fought during the world war. Our Constitution is the weakest in the British Empire. </para>

                            <para>- Dicey admits that our Constitution is advanced in the sense that it provides power of amendment. Dicey deals with the fact that we can amend- our Constitution, which he says is in it favour, but that is the only material difference to which he refers. Still the opinions of Dicey should not necessarily affect the judgment of this Parliament in considering the real problems of the situation confronting us. It is mere hyperbole and humbug for the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> to say that if we give Parliament the power to amend the Constitution this will have the effect of destroying the Constitution. Is the Leader of the Opposition opposed to the policy of allowing this Parliament to give expression to the impulses of the people? That is the only difference between the policy of the Labour party and of the anti-Labour party. The Labour party believes that sovereignty should be vested in the people and contends that they should not be subjected to control by judicial decisions or by the votes of Upper Houses elected on a property franchise. I believe that there is a reasonable prospect of the people throwing off the shackles which are now impeding the progress of this nation, and that they now realize that by limiting the powers of this Parliament they are stultifying the nation, and consequently themselves. The effect of this proposed amendment if carried would be to enable this Parliament, if it so desired, to abolish the State Parliaments, and also the Senate. This Parliament would be able to do any of those things when it. had a mandate from the people to do them, and no government dare act without a mandate. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite virtually say, " We will not allow the people to decide these matters." That attitude is entirely wrong. They ought to facilitate the submission of these matters to the people, and oppose them, if they so desire, on the public platform. Australia spoke as a united nation in time of war, and why should it not now speak with one voice in time of peace? Faced as it is with a grave economic crisis, I feel that the Government has every prospect of having the present proposals agreed to at the polls. Owing to the multiplicity and cost of governments in Australia, the people are crying on every hand, "Abolish the State Parliaments. Remove the things that hamper the application of remedies to meet the requirements of the community." </para>

The submission of specific proposals to the people asking them to consent to a re-subdivision of States would be doomed to failure because of their arbitrary character. It would be far better for this Parliament to have power to re-subdivide the country with a view to promoting its economic development. </para><para>There is another phase of the subject of the transfer of powers by the submission of specific proposals to the people to which I must refer. Assuming that we induced the people to agree to give this Parliament additional trade and commerce power, or power over corporations, that power would still have to be construed in relation to other sections of the Constitution, and, therefore, within the limits there imposed. Even though we might think that the amendments were couched in simple and unequivocal language, the interpretation of such limitations would rest with the High Court, and not with this Parliament. Therefore, we should remove that court  from its  dominant position regarding constitutional interpretations, and allow this Parliament to function without artificial restrictions. </para><para>The point has been raised by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> whether this Parliament has the right to qualify section 128 of the Constitution by the insertion of the proposed new section 129. The Royal Commission on the  Constitution  quoted the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Dixon and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, that the Constitution could be amended in this regard, and, in the circumstances, the Government has no doubt also secured the advice of other eminent legal men, which justifies it in pressing on with this proposal. </para><para>The measure in which the Government seeks powers over industrial matters is a subsidiary proposal. Such power would not perhaps give the Parliament authority to legislate, for instance, for a complete system of national insurance; the power sought would still, no doubt, be subject to High Court appeals, and a considerable amount of litigation would take place before fundamental principles of interpretation were settled. Therefore, I appeal to the people to sweep away all the obstacles with which the path of progress is strewed, and allow this Parliament to legislate for the people as Australians by giving it power to amend the Constitution. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- I am entirely opposed to the first of the Government's proposals, which I believe has been brought forward not for a national purpose, but with the object of driving home a temporary party advantage gained at the polls. I believe, too, that it is calculated to deprive the States of that measure of self government that was expressly retained by them when the federal union was consummated. The measure which has to do with industrial powers, however, falls within a different category. I recognize that if the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is to be retained, it is desirable that it should be a workable tribunal. The experience of a number of years has brought to light defects that ought to be remedied. There must be a dispute before the court can act ; it must be a dispute extending beyond the boundaries of a State; and, further, the court  is unable to make a common rule. It seems to me that the Government should enumerate these defects, and ask the people for power to remedy them. But the Government is not satisfied to make the court efficient ; its idea is to go the whole length of its ambitions and seek to control every activity within the Commonwealth. I am glad that the Government ha3 openly made its proposals known, because I am inclined - to think that when they have been fully considered by the people they will be seen in their true perspective. </para>

                    <para>We have been told that this subject should' be approached as a non-party one. I entirely agree that it is regrettable that a national issue should be dealt with on other than non-party lines. The failure of the referendums taken in the past was due to the party bias displayed in submitting the proposals to the people. On the only two occasions when the electors agreed to constitutional alterations all parties were in unison in regard to them. The 'most striking example of the influence of parties was given in 1926, when it was desired to grant additional powers to the court by going some distance in the direction sought to be followed under the present proposals. It is somewhat remarkable that the electorates that then cast the heaviest majorities against the proposals were industrial districts. In my opinion, matters such as this should be considered first by conferences or conventions. I think that it would be a good plan if the Government appointed a committee consisting of an equal number of members from' both sides of the House, the Prime Minister of the day to be  chairman  and have a casting vote, to make recommendations for alterations on those matters upon which Parliament is -agreed that there should be amendment of the Constitution. At present, however, it looks as if the Government's proposals will meet the same fate as the majority of those of the governments that have preceded it. </para>
                    <para>The main objection to the first bill is that it is desired to obtain for this Parliament power that is inconsistent with the bargain into which the States entered when they agreed to the Constitution which established federation. There were six independent colonies enjoying responsible government; but recognizing that Australia should speak with one voice on certain national matters, and. that it was desirable that there should be uniform laws on certain subjects, delegates were chosen by those colonies to frame a federal Constitution, which was subsequently ratified by their peoples, and became law by an act of the Imperial Parliament. That Constitution is in its nature the bond into which the six colonies entered. I do not intend to touch upon the right of five States to deal with a recalcitrant State - that is a matter that cannot be settled in this House - but a useful analogy can be drawn from what happens when six private persons enter into and draw up articles of partnership and sign them. It is not competent for five of the partners to alter the articles of partnership without the consent of the sixth partner. But if the proposal now put forward by the Commonwealth Government becomes law, it will be competent for the representatives of the two largest States of the Commonwealth so to alter the terms of the bargain entered into by the people when they agreed to federation as to affect the interests of the other four States. New South Wales and. Victoria have 48 members in the House of Representatives out of 75, and in many respect3 the interests of the two big States are opposed to those of the less populous States, particularly in regard to tariffs and bounties for the purpose of building up industries which are conducted almost entirely in the great capital cities. Even now a combination of the representatives of the two most populous States can carry anything they choose against the wishes of the representatives of the other four States, which is a condition of affairs that was never contemplated by the people when they agreed to federate. Western Australia has five representatives in a House of 75, and those five are weakened by party division. For 25 years the people of the State have suffered from their association with the Commonwealth, and so far have not been able to&gt; obtain relief under a constitution which gives restricted powers to the Commonwealth Parliament. How much worse would their position be if all the powers - at any rate all that count - were handed over to the Commonwealth Parliament? </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)has</inline> suggested that if these unlimited powers were granted to the Commonwealth, Western Australia might be allowed to impose its own customs duties. If that suggestion came from the official representatives of the Labour party, the people of Western Australia would grasp at it, because if they were given the power to impose their own customs duties, their discontent would be forever silenced. The tariff protection they need is against Eastern Australia. Honorable members may laugh at any suggestion of secession, but that is not impossible. A determined decision on the part of the people of any one State could bring it about, because the right to permit any State to secede from the federation is reserved to the Imperial Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- They cannot go any further. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> did not give very strong reasons for making these sweeping amendments. He certainly enumerated a number of the powers which he thought it desirable that the Commonwealth Parliament should have, but they were not of very great importance. Incidentally, the Commonwealth Parliament already has certain powers which it has not seen fit to exercise. For instance, it has not enacted uniform marriage law. There are, no doubt, many matters such as company law upon which it is desirable to have uniform legislation for Australia. Why cannot we, as a Parliament, set out these matters, and ask the people to give us the power to deal with them? </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that the people should be asked to give us what we want, but that we should not ask them for an open cheque or a roving commission. I have already mentioned what power I propose to ask the people to give to the Commonwealth Parliament in regard to arbitration. I think that we should ask for specific powers. </para>

                    <para>We can only surmise what is likely to happen if the Commonwealth Parliament is given the powers for which the present Government is asking. I agree with previous speakers that we must not take too seriously the suggestion that terrible trouble is likely to arise in Australia if the Commonwealth Parliament gets this full power of amendment; but judging from the utterances of responsible Ministers and members of the Parliament and delegates to trade union congresses, certain things are not only possible but also quite probable. State Parliaments might be abolished and replaced by provincial councils. The position in Great Britain has been quoted because that country has a central government with urban and county councils. That, apparently, is the scheme to be put before the people in Australia for their acceptance. The Labour party might seek the abolition of the Senate, which was created to protect the small States. There is no doubt that the promise of a Senate, in which all the States would have equal representation, was one of the most effective reasons for appealing to the people in the less populous colonies to enter into the federation. Another important change that might be proposed might be in the method of appointing the justices of the High Court, and the judges of the Arbitration Court. Our judges now enjoy security of tenure, so that their decisions may not be influenced by the desire to please the dominant political party of the hour; but under this proposed amendment of the Constitution they will no longer have security of tenure. We have already had instances of judges of inferior tribunals being dismissed by incoming governments, because their decisions have not suited the policy of the party to which the government belonged, and only a few days ago I saw a statement, which has so far remained uncontradicted, that it was the intention of the Labour party to get rid of the Chief Justice of the High Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Adrian</inline> Knox, and the Chief Judge of the Arbitration Court, Judge Dethridge. We all remember the demand made by the Timber Workers Union for the dismissal of Judge Lukin, and it is within our recollection that that judge was burned in effigy. The action of the union was by resolution approved by the whole of the members of the Parliamentary Labour party, including all the members of the present Commonwealth Government. The changes I have mentioned may be not only possible, but also, probable. The Commonwealth Parliament may proceed to put into effect a great many of the hopes of the Labour party. It may so alter the Constitution as to give the right to vote to persons under eighteen years of age, a proposal which has been seriously discussed at Labour conferences; and we know that the platform of the Labour party is drawn up by Labour congresses, and that a Labour Government has to give effect to the platform of the party. Other things that are possible are the " socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange." I am quoting the words used in the Labour platform. Trades Halls may be invested with the exclusive right to say what employees shall be engaged. The Labour proposals provide for the abolition of employment registries, and for giving preference to financial unionists sent to employers by officials of the unions; also for the prohibition of press advertisements for situations vacant. </para>

His scheme then was for an amendment of the law to provide for a system of sound and business-like administration along the lines of the Industrial Peace Act. The scheme put forward by the Government to-day bears no semblance to the scheme then propounded. The Government cannot claim that it has a mandate from the people to introduce this legislation. It is said that in 1926 the Nationalist Government submitted similar proposals to those now before us. That is not so. In 1926 two proposals were submitted to the people - one relating to industry and commerce, and the other to industrial matters. The proposals in respect of industry and commerce were chiefly for the establishment of uniform company laws. The proposal in respect of arbitration was to leave out the provision that a dispute must extend beyond the limits of any one State before the Arbitration Court could interfere, and to add three paragraphs to section 51 of the Constitution : - </para><list type="lowerroman">

They merely meant  tightening  up the arbitration laws to give the Arbitration Court increased authority to deal with legitimate arbitration matters generally, and also power to enforce its decisions. The present Government wants power to legislate in respect of industrial matters, including labour, employment and unemployment. The Arbitration Court has nothing to do with unemployment. It is not concerned, as a court, with the causes of unemployment, or their removal. The problem of unemployment is one for governments, not courts. The only reason for the inclusion of the word " unemployment " is that the Government desires to empower Parliament to grant an unemployment dole, and to authorize the Arbitration Court to determine what imposition shall be made on industry to provide funds for the purpose. If the reason for its inclusion is other than I have stated, 1 should be glad to hear the Government's explanation. </para><para> The Government seeks power to alter the Constitution to give Parliament control of the terms and conditions of  labour  and employment in any trade, industry, profession, occupation or calling anu the rights and obligations of employee and employees. Those are very wide powers. Evidently, the Government, wishes the court to have power to control every phase of industrial activity. Under those powers, it would be competent for Parliament to pass a law to instruct the court that no award shall contain a provision for a working week of more than 44 hours. Indeed, that proposal has already been made. Before long we shall have requests for a working week of 36 hours. Moreover, those powers would enable Parliament to say that no award may provide for a wage less than the basic wage in 192S, irrespective of any subsequent changes in economic  condi-ditions.  Such powers are beyond the proper sphere of the Arbitration Court, and should not be granted to any government. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Inferentially, the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> suggests that such directions should be given to the court. He, apparently, overlooks the possibility of conditions in Australia changing. It would be well if the basic wage of 1928 could be raised still higher; on the other hand, the necessity for a reduction of that wage might arise. It would be utterly wrong so to restrict the court. Again, in paragraphs / and <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of clause 2, dealing with the maintenance of industrial peace and the settlement of industrial disputes, the wording is as wide as possible. That power, if granted,' would enable any government to do whatever it considered necessary for the maintenance of industrial peace or the settlement of industrial disputes. It would, for instance, have enabled the Government to take over the coal mines at Newcastle. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government is to be commended for having, so early in the session, introduced these bills to provide for referendums on amendments to the Constitution, and I commend the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> for the clear and definite language which he employed in urging their acceptance. The object is to seek full industrial powers for the Commonwealth. I believe it is generally agreed, notwithstanding the interjection made by one honorable member opposite when the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> was speaking, that in respect of certain of its provisions the Commonwealth Constitution is exceedingly weak. I remind . the House that when the Prime Minister stated that it was the weakest in the world he was expressing not only his own view, but also the opinion of the present Chief Justice of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine).</inline> As we all know, it is modelled on the Constitution of the United States of America. But neither the Commonwealth Constitution nor that of the United States of America contains any provisions under which the High Court of either country has authority to say that any act of the Federal Parliament shall be null and void. Such action by the High Court is, I submit, a usurpation of power. The Constitution of the United States of America specifically provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Yet the New York State legislature passed a law forbidding a man to keep a revolver in his own home, and although a New York lawyer fought that law in the highest tribunal of the republic, he was defeated. The Constitution of the United States of America provides further that every citizen may freely speak, write and publish .his sentiments upon all subjects, being responsible  for the abuse of that right, and no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or the press. Although nothing could be more explicit than that, certain of the State legislatures of America have passed what is known as a criminal syndicalism law under which, at the present time, no fewer than 70 persons are undergoing sentence in gaol, merely because they gave voice to their political opinions. One man was placed in confinement for three weeks in California for having taken his stand on a vacant piece of land from which it was his intention to read a copy of the Constitution of the United States of America. I do not suggest that the High Court of Australia has gone so far as that, but, as the court is constituted, anything may happen to a citizen of the Commonwealth ; because the court has the right to interpret the Constitution, and declare whether acts passed by this Parliament are in conformity with it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There should be no doubt about the authority of the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate for the people. The national legislature should have at least as large a power as that enjoyed by the New South Wales Parliament which, by the passage of a simple act, may entirely alter the Constitution. The only difference between an act to alter the Constitution and an ordinary legislative measure is that the former must be reserved for the King's assent. This Government also is asking for exactly the same measure of power as is vested in the British Parliament. Surely it is not too much to urge that the people of Australia should give to the Commonwealth Parliament authority to amend the Constitution. Is it not an axiom that the whole is greater than its part? </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> seems to fear that if these proposals are approved by the people, the Commonwealth Parliament will have too much legislative authority. Why should any citizen of the Commonwealth be afraid of the fullest constitutional functions being vested in this Parliament ? As the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> pointed out last week, any government that attempted to play fancy tricks with the Constitution would soon be destroyed, and the right honorable gentleman instanced the fate of the Bruce-Page Administration which sought the abolition of the Federal Arbitration Court. As the result of the appeal to the people the Labour party was returned to power with no fewer than 47 adherents in this House. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> suggested that this Government was trying to force constitutional amendments on the people merely because, as he put it, the Labour party had had a temporary and fleeting victory at the polls. Let me tell the honorable member that it will be a long time before the party of which he is a supporter again takes up the reins of office. Non-Labour forces may one day return to power in the Commonwealth, but they will not be under the name of the Nationalist party. The last general election clearly .demonstrated that the people demand the retention of the federal system of arbitration. In 1926, when the Bruce-Page Government introduced a measure to submit to the people constitutional amendments dealing with industry and commerce, the Right Honorable W. A. Watt, whose remarks will be found on page 2605-6 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 3rd June of that year, said this of the bill : - </para>

                        <para>If the referendum proposals are adopted the three men who will be appointed to constitute the established authority with full control over all industrial matters will have larger power than even this Parliament, and larger power than has ever been entrusted to any men in normal times in British history. They will hold in the hollow of their hands the fortunes, prospects, and careers of at least SO per cent, of the Australian people. They will he in charge of a machine which they will be tempted <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> operate until it makes them veritable industrial autocrats. Even if they were angels from heaven I should hesitate to repose in the three new jurists the enormous power which must be given under this extension of powers. </para>

                        <para>If proof of the necessity for this constitutional amendment be needed, it could be found in the state of affairs in New South Wales during the last three months. The New South Wales Parliament has deliberately passed an act providing that, no matter what the number of working hours determined by a Commonwealth award may be, the number of working hours in New South Wales shall not exceed 44 a week. . . . </para>
                        <para>By passing that act the New South Wales Parliament precipitated the trouble.

                    <para class="block">When the question of the validity of the 44-hour week was referred to the High Court in April, 1926, it was made plain, much to the chagrin of the Nationalists, that federal awards prescribed 48 hours as the maximum and not the minimum number of working hours a week. It was also made clear that the Federal Parliament had no power to enact legislation concerning labour for people within a State, and that such power was reserved to the State legislature. The position as revealed by the High Court was, in short, that it was no breach of the federal awards for employees to work less than 48 hours a week, and that in working 44 hours for 44 hours pay, they were simply exercising the contractual rights which they possessed. </para>
                    <para>I wish also to direct attention to the following statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> Ryrie concerning the constitution alterations sought by the Bruce-Page Government in 1926.

                        <para>The Bruce-Page Government was seeking power, per medium of the second referendum proposal, to do exactly what the British Government did during the recent general strike. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>During that strike the Baldwin Government declared a state of emergency, and mobilized the military and naval forces on a war footing to protect scab workers. Naval ratings were employed as strike breakers. ' The Labour party's rooms and trades halls were raided by the police, union property was confiscated or destroyed, union  officials  were arrested in wholesale fashion, and civil and military officials were promised indemnity for any action that might be taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> Ryrie furnished another reason why the proposals of the Bruce-Page Government were rejected by the people. </para>
                    <para>In speaking on the 26th July of the same year on the Essential Services Referendum, ex-Senator Drake-Brockman, who was then Nationalist campaign director, said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>This means that the Commonwealth Government is asking the people to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to take the same kind of action in Australia as was taken in Great Britain during the recent general strike. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In other words, he said that if the second referendum proposal of the Bruce-Page Government were carried, the Government would introduce legislation similar to the Emergency Powers Act in operation at that time in Great Britain. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members opposite have suggested that if this bill is agreed to something outrageous will be done, and that the people will be robbed of their inheritance. That is foolish. This Parliament was elected by the Australian people who, years ago, approved of the Constitution, and I cannot see any substantial reason why the same electors should not be asked now to agree to or reject this proposal. If the people want unification, let them say so. If they want to give this Parliament additional power" over industry, or if they want to give it full power over trade and commerce, let them be given the opportunity to do so. They should have the fullest possible opportunity to express their opinion. If they do not want unification, they will say so ; and if they do not desire to extend the power of this Parliament in the directions indicated they will also leave us in no doubt on the subject. I would use the ballot-box to answer all these questions. </para>
                    <para>The existing federal system is, in my opinion, absurd. A change in the personnel of the High Court bench may easily bring about a change in the interpretation of the Constitution. As a matter of fact, the court has reversed some of its earlier decisions. It is high time that we had a simpler method of altering the Constitution. If the first proposal of the Government is agreed to, it will be easy, at any time, to make such amendments to the Constitution as may be thought necessary to meet the needs of any particular situation. </para>
                    <para>As the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> pointed out, every political party in Australia has, at one time or another, declared itself to be in favour of an amendment of the Constitution. The Nationalist party has committed itself definitely to this policy on numerous occasions. The Prime Minister indicated clearly that there were many absurdities and anomalies in the Constitution. He pointed out that, although the Commonwealth Government owned Cockatoo Island Dockyard and desired to do some work in connexion with the Bunnerong Power House scheme, the High Court ruled that the dockyard was only a war-time enterprise. The whole position is absurd. If the first proposal of the Government is accepted by the people it will mean that Parliament will be supreme. Under the existing provisions, political matters become judicial, and Australia is governed not by the Commonwealth Parliament but by the occupants of the High Court bench. </para>

The right honorable gentleman also showed that although we are supposed to be a democracy,  650,000  people could, under existing conditions, dictate to <inline font-style="italic">2,000,000</inline> people on constitutional subjects. Because it is necessary to secure a majority of four States to alter the Constitution, a four-to-one favorable majority might be secured, and yet it might not be possible to effect the alteration. If we are a democracy we should have a democratic constitution alterable at the will of the people. The Constitution of the Union of South Africa can be altered by the Union Parliament. If the South African Parliament has such power, I cannot see why it should be denied to the Australian Parliament. </para>

The right honorable gentleman informed us that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, now Chief Justice of Victoria, said on one occasion that the Australian Constitution was one of the weakest constitutions in the world. If that gentleman is acceptable to the Government as an authority on one branch of this subject, I trust that he will be equally acceptable and authoritative on another branch of it. Speaking in this House in  1912  on certain Constitution alteration proposals, he said - </para>

As long as you have the several States in complete independence in their governments, you adopt a scheme which is consistent with the federal idea, and, therefore, is not unification. But when in effect you give this Parliament complete -control over the acts of administration of the most important functions of the State Government, you are bringing about unification. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is an opinion against which, I submit, that expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine fades into insignificance. Although the greatest constitutionalist in history has referred to the democratic character of our Constitution, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> when speaking on this measure, said that our Constitution was foreign to the elements and aspects of democracy. To quote one sentence from a speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, as an expression of his opinion of the Australian Constitution, is merely a libel on the Constitution. </para>
                    <para>What did the Attorney-General mean when he said that the workers of Australia were hobbling along in chains? Was it a feeble paraphrase of the remarks of Karl Marx, who .some years ago said, " Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains"? How utterly inconsistent and inapt is a remark of that kind in this period of our history. It is capita], not democracy, that is hobbled now. To-day democracy rules this and practically every other country. There was a time when the workers were attacking their rulers and asking for some part in the government of the country in which they lived; but such a position does not now exist. I remind honorable members that an ordinary man is president of the German Republic, that Masaryk is in control of what was part of the realm of the Hapsburgs, that Mussolini is in authority in Italy; that a Labour Government is in p(ower in Great Britain, and a Labour Government is also in office in the Commonwealth. Does not that show how absurd it is for the Attorney-General to say that the workers are hobbling along in chains? Democracy is enthroned, and it is time for those who represent the democracy to cease mumbling and juggling with ancient shibboleths, and to put into operation the programme which they have promised their supporters. This " hobbling along in chains " is mere political hypocrisy which does not deceive anybody, not even the Minister, as it bears on its face both contradiction " and inaccuracy. </para>

                        <para>On the 1st January, 1901, when the Commonwealth Constitution was established by an act of the Imperial Parliament, there was not very much to show in the way of Australian union.- The Constitution, then, first, came into force as a legal document. It was a document which had been framed by the leading Australian statesmen and constitutional lawyers. Many of them were men not only of great experience in public affairs, but were keen students of constitutional matters, especially of the federal systems of the world. They had studied the United States Constitution ; they had studied what was then practically a recent work of Lord Bryce; they had studied the commentaries on the American Constitution by the great jurists - Storey and others - and also the more modern commentaries by the leading American lawyers. Further, they were familiar with the Constitution of Canada, which was a more modern example, and, in one way, more relevant to the subject, because it was an example of federation, under the Crown of the United Kingdom.  They had also studied the Constitution of Switzerland, and the Commonwealth Constitution bears evidence of some borrowings from that Constitution. Above all, they were familiar with the political institution of Australia, which they had been working themselves, and with the various principles and practices of those institutions. Therefore we must say that the main sources of the Constitution which was brought into force on the 1st January, 1901, were the American Constitution, the Canadian Constitution, and to a less degree, the Swiss Constitution, and to a very large degree, the Constitution of the various Australian colonies. </para>

The Commonwealth Constitution is a monument to Australia's public men who framed it, and I deprecate the action of vandal hands which seek to destroy it. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister, in giving reasons why, in his opinion, the Constitution should be amended, referred to the Harvester judgment and the new protection, the use of the naval dockyard for general purposes, Commonwealth Arbitration and State instrumentalities, the difference between the judgments in the Poggitt and Duncan cases, the variability of the interpretation of the High Court, the acquisition of land, and the definition of " industrial dispute." In regard to all those matters the right honorable gentleman contended that the powers of the Commonwealth under the Constitution had been found to be inadequate. He made much of the fact that there is a portion of land required for a sewage farm which the municipality of Queanbeyan, wishes to surrender, but the Commonwealth has no power to accept. He based his demand for an amendment of the Constitution on a trivial matter of that nature; one which is too absurd to mention in connexion with such important issues. </para>

                    <para class="block">I think honorable members on both sides of the House agree that those are matters upon which this Parliament should have power to legislate. I have mentioned the matters upon which the Prime Minister based his demand for an amendment of the Constitution, and those which the royal commission recommended should be handed over to the federal authority.I believe that if the Government submitted a proposal embodying an amendment of the Constitution to enable this Parliament to deal with those subjects about which there is general agreement there would be practically no opposition. If, for the time being, the Government discarded its first proposal, possibly some agreement between the parties with respect to industrial powers could be reached, with the result that a scheme acceptable to all could be submitted to the people. Ina ministerial statement delivered some time ago, the Prime Minister said that this Parliament should become an economic conference to consider the economic and financial position of Australia. Surely it might be regarded as a conference to consider the amendment of the Constitution. If there is one subject above all others upon which there should be no party feeling, it is that. Nevertheless the Government and its supporters have regarded this matter in a party light. </para>

                    <para>Other constitutions have been spoken of as worthy of study with a view to their adoption. It has been suggested that because certain things are done under them Australia should discard the federal nature of its instrument of government; but we have to remember that the conditions in this dominion are entirely different from those in countries such as South Africa, which have been cited by the Prime Minister and the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman).</inline> Our population is 98 per cent. British, and we are a homogeneous people; but in the South African Union, out of a population of 7,000,000, no less than 5,250,000 are black, and 1,750,000 are white. Surrounding the South African Republic are the two British protectorates of Bechuanaland and Swaziland, which comprise an area of 300,000 square miles and contain an additional coloured population of 750,000. With such a huge black population, within and immediately round its borders, how could South Africa have adopted any other Constitution than that under which it is working? That country to-day is endeavouring to evolve a British method of governing both the white and black races that are living in the same dominion. I sympathize with it in the great task in which it is engaged, and on that account I make some allowance for the attitude of General Hertzog, who is engaged in political pioneering work in a new form of government for a portion of the British Empire. I assert that no analogy can be drawn between the conditions in South Africa and Australia. New Zealand has also been cited as having a unified system of government; but that country cannot be compared with Australia. Comprising about 100,000 square miles its area is little larger than that of the State of Victoria, less than one-third that of New South Wales, and one-thirtieth that of Australia. The physical and social conditions of New Zealand and South Africa do not admit of the constitutions of those countries being regarded as examples that Australia should follow. </para>

                    <para>The. Government's proposal is that we should change the present method of making an alteration of the Constitution so that " after the lapse of one month from its origination in a House of the Parliament " it must be " passed by an absolute majority of each House of the Parliament and be assented to by the Governor-General." That would be a most drastic step to take, and it has been described by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> as almost audacious. And it is. Let me point out what it would actually mean. At the present time certain procedure is laid down in the Constitution as to how an alteration may be effected. A proposed amendment must be agreed to by a majority of the votes cast in the aggregate, and a majority must also be secured in a majority of the States. Thus the power to amend the Constitution is left to the people. But, by the bill that power is to be taken entirely from the people, and is to repose in the Parliament, which is to decide on any alterations it chooses, and later on, if it so decides, submit its proposals to the people. It is a catch cry with honorable members opposite who have spoken on this measure, that all legislative power comes from the people; that the people are all-powerful. If so, let the people decide these matters before Parliament adjudicates upon them, instead of turning the position round and allowing the Parliament, without authority from the people, to alter the Constitution as it wishes. Under the Government's proposal, an alteration would be submitted to the people after it had been made, and at the next general election. That is an undemocratic proposition, and one that no sound constitutionalist would admit. It is also one that no Labour Government, prior to the present Ministry, has ever brought forward. Until now it has never been suggested by the Labour party that this power, inherent in the people, should be taken away from them and vested in the Parliament. I submit that the attitude of the Government will require a good deal of justification before the electors will be prepared to endorse it. They will wish to know why this power should be taken from them, why any clique for the time being, why any oligarchy, why any section that may be returned to power for three years, should arrogate to itself the right to say that a power previously vested in the people should be placed in its hands. That is one aspect of the matter that will demand the keenest consideration of the electors, when these proposals are submitted to them. </para>
                    <para>We have been told that members of the Labour party are reasonable men, and the electors might well entrust them with this power. The Prime Minister, when speaking on the proposals, remarked: "What did we do in regard to the roads? Did we not give the States full power under the Roads Agreement?" Certainly, but that was purely a minor matter. That surely does not indicate to the people that, because the Government gave back to the State a power that should never have been taken from them, everything that the Prime Minister and his party may do in the succeeding years will be of the same simple character. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am impressed with the extraordinary inconsistency of the Government in regard to trusting the people, and I refer to it again. Apparently the Labour party is prepared to permit the people to initiate legislation, and, in certain circumstances, express their will by referendum, but in regard to the alteration of the Constitution, the people are to have no voice. That power of amendment is to be exercised by the people's masters - the Commonwealth Parliament, forsooth! The proletariat, from whom, honorable members opposite tell us, all power comes, is to be subordinated to this Parliament, and will be able to express itself at the periodical elections only after the elect of the people have done their will with the Constitution. One of the greatest obstacles that the Labour party will have to surmount, when supporting the referendum bills on the hustings, will be the proposal to make the Commonwealth Parliament paramount over the people. Parliament is to amend the Constitution as it thinks fit, whittle away the powers of the States, alter the whole constitutional face of this continent and then, two or three years later, go to the people and say, " This is what we have done." This is not in accord with the democratic spirit of the Australian people, and is opposed to the democratic professions of the Labour party. Honorable members supporting the Government will have difficulty in defending this proposal, particularly in Labour electorates. </para>
                    <para>The Labour platform provides distinctly for the abolition of the Senate, and both the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens)</inline> and the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> frankly admitted that to be the objective of their party. I invite the electors of the smaller States to note that clear enunciation of the Government's policy. The shield and buckler of the smaller States is equal representation in the Senate, and so greatly did they prize that protection that they insisted upon a provision being inserted in the Constitution that it should not be altered without a referendum of the people. The Labour party proposes now not only to destroy that safeguard, but to do so without consulting the people by referendum. Giving evidence before the Royal Commission on the Constitution, Professor Shann, of the Western Australian University, said " that at the present time there is a consolidation of power in the three small States to veto any amendment which would enlarge federal authority, but that veto will hold good only till New South Wales and Queensland be divided into new States." In other words, the protection of the smaller States is in the present composition of the Senate, but it will continue only until new States are created. </para>
                    <para>As further evidence of the real danger that threatens these States, I cite the remarks of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> at the recent Eight Hours Day dinner in Melbourne and the speech of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> in this House when defending the two referendum bills. Both emphasized the enormity of 600,000 voters in the three small States being able to prevent the carrying of a referendum. Nothing could be clearer than the intention of this Government to destroy the safeguards and protection which the small States were conceded when they consented to enter federation. The Government cannot justify this policy, because, so far, referendum proposals have been defeated, not by the small States, but by the aggregate vote of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">The preamble to the Constitution refers to the federation as " an indissoluble bond ". That phrase is used because the union was an honorable contract made by the various States, assuring all parties to the union of certain specified safeguards. </para>

The Commonwealth Labour party contains some representatives of the small States, and I cannot see how they can face the electors after voting for a proposal of this kind, in view of the statements I have quoted, and the arguments I have advanced showing what the abolition of the Senate would mean to those States. This proposal to alter the Constitution, so far as it affects the small States, is a dishonorable breaking of the federal compact. </para>

                    </continue><para>This proposal for the alteration of the Constitution is not even in accord with the Labor party's own platform. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kenneally, President</inline> of the Australian Labour party, and member for Perth, when giving evidence before the Royal Commission on the Constitution, agreed that power to alter the Constitution should be on the lines proposed in this bill, but added a number of provisions. He said that there should be power to alter the Constitution by an absolute majority to give effect to the will of the people declared at a general election ; and that uo alteration diminishing the proportional representation of any State, or the limits of a State, should become law unless a majority of the electors of the State concerned approved. It will be noted that there is no reference to a general election in the Government's proposals. The Labour party outside this Parliament obviously desires to protect the rights of the small States ; but no provision to that effect is included in the Government's bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kenneally</inline> also stated in his evidence that there should be no extension of the life of Parliament without referendum. There is no provision to that effect in the bill before the House. He also said that there should be no alteration of sections 8 or 30 of the Constitution without referendum ; that there should be no conscription for military or naval purposes; that all alterations should be submitted to the people at a general election not less than- two, or more than six, months after passing Parliament. There is a further proviso in his evidence that, if the Senate disagrees, the Governor-General shall put the proposed law at a general election by way of referendum. That is the declared policy of the Labour party, and it differs from the proposals which the Government has placed before the House as chalk differs from cheese. The two policies arc as wide apart as the poles, and I invite honorable members of the Government to explain the difference. </para><para>With regard to the position of the small States under federation, I propose to quote some evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maurice</inline> Blackburn, of Victoria, before the Royal Commission on the Constitution.

                        <para>My great objection is that two States are all the time out for financial concessions.

I would not give additional power to the Commonwealth as at present constituted, because I think the smaller States have too much say. I have the opinion that Tasmania and Western  Australia  are largely influenced' by the prospects of financial concessions from the Commonwealth Parliament - and I do not think it good for Australia for them to have one-third of the power of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>I do not sue any signs of what some people fear, or hope for, according to their political views: that i3, a tendency to depart from the federal form of government towards the unitary. I should rather describe what. 1 think the general feeling is at present, as being that in some respects it would be desirable to extend the federal powers with a view to obtaining more effective control over thu matters of federal jurisdiction; but I do not see any signs of such a weakening of State patriotism as would suggest that there is any desire on the part of the people of  Australia  to abandon the federal form and adopt the unitary form of government. Summing it up, <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> should say that, on the whole, the general scheme of thu Constitution is one which, both as to its federal nature and as to the principles by which the powers are distributed, and also as to the structure of the organizations of government, has worked satisfactorily, and docs not require any fundamental alteration; but thu points to which the commission might be well directed as regards amendments aru those questions as -to the allocation of powers in the directions that have been mentioned. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">That is the view I take. The phenomenal progress made by Australia during the last 30 years is clear and unmistakeable evidence of the satisfactory nature of the Constitution under which we have been working. When the history of the Commonwealth comes to be written, historians will stand aghast at the courage and fearlessness of 6,250,000 people and their achievements. All that is needed is means to amend the Constitution as required in directions upon which we can all agree. On the question of industrial powers, I am prepared to admit that national questions should be legislated upon by the National Parliament. That is a line of demarcation which can be definitely adhered to. I am impressed with the views expressed by the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> in his speech on the 1926 referendum proposals. He pointed out that the proposal to create organizations which would deal with arbitration and industrial questions was far better than one that would permit Parliament to do it. I have no desire to see every Commonwealth election turn on industrial questions to the exclusion of everything else, as would be the case if this full power of amendment for which the Government is asking were conceded. I would rather have some authority outside this Parliament dealing with industrial matters in a purely impartial and judicial way, free from the political atmosphere of this Parliament. This is not the body to decide whether a 44-hours working week should be adopted or not. </para><continue>

                        <para>.- Listening as attentively as I possibly could to the debate on the Government's proposals for the amendment of the Constitution, I have been deeply interested but not at all convinced, by the arguments put forward by honorable members opposite. One would think that the Government was proposing something likely to revolutionize Australia. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archdale Parkhill)</inline> is alarmed at the possibility of the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth passing into the hands of a few individuals. If Labour were' in power in the State of New South Wales to-day, its activities would be restricted by an Upper House, commonly called the Legislative Council, not one member of which is responsible to any one elector. The whole of the legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly in New South Wales is at the mercy of a nominee chamber. Labour did attempt to remove this anomaly, but the party to which the honorable member for Warringah belongs supports its retention, and yet he suggests that he is alarmed at what is likely to happen if the present Commonwealth Government succeeds in having its proposals carried by the people. There is no cause for alarm in these proposals. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Australia is at the present time in a state of stagnation. The present Government cannot be blamed, seeing that it has not been in office for more than a few months, but the party to which the honorable member belongs and which he applauds on every occasion, held the reins of office for six and a half years. That party is now in opposition, and we hear from it the cry that always emanates from an opposition when Labour proposes to do anything - that it will be detrimental to the best interests of the country. I wonder if honorable members opposite are actuated by any real regard for the bes interests of the country, or by their hatred of the Labour party. I believe they have satisfied themselves that no good can come from a government composed of members of the Australian Labour party. The present Government has already gone as far as it can under an obsolete Constitution, and now it is doing the next best thing. In a democratic manner it is asking the people to give it power to enact the legislation that it promised on the hustings would be enacted when Labour was returned to power. As to the fear of the honorable member for Warringah that the administration of affairs may pass into the hands of a few individuals, is it not better that the destiny of every man, woman, and child, and of every industry in the Commonwealth, should be in the hands of this deliberative assembly rather than in those of the justices of the High Court o'f Australia? It is absurd that such arguments as we have listened to against <inline font-style="italic">the?</inline> proposal should be advanced by men who are supposed to be learned. I should like the bill to be amended so that the following question may be submitted to the people: - </para>

O'Connor and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Downer. That was in 1898, I believe. Will any honorable member suggest that those gentlemen could draft a constitution to suit Australia for all time; or that if they were living to-day, they would not be prepared to cast it aside and replace it by another more adaptable to the circumstances of to-day? Is it not the rule in all walks of life that what has become obsolete is replaced by something that better meets the new circumstances that have arisen? </para>

The issues he considered fundamental were the franchise, conscription and religious liberty. Why should any honorable member introduce as a subject for discussion something which should be left severely alone? There is a time and place for everything, but this is certainly not the place for that sort of thing. Admitting, however, that they are fundamental issues, is there anything in the Government's proposals to suggest that they will not still remain fundamental? The Federal Constitution is by no means sacred. It is merely an agreement made by the people to protect more effectively their interests, and to extend their self-governing powers. There is nothing wrong with that. The proposals of the Government amount to this: that as conditions change, so also may the Constitution be changed. In industry, art or science, in fact, in every walk of life, the conditions of 30 years ago are no longer applicable. Would any one suggest that the original motor car built by Henry Ford would meet the requirements of modern motor transport, or that Stevenson's "Rocket" would handle the locomotive transport of the present day? I can speak with a practical knowledge because I am by trade, a boiler-maker of many years' experience, and I would not suggest that the boiler of twenty years ago would meet the requirements of the trade to-day. </para><interjection>

South Africa, Canada, and New Zealand are self-governing powers, but Australia, which it is claimed is the brightest jewel in the Empire's crown, is to be deprived for all time, according to honorable members opposite, of these self-governing rights. The position is absurd. If honorable members opposite were not such little Australians in sentiment and ideals, they would stand wholeheartedly behind this Government in its endeavour to place the Commonwealth Parliament in a stronger position to legislate for the people. It has been argued, and perhaps with some force, that, from the outset, the Constitution was drafted on entirely wrong lines. If the Constitution at the inauguration of the Commonwealth was inadequate to meet the needs of the time, how much more must it be inapplicable to present day needs. It is an anomaly that the central Government, which is supposed to be the supreme legislative authority in the Commonwealth, has not the power to deal with trusts, combines, or monopolies, and, as I have already remarked, it has not the power to legislate effectively with regard to trade and commerce. I, therefore, hope that the Government will consider the advisability of incorporating an amendment to ask for more complete legislative authority over trade and commerce. </para><interjection><talk.start>

It cannot even enact a uniform company law. The Commonwealth Parliament is supposed to represent the democratic ideal. I refute that statement, and say that the present Government is democratic in its ideals, but honorable members opposite are so obsessed with the obsolete Constitution under which a government supported by them attempted to govern for six and a half years that they are determined now to deny this Administration an opportunity, through these referendum proposals, to give effect to its policy. Their attitude is, I suggest, dictated more by a strong desire not to see anything accomplished by the Labour party rather than by a fear that the additional powers may be derogatory to the best interests of Australia. Tinder existing conditions, State Parliaments are unable to legislate in respect of certain industrial matters and the national Parliament also is powerless. Surely honorable members realize how unwise it is to maintain a costly National Parliament working under an obsolete Constitution that makes it subject to the dominion of the High Court ? How can any one suggest that with its restricted legislative powers the Commonwealth is an expression of our democratic ideals? </para>

The objections raised by honorable members opposite to the Government's proposals were, I believe, effectively answered  by  the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tully)</inline> when he said that the principal reason for the rejection by the people in 1926 of proposals to extend the industrial powers of the Commonwealth was that they feared an oligarchy, in the person of three High Court judges, would really control the industrial conditions of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned so much with the attitude of the present Prime Minister on that occasion as I am with the bills now before the House. Although honorable members opposite affect to see certain danger in the present proposals, they were prepared in 1926 to hand over sole control of all industrial matters to three members of the High Court Bench. All that we are now asking is that the people should vest this power in the national Parliament, which at present is absolutely powerless to legislate effectively in respect of industrial matters.1" Nobody knows this better than the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> The limited power vested in the Commonwealth Parliament has been reduced to a mere shadow by the decisions of the High Court. If we value industrial peace it is essential that we should vest the national Parliament with fuller powers to legislate for the settlement of industrial disputes. It must have the authority to prevent disputes from arising and spreading. It must also be able to deal with conditions that give rise to disputes, and it must have the power to make a common rule. It is necessary too, that the Federal Parliament should have full power to secure uniformity in industrial conditions throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>Some honorable members opposite take the view that it would be absurd to apply to Tasmania conditions obtaining in Victoria, or to make the industrial conditions of New South Wales applicable to Western Australia. When they raise such objections as these, they merely reveal their own lack of understanding of what is really the objective of the Government. I challenge any honorable member opposite to point to any Federal Arbitration Court judgment that has not been based upon the conditions governing industry in the particular State concerned. The court has always taken care that one State has no advantage over another. Unless our system of democratic government is to be a complete sham, the national Government must be vested with full legislative authority to come at once to death grips with those mighty organizations of capital which, on occasion,  seek to impose unfair conditions upon their employees. The second of the Government's proposals is closely related to the first. If the Government had power to deal with monopolies, combines and trusts, and had authority to legislate for uniform industrial conditions throughout the Commonwealth, I am firmly convinced that we should not have anything like the industrial unrest that exists to-day. When honorable members opposite want something from the Australian worker, he is a fine fellow; but in other circumstances he is everything that is bad. I defy contradiction when I say that the organized body of Australian workers is equal if not superior to any other organized body of men or women in any part of the world. It ill becomes the Opposition to criticize this Government for endeavouring, in a straight-forward, manly way, to improve our constitutional position, and so make it possible for our people to get a little more of the good things of life to which they are justly entitled. A good deal has been said in this Parliament since I have been a member of it, about patriotism and loyalty to one's country. There can be no greater disloyalist than an honorable member of this House who stands in his place here and disparages the men and industries of Australia. Our people are doing their utmost to develop this great country, and they should be encouraged to continue their good work. </para><para>The object of this bill is to clothe the Government with more adequate power to deal with the problems that confront the country. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> attacked the constitution of the Labour party, and accused it of departing from its platform. He also said that the Labour party proposed to extend the franchise to youths of eighteen years of age. I can find no reference to that in our platform, but I quote the following from it: - </para><list type="decimal-dotted">

                    </list><para class="block">Is  there any thing wrong with that? If we could give effect to that policy, we should do a good deal to advance Australia, but it is difficult to make progress under an obsolete Constitution. This Parliament is, at present, to a considerable extent impotent. </para><para>When honorable members opposite were sitting on this side of the chamber in the last Parliament they had a good deal to say about co-operation. Now they have an opportunity to show their bona fides, if they really desire the advancement of Australia they will support this bill. It would do us good to see a little of the patriotism, loyalty and adherence to democratic ideas which we are so often told are characteristic of them. We invite them to co-operate with us in this move to strengthen the constitutional position of the national Parliament. There never was a time when Australia needed harmony and a co-operative spirit more than she does to-day. On the 12th October last, the people indicated in no uncertain way what they thought of the previous Government's endeavour to tinker still further with their industrial freedom, and gave a definite opinion on the notorious Maritime Industries Act. In these circumstances one would expect the Opposition to assist the Government to carry out the policy of which the people approved. We look for a little more co-operation and expect a little less talk about the necessity for the workers working harder to produce more. It is absurd to say that our economic situation calls for more production. Production overtook consumption years ago. The country is crying out, not for more production, but for more consumption. </para><interjection>

I deny that either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> or the previous Government was guilty of a failure to redeem any promise to hold a constitutional session, in 1927, the Bruce-Page  Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into all matters affecting the Constitution. This was a necessary preliminary to a constitutional session. The commission consisted of representative mcn of great, ability. As might have been expected, their report was most valuable, but, unfortunately, the findings were not unanimous. It was impossible for the last Government to make any announcement of the dato on which a constitutional session would be held until the report of the commission was available, and it was not tabled until the 21st November, after the last general election. The Labour Opposition in the last Parliament no doubt felt that it was doing its duty in making it awkward for the Government to find solutions for our industrial troubles, and it was responsible for the failure to arrange a constitutional session. </para>
                    <para>The report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution contains a vast amount of valuable information, but there is no finality in it. One can find in it arguments to support almost any measure of constitutional reform. The report shows beyond all question the necessity for a more exhaustive examination of the economic position of the Commonwealth. It seems to me that that could only be made by a properly constituted constitutional convention. Honorable members opposite have said that no more representative gathering can be secured to debate such a subject than is constituted by the members of this House. </para>

It is almost impossible for this Parliament to discuss these problems without party bias. In the past, if a referendum asking for increased industrial powers has been proposed by the Labour party it has been opposed by the Nationalist party, and if proposed by the Nationalist party, it has been opposed by the Labour party.

The late Government has been charged with a breach of faith for failing to hold a constitutional session ; but this Government has the opportunity of employing any similar method to discover what the people desire. A few days ago I asked the Prime Minister the following question : - </para>

In these circumstances the Prime Minister would bc well advised to confine the appeal he promised to make by referendum to that one question. There was a possibility that, if the 1 'rime Minister had called representatives of the States into conference with him, agreement might have been reached as to the questions to be placed before the people, and upon which all parties might agree. Previous  experience  allowed that that, apparently, was the only way to effect a change in the Constitution, and that to introduce the wider question of unification would only confuse the issue and would delay a solution of the problem. Ho did not think there was any likelihood of the Commonwealth Government succeeding in its wider appeal for unification. </para>

I do not wish to unduly criticize the present Government, because I believe that its members, and those supporting it, are honorable men; but we have- to remember that there is an extreme element outside this Parliament which exercises unyielding pressure upon the party represented by honorable members opposite. Evidence of that pressure is seen on many occasions. One of the first lines of the Labour party's platform relates to the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> has dealt very fully with the Labour party's programme and I feel certain that the people of Australia are not prepared for the adoption of the Labour party's policy in its entirety. That is exemplified by the words I have quoted. It is true, of course, that unification could be brought about if this proposal were adopted. The Senate could be abolished, the life of Parliament extended, and a dictatorship established. </para>

There are, unfortunately, many men such as the Rhodes scholar to whom I have referred, and also among those representing the timber workers, who use discreditable language and who advocate violence. Many of these men are admitted to the councils of Labourorganizations. </para>

                    <para>Reports of the proceedings of the Labour Council in New South Wales show that the extreme element is gaining the upper hand in the counsels of the Labour party, and my complaint is that the professed political leaders of that party will not attempt to suppress it. As further evidence of that, we have the conduct of the present Labour Government during the dispute in the coal industry. I suggest that the action of this Government on that occasion was not such as to give the people an assurance that it would act wisely if consent were given to its proposal to mutilate the Constitution. It is regrettable that the Government failed to give its moral support to the New South Wales Government when a "Red army " was formed, and there were great possibilities of evil happenings in Australia. Under present conditions, when t he people are dissatisfied with a Government, they simply defeat its candidates at the polls. One can imagine the confusion that would follow if there we're  a  change of government following three years of administration by a Labour government that had been authorized to mutilate the Constitution, and was subject to the dictation of the extremists who are, undoubtedly, strongly represented in the Labour organization. </para>

If it were possible for a government to amend the Constitution in any way it desired from time to time, it could do almost anything. It could extend the life of the Parliament indefinitely, and eventually set up the dictatorship that we hear so much" about. The people must have grave doubts as to the way in which the proposed power would be used when they read in the press that the present Government has consented to the admission into Australia of a representative of Soviet Russia.

                            <para>- I would have no difficulty in connecting my remarks with the bill. We are all well aware that the Government, under the present proposals, is asking for authority to amend the Constitution in any way it desires, and I am pointing out, that if that power were granted, there would be hardly anything that this or any other government could not do. I do not suggest that the present Government in particular would be guilty of extreme action, but I am warning the people as to what might happen if complete legislative power was handed over to any government. </para>

                            <para>- I bow to your ruling. Unification has for a long time been one of the planks of the platform of the Labour party, but I think that it would be cowardly of any government to attempt to seek full legislative powers in an indirect way. According to my reading of the first bill, the people would not be given a proper realization of all that is desired by the Government. It would be much preferable to ask the people in a straightforward way for specific powers, stating exactly what the Government wishes to accomplish; the electors would then know what to expect. I recognize that the federal compact of 1900 was only a compromise. Few people regarded it as a grant of the whole of the powers to be exercised by the Commonwealth. It was understood that the arrangement then entered into must stand the test of time, and be modified according to the needs of the people. </para>

I am inclined to think that the Government might have more suitably framed the questions to be submitted to the people, so that they would "have had a better chance of acceptance. In his ministerial statement, when Parliament assembled recently, the Prime Minister referred to the serious difficulties confronting the people, and said that a proper realization of them should result in the whole-hearted ' co-operation of all sections. I think that the Opposition has given considerable evidence of its desire to assist the Government. A few days ago, the Prime Minister referred to the large amount of business that had already been done, and that result was undoubtedly achieved -with the sympathetic co-operation of the Opposition. That fact, apparently, is not fully appreciated on the Government side. On the contrary, we have this attempt by the Government to obtain authority to tear up the Constitution, and carry out contentious Labour policies.

In my opinion the 1926 proposals were preferable, because the people would not appreciate industrial matters being made a bone of contention at a general election. If that happened the party that bid highest in regard to hours and conditions of employment would probably be successful at the polls, although its policy might not be in the best interests of the people. </para><para>All political parties are agreed that an extension of the industrial powers of this Parliament is urgently needed. The allegation has been made that the last Government did not attempt to deal with this problem; the truth is that it made not less than six attempts to find a solution. The first was the referendum in 1926, which was defeated by the extremists on both sides, some representatives of Labour on one side, and some employers on the other side. If the members of this Parliament had actively cooperated and given a lead to the people the proposal of the then Government would have been carried. The second effort made by the Bruce-Page Ministry was the sending of a delegation of representatives of employers and employees to study industrial conditions in America. Heavy expenditure was incurred and every opportunity was afforded the delegation to obtain the latest information and study industry from the points of view of the employer and the employee. </para><para class="block">Although reports were submitted by the delegation to Parliament, they failed to discover a solution of our difficulties. The third attempt was the convening of an industrial peace conference of representatives of workers and employers. But the Australian Workers Union, one of the strongest Labour organizations in the Commonwealth, refused to participate and the conference failed. The Government next introduced a comprehensive amendment of the Arbitration Act, but unfortunately its merits were never fully tested. The fifth endeavour of the Bruce-Page Government was an appeal to the State Governments to surrender voluntarily to the Commonwealth the necessary industrial powers. That the States refused to do, and the only alternative remaining was to endeavour to induce the State Governments to take over from the Commonwealth the greater part of the federal jurisdiction in industrial matters. The Government took what it believed to be the proper course, but the electors did not appreciate the merits of this action and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> and his ministry were defeated. It is clear, however, that the last Government explored every possible avenue to establish peace in industry, and it did something which so far the present Government has failed to do; it consulted with the then Opposition with a view to the framing of a question that both sides in politics could recommend to the approval of the people. Honorable members will recollect that in 1926 the Bruce-Page Government consulted the then Leader of the Labour Opposition in regard to the questions to be submitted to the people; certain amendments were made to the Government's proposals, and in their altered form they were carried almost unanimously in both chambers. </para><interjection>

Honorable members are capable of influencing public opinion. In 1926 wo told the people that the proposed increase of federal powers would save the country; our opponents adopted a hostile attitude, and the proposal was defeated. If on this occasion the position is reversed, and those who previously supported this appeal for increased powers now oppose it, the people will become disgusted with the parliamentary institution. The Government might reasonably act upon the advice of some of its supporters that constitutional amendments should bo considered from a non-party stand-point. So far the Government has not consulted the people by means of n convention, or attempted to ascertain the views of the State Governments or convened a gathering of employers and employees in order to reach a decision as to what proposal would be most acceptable to all interests. I see little possibility of the power of amendment referendum being carried, and the success of the second proposal will be gravely imperilled because of the opposition that will necessarily arise from a section of the House. It would bc <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> great pity if the money expended on the referendum were wasted because of the absence of unanimity amongst the parties in this chamber. Naturally, those who are politically opposed to Labour will say that the Government wants its own way, just, as in 1926 the Labour party said that the Nationalists wanted too much of their own way. Surely a compromise is possible by which the proposal to be submitted to the people will have a better chance of being carried, thus introducing a reform  which will be of lasting benefit to Australia. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> displayed a better spirit than was manifested by earlier speakers on the Opposition side. The speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> was a great disappointment to me; it was wholly hostile, and lacking in constructive suggestion.  His  attitude was much less generous than that adopted by the then Opposition in  1926.  On that occasion nearly all the Labour members signified their willingness to recommend to the people the increase in the industrial powers of this Parliament that was being sought by the then composite Government. [ regret that many Labour supporters in the country did not follow the advice of their representatives in this chamber, but  1.  can claim to have supported every proposal to extend the constitutional powers of the Federal Parliament. Therefore, it is with more than ordinary pleasure that [ approve these bills to ask the people to empower this Parliament to make all laws that are necessary for the good of the nation. Much has been said of the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution, which would lead one to assume that they brought to their task minds that were free and unfettered, but commonsense tells us that that was not so. They had to contend with violent criticism by many sections of the Australian people, by whom federation was regarded as a revolutionary step. Those men who framed the Constitution were not able to give effect to what might have been their own personal feelings. The report of the Commission on the Constitution deals with that point. On page  74  of the report, it states - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The main grant ot powers to the Commonwealth Parliament is in section SI. The grant is not based on abstract principles, but is the practical solution which commended itself to the framers of the Constitution in the light of the history and circumstances of Australia, and the need for compromise in order to reconcile divergent views and obtain agreement. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That does not suggest that the framers of the Constitution enjoyed unfettered powers, but rather that the Constitution as it stands represents not what they would have done, but what it was possible for them to do in the circumstances. It was a compromise, a reconciliation of divergent opinions. </para>
                    <para>It is said that this proposal represents a revolutionary change, but to regard a great change as something catastrophic and fraught with dire danger is not always a sign of wisdom; it is more often a sign of a parish pump mind. Those who have spoken against the proposal have done so mostly out of jealousy for the preservation of State powers. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> said that the carrying of the proposal might mean the death, or withering away, of State Parliaments. So far as my State is concerned, I hope he will enunciate that opinion from the house tops. It would do more than anything else to gain support for the measure. Honorable members should realize that there is a great change coming over the minds of the people. The last election, apart from showing what the people thought of our opponents, was a clear indication that they were not prepared to agree that any power should be taken away from this Parliament. Is it not possible that it also showed that the people are prepared to grant even wider powers to the Com-wealth Parliament? </para>
                    <para>A great deal of time has been spent in involved arguments and academic discussions about what might or might not happen if this proposal is carried. If it is carried, however,' it will not be because the people have been influenced one way or another by those arguments, but because the seeds of national unity, which were planted at the time of federation, have at last come into flower. It will be because the people realize that their material interests, as well as their national aspirations, can be best served by giving the Federal Parliament full power, so that the man in the street, seeking to know upon whose shoulders he can place the responsibility for his troubles, and to whom he may look for a remedy, may be able to turn to a legislative authority possessing full and undivided powers. If the people feel the need of such an authority all the thundering of all the pessimists will beat itself to pieces on the solid wall of public opinion. It will be on that issue, rather than on hair-splitting arguments, that  this proposal will be decided by the people. If it is carried it will be because the people feel that at last an opportunity has occurred to give to the National Parliament full and complete power, so that it may accept full responsibility for the government of the country. </para>
                    <para>It has been said that the needs of Parliament, and of the people, can be best served by making specific amendments to the Constitution. The changing needs of the country, however, and the varying interpretations of the High Court, have left the people and the parliamentarians, no matter how experienced, in some doubt as to where the powers of this Parliament begin and end. It is possible for the opinion of a single judge of the High Court to decide an issue as to whether a law of this Parliament shall be declared null and void. If a High Court Bench of six judges, when dealing with a constitutional interpretation, divide equally on the point, the opinion of the Chief Justice is then the deciding factor ; so that his opinion alone may be sufficient to nullify the wish of the majority of the people of Australia, and, possibly, the unanimous wish of both Houses of Parliament. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> in dealing with the proposals we are now considering, suggested that, in certain circumstances, Western Australia might secede from the Commonwealth. He seemed to suggest that there was no federal spirit in Western Australia. But it might be well to remind him, and others who might be influenced by his views, that Western Australia has been one of the most insistent advocates of increased federal power. In 1913 Western Australia was the only State which carried a majority for the proposals submitted. In 1913 Western </para>
                    <para>Australia carried the whole six proposals for giving increased power to the Federal Parliament. The honorable member for Swan further suggested that the effect of the tariff had turned the people of Western Australia against federation, and one might presume from his remarks that the protectionist policy is not viewed favorably in that State. Prior to federation, however, Western Australia was the greatest protectionist State in Australia. In 1898 the customs revenue of Western </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia was £5 8s. 8d. per head of population, compared with £1 12s. lOd. per head in Victoria, which was regarded as a protectionist State. Prior to federation the tariff schedule of Western Australia contained 1,042 items, compared with 917 in the Victorian schedule. Even after federation Western Australia continued to retain its customs duties for some time. The contention, therefore, that the Protectionist policy of the Commonwealth is likely to prejudice the success of the Commonwealth Parliament's request for greater powers: does not seem to be so well founded as the honorable member for Swan suggests. </para>
                    <para>I do not wish to dwell on the need for giving the Commonwealth Parliament greater industrial powers because during the last Parliament I spoke somewhat lengthily on the subject. I think it is generally, recognized, as the right honorable member for North. Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has said, that every party in this House at one time or another submitted to the people proposals intended to give this Parliament greater industrial powers. Whatever difference of opinion there may be as to the form in which the question should be submitted to the people, there can be very little difference of opinion about the urgent need for giving this Parliament these greater powers. There are, however,, other powers which this Parliament should have. I could enumerate quite a number, but one that stands out is the power to enact a. uniform company law. The decision in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Huddart Parker &amp; Coy.</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Moorehead</inline> has raised doubts as to the right of the Commonwealth Parliament to enact such a law, but it must be admitted - at any rate it is recognized by all who have any knowledge of the subject - that there is urgent need for uniform legislation in this direction. </para>
                    <para>When he was speaking on this bill, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> digressed from the main points of his argument to suggest that sinister motives were actuating the Labour party in its desire to secure increased powers for the Commonwealth" Parliament; but in the next breath he said that it was all bluff and that if the Labour party had the power it was seeking it would not know what to do with it. I do not know how he can reconcile the two statements. He also mentioned that the present Government had been a constitutional Government since it assumed office, but that it could not claim any credit for it. The slogan of the Bruce-Page Government at the 1925, 1928, and 1929 elections was that it was a constitutional Government, and that the Labour party could not be depended upon to observe the Constitution and the law. But now that Labour is in office, it is, according to the Leader of the Opposition, a constitutional Government, although it cannot claim any credit for it. Seeing that the honorable member now admits that what he told the people during those three campaigns was said with the ulterior motive of deceiving them, and in order to make them believe that the Labour party could not be entrusted with the task of administering the law, I think that for political decency's sake he owes some apology to Labour for having slandered it in the way he did. He said the other day that if the present Government had not intruded into the coal dispute it would have been settled long ago. My reply is that if his Government, backed by the State Government of New South Wales, had not intruded into the issue by definitely bestowing its sympathy upon, and throwing its support behind the coal-owners, the dispute would never have started. Had Labour governments been in office in the Commonwealth and in the State of New South Wales, and the coal-owners had been without that governmental sympathy they received from the Bruce-Page Government and the Bavin Government, there would have been no lockout. The honorable member's statement, therefore, falls to the ground, because if it had not been for the action of his Government and that of the Bavin administration, there would have been no dispute. </para>
                    <para>It has been suggested by an honorable member opposite that the deficits in the State railways are in some way due to the operation of federal arbitration awards. But the honorable member who made that suggestion displayed very little knowledge of the financial position of the State railways. Not half of the railway employees in New South Wales work under federal awards, scarcely any of the railway employees in Western Australia, and very few of those in Queensland. The best test of whether the State railways have been crippled by federal awards is the figures issued by the various Railways Commissioners. There are about 23,000 railway employees in New South Wales operating under federal awards, the biggest proportion of State railway employees who work under those awards, but last year the proportion of working expenses to revenue earned in New South Wales was lower .than it was in any other part of the world. According to the last figures supplied by the New South Wales Railways Commissioners, the proportion of working expenses to revenue earned was 76.36 against 78.20 in Victoria, 78.9 per cent, in the Canadian National Railwayssupposed to be one of the most efficiently controlled railways in the world - and 80 per cent, in New Zealand - where they are not troubled by federal awards - Western Australia, and the United Kingdom. What actually happens in New South Wales is that the annual interest bill absolutely prevents the railways from showing a profit. The railways are crippled not by the operation of federal awards, but by the effect of State legislation, and because of the manner in which the State Government has controlled its system. For instance, last year the total revenue earned by the service in New South Wales was about £19,500,000, of which amount £14,900,000 was spent in working expenses. The balance of the revenue was not sufficient to meet the interest bill, which amounted to £6,150,000, approximately half the cost of working the system. These figures give honorable members some idea of where the money is going. The State railways are not crippled by the operation of federal awards, but because of the Government's legislation, and because the railways have been controlled and in many cases built for purely political purposes. </para>
                    <para>We should consider these questions not from the point of view whether the people are likely to accept them, but rather whether it is expedient and desirable, as well as in the interests of the nation, that these extended powers should be given so that the National Parliament may be unrestricted in its legislative authority. It must be apparent that the governmental functions exercised by this Parliament have their roots right down in the economic heart of the nation. This is the Parliament which decides the tariff questions that are designed to assist our secondary industries; which decides the payment of bounties for the assistance of our primary producers ;  which  exercises supreme control over banking; and many other functions that vitally affect the lives of the people. In the circumstances, is it not desirable that this Parliament should have full legislative power  in  respect of all those industrial issues which have  an  important bearing upon the general welfare of the community, and should not the people now be given an opportunity to say whether the time has not arrived when this Parliament should be permitted to discharge its legislative functions  without  any hampering restrictions? If honorable members  w111  peruse  the report  of the royal commission  which  inquired into the coal-mining industry in New South Wales, they will find that that body has made extensive recommendations to the Government. That commission, I remind the House,  was  appointed  with  the consent, if not at the instigation, of the Bruce-Page Government. Because of our limited constitutional  powers,  this Parliament could not give effect to its recommendations if it  wished  to do so, I agree  with  many and disagree  with  some of the recommendations made by that body, and I feel sure that honorable members opposite  will  receive a great shock when they realize fully the nature of the recommendations made by the commission appointed with the approval of the Government of which they  were  supporters. The commission has recommended that the selling price of coal should be decided by a tribunal; that mines should be , closed down  when  necessary; that a levy should be struck on every ton of coal produced, and that action should be taken to restrict excessive profits being earned. It does not declare that evidence was adduced to show that excessive profits were or  were  not being earned, but the suggestion that control should be exercised to prevent excessive profits  from  being earned is a clear indication that at least there was strong presumptive evidence that some of the  colliery-owners  at all events, were making excessive profits. </para>
                    <para>Whatever may be our differences of opinion as to how far these proposals for increased constitutional powers should go, I believe every member of this House is agreed that this Parliament should be vested  with  additional  powers.  If he does not subscribe to this  view,  he is not fitted for his position as a member of this Parliament, because,  with  the exception  of that of Queensland, this is the only Parliament in Australia that is instantly responsive to the wishes of the people. The legislatures of all the other States are dominated by Upper Houses, the members of which are appointed either on the nominee system or are elected on a restricted franchise, and do not represent the  views  of the people. I submit, therefore, that this Parliament, which is instantly responsive to the people, should be vested  with  complete authority to legislate in respect of industrial matters. The people themselves will judge whether this Parliament acts  wisely  or  unwisely.  They  Will  give their verdict just as they did on the 12th October last. Within eleven months, large numbers of the people had completely changed their opinion as to the  wisdom  of their action in 192S,  with  the result that this Parliament immediately responded to the change in public opinion. </para>
                    <para>I understand that something has been said about this Government courting political popularity in regard to these proposals. Are not members of this Parliament elected to give effect to the wishes of the people, and if they make a mistake, are they not held responsible? We are here to tell the people, when the opportunity offers, what we think is best for them, and we leave the issue to them. Every member of this House is returned because the policy he advocates or the party which he represents is more closely in accord with the wishes of the people. </para>
                    <para>I hope these proposals will be approved by the House and accepted by the people. I do not know what amendments honorable members opposite intend to submit, but I hope that during the remainder of this debate the speakers from that side will show a fuller understanding of the intention of the Government. My views on this subject are well known, but they are not necessarily the views of every member of my party. I favour the abolition of State Parliaments and greatly extended powers being given to local governing authorities. I have stated my views on the public platform throughout my electorate on many occasions, and I shall do so again. I realize, of course, that wc are not likely to obtain the objective  in  a day, but I believe that whenever an opportunity offers, steps should be taken in this direction, so that eventually the Commonwealth Parliament may be vested with full authority to legislate in all matters affecting the general welfare of the people, and that parely domestic and local affairs should be dealt with by local governing authorities. </para>
                    <para>I hope that these proposals will commend themselves to the people of Australia. It has been said that this Government has been too cautious. Now the same people are saying that it has become too reckless ; but they .are confusing courage with  recklessness  In spite of what the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> has said, there is nothing obscure about this issue. The simple question is, in effect, " Are you prepared to give the Federal Parliament full power to make the laws which it considers to be necessary in the best interests of Australia?" </para>
