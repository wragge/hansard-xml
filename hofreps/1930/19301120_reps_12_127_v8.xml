                </para>
                <para>Prime Minister.) [2.31]. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave -</inline> The Government is deeply concerned at the serious position in which wheatgrowers and others dependent upon the wheat industry throughout Australia find themselves owing to the fall in wheat prices in the markets of the world, and Cabinet further considered the matter this morning. Early in the year the Government succeeded in having the Wheat Marketing Bill passed by this House, but it was summarily rejected in another place without Parliament being given an opportunity to reconsider the measure. The Bill provided all the machinery to enable wheat-growers to organize their industry on a national basis, and establish a central marketing board for wheat. Such organization would have been controlled by the wheat-growers, and would not have been subject to government control. </para>
                <para>Last week the Acting Minister for Markets, at the urgent request of two State Governments, some members of this Parliament, and numerous farmers' organizations, convened in Canberra a conference of Ministers of Agriculture and representatives of wheat-growers, cooperative and proprietary wheat distributing organizations, and flour millers, to discuss this great national problem. The conference was representative of every interest associated with wheat throughout Australia. It was hampered from the outset by the fact that there was no legislation on the statute-book which would enable the industry to take action in the present crisis. Three suggestions were made by the conference. One was a sales tax on flour used for Australian consumption, the proceeds of which would be used to pay a bounty on wheat. As we were assured by millers that the tax would be passed on, and would, therefore, increase the price of bread to the consumer, the Government could not adopt the proposal as a direct Government tax, at the present time, particularly in view of the large numbers of people out of employment and the reduction of incomes generally. The collection and distribution of the tax would have been very costly, and extremely difficult to administer. Further, the effect of a direct government sales tax on flour, we were assured, would be that the flour exported would be sold at a lower price than the flour used for Australian consumption. This, it was believed, would lead to the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Australian flour in oversea countries, a step 'which would seriously affect our oversea flour trade, which is very valuable, and give a setback to the flour milling industry, which provides considerable employment. </para>
                <para>Another suggestion made by the conference was that the Government should guarantee a price of 3s. a bushel at the railway siding, or, alternatively, fix the price above export parity for wheat for local consumption. This proposal could not be carried out because the Common-  wealth Bank, which was approached by the Acting Minister for Markets, was not prepared to make any advance on wheat in excess of80 per cent. of its export value, even if the joint guarantees of the Federal and State Governments were behind it. Of course, had the Wheat Marketing Bill been passed, the Australian Wheat Board and the State Wheat Boards, in consultation, would have been in a position to fix prices for wheat required for local consumption. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has no power to fix prices. </para>
                <para>The conference also asked that exchange should be allowed to take its natural course in the interests of the export trade. This is a matter under the control of the banks, but the Government is taking all practicable steps to improve the position in this direction, and is doing everything in co-operation with the State Governments and the financial institutions to alleviate the present very difficult position of the wheat-grower. Further, I am cabling to-day to the Prime Minister in London, asking him to arrange immediately for the Minister for Markets to proceed to Canada and America to consult with the respective Governments of those countries as to what united action might be taken with a view to bringing about some stability in regard to the marketing of wheat this year. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, I wish to make it. clear that the Government fully realizes the parlous position in which thousands of wheat-growers and country storekeepers find themselves in regard to this year's crop, and is most anxious to help in any reasonable and practicable manner within its power. To that end steps will be taken immediately to confer further with the Commonwealth Bank and State Governments in regard to finance for this year's harvesting. One of the most serious aspects of the problem is the insufficiency of finance to carry on planting and harvesting operations during the next year. This situation is now engaging the Government's attention, and wheat-growers can rest assured that everything possible will be done by the Commonwealth Government in cooperation with the State Governments and the financial institutions to alleviate existing difficulties. </para>

                        <para>- I could npt undertake to do what the honorable member desires, because there may be isolated cases in which a further investigation would show that the curtailment of a mail service was not justified. I made a' very full statement of the position, from the departmental point of view," the other evening. Some honorable members have had copies of that statement circulated in their districts. I cannot do more than make it clear that this course has' been 'adopted only because of the' financial' stringency. The department investigates each case fully before taking action. It would not be possible to make a general sweeping statement, such as that suggested by the honorable member, because of the occasional cases in which further consideration might alter the decision of the department. </para>

                        <para>- I can explain the position by quoting the reply given by an honorable gentleman now sitting in Opposition to a similar question asked by me when I sat on the other side of the chamber. The honorable gentleman then said that New Zealand was in an altogether different position from that of Australia, because there are no local refineries in that dominion, whereas in Australia there are the refineries of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and the Shell Company. He said also that it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the department to say whether the oil distributed by these two suppliers was refined locally or imported ready for use. I repeat that statement in reply to the question of the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>Before the last elections the Bruce-Page Government promised to refund petrol duty charged on petrol used in tractors and farm engines that do not run on roads. They failed to honour that promise, and recently they wiped out the clause in the tariff schedule providing for that refund on the pretext that they found it impracticable to put it into operation. The New Zealand Government on the other hand seem to have no difficulty in making the refund. Why should the farming community have to pay this road tax duty on petrol not used in engines running, on roads?. Nobody can justify the action of the Government in this regard. </para>

                        <para>- I have already said that the subject is not closed, and that the Government is prepared to consider any helpfulsuggestions from honorable members. I explained the position in regard to New Zealand, which was pointed out to me by the then Minister for Trade and Customs. I would remind the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> that he sat behind a Nationalist Government for years, but failed to getit to do what he now advocates. </para>

                        <para>- Because of the serious position in which wheat-growers now find themselves, since the defeat of the Wheat Marketing Bill by the Senate, the Government last week called together in conference at Canberra, representatives of all wheat interests to consider the problem. The conference failed to put forward any scheme which, in the opinion of the Government, could be adopted without adversely affecting trade and industry, taking into consideration the refusal of the Commonwealth Bank to advance more than80per cent. of the market value of wheat. The Government is still closely examining the position with the object of doing everything possible to assist wheatgrowers, and if the honorable member has any helpful scheme in mind to deal with the situation the Government will be pleased to consider it. The Acting Prime Minister in his statement to-day showed that the Government realized the seriousness of the position by stating that the Government would immediately confer further with the Commonwealth Bank and State Governments in regard to finance for the harvesting of this year's crop. </para>

                        <para>.- Ithas been asserted that this debate has been too greatly prolonged. I venture the opinion that the present financial position is the most critical that the Commonwealth has ever experienced, and that, therefore, any discussion upon it must be of very great value, not only to the members of this Parliament, but also to the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para>At the outset, I wish to state the real reasons for our critical financial position. We have to recognize that the existing distress is an effect, not a cause, and that it arose during the time that the Bruce Page Government occupied the treasury bench. I make that statement because the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> who within recent months has delivered a number of speeches to national organizations, informed the annual conference of the National Federation on the 23rd September of this year that in. the Commonwealth Parliament Labour members no longer blamed the late Government for the present position. That is contrary to a statement made in Melbourne on Tuesday last by the late Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the report of which reads as follows :  - </para>

(Applause.) Australia, deluded by a prosperity which had come to few countries, not unnaturally lost her head. There had been governmental, municipal, public, and private extravagance - extravagance practised by every individual, rich and poor.

                        <para>While the various component parts of the Labour party are trying to agree, it is worth while harking back to the days of a government which knew its own mind and carried out its policies in those directions in which it believed the people could best be served. The Government which is referred to is the Bruce-Page. Government in which the Country party co-operated to ensure that rural interests would receive the attention which their proved importance warranted. </para>
                        <para>From the countryman's point of view, the existence of that Government has been justified by the manner in which the funds of the Commonwealth were spent, alone; and the condition of the nation at the moment proves that every penny spent on country development was justified in a nation which depended so largely for its prosperity on the state of its primary industries. </para>
                        <para>An examination of the finances of that Government shows in a striking manner which no criticism can steal away, the interest, real and practical, which was shown in rural affairs. Let us examine the finances for the years 1923-4 to 1928-9 inclusive. This examination will show an expenditure of over £34,000,000 on country works - money spent solely in country development. £1,250,000 was invested in the Murray waters scheme; £3,720,000 on commencing the unification of the railway gauges, 'by linking Brisbane and Sydney with a standard gauge line and opening up thousands of acres of new country; £810,000 on wire netting for country settlers; £50,000 for health laboratories; £375,000 for the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway; £3.415,000 on the North Australia-Port Augusta railway; £1,070,000 on country buildings for the Postal Department; £11,400,000 for country telephones; £50,000 for country postal sites; £920,000, migration works; £7,750,000 on roads; £80,000 on bridges and bores in Western Australia; £30,000 in South Australia; and £50,000 loan to Papua, and £111,000 on lighthouses which was spent outside the city. In addition, £7.400,000 was spent on fleet construction, £1,500,000 on defence equipment, £4,000,000 on war service homes, and £400,000 subscription to Amalgamated Wireless for equipment, which also benefited the country. There is no answer to that as a record of rural administration. </para>

                    <para class="block">Apparently the whole of that expenditure was incurred with the intention of assisting rural development. According to information supplied by the Acting Treasurer, the money spent by the late Federal Government on the works mentioned was borrowed at £6 13s. 4d. per cent.

I find that the return in 1928-29 from the River Murray works, which cost £3,720,000, was only £65,000. There was no return from the roads expenditure, and none from the bridges and wharfs constructed in Western Australia and </para>

As I have said, the total return for these so-called reproductive works was only 4.47 per cent. In the circumstances it was disgraceful for the Country party to claim any credit for this expenditure. I cannot see how a single member or supporter of the Bruce-Page Government could boast about this expenditure. The writer of this bulletin must have a queer  sense of humour, or a poor opinion of the intelligence of the people who are expected to read it.

I am amazed that honorable members opposite who were members of the last Parliament should have the temerity to preach economy. But apparently they are now quite willing to out all expenditure, irrespective of the consequences, with a view to rectifying their own mistakes. It is just as reasonable for the members and supporters of the previous Government to preach economy as it would be for a cemetery worm to advocate cremation. </para>
                    <para>The Bruce-Page Government went on its reckless way in spite of the numerous warnings that were issued during its period of office.

In their introductory remarks, the authors said - </para>

                        <para>In the whole British Empire there is no more voracious borrower than the Australian Commonwealth. Loan follows loan with disconcerting frequency. It may be a loan to pay off . maturing loans, or a loan to pay the interest on existing loans, or a loan to repay temporary loans from the bankers. The British public, kept in splendid isolation by the financial advisers of the Commonwealth and States, has no means of judging one loan from another. The law of England once again assists the debtor by admitting without question Australian with other colonial loans as trustee securities. There is even an idea current with uninstructed investors that colonial loans are guaranteed by the British Government. The way is thus made dangerously easy for colonial borrowers. Without conceding a line of information, or any measure of protection to the lender, they get the money they want when they, want it. No dominion takes such full advantage of these unique opportunities of raising cash as the Australian Commonwealth. But is the system safe? Are trustees in this country justified in continuing to hand over a large proportion of the nation's savings to such reticent and pertinacious borrowers? It is, in fact, high time to ask the question - Is Australian finance sound ? </para>
                        <para>The answer must depend upon the rate at which Australia has been borrowing since the war, the proportion of the national wealth that has now been mortgaged, the present rate of expenditure, and above all the purposes for which the loans are raised, and the steps that are being taken to reduce' the debt by the provision of adequate sinking funds. These questions answered, it will remain to consider the financial position in relation to the economic development of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth expenditure out of loans also contains some interesting items. For example, there is a subscription to the capital  of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries, Limited, amounting to f 31 8,750 for the period 1920 to 1925. This money was apparently subscribed in order to fight the established oil-importing companies. Commonwealth Oil Refineries, Limited, was formed in 1920 to bring into effect an agreement made between the Commonwealth of Aus'tralia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the import and refining of Persian crude oil and the marketing of the refined products. This State trading scheme naturally brought the Commonwealth Govern-i ment into competition with the private commercial interests. In consequence the Statecontrolled company disclosed a loss on its 1925 operations, amounting to £53,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> talks of "exploitation", and charges the oil companies with selling at exorbitant prices. Yet the heavy loss sustained by Commonwealth Oil Refineries, Limited, in 1925, was incurred when selling petrol during the whole of that year at the same prices as those charged by the large oil companies. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> has now committed the Commonwealth Oil Refineries, Limited, to the policy of slightly underselling the private importer, and anticipates another loss for the State oil company in 1926. Is the Federal Government justified at all in raising money in this country to be used in uneconomic competition with legitimate private enterprise in which the British investor is interested? <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Although honorable members  opposite, who were supporters of the last Government, may disclaim all responsibility for the financial difficulties which are now facing the country, they cannot disclaim responsibility in their capacity as members of this Parliament. They should, in the present circumstances, be doing everything possible to improve the credit of the nation; but they are doing the very opposite. I regret that upon three occasions the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has made remarks in this House which have seriously damaged our credit. It has always been the custom, when speeches have been made in the chamber in connexion with the death of members or former members of the Parliament, carefully to exclude from the proceedings of the' day all party bitterness, and to adjourn immediately after the speeches have been delivered. This is in keeping with the requirements of common decency. But upon one such occasion recently the Leader of the Opposition, on the motion for the adjournment of the House as a mark of sympathy with the relatives of certain deceased ex-members of the House, made a vigorous attack upon the Government, and incidentally seriously injured the credit of the country at the time when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was trying, overseas to improve our financial position The honorable gentleman could, at least, have waited until the following Tuesday to launch his attack. He was guilty of a breach of respectful precedent that cannot be condemned too strongly. The conduct of the honorable gentleman reminded me- of the actions of those cemetery touts who disturb mourners at the graveside, ' endeavouring to obtain orders for <inline font-style="italic">in</inline><inline font-style="italic">memoriam</inline> printing. It. must he remembered that the Leader of the Opposition has behind him a very great sounding board, the Nationalist press. I read the daily edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and frequently I find therein cabled reports, of the honorable gentleman's remarks.  They generally affect Australia's credit adversely. </para>
                    <para>The other reprehensible action was his questioning of the Acting Prime Minister concerning resolutions alleged to have been carried by the Labour caucus. The honorable gentleman again did his utmost to injure our national credit. It can be safely  assumed that no newspaper report of caucus happenings can be trusted, as it emanates from the mouth of a traitor from a polluted source. No decent man would betray his party. </para>

                    <para>The matter of inflation has been made a prominent issue in this debate. Undoubtedly deflation has proceeded too far. Unfortunately for the people of Australia, the gold standard was re-estab lished before the nation was prepared for it. The immediate, effect was a grant of £330,000 to bondholders as the money was lent at a time when our £1 was worth from 13s. 6d. to 14s. That is well known to any student of economics. When at Colombo, I had the experience of obtaining an Australian £1 note and 7s. in silver for a sovereign that I exchanged. It was recently stated that the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Coleman)</inline> could obtain only 12s. in New York for our Australian £1 note. By its premature re-establishment of the gold standard the Bruce-Page Government increased the actual debt of the Australian people by one-third, and gave that tremendous grant to the bondholders. In addition the rate of interest was increased from 5 to 6 per cent. Apart from the need of gold in the community, we should be justified, as a matter of equity, in paying bondholders the value of their loans to the country. It is unfair that, because of the machinations of some stupid financiers who temporarily, occupied the treasury bench, we should be called upon to pay 20s." for every 13s. 6d. that was contributed. </para>

I am surprised  that  the business men among honorable members opposite do not realize that our troubles are due mainly to the severe contraction of credit. Many persons in business are hampered in their operations because of the difficulty they experience in securing accommodation. I do not blame the trading banks, because I believe that they have done everything in their power to meet the situation, and that some institutions, having made almost unprecedented advances against deposits, are in a position of extreme peril. It has been reported that the advances made by one of the trading banks represent 116 per cent, of its deposits; an unprecedented and most unsafe position. Nevertheless, it is almost impossible for business men to secure the accommodation which they require to carry on their businesses. I heard of one man, who had the utmost difficulty in obtaining an advance of £400 against security worth, at least, £2,500. </para>

                    <para>Credit is the life-blood of the community. Practically all businesses are conducted on bank overdrafts. If a business man is unable to obtain finance, his business becomes absolutely disorganized. We are in our present position through causes that are beyond our control. All financial authorities are agreed that the gold  supply  of the world is not adequate for the requirements of all countries, but if, by a lucky chance, we made an overwhelming gold discovery in Australia, or if a mountain of pure gold' were reported in the South Polar regions, gold would then be a drug on the  market  and, possibly, we should have to discharge our obligations by paying 30s. in the £1. Gold is merely a token of value, and since there is a world-wide scarcity of the precious metal, it is obvious that, in our present difficulty, we would be justified in adopting some other expedient to oil the financial machinery of the nation. The shortage of gold in this country is becoming very acute. Recently, our reserves were reduced from £22,000,000 to £15,000,000. In 19.24, when I was in London, there was an extraordinary shortage of copper. To meet the situation certain business firms were allowed to issue tokens of their own as emergency currency until the supply of copper again reached normal dimensions.

I would remind the honorable member that, because morphia is in certain circumstances administered to a patient and is of proved efficacy, it would be extremely foolish to withhold .the remedy merely because of the fear that it might be abused. The same argument might be applied to a policy of currency inflation as a cure for the financial illness of a nation. It is admitted that the present crisis is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth. It is also admitted that it is due, in large measure, to the deficiency in the gold resources of the world. It would seem, therefore, that inflation of the currency is necessary. As to the future, I trust that, if I am in a position of responsibility, I shall have enough courage to stand against any attempt to carry the policy beyond a. reasonable margin of safety. </para>

                            <para>- That would be determined, I suggest, by the volume of reproductive works necessary for the development of the country. If the proposal pf the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> had been submitted without attachments or conditions, I believe it would find general acceptance among the majority of Government supporters. Currency does not consist only in bonds, notes or coin ; it includes anything that can be used for barter or exchange. It may, therefore, comprise bonds, banknotes, bills-payable at sight, cheques, or coin ; and if one form of currency is replaced by another, it does not necessarily follow that there is inflation. Bonds, payable to order, are used very often as portion of the purchase money in business transactions, because, being payable to order, they pass from hand to hand. Australian war gratuity bonds were accepted by many life insurance companies in payment of premiums, and in that way they became part of the currency. We require immediately to borrow £28,000,000, and this is an opportunity to inflate credit by withdrawing a certain amount of one form of currency and substituting a more liquid form.' If I were Treasurer I would ask the Commonwealth Bank to institute credits for that £28,000,000, and the investment would be reproductive because the sinking fund contribution at compound interest - would wipe out the whole of the debt in 13£ years, and the Commonwealth would not have to pay any interest outside Australia or at all. That form of inflation will, I trust, yet be adopted by the Commonwealth Bank, when it takes up a large part of the proposed loan. </para>

The Leader of the Opposition could not have studied the history of the British national debt, or he would not have stated that the Government's proposals are unprecedented.

                        <para>It was proposed in the budget of 1914-1915 to reduce the fixed debt charge to £23,500,000. On the outbreak of war, however, the payment of the new sinking fund was suspended, with the exception of £1,000,000 applied to the redemption of drawn exchequer bonds. The suspension continued up to the end of 1920, but the new sinking fund was resumed for the two following years. In 1922-1923, as a temporary measure, the new sinking fund, was again suspended, and in the following year the basis was entirely altered. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the whole contribution was suspended. The Commonwealth is not proposing to suspend its § per cent, contribution to the sinking fund, but merely to divert to the relief of the current budget any German reparation payment received during this year, and half of the profits of the Commonwealth Bank. The new sinking fund now in operation in Great Britain will not pay off the national debt in less than 153 years, while ours will be extinguished in 35 years. One of the recommendations of Lord Colwyn's committee was-  that instead of £50,000,000 that is now applied to the redemption of the national debt, the amount should be increased to £75,000,000 in order to reduce the term in which the debt would be liquidated. Even if the German reparation payments and. the profits of the Commonwealth Bank be deducted, Australia will still be paying more towards the reduction of its sinking fund in accordance with the loan prospectuses than the United Kingdom is paying. </para>

                        <para>.- I was very pleased to hear the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> disapprove of any scheme of government borrowing for the purpose of .competing with private enterprise, and I hope that nothing of that kind will be attempted by the present Ministry. I was sorry, however, that he declared that the interesting statements published in the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily,</inline> regarding the doings in caucus, came from a polluted source. </para>

                            <para>- I did not imagine that a journal which is supposed to express the opinions of honorable members opposite would be guilty of publishing tainted information. I suppose the honorable member means that somebody " blew the gaff." But is it not fortunate that the people should be able to know, even from a polluted source, that after the leader of the Labour party had announced in Parliament the policy of the Government, some of his supporters are prepared to stab him in the back ? Undeniably, Australia is in a very bad financial position, and there is no doubt as to where the responsibility lies. For eight years . I reiterated in this House the warning that we were living in a fool's paradise, and that it was imperative that we should conserve our resources, put our house in order, and endeavour to live within our means,, instead of being dependent upon- borrowed money. The trouble has now become so acute that it is the bounden duty of every one of us -to face the facts courageously, and take the public into our confidence. It is useless to withhold the facts; let us realize the seriousness of our position and consider how we all can work together to restore our country to its old position of solvency. Had the Government tried earnestly to carry out the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister before he left for Europe, and still advocated by the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> ; had it shown a clear determination to reduce expenditure and make the Commonwealth live within its means, it might not have succeeded in balancing the budget this year, but it would have gone a long way towards doing so. No such effort was made, but that should have been the endeavour of every section of the community. When hundreds of thousands of our people are unemployed and suffering misery and starvation, it behoves all of us to cooperate in winning back prosperity for the nation. An ailing man, if he is wise, does not consult the newspaper advertisements for quack medicines; he seeks the best medical advice. When a country is financially ill it should act on the advice of financial experts, and not rely on the nostrums prescribed by raw students, mere neophytes in economics. I say that without desiring to be offensive to the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> whose sincerity I do not doubt. He has been carried away by his reading of certain financial theories. I, too, have endeavoured, by reading, to learn something of the intricacies of finance; but I confess that I know very  little about the subject. At the head of our financial concerns, however, are men whose whole life has been devoted to the study of finance and economics, and by their advice we should be guided. Unless drastic steps are taken to put the finances in order, honorable members may find, in addition to the proposed reduction of 10 per cent, in their salaries, that no cheques are available for them at the end of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> month. It will be necessary, also, to make a big reduction of the salaries of all members of the Public Service. The present is the time for decisive action. Imagine giving the maternity allowance to families with incomes of £l,i&gt;00 or <inline font-style="italic">£2,000</inline> a year.' Such a measure should not be permitted to remain on the statute-book unamended. I have always opposed it. If this payment is to continue the allowance should be limited to those in receipt of not more than £300 per annum. In that way a considerable saving could be made. Many of the regulations relating to the Public Service, such as the rule under which an official stationed, say, in Melbourne, and travelling to Canberra, receives overtime rates, should . be amended, with the object of effecting economy. </para>

I do not say that the present Administration is more responsible than any other government; but everybody recognizes the critical position into which Australia has drifted, and extravagance in government expenditure must be stopped. Had all possible reductions been made a couple of months ago, we should not have had the slightest difficulty in funding the £37,000,000 of Commonwealth debt in London, which is proving a great incubus ; and the financial problems of Australia would have been much less difficult to solve than they are now. </para>

A considerable amount of bartering has taken place between the dominions and Great Britain; but when the maintenance of the Imperial connexion depends upon bartering of the kind that has been witnessed lately, we shall have reached the parting of the ways. We value our kinship with the people of Great Britain, and we desire to continue to be part of our great Empire; but if Australia, Canada, and New Zealand rely on the granting of trade concessions for the maintenance of the bonds of Empire they are looking for trouble. What right has Australia to interfere with the policy of Great Britain? In framing our tariff we willingly made certain concessions to Great Britain, and as the result of private representations, concessions were granted by Britain in return. We have the Canadian Prime Minister asking Great Britain for duties on foodstuffs, and offering certain preferences. If the recent elections in Canada had resulted differently, or if the Imperial Conference had been held six months earlier, we should have had the spectacle of the Prime Minister of Canada advocating absolute freetrade between Canada and Britain. Now we see the Labour Prime Minister of Australia joining forces with the Conservative Prime Minister of Canada in an effort to induce the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain to grant preferences to the dominions, which would increase the cost of living and of the raw materials required for manufacture. This, Great Britain could not afford; her position to-day is more than difficult. </para>

Would he have allowed this drift to continue, or would he have called Parliament together, and pointed out that the revenue from customs and excise would probably be from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 short of the estimates ? He would not have played for a party gain in New South Wales. There was no excuse for the delay for which this Government is responsible. Months have been allowed to elapse, and, in four months, deficits have accrued to the extent of £16,000,000.

                            <para>- Surely this shows to what depths the party would descend no matter what the cost to the country. At the conference with the State Premiers, the several governments there represented, the Commonwealth and the State Governments, declared their fixed determination to balance their budgets this year, and maintain similarly balanced budgets in future years. The only way to do that is by reducing expenditure. I admitted in July that increased taxation was necessary. I do not approve, as a rule, of placing heavier burdens on the people, because they are called upon to meet too much taxation at the present time; but, in the circumstances, there is no option in the matter. Here was a definite promise that the various Federal and State budgets would be balanced, and yet no attempt to square its finances has been made by the Commonwealth Ministry, except by a slight reduction of expenditure in the Defence Department, and a small saving in connexion with members' salaries, and the remuneration of the higher paid officers of the Public Service.

                    <para>The depreciation of Commonwealth stocks is one of the results of the delay that has taken place - a delay due entirely to a desire to keep the true position from the people of Australia until after the New South Wales election. Australian 5 per cent. stocks, due in 1955, stand at £76 or £77 in New York, while Canadian stocks bearing the same rate of interest and payable about the same time, stand at £105. The reason for that difference is, not that Canada is a better country than Australia is, for Canada cannot be compared with Australia in natural resources; the relative values of Australian and Canadian securities are due to other and deeper causes. </para>

                            <para>- I blame that Government for having depended too much on borrowed money, and for not having abandoned the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and left the control of industry to the States. I feel sure that, were the Commonwealth to vacate the field of industrial legislation, good results would follow. The position to-day is that we are drifting towards repudiation <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> default. One would have expected that in a crisis of such magnitude the members of the Cabinet would show a solid front; but, according to press reports, members of the Cabinet - I refer to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> the Assistant Minister for Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> and theVice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Daly)</inline> - played the part of Judas to their own leader. The Minister for Health is reported to have moved the following motion at a meeting of the caucus: - </para>

                            <para>- Some further taxation is necessary, although the burden of taxation is already almost intolerable. Last year Commonwealth and State Parliaments, through taxation and all sources extracted £193,000,000 from a little over 6,000,000 people; and even then we were £6,000,000 to the bad. This year it will be necessary to impose still heavier taxation. It must not be forgotten that when the people are taxed in this manner, money is diverted from avenues of production, and that, without further production, we must expect an even worse time. A determined effort must be made to reduce governmental expenditure in order to leave more money with the people to be used in the production of wealth. The position of a nation is not ' different from that of an individual. An individual who spends more than he earns inevitably meets with trouble. If we continue to extract from the people huge sums of money each year for governmental purposes, there will be less money available for investment in primary and secondary industries. No person will willingly continue in production unless he sees a possibility of a margin of profit. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member's deductions were based on fictitious values. On the basis of values in 1911 production in Australia has decreased per head of the population. That is not because machinery has not been available to assist the primary producers; it is due to the existence of legislation which engenders antagonism between employer and employee. Canadian statistics show that, generally, wages are from 25 to 50 per cent, more than they are in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The reason is the refusal of the trade unions to allow men to be paid according to the value of their output. The worker should realize that his interests and those of his employer are identical; that co-operation between employer and employee is essential to the success of both. Unfortunately, the present trouble in the meat industry is evidence that that co-operation does not exist. It is indeed strange that in a country noted for its industrial legislation, there is so much industrial chaos. I have here some statistics relating to the railways of the United States of America, which show that railway workers there employed on an hourly basis, averaged 2s. 91/2d. an hour for a day of eight hours, and that the average wage last year of men paid daily rates increased from 34s. 6d. to 35s.1d. a day. The figures also show that freights are considerably less than they are in Australia for all goods, with the exception of wheat. </para>

America has some £S02,000,000 of gold in its vaults. France has, in the last four years, increased its holdings of gold from £165,000,000 to £330,000,000. The Argentine has £97,000,000 of gold. That is far more than is needed by those countries. It was the desire of the economic council of the League of Nations to get rid of the present position by- establishing something in the nature of an international central bank, whose function would be to arrange credits. But that position should not affect Australia. "Wo cannot help the depression so far as the low prices ruling for our primary products are concerned. We have had some wonderful years since 1920, and good prices have ruled for our products. But large sums of borrowed money have been brought into this country, and that has mostly been responsible for the financial difficulty in which we find ourselves today. We have to proceed carefully in our legislation, particularly in regard to the tariff, to avoid killing our two great basic industries - wool and wheat - which are of such enormous value to Australia. The gold-mining industry has been killed because of the high cost of mining. We have, in Australia, large bodies  of  ore - -I am not speaking of base metals, the world's prices of which are low - which, if, in any other country, would have been profitably developed. We are doing a dangerous thing in raising the cost of production so high as to make it impossible for- our basic industries to carry on.- If we destroy those industries the cities will collapse like houses made of cards. There are in the large cities enormous agencies and business houses. But is there one thing manufactured in them that could not be done without by the primary producer? I admit that cities are essential. I like to see a beautiful city. But it is wrong to shelter the city people to such an extent- that the balance that should exist between city and country interests is destroyed. </para>

                            <para>- The whole thing is damned immoral ! I have read the motion that was submitted by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> to caucus and approved by it, and a further motion by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> that a demand be made on the Commonwealth Bank Board to underwrite a loan of £27,000,000,. .,and that in the event of it failing to doso, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey's</inline> motion be given effect. When the honorable member for Fremantle spoke subsequently in this House he said that the Commonwealth Bank might he persuaded, directed, or encouraged to underwrite the loan.  I  feel exceedingly pleased that when the Commonwealth Bank Act was being amended in 1925,I noticed that the original act, under section 60p, gave power to the Commonwealth Treasurer, if he thought fit, to supersede the Note Issue Board. I drew attention to it, and finally had it repealed. Had that section not been repealed, the Acting Treasurer would now have been able to'- supersede that board. The honorable member for Fremantle in his speech recommended three things - the unpegging of exchange, the balancing of the budget over a period of years, and the issuing of notes to the extent of £27,000,000. Respecting the unpegging of exchange, I understand that that is being done by the banks to enable them to carry out their promise to the Government to provide £3,000,000 monthly to meet Commonwealth debts. We must assist the primary producers, and there is no doubt that they should get the full value of the exchange. Then respecting the balancing of budgets over a period of years, let me say that we cannot balance the budget this year. That is an impossibility. </para>

In doing that we incurred an enormous debt, which will be a burden upon our people for generations  to come. We did that willingly in the cause of liberty. Our one object was to defeat the enemy. Surely honorable members opposite must realize how entirely different are the present circumstances; yet they wish to plunge again into the same species of inflation. Their desire should be to increase production and add to, instead of destroy, the national wealth. Our one great object should be to find employment for our people!, and bring prosperity to our country, and that cannot be done by inflation.

                        <para>Different emergencies call for quite different measures. Australia is facing, not, a war, but an economic and financial emergency. The exhaustive and destructive measures of war are precisely those that would be fatal to economic restoration; the inflation of the war is a warning of what to avoid, not an example to be followed. There arc also some special considerations which make inflation now peculiarly dangerous. In the war, the inflating countries all started from sound economic conditions - their credit was good, their currency was stable. Their debts were comparatively light; their people had large accumulated savings; there was little or no demand for money, except for war purposes - industry, except for the war needs, was to a great extent suspended, and the people were compelled to do without ordinary consumers' goods. All this helped inflation to work, gave it a longer lease of life before it exhausted itself. Our conditions in Australia are wholly different. Our credit is strained, our currency is depreciated; wo are already in a state of inflation. Our debts are heavy, and there are none of the war-time restraints on demand. All these things diminish immensely the power of a community to resist the perils of inflation; they bring its evils more swiftly, as is shown by the fact that it was after the war, rather than during it, that currency depreciation became catastrophic in France, Italy, Germany and Austria, the most inflated countries. Add to this two other factors: First, during the war and for some time afterwards, inflation was almost world-wide and prices were rising everywhere; to-day, the world process is reversed, and a country which inflates is complicating its international trade and ruining its foreign credit: as its currency depreciates in terms of foreign currencies, it becomes increasingly difficult for its government to meet payments abroad. The second factor is this : The value of " credit " depends on general confidence in it. Now the recent experience of several countries has opened our eyes, and the eyes of all the world, to the inevitable tendencies and disastrous results of inflation. The necessary "psychology" for its success is absent; its perils are so notorious that the fear of it is exercising already a pernicious effect in our business and in our foreign credit. The descent is immeasurably steeper for us than it was for our forerunners. </para>

                    <para class="block">What is meant by inflation? I say at once that notes may be issued by the banks, but only on the creation of wealth. If large quantities of notes are used merely to provide labour that will not give any return, the lowest level to which inflation can bring a nation must inevitably be reached. Last night the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. ' Morgan)</inline> pointed out how dangerous a policy of inflation would be to- friendly societies, life assurance companies, savings banks and other institutions which have the custody of the savings of thrifty members of our community.  We cannot afford to take that risk. We must ask ourselves where we are likely to end if we depart from sound financial methods. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harrison</inline> Moore goes on to say - </para>

                        <para>It is to government we must look, because the mischief is in government and its measures. The essential for prevention of inflation, as the essential for escape from the wreck that it makes, is the balancing of expenditure by revenue. One of the earliest publications of the League of Nations contains a memorial, presented in 1919 to the Governments of seven European countries and of the United States, by groups representing all political parties and all economic interests (signed in Great Britain by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> among Liberals, Lord Robert Cecil, among the Conservatives, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clynes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> of the Labour party). It says : " There can be no social or economic future for any country which adopts a permanent policy of meeting its current expenditure by a 'continuous inflation of its circulation and by increasing its interest-bearing debts without a corresponding increase of its tangible assets. </para>

                    <para>The wheat industry is in a deplorable condition. A little while ago this Government was prepared to take action that would have increased the price of bread by 7d. a 4 lb. loaf, yet now it objects to increasing it by1d. or 2d. It is opposed to anything in the nature of a sales tax on flour, so that those in sheltered industries may give some little assistance to the poor farmers who are battling against harsh conditions and opening up new markets. </para>
                    <para>The Government should do everything possible to open up additional avenues of production, and thus increase the opportunities of finding employment for our people. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> The effect of the employment of large numbers of persons in either mining or agriculture, is remarkable. My experience has taught me that for every man employed in those industries, at least six or seven are found employment in other industries. Therefore, every effort should be made by the Government to promote the expansion of primary production in Australia. Unfortunately, the low price of metals to-day makes it almost impossible to carry on mining operations at a profit. Only yesterday I was shown reports regarding discoveries of silver, copper and lead in Central Australia. The properties in question would appear to have the most wonderful potential wealth, which could be made available if the cost of production were not so great in the interior of Australia. </para>
                    <para>I impress upon the Government the necessity for making every effort to reduce the cost of the Public Service. Last year we took from the people £193,000,000 and still were £6,000,000 to the bad. If the cost of administration continues to soar it will not be possible for industry to flourish. We must prove to people in other countries that we are determined to live within our means. -Only in that way shall we be able to keep our name good. I hope that, before this session ends, the Acting Prime Minister will take his courage in both hands and bring forward resolutions providing for reductions throughout the Public Service. An effort should be made to ration instead of to dismiss officers. Every one should be compelled to bear his share of the sacrifice that must be made. The sooner that is done, the better it will be, not only for those who are immediately concerned, but also for the people of Australia as a whole. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to say a few words on this important question. The Government has had levelled at it unfair criticism by some honorable members opposite as well as by outside persons who have quite overlooked the fact that we came into power in one of the worst periods in the history of Australia. I venture to say that no Government, either State or Federal, has ever faced a more difficult position than that with which this Government has had to contend. We came into power when the Treasury was empty and when the country was recovering from the effects of a drought. There had been a big drop in the prices of wool and wheat, and there was a tremendous army of unemployed throughout Australia. It has been alleged against us . that we have not attempted to do the right thing by those who are out of work, that we have made no effort to balance the budget, and that we have not practised economy to the extent that some people desire. The Government has used the pruning knife very severely, and is attempting to provide employment so far as the finances will permit. I agree with the statement of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> who, in a very fine speech, said that the sudden reduction of loan expenditure from £40,000,000 to £14,000,000 was altogether too drastic. The decision of the Loan Council, to make such a reduction, rendered it impossible for many departments to carry out the important work which should be undertaken. If a gradual reduction in our loan expenditure had been agreed upon, the consequences would not have been so serious. Although Australia has a national debt of approximately £1,100,000,000, surely no one will argue that that is the value of our assets. I venture to say, that if this country is worth £1, it is worth £6,000,000,000, which is a conservative estimate.  Australia is the finest country on God's earth and the Australian people will meet their obligations. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Despite what may bo said by the calamity howlers, who cable certain information overseas, to the effect that this country is down and out, and that because a Labour Government is in power there is a possibility of Australia not meeting her obligations, the Commonwealth Government arid the Australian people will not shirk their responsibilities. It is unfortunate that, following a marked decrease in the price of our wool and wheat, we should have to raise £27,000,000 in one year. That makes the task of financing the country infinitely greater than it would otherwise have been. I am optimistic enough to believe that within twelve months or less we shall see a new Australia; that better times will come, and. that the people of this country will be in a better position than they are to-day. When the £27,000,000 loan falling due in December has been successfully converted, money from overseas should be available at cheaper rates, and, if, in addition, we are able to fund our war debt, our financial position will be much better than it is to-day. Although the situation in Australia is unsatisfactory, we have to remember that in the United States of America, with its undeveloped wealth of forest, oil and other resources, no fewer than 52 banks have closed their doors within the last few weeks. The United States of America holds £800,000,000 in gold, hut it is of no value in providing work for its- people, and there is a greater army of unemployed there than in any other country. </para>
                    <para>Irrespective of party, honorable members cannot escape their responsibility to assist in straightening out the affairs of this country. Wo  shall  not solve our difficulties by  quarelling  and saying nasty things about each other. It is our bounden duty to tackle the problems confronting us with courage and determination as quickly as possible. Even if the conversion loan is oversubscribed we shall have other problems to face. We must provide work for our great army of unemployed, and find ways and means of financing the wheat-growers and other primary producers. To-day I received a letter from a representative of the fruit-growers in the Horsham district, who informed me that information had been received to the effect that jam manufacturers would not be purchasing the fruit crops this .year direct from the growers, as has been the practice in previous years, but intended to buy in the open market. In these circumstances the unfortunate fruit-growers will be forced to send their fruit to Melbourne, where there is a ring, and purchasers will get the fruit at their own price. It is difficult to purchase any product in or out of the city other than through a ring. When primary producers, particularly our wheat-growers, are faced with such a position the Government should do something to assist them. If the State Governments and the wheat-growers were agreeable - I believe they would be - the Commonwealth should provide sufficient money to take over all the Australian wheat crop at a guaranteed price of 3s. a bushel, although I do not think a return of 3s., 4s. or 5s. would enable the wheatgrowers to overcome all their difficulties. Producers who were encouraged to undertake the production of wheat because of the high prices prevailing and who paid fabulous prices for the land are now faced with ruination. They cannot possibly make any recovery unless the Commonwealth or the States render them temporary financial assistance. I am afraid that if the Government cannot help them this year many of them will be so financially embarrassed and broken in spirit after years of struggling that they will abandon their holdings. In view of the price of wheat now prevailing, I believe that only two-thirds of the area under wheat will be cropped next year. Many of those now engaged in wheat-growing will have to devote their  attention to some other form of production, such as Jamb or pig-raising, in conjunction with dairying. I am sure that only a comparatively small area in Victoria will be placed under wheat next year. </para>
                    <para>Many suggestions have been made for overcoming the problems of unemployment. In this matter I think the State Governments will have to adopt the policy of the Victorian Government, which is acting on right lines. In Victoria it is proposed to subdivide large areas of comparatively cheap land, which if properly treated can become productive, and to allot it to married men with families so that they may become producers instead of members of the army of unemployed. There is a tract of country from Dartmoor to Portland, and also in the Heytesbury Forest and in Gippsland on which many families could be settled, lt is cheap land. Suitable land is also available in Queensland on which cotton and tobacco-growing as well as dairying could be profitably undertaken. There arc also suitable areas in New South Wales. To provide men with intermittent work - and sustenance is only begging the question. No man would look for sustenance if he could obtain work. Every man desires a home for himself and his family, and in this great country, where we have large areas of suitable land and a virile manhood," there should be no difficulty in placing 100,000 of our unemployed on the land where they could- become producers. </para>
                    <para>The opportunities which the Commonwealth Government has of providing employment are very limited. It is true that it might be able to absorb a. few thousand men in work for the Postmaster-General's Department, such as the laying of underground telephone lines; but the States control the land of the country, and  Iso its water and forests, and they only can effectively deal with the unemployment problem. But. in spite of this, the Government has been abused by the press, and criticized by honorable members opposite, for not providing work for our unemployed. When we can get sufficient money we will, of course, gladly assist the State Governments to put work of a reproductive character in hand. We should be glad, for instance, to see the shale oil industry of New South Wales and Tasmania developed. I believe that this industry can be put upon a sound footing. We should be glad, also, to see all the cotton country of Queensland under cultivation, it is capable of carrying many thousands of people. The tobacco industry is also one that merits development. There arc many ways in which employment could be provided in permanent developmental undertakings if the money were available. The provision of millions of money for the making of roads, the putting up of sign-posts, and so on, while perhaps desirable, is not essential at the moment. Work of this kind is not reproductive, and at present it is highly desirable that, all available government money should be well and wisely spent on industries which will add to the wealth of the country. </para>

I believe that the hardening of our wool, wh6at, and butter prices will enable Australia to recover her position very quickly. No country in the world recovers as quickly as Australia. If every honorable member of this Parliament, and all the people who hold responsible positions in industry, would put their shoulders to the wheel and do their utmost for the country, we should soon bring Australia safely through the present crisis. We are on the way to prosperity. The ship of State is now riding on a more even keel. If all honorable members will assist the Government to balance its accounts it will be seen that we intend to face the world determined, as honest men, to do the right, tiling for our People and nation. </para>

                            I do not propose to speak at any great length  in  reiteration of the views . put forward by  honorable  members 'on this side of the chamber, with practically all of which  I am in  . agreement; nordo I propose to 'talk merely to keep the House  in  session as a sortof clubfor the interludes of caucus, 'where the real 'decisions in regard to the 'future 'of this country will he made sometime before next March. But theeffect upon our . most important primary industries of the times through which we are passing, and of this supplementary budget -cannot be too frequently stated by honorable members who represent the districts in which these industries are dominant. Although there is no lack of sympathy by city people with the country people, there seems to he "an almost total obliquity, not ignorance but sheer obliquity, as to real conditions which prevail in the country and the effect which those conditions are having on the people in the city as well as the  people  in 'the country who hear the first shock which they cause.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We have had the spectacleduring the last twelve . months of the depression deepening, of private business getting intoworse, and still worse, troubles, and of farmers and many business people getting closer and closer to ruin. The largenumber of bankruptcies which have occurred have had a serious effect upon- the revenue of both the Commonwealth and the States and have caused a very quick and indeed tragic increase in the number of unemployed people in our midst. I agree with everything that has been said by honorable members opposite as well as by honorable members on this side  of  the chamber as to the seriousness and poignancy of this very terrible unemployment problem. I propose to analyse, very briefly, the probable influence of this supplementary budget upon that problem. </para>
                    <para>As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> pointed out . the other day, there are two parts  to  this budget. One part is thoroughly sound, but the second part, does not seem to fit in with the first. I do not think . that there is, a single sentence in the general statement of our position with which any honorable -member -of the House who is aware 'of the existing conditions in this country would quarrel. Butfollowing upon that statement 'are proposals whichare futile  as  'a means 'of getting us out 'of our troubles. The 'depressionof to-day is caused by two things. There has been analmost complete failure of what were. untilrecently,ourprincipalsourcesof income. Our flow -of loan moneys,the spendingof which untilthis year, has been 'our biggest industry, with the single exception of the wool industry, has almost entirely failed, and this failure has been accompanied by a tremendous drop in our real income due to the fall in world prices of our principal exportable commodities. The problems which we have to face are, first, how to transfer our people from the industries and businesses which were dependent upon the spending of loan moneys to some other productive and self-supporting occupation'; and, secondly, howto find occupation 'for the people who are but of "work as the result of the reduced spending power of those engaged in our main exporting industries. These are two problems of major magnitude. The largest shrinkage in our spending power has been due to the fall in the prices of 'our commodities, but enormous as that fall has 'been, it has not entirely dwarfed the shrinkage caused by the cutting 'off ofour loan funds. Our problems, therefor  e,  are how to keep our primary industries . going and how to find occupationnot only for the people engaged in primary industries, but also for those engaged  in  businesses which were maintained by the spending power created by our primary industries. </para>
                    <para>If there were any indication that we were passing through  a  temporary depression, or that the slump would  end  within the next few months, or even within a year or two, our problems would not be nearly so serious. They might even be dealt with by  an  extension of Government expenditure. In such circumstances it might have been possible for the Government to maintain its rate of loan expenditure with the object of reducing the seriousness of the general problems caused by the failure of our income from our primary industries ; but unfortunately, conditions are 'going still further to the bad  in  some of our chief  industries. It is true that the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNeill)</inline> struck a hopeful note when he referred to the hardening tendency apparent in the recent wool sales. The position of wool to-day is probably sounder than that of almost any other crude product in the world. This is largely due to the fact that at no time either during the recent booms or recent slumps, with their fluctuations in prices, has there been any effort to hold wool back from the market. Even in the time of B.A.W.R.A., when the large stocks of wool which  had accumulated during the war were marketed under special conditions, those in control of our stocks never held wool back if there was a demand for it. So that, although the price of wool is at present very seriously affected by the prevailing world slump, its prospects .are not so adversely influenced as are the prices for most minerals, rubber and wheat. The reason is that there are big accumulations of those commodities for which the world has no immediate demand. Because of that the honorable member has some justification for his optimism when he says that there may be a recovery in the price of wool. But it is unlikely that any such recovery will relieve the industry from undergoing the most drastic  re-organization,  a process that must necessarily reduce its employing power and adversely affect our secondary industries.  While I believe that reorganization cannot be avoided, I agree with the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNeill)</inline> that the wool industry is rather closer to a recovery than are the other industries that I have enumerated. </para>
                    <para>The prices of wheat, rubber and certain metals are affected, not only by the shrinkage in the world's purchasing power but by a further problem of an accumulative character. Governments, pools and individuals have made finance available and -large stocks of these commodities were withheld in times of depression. As a result, the world now lias approximately a 20 months' supply of wheat available, and only a twelve months' demand for it. Failing some catastrophe in one of the wheat-growing countries of the world, the struggle, rin that industry for markets promises to bc </para>
                    <para>Ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Hawker.</inline> a long one. Australia is engaging in that struggle against competitors in other parts of the world who are, probably, better equipped than are its wheatgrowers. Our growers are also saddled with a number of artificial handicaps, most of which are the result of legislative action on the part of the Commonwealth Governments during the last fifteen to 25 years. Of our competitors, Soviet Russia is dumping its wheat on the markets of the world at well below the cost of production. Its grain is produced under what are practically slave labour conditions. Our farmers are facing ruin because of the competition of thai:  slarc-grown  wheat. If their ruin is accomplished, a number of our secondary industries will also be involved in the catastrophe. Another competitor, the United States of America, the richest country in the world, and with a comparatively small exportable trade, is dumping its grain on tile Italian "market, with the aid of its State financed Farm Belief Wheat Board. Some alarm is felt iii Australia as to whether that competition will exhaust one of the outlets for our wheat. Our wheat farmers have to compete against European countries, which are in a position to impose tariffs to protect their own farmers. We have also to meet the competition of Argentine, where the standard of living is very low, and that cf Canada, which has done far less than Australia to impose handicaps on its wheat-growers. </para>
                    <para>And what applies to our wheat-growers applies, although perhaps to a less acute degree, to our mining and wool-growing industries. Those three activities, not simply because they are primary industries, but because of their magnitude, are involving the country in financial trouble, and in a very serious unemployment problem. </para>
                    <para>It is upon the effect of this supplementary budget on these problems I propose to make a few observations. Although our great staple industries are struggling for their existence, there are not very many things that a government can do to assist them. It might, if it were able, subsidize them to a reasonable extent. Only this afternoon, the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> read a statement which indicated the absolute helplessness of the  Government in the matter. Last session it proposed a guarantee to the wheat-farmers, under conditions which were odious to them. </para>

                            <para>- And to a considerable section of the farmers. If our wheat farmers thought that they could, at this juncture, obtain 4s. a bushel for their product, they would put up with practically any conditions, no matter how odious they were. However, no saneminded section of the community would admit the ability of the Government to raise the special tax which would have been needed to make good the guaranteed price v,o the wheat-farmers. That applies particularly with relation to State  Govenments,  whose financial difficulties are greater, if anything, than those of the Federal Governments. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>There is another method by which the Government can assist the farmers - by reducing his costs. The average farmer does not employ a great amount of labour, but he has to buy superphosphate, also fuel, if he has a tractor. He may also buy additional implements, although most primary producers are, at the moment, over-equipped in that direction. In any case, he has to buy spare parts for his machinery. In nearly every case where this Government has taken action in connexion with those commodities, it has made them more expensive to the farmer, lc has placed a primage duty on the raw materials imported for the manufacture of fertilizers) and it has imposed a very high duty on the spare parts that the( farmer needs. It has actually placed an embargo on the importation of machinery. Although that embargo might not bring about an increase in the price of farm implements, it has prevented the farmer from obtaining the benefit of a fall in prices which his competitors abroad are receiving. Then there is the sales tax. The argument has been advanced by the Government that it would be impracticable to exempt the farmer from the general drag-net conditions of that tax; that it would not know where those exemptions were to stop; that the revenue would be depleted. </para>
                    <para>But the Government has gone even further in the matter of imposing burdens on our primary producers. In this supplementary budget, it has gone out of its way, through cold-blooded choice, to tax the fuel that is necessary for the farmers' tractors - kerosene. Generally speaking, kerosene is used in Australia as fuel for stationary engines, tractors - none of which arc used on our roads - or the engines in fishing boats, or it is employed for lighting purposes by the poor, or by country people who have not the advantages of electric light, gas, and other city conveniences. It is - no argument to claim that the tax will not be passed ou, because the oil companies are already making an excessive profit. For some time past, farmers' co-operative societies have been importing kerosene and passing on to the farmers who use it the saving of the extra profit that the oil companies make. The cooperative concerns were increasing their sales, and their competition had begun to make itself felt with the oil companies. Now, if the co-operative companies are compelled to increase their prices by Id. because of this tax, the value of their competition with the oil concerns will be stultified. Possibly they will be forced out of the business altogether. In the circumstances, what chance have the farmers and country <inline font-style="italic">people</inline> of escaping the imposition of the extra Id. tax? </para>
                    <para>I strongly support the argument advanced by previous speakers on this side of the chamber that, instead of introducing additional income tax and  impos-ing  taxes on the raw material that is essential to the primary producer, the' Government should have effected greater economies in administrative expenses^ I shall not deal with that phase in detail as it lias already been fully traversed by"1-.... other speakers. But. there is another very big cost which a great many farmers and mining companies, and even the Government itself, is incurring to-day - the cost of interest. Due not so much to the action pf the Government, . but to that of the party which supports it, everything has been done to make it more difficult for Australia to obtain the benefit of the falling rates of interest which are enjoyed by other countries in the world. If an investor can obtain 6 per cent, from a government, it is extremely unlikely hat h he will lend his money to' primary producers for an additional 1 per <inline font-style="italic">cant.</inline> Despite all the talk about repudia tion, the bonds of this or any other government are a better risk than are the assets of a private individual. The funds of our big insurance companies represent the savings of many people who are making provision for their old age. Would those companies be doing their duty to their policy-holders if they loaned their money to private individuals, with their inferior security, for approximately the same interest as may be obtained from a government? The interest which a government has to pay depends to a great extent upon the standing of that government; upon the risk that the investor feels may be incurred with regard to the return of his money on the due date. Credit makes possible the maintenance of the standards set up by our highly complex modern civilization, with  its  specialized divisions of labour. To use the words of the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> credit  in its  primary sense is faith - believing that the creditor will pay when  its  debt falls due. The credit of  a  country is the belief, not that  it is  willing to pay, but that it can pay, when the debt falls due. On this point the following resolution, passed by the Federal Parliamentary Labour party recently, is interesting and significant: -  That legislation be passed immediately compelling bondholders in the £27,000,000* loan, maturing in December, to hold their bonds  for  a further period of twelve months,  interest  to be paid as usual, with the proviso that persons in necessitous circumstances may receive immediate payments of small amounts by cashing their bonds at the Common wealth Bank, the same to be held as  noninterestbearing  securities, the onus of proving that the circumstances justify payment, to fall on (lie bondholders. </para>

In every instance when government bonds decline in the market, purchasers of them secure a fraction more interest. This means that persons with money to lend, either to governments or private individuals, expect to obtain better terms. </para>

                    <para>To-day in most countries interest rates are falling rapidly. In the United States of America, which perhaps is an extreme case, the re-discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank is 2 per cent., and to make money even more plentiful, as well as to hold up the values on government issues, the bank is purchasing government stocks in the open market. In this way interest charges in the United States of America are kept at the lowest point, and substantial assistance is given to industry. Every country which gives evidence of a real determination to put its industrial and financial house in order, benefits from the easing in interest charges, and this advantage is passed on to industry. </para>
                    <para>The Government's revised financial proposals are framed, not for the purpose of enabling the Commonwealth to meet its commitments during the current financial year, but to prevent the present position from becoming worse. If the Government succeeds in stemming the tide, it will have accomplished something. Interest charges are a considerable burden. Another problem that is causing much concern is the cost of remitting money to London, without penalizing the primary producers, in order to meet our interest charges overseas. </para>
                    <para>It has been suggested that industry should be temporarily assisted by a certain measure of inflation. Those who .favour this course argue that it is necessary because of the difficulty experienced by government and private individuals in raising money. They contend that the nation's assets are ample security against any increase in currency. But they lose sight of the fact that the thing that matters is hot the selling-up value, but the paying-back value of assets. The honorable member for Fremantle, I understand, takes this view and used almost the same phraseology. He pointed out that the individual borrower must have sufficient wealth-producing capacity to satisfy the requirements of the bank before he can secure the required accommodation. If by wealth-producing  capacity, the honorable member means wealth-earning capacity, I am in agreement with him, because hanking and, indeed, all healthy business concerns, depend upon the belief or knowledge that money advanced will be repaid at the due date. It is. I think, generally acknowledged that our main primary industries and, indeed, most businesses in Australia have, for the moment, lost their wealth-earning capacity, which, of course, impairs their capacity to pay back advances made, so that an extension of facilities to borrow would only get them deeper into the financial bog. Unless .DdS are lowered, they cannot carry on permanently, nor can we expect the country, as a whole, to recover permanently from the present depression. An inflation of the note issue by the printing of additional notes might, and probably would, result in a temporary flutter, but in the end it would only increase the difficulties of the nation. The advocates of an extension of credit tell us that it would be only a little inflation; only a little printing of additional paper money; only a little manufacture of credit. In this  way  lies danger. All the really devastating inflationary policies have had their beginnings in a little measure of inflation. Always the excuse has been that, to meet temporary financial difficulties, an extension of credit was necessary to stimulate Trade, in much the same way that an injection of strychnine to a patient suffering from heart trouble provides the necessary stimulus to carry him over a crisis. A small measure of inflation certainly does stimulate trade temporarily; but, before long, further and larger doses are required to continue the process. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that, if we could reduce our costs of production, our primary industries would be able to carry on. Once we show our determination to make this possible there should then be no difficulty about obtaining financial assistance at rates which would not be unduly burdensome. Developmental works constructed with money borrowed at 4 per cent, have a much bettor chance of returning interest and providing for sinking fund contribu tions than when the interest rate is 6 per cent. If the Government can borrow money at 4 per cent., private individuals may expect to obtain it at 5 per cent, or <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> per cent., instead of, as at present, from 7-i per cent, to 8£ per cent. If finance were available to business concerns at 2 per cent, below existing rates, trade would be stimulated and the unemployment problem relieved. The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> last, night dealt very ably with the injurious effect  of inflation upon the savings of thrifty people in the community. I do not propose to traverse ground which he covered last night. But I should like to remind the House that the Government's taxation proposals, under which a certain section will be used for the benefit of other sections, will react upon the wage-earner  through  rising prices for commodities. </para>

                            <para>- Inflation in France brought down real wages. This is one explanation for the prosperity of that country to-day. I have no doubt that the' Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> in his recent visit to Bradford, heard many complaints from textile manufacturers about the cost of raw materials and wages. Under existing conditions, I believe that English textile manufacturers could not compete with the French mills, even if Australian wool were given to them, provided French manufacturers were on the same footing for their raw material, because, as the direct result of inflation in France, real wages costs are now so- '.much below English levels. Some interesting figures on the.s subject have been issued by the International Labour Bureau at Geneva. These show that in 1913, when the franc was approximately 25 to the English £1, the index number for real wages was 100. In October, 1920, immediately after the war, the franc had receded to 49.39, and real wages had fallen to 90. In 1921, the franc fluctuated between 45 and 61, and the wages index was S3. In the following year the franc was to some extent stabilized, the minimum being 45 and the maximum 61. In 1922 it fluctuated between 47 and 72, and in that year real wages recovered to about the 1913-14 level. </para>

                            <para>- In 1923 the franc was still fairly stable, and real wages actually rose above the 1913-14 value, reaching an index number of 105. In 1924 the value of the franc fell from 80 to 120 to the £1. In that year the index number was reduced to 99. In 1925 the franc did not fall very much, only from 120 to 135 to the £1, and wages recovered a little, so that the index number stood at 101. In 1926, the year in which the big collapse took place, and the franc came as low as 238 to the £1, the wage index figure fell to 86. In 1927, the franc was stabilized at about 124 to the £1, and from that time the wage index figure has gradually improved until it now stands at 106 as compared with 100 in 1913-14. Inflation is a means of reducing wages, and it is just as well that that fact should be realized. That is one of the reasons why France, which has practised inflation,has very little unemployment. The French figures regarding wage values as indicated by the cost of food were not recorded before 1924. In that year the index figure for Paris, which is the largest industrial town in France, and also the biggest centre of population, stood at 73 as compared with London. In 1925, when the franc had fallen a little, the wage index figure came down to 68. In . 1926, which was the year when the franc, took its big tumble, the index figure came down to 66, and for part of 1927, it was as low as 56. After the franc was stabilized in 1927, and wage rates became more or less constant, the index figure was 61 for 1928, and 59 for 1929. </para>

                            <para>- A great many exaggerated statements are made in Australia to-day on the subject of deflation, which may be defined as the contracting of the basis of credit. According to figures published in to-day's press, the value of bank notes in circulation in Australia at the present time is £45,153,000 as compared with £42,878,000 on the 17th November, 1929. That shows an increase of between 4 and 5 per cent: in the value of the note issue. It must be clear, therefore, that our difficulties are due, not to any contraction of credit or deflation of the currency, so much as to a loss of real income resulting from lower world prices for our staple products, and the sudden cessation of borrowing. </para>

                            <para>- The present increased purchasing power of money is due to the fall in world prices. This craving to manipulate the currency when times are bad is no new thing. After the Napoleonic wars much the same difficulty occurred as we are confronting now, and the suggestion was made that the British currency should be de-valued for the benefit of the aristocracy, who had been living rather high. During a debate in the House of Lords in 1823. Lord Stauhope said - </para>

                        <para>If we contemplate the effects which the change of currency has produced upon taxation, we find that the public annuitants now receive twice as much in the produce of the earth as they did in 1819, and nearly twice as much as they then did in other commodities. Is not this to be considered as a most nefarious fraud practised on the nation, and as an act of public robbery? </para>

                    <para class="block">One might also imagine that it was " Lord Adelaide " speaking in this way. To-day, it is merely a different section of the community which has a vested interest in bringing about <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> regime of easy money, and it is using the same arguments as were used then. The Marquis of Tichfield, who would probably correspond more or less to our "Marquis of Werriwa," in the course of the same debate, demanded " justice - simple justice - for the ' aristocracy of  the  country, who would inevitably be ruined, torn from their paternal estates, and reduced to spend a miserable existence in a foreign land - and all because, when money was abundant and prices high, they borrowed fearlessly." Fortunately, the British Government did not at that time inflate the currency. The nation put its shoulder to the wheel and by hard work surmounted its difficulties. Because Britain faced her obligations at that time and made it possible for Australia to develop as she has done until our country has attained the best living standard in the world. </para>

I do not believe that there are half a dozen honorable members on the other side of the House who would, if they could avoid it, countenance the failure of the country to meet all its commitments on due date; but I believe that some of them have foggy ideas as to what really constitutes meeting those commitments. The Premier of New South Wales has fervently denied that be advocated repudiation or countenanced it; but in one of his electioneering statements he made an implied, if not an actual promise, to the farmers of New South Wales, and has since repudiated it. Speaking at Parkes on the 6th October, 1930, he said- </para>

                    <para>Quack remedies, such as have been suggested, if followed, would only lead us into greater difficulty. Inflation would only postpone the difficulty, and we should have to face it after losing our good name. The w'ay out of the trouble is not solely through governments and budgets. The present budget does practically nothing' to help us out of our difficulties. As a matter of fact, it makes the recovery of our main industries more difficult. If we are to get out of our troubles we must sooner or later reduce costs. This Parliament cannot reduce industrial costs. All it can do is to remove obstructions to industry, particularly by avoiding the imposition of any form of taxation which falls heavily on production. The present Government has imposed a duty on kerosene, probably for the purpose of preventing a reduction of the salaries of public servants with incomes up to £725, which is vastly more than any farmer has been able to earn in Australia within the last two or three years. Taxing people living outside the cities in order to make things softer for a favoured section of the community will not help us out of our difficulties. It will only serve to bring us into greater difficulties. </para>
                    <para>What the country needs is that all sections should make a sacrifice. We shall get nowhere if certain sections try to put the whole of the burden on the wage-earner; or if other sections try to put it all on the primary producer or any special section of the community. All must share the sacrifice, and as a matter of fact, that is exactly what is taking place at the present time. Is not the biggest sacrifice of all, useless though it may be, that which is being made by the unemployed, tragically and hopelessly looking for some chance to get back to work? Before the unemployed can get that opportunity we must restore obi industries to a position in which they can pay their way. The capitalist must suffer big losses of his capital, and the land-owner cannot avoid a big writing down of what he believes to be the value of his land. He cannot pass on the burden to any other section of the community. </para>

                            <para>- Interest is always the last to come down, just as it is the last to go up. The interest rate has come down in every other country, and will come down in Australia as soon as the country makes an effort to pay its way. In the meantime, income from property will have to stand, and is standing, a very big share of the burden of taxation and the cost of running the country. But we cannot get through without labour also bearing its share of the sacrifice. </para>

                        <para>The National Council of Industry and Commerce urges the Government and the Opposition to discharge party politics in favour of sound economies. "At present the country's prosperity is the politicians' plaything,"' it states. " The Council observes apprehensively the Government's immediate programme and regards with dismay the economic failure of the Economic Conference, which was inevitable because the Government subordinated economics to politics. The solution of unemployment evades discovery and the former will soon become unmanageable. Britain should not wait for a general election, but should force their views on the sitting members demanding some sound non-party action." </para>

                    <para>I pass from those opinions to the debate which is taking place in this chamber. I have listened with great attention to speakers on both sides, and I am more than delighted at the tone of the debate. With one or two exceptions the speeches delivered have been on a lofty plane and on non-party lines. The Government has called us together in the greatest crisis that has ever faced Australia, and we, the people's representatives, are all honestly endeavouring to give of our beat to our country. There is, perhaps, not one honorable member, not even the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> who has been trained in the higher fields of finance, yet being the elected representatives of the people it is for us to declare our opinions on this momentous question. I thought that the speech delivered yesterday by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> was one of the best I have heard him deliver in this chamber, and I congratulate him. I also congratulate the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> upon his speech. Another speech worth listening to was that delivered by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> But I still think we are as far away as ever from a solution of the great problem facing us. I want to trace exactly the position and how we are facing it, and, in order to do so I shall mention various points which have been made. </para>

                        <para>A further general observutio.il suggests itself.  Loan  moneys raised overseas can only come to Australia in the form of goods. These  goods  are subject to the customs duties provided for under the Commonwealth tariff on importation into Australia, and arc in this way taxed to an extent estimated at from 15 'to 20 per cent, of their value. The result is that this proportion of moneys borrowed abroad foi' capital purposes comes to the Commonwealth as revenue and is spent accordingly. This diversion of capital funds is, obviously, had finance. </para>

                    <para class="block">Although I have handled some big trusteeships, I do not claim to be an expert financier, and I have sought the best advice so that I might have the figures taken out for me. They are rather staggering. For the nine years ended the 30th June, 1929, Australia borrowed £324,000,000, 15 per cent, of which amounts to £48,000,000, and 20 per cent, to £64,000,000. That is to say, for the whole period of niue years either £48,000,000 or £64,000,000 has been paid into the current account of the Commonwealth from moneys borrowed abroad. The average has been £5,500,000 per annum on a 15 per cent, basis, or £7,000,000 per annum on a 20 per cent, basis. It is astounding to think that we were getting wealth from money we borrowed and using it as i  income  in a way described by the " Big Four" as "obviously, bad finance." However, we did it; we drifted along; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> says, " Let us forget the past; let us face the future." </para>

                    <para>The position as we find it, and it's causes, need not be discussed by me at great length. What is the use of traversing the whole subject again? We all know that there is a drop of £80,000,000 per annum in the national income. Rents in our capital cities and suburbs are down over 50 per cent. Incomes, owing to the financial crisis and the crushing burden of taxation, have dropped 80 per cent. There is a reduced demand in the world's markets for our exports, the prices of which have seriously declined. Then there is the frightful problem of unemployment. And what of the money borrowed ! </para>
                    <para>How much money does Australia owe? Commonwealth and State loans maturing in December, 1931, amount to over £76,500,000, all of which, fortunately, are internal loans. In addition to that huge sum, we have £7,000.000. of internal treasury-bills, and. £10,000,000 of treasury bills in London. Local loans amount to £83,693,807, which with the £10,000,000 falling due in London make a total of £93,693,S07.

                    <para>I come now  to  the financial statement  for  the consideration  of  which the House has beencalled together and  to  the amendment moved  by  the Leader  of  the Opposition. This  is  naturally <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> most important document, well considered  by  the Cabinet, otherwise  we  should hot have been called together  to discuss it, and it  would hot have been tabled. The first thing one notices about  it is the  frequent repetitionof those dear  did  words'; " balance the budget." It  is  first mentioned  in  connexion with  the  Australian Loan Council meeting held on the 10th June, 1930. At that meeting  the Honorable E. G. Theodore, then Treasurer, represented the Commonwealth and a joint statement was issued as follows:-* </para>
                    <para>The members of the Loan Council appreciate that the consideration of the financial position of the Commonwealth and each State involves a review of financial policy of each government, and that it is not the function of the Loan Council to determine, or even suggest, the form which that policy should assume. The Treasurers feel, however, in view of the difficult outlook generally, that it is proper and advisable for them to urge Upon ali governments the heed for the utmost economy in regard to expenditures, and also that  it  is essential that the budgets of the Commonwealth and the States be balanced for the forthcoming financial year. This is necessary, not only because of the Australian position, but also because of the serious effect which the continued deficits in the accounts of the Commonwealth and States have undoubtedly had upon the credit of Australia abroad. </para>
                    <para class="block">This phrase was again mentioned in July by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.- Scullin)</inline> in his reference to the deficits of the preceding three years. He said- </para>

                    <para>The press has from time to time published accounts of the ructions in the caucus, and the names and division lists of those who were against the Acting Prime Minister and the Acting Treasurer, mostly on the point raised by several honorable members in respect of inflation of the note issue and deflation of our money. In that regard, it is not strange that the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> voted with the Acting Treasurer. He rightly did so, although it was previously stated that  he was against the Government or the moderates in the Cabinet. On this occasion he acted rightly, especially in view of his statement as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 14th November, 1923, when he was Premier of Queensland. - It reads - </para>

                        <para>The Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> said to-day: The world has had many salutary lessons <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> recent years of the confusion caused by unstable money. Trade was paralyzed, commodity prices soared sky-high, wage standards were lost, and national bankruptcy ensued. With the exercise of ordinary prudence we may avoid the difficulties that have beset many European countries. Gold should be permitted to circulate freely, and to this end the embargoon the export pf gold should be withdrawn. Merely to pay higher wages in paper money achieved only disappointment, as the purchasing power of paper money will be less than the purchasing amount (power) of gold. By inflating currency we get into a vicious circle, and none suffers more than the workers, because their wages are paid on the assumption that commodity prices are in gold and not inflated paper prices. Wages1 are always less than they should be in countries that practise inflation. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I am inclined to agree with the honorable member for Dalley in certain respects, and also with the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> who stated in his excellent speech the other night that it has taken us practically nine years to drift into the appalling position in which we are in to-day, and we cannot get out of it in three or four .months. There, is a great deal of truth in that. I do not think that any member of this Parliament believes that it is possible to absolutely balance the budget within the next few months. What, in my humble opinion, should be done, is to again seek, the best advice - whether it will be available after the treatment accorded to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer I cannot say - from men who, for the whole of their lives, have been devoted to high finance, with a view to coming to some arrangement that will ease the appalling burden represented by the tremendous debts that we have to meet in  the next five or ten years. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> suggested the raising of a loan of from £20,000,000 to £25,000,000 for reproductive works, in which could be absorbed a large number of our unemployed. If we do not immediately face the position, the problem will become much worse than it is at the present time. As Australians, we are not afraid to tackle difficulties and surmount them. I strongly urge the Government to endeavour to arrive at some arrangement that will operate over a period of years. </para>
                    <para>The next point that I wish to make relates to taxation. Honorable members must have noticed in the press what the super tax upon property amounts to; it is nothing less than confiscation, and will bring about the destruction of industry. </para>
                    <para class="block">I can illustrate the position to the Acting Treasurer by citing my own case. Estates in which I am either trustee or beneficiary have always been able to invest their surplus funds in Commonwealth loans, but, in the coming taxation year, it will be difficult to find sufficient to pay the taxes that are to be raised. We shall have left to us only 6s. 3d. in the pound on the returns from our property. This taxation, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has stated, amounts to between 60 per cent, and 70 per cent. One property, in the heart of the City of Sydney, dropped £6,000 per annum in rents in four weeks. All other property owners are in a similar position. Rents have tumbled like a pack of cards, and many tenants of shops and offices cannot pay anything. In my own case, I had to call the whole of my staff together and place the position before them. I have always admitted that I have received far too much in dividends from watered stock, and that there should be a better distribution of wealth. I still hold those beliefs. I said to my staff, " Looking at the wages sheet, I find that your average wage is £4 lis. 6d. a week - the award rate. How you keep a wife and family on that, 1 do not know. I cannot afford to pay you that amount now. I am not going to sack one of you, because that would be a tragedy. What are you prepared to do?" They realized the position; they knew how many shops and offices were vacant. They said, " We will agree to be rationed at the rate of one week in six." I believe that they are prepared to stand down three weeks in six rather than suffer dismissal. I have always held strongly the view that wages ought not to be lowered, nor the purchasing power of the community lessened. What is the use of producing goods if they cannot be consumed? As the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said, we have to face economic facts. But if you have not the money to pay wages, what are you to do? The only alternative to dismissal is to get round a table and talk the matter over. These are times when we must all help one another. The dismissal from government departments within the last few weeks of over 1,600 returned soldiers out of a total of 3,000, many of them minus, a leg or an arm, is tragic. Why could not a rationing scheme have been adopted to help these poor chaps over the stile ? They ought to have a little to take home every week to feed themselves and their families. Therefore, I say to the Government that, if possible, it should make less burdensome the proposed tax on property. What has been the effect already? Every honorable member has received a circular from the Real Estate' institute of New South Wales, protesting against the proposed additional tax. It should be seriously considered, because no less than about £20,000,000 has been invested in city properties and factory sites in Australia by English investors. </para>

                            <para>- The amount has accumulated gradually over the last three or four years. Two years ago, while abroad, I found that conditions in France were fairly bad. I said to some of my French friends who had money, " Why not invest your money in Australia? " I was given instruction to find investments for some of it, and I invested it in city properties and factory sites. This proposed tax, plus the exchange, will exhaust all that is received for some of it from those properties so that there is practically nothing to remit to the investors. We should do everything that we can do to encourage people in other countries to invest in Australia, and thus give employment to our people. The way to do that is not to impose a super tax of 71/2 per cent., plus 15 per cent., upon receipts from property, leaving merely 6s. 3d. in the pound. What can a man do with that? Employees in industrial enterprises and domestic service will have to be discharged, and gradually the whole fabric will tumble to the ground. Every pound levied in taxation means a pound taken out of industry and consequent unemployment. </para>

In addition to this, which is a direct source of loss of revenue and income, returns from their property have been materially affected for the following reasons: - </para>

                    <para class="block">Every word of that is true; I can vouch for its accuracy from my own experience. I have always been rather proud of the fact that my brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunts have never accepted their full allowance; but, on the contrary, have saved up and invested in industrial concerns to the tune of thousands of pounds. As the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> knows, portion of our estate invested £60,000 in a factory in Sydney, and, in addition, we have purchased government bonds. We cannot continue to 'do that, because practically all that we now get is taken from us in taxation. </para>
                    <para>I appeal to the Government to consider the seriousness of this question, and to ease up on those people, both at home and abroad, who have invested in city and suburban property. If it does not, its action "will be nothing short of confiscation, and the affairs of this country will totter, because funds will not be available to provide employment. At the present time many employees are being rationed ; but how long that will last I do not know. </para>
                    <para>I realize fully the extremely difficult position in which the Government finds itself in regard to finance and unemployment. Every week the ranks of the unemployed are being swelled. Honorable members know that I am not one  who boasts <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> blows his own trumpet, but that I always like to give this House the benefit of what I learn in my travels. Within the last three years I have asked the Prime Ministers of Japan, England, Canada, Prance, Germany, and Belgium, " What is the cure for your unemployment 1" and the reply has always been, " There is no statesman living who can furnish the answer to that difficult question." The government of every country to-day is faced with this problem. The United States of America, which, with France, holds practically all the gold in the world, has an army of  5,000,000  men unemployed. One would naturally think that where there was wealth there would be no unemployment, because money would be available to 'provide work; but that is not the case. Therefore^* there is no solution of the problem in that direction. </para>
                    <para>The question I stress is, what are we going to do to increase the chances of our people  Obtaining  employment? I shall indicate a few directions in which employment may be provided ; but money will be needed to pay  wages.  If the Government is trusted by overseas financiers, it will get all the money it needs. Tobacco-growing would absorb a small number of men. Then there is the production of oil from shale. At Newnes, t understand, the quantity available is sufficient for a maximum output over  a  period of  100  years. Another avenue is oil from coal. Ali officer has been sent from Australia to Germany to learn all about the process; and I was told to-day, by a departmental official, that in his last report this gentleman stated that he is more than satisfied with the knowledge that he is gaining. Thousands of men who are now unemployed could oe absorbed in the production of oil from coal. Another avenue is that of oildrilling on the most scientific lines, similar to the operations of the Oil Research Syndicate, of which I am a member. But the occupation which appeals most  to  me, as a  Sailor,  is that of deep-sea fishing. There we have an avenue that has not been touched, and is approached by none other in the world. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about eight weeks ago, just prior to the State elections. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead,</inline> the great fishery expert, published the statement that deep-sea. fishing in Australian </para>
                    <para class="block">Waters would  bring  into  Sydney and Melbourne  at  least  £2,000,000 a Vear.  At  present,  when  the  great cry of the multitude is " employment it seems that we might direct our attention to the energetic development of our undeveloped fisheries resources. The only tangible effort made by the Commonwealth to conduct fisheries research was by  the  old S.S. <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour,</inline> from  1909  to  1914.  Unfortunately, that  Vessel  foundered, with all her records, so that most of the fruits of her work were lost. Australia is a fish-hungry nation.. The <inline font-style="italic">per 'capita</inline> consumption of fish in Australia is  14  lb., compared with  25  lb. for New Zealand and Canada, and  40  lb. for Great Britain. I know that men frequently comment upon the fact that their wives complain because they, have to pay ls: 6d. for a piece of whiting 6 inches long; It may interest honorable members to know that Australia annually imports about  £1,500,000  worth of fish, and that our domestic production is valued at  £1,200,000,  so that  £2,700,000  is spent  annually  in Australia on fish. The fishing industry in Australia shows distinct signs of languishing, because no active fisheries research work has been undertaken. If the Australian people consumed fish to the same extent as the English people-there is no reasonwhy they should not- the fishing industry would be worth nearly  £8,000,000  annually to the Commonwealth. Think of what that would mean in the  matter  of employment. Do honorable members realize as I do, after an extensive tour of China and Japan, the market that  exists  in the East for dried fish alone? The fish obtained in Japanese water's are not nearly sufficient to meet the requirements of those countries. In journeying through China and Japan, I noticed that  wherever  they were travelling they' carried a small wooden box consisting of two compartments one containing rice and  the  other dried fish. As the consumption of dried fish in China  alOne  is exceptionally large, a wonderful market exists which could be profitably exploited by Australia. On the basis of the average annual earnings of those engaged in the Australian fish industry being  £200,  a production valued nt  £8,000,000  annually would  iti  nin tain  40,-000  bread-winners. The  industry would also provide indirect employment for many thousands more, especially if the valuable by-products of fish- meal and fish oil, for which there is a world demand1, were added. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead</inline> lias said that cnr waters are teeming with fish ; but the harvest of the sea cannot he gathered unless capital is attracted into- the enterprise. The initiative iri this regard rests with the Government. Although the industry is well established in Great Britain the Ramsay MacDonald Government has at present in contemplation the purchase of a research' vessel at a capita?: cost, including scientific equipment. Of £80,000, and has guaranteed to spend £34,000 annually for a period of five years on running expenses.- The British Government realizes that the fishing industry provides employment for a vast number of men and women'. Last year the Canadian Government spent £300,000 on -the development of her fisheries, While the expenditure in Australia was nil. The South African Government is at present building a new research vessel at a. cost, of £24,000. It is interesting to note that in 1928 the cray-fishing  industry in South-west Africa was worth not less than £200,000. If honorable members visualize our vast potentialities in this regard, they will see that Australia is missing a golden opportunity; Last year Canada marketed 90,000,000' lb. of fish from her Atlantic fisheries, quite apart from those on the Pacific coast. In British Columbia where the industry has made rapid strides, the quantity of pilchard landed for this  purpose  increased from 2,750,000 lb. in 1924 to 101,000,000 lb. in 1926. In California, where the pilchard is used for canning as well as for fish by-product manufacture, the quantity landed increased from 15.000800 lb. in 1916 to 315,000j000 lb.- in 1925- truly a phenomenal development. I understand that fish meal is becoming increasingly popular for cattle, pigs and poultry, as it is rich in those elements which are deficient in our natural- postures. While other countries are moving forward in this direction, Australia is not doing anything. I compliment the Government upon making tin attempt to do something iii this direction, as I notice that £50,000 is set down iii the Estimates for the current year to cover the cost of constructing a trawler to undertake research work. This expenditure was strongly recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead</inline> and others who realize the extensive possibilities of the fishing industry. I appeal to the Government to provide this £50,000 - I know it is difficult - for the construction of a research vessel, particularly as a good deal ofBritish money would be invested' in the industry if it were established ki Australia. I learn, however, from newspaper reports, that this work is not yet being proceeded with. To me that is calamitous1. It is easy to talk of depression and restricted finance; but unless we endeavour to extricate ourselves we shall sink further and further into the abyss. This subject should also be studied from another aspect.- Admiral Jellicoe is taking a great interest in the fishing industry, because he knows the value of the naval services rendered by men trained in the British fishing fleets. At the outbreak of the war I was sent by the Admiralty to Wick in the northern mists to gather in- and train thousands of men engaged in the fishing industry. It was the men who had been engaged1 in the British fishing fleets who did the patrol work, and who materially assisted in checking the submarine menace during the first three years of the war. As one of their commanders I know how keenly Admiral Jellicoe supports the deep sea fishing industry, which, if established in Australia, would provide thousands of naval reservists. We should proceed with ;i bold policy of reproductive development. We pay bounties amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds to industries which will, probably, never become self-supporting. For the products of the fishing industry we have a big home market, and an ever-increasing market in the East. Surely, such a project merits an initial capital outlay of £50,000, which would produce a valuable asset, while the work accomplished by a. research vessel would be of lasting benefit to Australia. If our governments </para>
                    <para class="block">Will but seek and follow the best expert financial advice, and our people will pull together in adversity, realizing the visible and potential wealth of the country, and the inherent strength of its citizens, the dark clouds that now overshadow us will surely roll away. </para>

There will be no friendliness expressed towards them in my speech; but. I have to consider my responsibilities when the country is facing a crisis. My leader stated on a. number of occasions that the Government would do its best to meet the crisis and to balance the budget. I shall support the Government's taxation proposals, because I consider it my duty to assist the Prime Minister in honoring the pledge he gave. 1' do not wish to be identified with, shall I say, the wild statements made by some honorable members on this side of the chamber in regard to inflation. I do not know whether honorable members realize it, but this subject will be the issue placed before the people at an early date.

                            <para>- I used that expression deliberately. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archdale Parkhill)</inline> does not expect me to say that I am opposed to inflation of any kind, because he knows that inflation and deflation is continuously going on in connexion with currency and credit arrangements. If the honorable member desires me to elaborate my statement I can do so in a few words. I am opposed to any inflation which will carry us in the direction of an excessive or even a marked increase in price levels, and would probably cause a corresponding reduction in the real value of the wages of the working people of this country. I have no desire to avoid explaining what I mean by " excessive ". . I am not afraid to declare plainly where I stand in regard to inflation. I believe that inflation would not be to the advantage of the mass of our people. It was claimed to-day, by certain honorable members who favour the inflation policy, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wickens,</inline> the Commonwealth Statistician, was on their side. I have read the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wickens,</inline> and I understand it to mean that only such inflation should occur as the banking companies, as a whole, or the Commonwealth Bank, favour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wickens</inline> was speaking of the Commonwealth Bank as it is at present constituted. Tlie honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> and the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> are totally unjustified in " laying the flattering unction to their souls " that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wickens</inline> is in favour of the kind of inflation that they advocate. I shall specially oppose the kind of inflation which will result in an increase of credit by, as the honorable member for Werriwa puts it, writing something on one side of the ledger of the Commonwealth Bank, or the issuing of additional Commonwealth notes for the purpose of redeeming loans as they fall due. If the £28,000,000 loan now on the market had been dealt with in this way it would undoubtedly have liberated credit to the extent of £2S,000,000 in this country, and this would have had a good effect temporarily, and tended to the acceleration of business. But do honorable members who advocate that policy suggest that the? next loan that falls due should be dealt, with in the same way, and that we should continue along those lines? I tried unsuccessfully to-day to get an honorable member on this side of the chamber, who advocated redeeming the present loan by that means, to deal with this point. </para>

It was at that time that I had my first personal experience of Commonwealth loans. </para>

                            <para>- I did ; not that I had very much to put in. The statement has been made that bondholders gain by investing in these loans, because the value of the bond increases. But that was not the case in connexion with the first loan in which I invested. Let us say that I put £100 into that loan. It represented the savings of a number of years, during which the purchasing power of the £1 was £1. Unless the £100 that I receive when that loan is repaid has the purchasing power of £100, I shall be the loser and not the gainer in purchasing power. Let us assume that 1 put another £100 into a. loan during 1921 or 1922. Compared with the war period, the purchasing power of £1 at that time was only about 11s. 6d. It is probable that on account of the deflation that will-have occurred by 1935, when that loan becomes repayable, the purchasing power of the £1 will be between 14s. and 16s. In that case, I should be the gainer and not the loser, because I saved that money during an inflation period. But I do not favour that kind of thing. Of course, if events turn that way, I shall take my money just as others will take theirs; but I would far rather see a system of stabilization instituted which would ensure that investors would get out of government loans money with the same purchasing power as the money they originally put in. If we could devise such a scheme it would be an excellent thing, but I know there are tremendous difficulties in the way. It is regrettable that our human systems are so frail in these matters. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member for South Sydney. I admit, of course, that financial systems have been evolving and developing since that time, and that considerable changes have occurred. The crises and bank failures that more or less commonly occurred at that time forced the banking companies to get together and take steps to protect and assist* each other in times of difficulty; but the facts with which I shall deal, and the quotations which I shall make, have just as much application to the conditions of to-day as they had to those of 1824. My reading of history forces me to the conclusion that undue inflation has always had the same effect. The first quotation that I shall make is from page 29 of the book. It reads as follows: - </para>

                        <para>The following passage might almost be read as referring, not to 1824, but to 1889: - "In the spring of 1824, when heavy payments had to be made on account of the South American loans and mining companies, so large an amount of gold and silver bullion was exported to South America, that a sensible deficiency was caused in the available currency of Great Britain, and during the whole of the year 1824. and the first three months of 1825, 'the Bank of England materially increased its note circulation". At the same time the provincial banks, under a mischievous act of parliament, passed in 1882, swamped the whole country with paper money, which found a ready outlet in that time of rising prices and universal speculation. In 1825 there were nearly thrice as many such notes out as there were in 1822; while between June, 1824, and October, 1825, from £10,000,000 to £12,000,000 of coined money was issued from the mint. Every step was thus taken to encourage speculation to the point of actual danger to the State, and to inflate the existing inflation beyond all precedent. </para>
                        <para>So long as money could be obtained at a low rate of interest, and interest was maintained at a low rate by the enormous issue of small bank notes, the speculation went on; and, as has been said, all classes and both sexes took an active part in the scramble for wealth. in six weeks no fewer than 70 provincial banks failed. In London and in the country, commercial houses fell one on the top of the other like a house of cards whose support is removed. Credit was almost at a standstill". It was impossible to say what constituted wealth for the purpose of carrying on business or meeting liabilities. The distrust was as profound as the confidence had but now been overweening. Whoever had loans out called them in ; whoever had money in hand refused to part with it on any terms. From one end of Great Britain to the other people looked blankly in one another's faces, not knowing whence had arisen this sudden tornado of financial despair. Little else was discussed in the exchange or on the market place. While some said that the whole thing was purely  imaginary,  the result of foolish fears and scandalous rumours, others maintained with equal vigour that the crisis was but the beginning of the end, and that the downfall of our whole industrial and financial system was close at hand. </para>

There have been quite a number of similar crises in previous periods of the world's history, when it was thought that the existing system was crumbling; that there was no way out. But times of sacrifice followed times of extravagance, and a way out was discovered, even though it proved to be a distressing one for those concerned. [ remember the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition pooh-poohing the idea that the mechanization of industry could bring about over-production. The honorable gentleman contended that the trouble was under-consumption. Surely he is not serious when he claims that if the men and the machines available were set seriously and strenuously to work, it: would not result in over-production? </para>

                    <para>Over-inflation is likely to bring about crises such as those to which I have referred. I know that I shall be told in some quarters that the trouble is due to a shortage of currency, and in others that it is the result of over-production. I support the latter theory. A temporary burst of prosperity comes along, and under its influence we. enjoy good returns, which engender great confidence in the community. Eventually that confidence becomes over-weening and leads to blind speculation. There follows a further burst of fictitious prosperity. Then comes the first whisper that things are not what, they ought to be. A panic follows, with the result that we all know only too well, whether from experience or from our reading. Take the redemption of a big national loan by inflation. When the transaction is completed the money becomes available to the general public of the country in notes or by book entries. The resultant credit is used in various directions, and brings about improved times. To obtain anticipated profits our manufacturers work their plants overtime. Shelves and bins are again stocked to capacity. Later, things once more begin to slip back. And on each occasion the same old process will be demanded and repeated. Speculation becomes wilder and wilder, until, in the words of the scriptures, ' the last state is worse than the first ". My next extract refers to the period 1836, and is taken from page 43. It reads - "In the year 183(5, speculation had again reached such a pitch that 42 new banks of issue were established which, with their branches, gave a total of fully 200, and taking into consideration other credit establishments and their branch banks, there were no fewer than 070 such institutions on foot with about 37,000 shareholders: and of these three-fourths issued their own notes." During these years, both the Bank of England and thu other banks had issued paper largely in excess of the amounts previously in circulation. But now, in the spring of 1830, the Bank of England, as in 1825, began to reduce its note issue, and was forced, in view of the drain for gold which had set in, to America to raise its rate of discount. Thereupon, the banks of issue, instead of following the Bank of England's lead, issued 50 per cent, more notes than' before, thus rendering the directors' action to protect their gold reserve from depiction, almost nugatory. </para>
                    <para class="block">Hence ti rose fin expansion of credit which speedily gave rise to a glut.  tt is useless for anybody to exclaim that that took place under a system which allowed private banks to issue their own paper money. I am aware of that. The point that I am trying to deal with is the inflation which results from the overissue of paper money. In that particular instance the consequences were as follow : - </para>
                    <para>A great bank iti .Ireland suddenly failed, and a run commenced on the .provincial banks &lt;&gt;f the South of England, which threatened to end as disastrously as the similar run in 1825, seeing that the banks of issue held at this time but a sixth part of their note circulation in specie. This time, however, the Bank of England came to the rescue of one of the great northern banks, and a crash was staved off. </para>
                    <para class="block">And this is how the American position during 1825-1839 is described- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>During the interval between 1.S25 and 1830, the United States had entered upon a career of false banking, based, to a large extent, upon fictitious land sales, and backed up by loans incurred in Great Britain. From 1832 onwards, a period of wild speculation had commenced, which the banks as usual had helped to extend and intensify by an excessive issue of paper money, amounting in the year 1837 to £90,000,000 for a population of about 18,000,000: an inflation which individual capitalists carried yet further by raising loans on their private property and businesses in England. In spite of the warnings of  President  Jackson, this dangerous system was pushed to the extreme. In vain was the extravagance, corruption, and swindling denounced by those who saw whither all this must lead. Paper money in excess seemed an easy way for all to make fortunes at once, and none would listen to reason so long as the universal prosperity seemed unshaken. In short, the old story of all such periods was retold on the other side of the Atlantic. The price of lond and commodities, the rents of houses and the wages, of labour, all rose together, and endless new enterprises were undertaken, numberless now houses were built. Any difficulty in high places was met by still further loans at high rates of interest in London and Amsterdam. There seemed, literally, no limit to the length to which things might be pushed, as there was assuredly no restriction put upon the action of the banks. No one seems to have imagined that the upset of all this extravagance and folly could come from England, which had been helping by her loans to breed this exaggerated confidence. No telegraphs then existed to keep the more wary on the alert as to the coming change. But the rise in the rate of discount which followed opened their eyes, and the crash which ensued was on a scale of truly new world magnitude. When credit first gave way the whole of the American hanks suspended specie payments, and eventually, in 1837, 618 banks, and In 1839, no fewer than 595 banks failed. Notes became worthless, loans remained unpaid, advances were not to be had, bankruptcy' seemed to become the rule in trade rather than the exception. The records of the period showed that the Americans themselves felt, for a time, almost hopeless of any speedy recovery. The advocates of " soft money " had had for the moment their fill of it. </para>

My experience is that, history has a habit of repeating itself; that if certain things happened then, they are likely to happen again at some future date. But if my honorable friend objects to my attempting to draw a lesson from the happenings in certain of the American States, I shall come nearer home for my illustration. I remind the House of the trend of events in Australia between 1887 and 1893. During that period, British capital was flowing into Australia in such volume that in Victoria, at all events, it could not be employed profitably. The crisis came in 1893, in which year banks failed almost daily. </para>

I am stating my views on this subject in all sincerity. I feel convinced - other honorable members may hold the contrary opinion with equal sincerity - that any move in the direction of undue inflation will result in disaster. If supporters of this policy believe that its adoption will right the wrongs of the present time; that this country will then emerge from its state of financial and industrial depression into a brighter atmosphere, they are doomed to disappointment. On this subject mine may be a voice crying in the wilderness, so far as the members of my party are concerned, but I hold my belief in all sincerity, and I am prepared to stand up to it. I am convinced that undue inflation is a dangerous weapon to use, and that its effect upon the working class of this country will be disastrous in the extreme. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have the honorable member's assurance to that effect, and I hope that he will obtain increasing support for his views among his colleagues. It is extraordinary that, at this juncture in our national affairs, it should be necessary for us to argue whether or not inflation is desirable. For some months the finances of the Commonwealth have been allowed to drift to the bad at the rate of £30,000 per day. Recently we were summoned, as a Parliament, to consider proposals which, we were given to understand, would balance the budget. We know now that the Ministry does not contemplate balancing the national ledger this year. The Acting Treasurer's proposals provide for a deficit of £2,000,000. Several months ago, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> in conference with State Premiers, and the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> in conference with State Treasurers decided that both Commonwealth and State budgets should balance. This decision followed a consultation with high financial authorities representing the Bank of England who were invited to Australia by the Federal Government. Since the matter was settled so long ago, it should not have taken this Parliament more than five minutes to endorse the decision and proceed to the consideration of proposals to solve our difficulties. All business concerns, large and small, and even the workers themselves, should be assisted to balance their budgets. We all deplore the plight of so many thousands of the working classes, and we sympathize deeply with those who return nightly to their homes saddened by the knowledge that, through their inability to secure employment, their little ones must suffer deprivation of the necessaries of life and of comforts which, in ordinary circumstances, would be theirs to enjoy. Surely all honorable members realize that time is of the essence of the contract in this matter, and that we should bestir ourselves. Unfortunately, thousands of young men in all parts of Australia are reaching manhood without any prospect of employment. Their present condition will be a serious- handicap upon them for the rest of their lives. In July last the Prime Minister declared that the balancing of the Commonwealth budget was an essential step to the restoration of the credit of Australia. Subsequently, at a meeting of the Loan Council, the issue of the following statement was authorized :  - </para>

                    <para>It is to be regretted that the Government did not take- the Opposition into its confidence long ago, when a  budget  might have been passed through the House in five minutes. If we are to achieve anything, we must abandon this bickering, party warfare, which, like a malignant cancer, has been destroying the body politic. Persons of all shades of political opinion must unite in a common effort to carry out a policy having for its object the restoration of national credit, stabilization of industry, increased production on a competitive basis, and the provision of work for our unemployed. Unfortunately, the Labour party in Australia is to-day controlled by a section which is determined to use the present depression to further its own purpose, namely, the destruction of the social system under which we live. This section is particularly strong in New South Wales, and the New South Wales members of the Federal Labour party are largely under its dominance, although some of the Labour members from other States are, I. am glad to see, prepared to stand up against them. The party controlled by this section passed a resolution that £2(5,000,000 must be found immediately by the Commonwealth Bank, and that demand has been voiced by honorable members in this House. They do not know how the £20,000,000 is to be found, nor does the Australasian Council of Trade Unions ; but they make the demand none the less. It has been avowed by the leaders of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions that the social system under which we live must crumble. Their object is the destruction of that system, the total destruction of the capitalistic system upon which society is organized to-day. On the 3rd March, 1923, the .late M. Lenin advised the Australian supporters of his doctrine as follows : - </para>

                    <para>One unfortunate action of the present Government was the imposition of duties that are having the effect of driving valuable business away from Australia. Belgium formerly took 6.45 per cent, of our total exports, while only .6 per cent, of our imports came from that country. Belgium has retaliated by taking action to reduce its consumption of Australian products. -France, which was taking 10-J per cent, of our total exports, with 2.6 per cent, "of our imports coming from France, has similarly retaliated, because of the effect of the Australian tariff on French trade. The Netherlands Government has decided to take similar action. No less than 98 per cent, of the flour shipped to Java formerly came from Australia, and 100 per cent, of the butter used in Java was sent from this country; but that trade is now threatened. It is most unfortunate that the Government did not fully consider the probable effect of the new duties on primary exports before imposing them. My first suggestion is that we should grapple with, and then improve, the unfortunate position of Australia, apart altogether from party politics. Our financial difficulties should be discussed either by the whole of the members sitting in conference, or by a representative section. We should out-vote the delegates of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, and those who want to bring about the destruction of Australia simply because they do not like the capitalistic system. If we are satisfied with that system, the majority of members in this Parliament should do the right thing in the interests of Australia, its people, and its industry. We should develop our industries, and do something for the primary producers who have to export. But before we can do that, we must brush aside the influences that are seeking to drag the Government from the path to prosperity so as to bring about revolution and appalling conditions throughout Australia. </para>
                    <para>My second suggestion is to enter into commercial agreements with countries that are prepared to trade with us in any particular commodity. There is 1:10 need to enter into any general commercial agreement, or to send our trade commissioners to other countries seeking better markets. We should endeavour to sell our wheat to countries that are producing something that we require. For instance, we could sell our sugar to Canada, and obtain motor cars in exchange. We could send our butter, meat, and wool to countries that requirethem, and take other products in exchange. By entering into business agreements, apart altogether from political influences and glaring propaganda in newspapers, we would be able to relieve ourselves of our exportable surplus, to the ultimate benefit of the producer, industry, and employment generally. That could be done at once, without wasting time attending imperial conferences from which no good can result. What did we seek at the Imperial Conference? At one time the Baldwin Government was about to give preference to the dominions, but the first Ramsay MacDonald Government took office and vetoed the arrangements. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin</inline> again returned to office, preference was given to the dominions, but when the Labour Government once more took office it threatened to abolish dominions preference. Eventually, it decided to continue the existing preference, a concession that we could have obtained by cable. The Imperial Conference has been a waste of time; our delegates could have been in other parts of the world making agreements, and selling our surplus products in exchange for goods that we require. Instead of that, we are continuing an adverse trade with America. During the last ten years, we have sent to that country £230,000,000 in gold as an. offset to the few products that.we send there. We have not harassed America . in the slightest degree. We have harassed Great Britain, and, unfortunately, there are some people in this country who would further harass that country, although it and the colonies are taking more than half of our exports. The British trade unions have passed a most significant resolution. It is an 'indication of the trend that has taken place in Great Britain towards empire trade. Two great organizations,the Trade Unions Congress and the Federation of British </para>
                    <para class="block">Industries - representing both labour and capital - sent a joint memorandum to the British Prime Minister, strongly urging that the most important task of the Imperial Conference, which was shortly to be held, should be the formulation of a constructive trade policy for the British Commonwealth of Nations. But the Labour Government of Great Britain has fallen down on its job. It has ignored the claims, not only of its supporters, but also of the dominions. On the other hand we find that Russia is actually flooding Great Britain with wheat. The British Labour Government is actually allowing wheat grown by the slaves of the Soviet to be dumped into the country. There is no standard of living in Russia. The peasants are compelled to grow wheat, and to contribute their quota for export. In many cases the imposition of that quota has caused rioting, and the death of producers who opposed the Soviet, and endeavoured to keep their wheat for their own use. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, the market should be ours. The British Labour Government, under agreement with Russia, is buying wheat grown by slave labour, from a country that has repudiated its debt to Great Britain, while we have to sell our products to make it possible for us to pay our debts abroad. We, as Australians, are determined to honour our obligations, but our position is- made very difficult when we have not even the support and sympathy of the British Government, our greatest creditor. That, Government is assisting the Soviet to the detriment of Australian and Canadian growers, who are producing wheat under white men's conditions in a civilized and Christian community. The action of the British Labour Government is scandalous, and I urge honorable members to disregard party considerations, so that we may take action to enter into commercial agreements with- countries who are willing to buy our surplus products. Why waste time after preparing a budget, submitting, it to caucus, amending and reprinting it, and communicating it to the Prime Minister abroad, in debating as to whether we should balance budgets or adopt a policy of inflation ? </para>

We should concern ourselves with entering into treaties or arrangements with countries that are prepared to trade with us. I find that the primary producers of Australia are responsible for 95.71 per cent, of our total exports. On the other hand, the industrialists in the large cities, who nave a high standard of living, and for whom the Australasian Council of Trade Unions is now seeking a 40-hour week and a 25 per cent, increase in the basic wage, are responsible for only 4.29 per cent, of our total exports.

                    <para>A great deal has been said with regard to standards of living. What do many of our people care about considerations of that sort? Not so long ago there was a most disgraceful coal. strike in Newcastle. Were the miners fighting to maintain the standard of living when they refused to forgo ls. a ton out of a total reduction of 5s. a ton, to make possible the export of that commodity? Let us consider the conditions that they permitted to exist in their desire to obtain a better standard of living.

                            <para>- I would call in some person who was not dictated to by outside influences that desired anything but a balancing of the budget. I would find work by dispensing with the party wrangling that now goes on, and by disregarding the directions of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, which is talcing advantage of the present opportunity to attempt to wreck Australia. Its idea is to discharge the employees of the Commonwealth Bank, and to engage workmen to run note-printing machines, so that they and their pals may have a good time. It is a wonderful proposition from their point of view, but the man who has a home, or the primary producer who has a farm, would quickly find that his security was considerably depreciated. The idea, of course, is that inflation would go some way towards giving effect to their policy that " There shall be no peace until the worker holds and controls fields, factories and workshops." This is one of the methods by which they propose to destroy capitalism and create the barbarous system which they wish us to live under. </para>

                    <para>This afternoon the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> referred to the expenditure incurred by the previous Administration on public works, many of which, he said, were of an unproductive character. I do not think the honorable member intentionally misrepresented the position; but the information which he supplied to the House was inaccurate. The honorable member said that"' from 1923-4 to 1928-9, it was claimed that a sum of £31,000,000 hod been spent on country works which he enumerated, but, be added that, to make up the amount, naval and similar expenditure had to be included. That is not correct. The amount included an expenditure of £1,250,000 on the Murray waters scheme and £3,720,000 for commencing the unification of the railway gauges of Australia by the construction of a line from Kyogle to Brisbane. It should be unnecessary for me to mention that that railway was only recently opened for through traffic, and, although the work could not be immediately productive, the whole amount spent has been showing a return of 4 per cent, on capital outlay, and the line will eventually show a higher return. A sum of £810,000 spent on wire-netting was borrowed by the Commonwealth at 5 per cent. ; but a rebate of 2 per cent, was allowed to the purchaser, so that it was actually secured by producers at . 3 per cent. In connexion with health laboratories, on which £50,000 was expended, valuable work was conducted in various country districts with respect to the hookworm disease. On the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway £375,000 was spent, and on country buildings for the Postal Department £1,070,000. During the seven years the Bruce-Page Government was in office £11,400,000 was expended on country telephones, which amount was larger than had been spent on similar work since the inception of federation. On migration works £920,000 was expended, and on roads £7,750,000. The share of this money which went to New South Wales was spent principally on coastal roads. In Queensland, the country roads are not cement, concrete, or bitumen, but of good gravel. and have been constructed to enable the primary producers to get their produce to market. Thus they are reproductive. </para>

                            <para>- From the newspapers which published our claim. The information supplied by the honorable member for Corangamite was inaccurate. Further, a sum of £80,000 was spent on bridges and bores, £30,000 in Northern Australia and £50,000 as a loan to Papua. A sum of £111,000 was also spent on lighthouses at points distant from the capital cities. In. addition, and not included in the claim £7,400,000 was spent on fleet construction, £1,500,000 on defence equipment, £4,000,000 on war service homes, and £400,000 subscription to Amalgamated Wireless, which also benefited the country. Although the last mentioned amounts are not included in the £31,000,000 which it is claimed was spent to benefit, country districts, the honorable member for Corangamite included them as though they made up the total. </para>

We should let the people of Australia, see that we realize the seriousness of the position, and are prepared to do our best to improve the existing trade conditions, and to provide em ploy ment for those who are unfortunately out of work. An effort should be made to provide profitable employment for those workless young men who are now approaching ma.nhood. It is the responsibility of this Government to see that the men, women, and- children of Australia are not deprived of their rights by those in control of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, whose policy can only bring the people to such a state of poverty and destitution that the revolution which they so much desire will be brought about. </para>

The state of our finances, the parlous position of commerce, and of the primary producers, and the tragedy of unemployment are, in themselves, of sufficient importance to justify a debate of first-class importance. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> said that the issues involved were above party, and I think that honorable members opposite were justified in asking if his speech was being delivered in that spirit. Still, the honorable member will have my cordial support in his plea for a consideration of this subject in the manner he suggested. Undoubtedly, the condition of business generally, and the position of the primary producers particularly, to which, the honorable member so eloquently referred, is so serious that it is the responsibility of every honorable member to consider the subject in a non-party spirit. Australia has been, caught in a vortex of world-wide depression. The roots of the problems which we are discussing go down very deeply. It is essential to discuss these issues in the manner suggested ; because this depression has not beencaused by any party in this House. No party couldhave avoided the troubles which are now facing Australia, for they are the result of world-wide causes and effects. In analysing <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> position with a view to finding a way out of our difficulties, we should try to discover the real cause of the present world-wide depression. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in an eloquent speech, referred to the paradox of a world over-supplied with goods and its population suffering tragically from unemployment and under-consumption. There is undoubtedly room for an investigation into the cause of this anomaly. Honorable members have advanced many reasons why we are in our present situation. It has been said that our troubles are due to the debts created through the war, and suggestions have been made for the cancellation of all war debts. It has also been said frequently in this debate that our troubles are due largely to what virtually amounts to a cornering of the world's gold supply by certain nations, notably the United States of America and France, and to a lesser degree, the Argentine. This cornering of the gold supply, it has been argued, has caused a contraction in the currency of those nations which have adopted the gold standard. I hold entirely different views. I believe that our difficulties have been caused by the accumulation of wealth in the form of goods - the oversupply of wheat, wool, meat, butter, rubber, cotton, and other requirements of mankind. Our inability to sell our own goods is largely due to the world-wide policy of trade restriction and the building up of tariffs. This policy has spread like a disease from one nation to another. The building up of these tariff barriers has rendered it impossible for the different countries to exchange their commodities on a reasonable basis. This, in my opinion, is one of the main causes of our troubles. </para>

                    <para class="block">Unfortunately, since the passing of that motion, the making of tariffs and the imposing of embargoes, as between nation and nation and country and country, has gone on to a greater extent than ever before in the world's history. Commerce, <inline font-style="italic">par excellence,</inline> is a matter of international concern. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have consistently pointed out, from my place in this chamber, the foolishness of our fiscal policy, by which we have endeavoured to create a Utopia here, and to persuade ourselves that we can dissociate ourselves almost entirely from world commerce and policy. It seems to me, as one who has travelled in other parts of the world, and lived for a time, at least, in other countries, that our geographical position has given us an isolated outlook. We are a white nation living in an out-of-the-way corner of the world, with no other white nation as our neighbour, except New Zealand. We cannot rub shoulders with the citizens of other countries. As a member of the crew of ft British sailing shy D, as I went up the Scheldt river years ago, I was told that the country on one bank was Holland, and that on the other Belgium. These two countries have different ideals, a different currency and a different language; yet it is possible to row across the river from one country to the other in a very little while. In these days of air transport, it is possible to leave the Croydon aerodrome in Great Britain and visit any one of three or four different countries within an hour or two. This enables a resident of Great Britain easily to get the point of  view  of the other fellow, and it gives the people a more cosmopolitan and balanced outlook on world questions generally. In Australia, we have no one to wrangle with but ourselves', and have proceeded with great enthusiasm to do so. Our isolation has caused the development of a spurious form of patriotism, and we have, unfortunately, a warped and selfcentred national outlook, which is exemplified particularly in our tariff policy. Put into plain English, we have adopted a trade policy which means, in effect, that while our buying of goods from the other fellow is condemned, his buying of goods from us is applauded. </para>

                            <para>- That is unfortunately too true. It is this spurious patriotism which has caused most countries to attempt to confine their trade and commerce within their own borders. Trade is not the flowing of commodities in one direction only, and sooner or later we, in common with other countries of the world, will be forced to recognize this economic fact. We, in Australia, do not consider it desirable to buy either the raw materials or the manufactured goods of other countries, though we set out with the greatest . of enthusiasm to get other countries to buy our goods from us. We do not want to take their goods, but we reach out with both hands to take their money. We have borrowed all that we could, and have set up a standard of living which is higher than that obtaining in the countries from which we have borrowed money. Can the debtor maintain a higher rate of living than his creditor? </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, but it does not last very long. And  it  has not lasted very long with us as a nation. The end was bound to come. Some of the most ardent advocates of borrowing have readied the stage when they declare that therules of the game are all wrong.Now that they can borrow no more, and it becomes necessary to repay our debts and interest, they set to work with a microscope to find flaws in the system. Various suggestions have been made to cope with the problem. It is a very humiliating position for Australia to be in. From time to time I have raised my voice against our borrowing policy overseas, and foretold that its inevitable conclusion was' disaster. However, I do not wish to quote past speeches, or to say, " I told you so." </para>

                    <para>The collapse of world prices is largely due to the collapse of world trade, because countries have erected tariff barriers one against the other. The honorable member, forWide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> referred to the position of ourprimary producers as a result of that policy. He intimated that  95.71  per cent, of our trade in Australia originates from our primary industries. Notwithstanding the importance of those industries to the nation, the Government has pursued a tariff policy which adversely affects the production costs of the primary producer, and makes it difficult for him to compete in the markets of the world. That policy has brought about trade reprisals, in the form- of dumping duties and embargoes, which have militated against the marketing of our primary products. Italy has raised its customs duties against Australian products, and the press recently stated that that country purchased .  50,000,000  bushels from the United States of America on long terms. France has issued suggestions to her colonies which., virtually, mean the boycotting of Australian goods. All that is the result of our tariff policy. It is our primary, and not our secondary, industries that suffer. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> are practically shut out from the various markets of the world, and compelled to force our exportable products into Great Britain. I, and others, have claimed that our tariff policy has assisted greatly to bring about the existing depression. Thecounter argument is that that is not so, as the depression has affected all countries alike, be they f reetrade or protected. </para>
                    <para>Other nations have taken advantage of Great Britain's freetrade policy to dump their goods there, and destroyed our market overseas. That is where our miscalled policy of preference has landed us. Ostensibly, we give preference to British products; actually we have raised a high tariff wall against the Mother Country, stuck on a few more bricks against the other nations, and called that giving preference to Great Britain. Even while our Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> is overseas seeking the favour of that country in the form of a preferential treatment to our primary products, the right honorable gentleman's Government is introducing tariff schedules and embargoes that are adversely affecting British trade with the Commonwealth. It is clear to me, as I feel sure it must - be clear to any student of the subject, that the policy of trade restriction has really destroyed Great Britain's overseas, market, and diminished her purchasing power. Being one of the few free markets of the world, she has been subjected to the dumping of the accumulated surpluses of other nations. ThereRussia has dumped her wheat, Argentine her meat, and Denmark her butter, at slump prices. Because of her  2,500,000  unemployed and her reduced purchasing power, Great Britain is unable to absorb the huge quantity of products that pour into her markets. I ask leave to continue my remarks. </para>
