                        <para>- As I stated yesterday, I have been advised by the Minister for Trade and Customs that the progress towards a three power pact has been satisfactory. A message from another source stated that there was still a possibility of a five power pact being entered into. I cannot understand the emphatic newspaper statement that the dominions are an obstacle to agreement. My advice from the representative of the Government is that whilst he is supporting a pact for disarmament or the reduction of armaments, he is not prepared to subscribe to an agreement that will involve Australia in an obligation to intervene in the internal troubles of Europe.  His  attitude is that whatever action is necessary in that regard should be decided at the Assembly of the League of Nations. </para>

                        <para>- I have been watching with grave concern the growth of unemployment in Australia, but honorable members will realize that this alarming development is world wide. The Government hopes that the action it has taken in recent months will have beneficial results. Unfortunately these remedial measures are somewhat belated, and probably some time will be required to correct the evil effects of excessive importations in past years. </para>

                        <para>- The exchange of cruisers between the Australian and British Navies for training purposes is customary. In war time the two navies must co-operate, and the Naval authorities strongly recommends the exchange of vessels in order that the Australian navy may gain a knowledge of fleet manoeuvres and co-ordinated action. The arrangement will involve an additional expenditure of approximately £3,000. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I desire to inform the House of the result of the loan recently issued to provide for the conversion and redemption of the Commonwealth loans maturing in Australia on 15th March, 1930, and 15th December, 1930. The main object of the loan was to deal with the securities maturing on 15th March, of which £10,637,360 were outstanding at the beginning of this financial year. Sinking fund purchases and redemptions from 1st July to 15th March reduced this sum by £360,050, so that at the maturity date the amount of the March loan was £10,277,310. To cover this amount, the Commonwealth Government, with the approval of the Loan Council, invited holders of the March securities to convert into a new loan carrying interest at 6 per cent. and maturing on 15th March, 1937. At the same time cash subscriptions were invited on the same basis to provide money for paying off unconverted holdings. The results show that March securities to the value of £6,279,200 were converted by 12,815 holders, whilst cash subscriptions totalling £7,724,570 were lodged by 20,892 subscribers. In all, £14,003,770 was provided in March conversions and cash subscriptions. This was £3,726,460 in excess of the amount required for the March loan. The loan prospectus, in common with all other conversion prospectuses of the Commonwealth, provided that the cash subscribed would be used only for the redemption of Commonwealth securities. The excess subscriptions were, therefore, not available for public works purposes. As the Commonwealth also had to provide for a loan of £60,000,000 maturing on 15th December next, it was decided to break down this huge December total now by inviting holders to convert at once on the same terms as the holders of the March loan. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The response to this invitation has been highly gratifying, conversion applications covering a total of about £34,000,000 having been lodged by over 30,000 holders. The December operation has also been materially assisted by redemption effected out of the National Debt Sinking Fund, and by using the excess subscriptions to the March loan for the purpose of paying off December holdings. The position of the December loan may be stated as follows :  - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">As sinking funds of not less than £2,000,000 will be available next year for the redemption of the December securities, the total amount to be faced at the maturity date will be approximately £18,000,000. In financial quarters in Australia, in London and New York, grave doubts were expressed as to the ability of Australia to arrange for its local 1930 conversion loans without recourse to the oversea markets. The result of the operations just completed is a definite answer to the suggestion that Australia might have to seek oversea help in this connexion. Not only have we fully covered the March operation, but we have reduced the amount to be faced in December from £60,000,000 to £18,000,000. This very satisfactory result materially eases the loan position and must help to enhance the credit of Australia. </para>

                        - The Commonwealth and the Treasurer are to be congratulated . upon the statement which has just been made to the House. I am glad, as an Australian, that the people are showing confidence in their own country, and we are all proud of the success of this conversion operation. There is, of course, another aspect to be considered. I am afraid that the success of this loan conversion shows that at the present time a good many Australians are not prepared to invest in industrial and other enterprises; but from the point of view of public finance and the credit and security of Australia as a whole, we welcome the Treasurer's statement.

                    <para class="block">The object of this bill is to remove a doubt as to the legality of agreements that have been entered into between the overseas shipping companies and Australian producers. It will be remembered that at the end of 1928 an announcement was made that a substantial increase was to take place in the freights of overseas ships coming from London to Australia, and the general belief was that it would be almost immediately followed by an increase of freights from Australia overseas. Naturally every one was alarmed at that prospect, because our primary industries were suffering, and an increase in freights would have been perhaps the last kick that the producers could have stood. It was suggested that the increase in oversea freights would be about 10 per cent., or perhaps more. </para>

                            <para>- That was the announcement made, but the belief was general that it would be followed immediately by an increase in freights from Australia to London. Acting on that belief, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> communicated with the oversea shipping companies and asked them to suspend any increase in freights until the whole subject had been discussed with the producers and the shippers in Australia. In response the shipping companies sent representatives from overseas, mostly from London, to this country. They met in conference with the producers who are our most important shippers. That conference was held in April, 1929, and as a result an association was formed known as the Australian Oversea Transport Association. It consisted of overseas shipping companies representing 22 British and foreign lines and also the shippers' organizations, principally producers' organizations. The representatives of those companies and organizations formed a committee in each State known as the Oversea Transport Committee, and from each of those State committees there were elected the members of a central council consisting of one delegate representing the exporters and one delegate representing the shipowners from each State, making twelve delegates altogether, and in addition a  chairman  representing the exporters. The Australian Oversea Transport Association represents, of course, British lines and many other Continental shipping lines, including all the shipping services regularly serving the Australian trade with Europe. The following list sets out the principal organizations which are represented in this association: - </para>

                    <para class="block">When thu first representations were made to me it was stated that the object of the proposal was to regulate shipping, and the amount of produce to be shipped, in such a way that costs could be kept down, and an increase in the present freight rates avoided. On looking through the draft of the proposed agreements, I found that no mention was made of any fixed rates of freight. When I  drew  attention to this fact I was informed that the ship-owners did not desire provisions of that kind to be inserted, although it was understood that there would be no increase in the existing rates. I was not satisfied with that understanding, and intimated that if the law were to be amended to permit agreements to be made with the object of keeping freights down, it was essential that it should be set out in them. The representatives who waited upon me were rather afraid that the head offices of the shipping companies would not agree to the insertion of such a provision. I insisted upon the necessity for it, and a subcommittee pf the Cabinet was appointed to go thoroughly into the whole subject. Subsequently the representatives agreed that fixed rates of freight should be inserted in the agreements. </para>
                    <para>Separate agreements will be made with each organization and each shipping company which handles different classes of produce, and in every case a schedule of freights will be included in the agreement. The agreements will remain in force for twelve months, and during that period no variation of the freight rates may be made. </para>

                    <para>The object of the amendment of the act is simply to allow these agreements to be made between the ship-owners and shippers. The Government does not come into the matter at all, and does not endorse or ratify the agreements, which will be mutual arrangements between the parties concerned. When this act was first passed in 1906, the object of it was to prevent combines and monopolies squeezing any section of the community. Originally it was not intended to apply to shipping, but had relation principally to the Coal Vend and similar organizations which might attempt to act in restraint of trade, or bring undue pressure upon the community. In this case it is obvious that, as the agreements are being made mutually by all the parties concerned, there can be no suggestion that pressure is being exerted with the object of injuring any one. It was never contemplated that the act should operate to prevent the making of mutual agreements. The 22 shipping companies which trade to and from Australia are already well organized, and are known as the shipping combine. They have it in their power, in the absence of agreements of the kind now proposed, to increase freights on our produce at any moment, but if these agreements are made they will- not be able to do so, except after the expiration of twelve months, and the giving of three months' notice. If no notice is given of an intention to terminate the agreements, they will remain in force for another year. The result of the making of the agreements will be to stabilize shipping and freights. At present the shipping companies may increase their rates without consulting any one; but it is now proposed to provide that no increase shall be made without consulting the shippers. There will still be competition between the various shipping lines, but there will also be a certain amount of regulation. </para>

                            <para>- There is competition to this extent, that shippers have the choice of certain lines. British buyers of wool, for instance, ship their wool on British ships, and Italian and French buyers on Italian or French ships. That choice will still be available. But the bunning of the ships will be arranged so that overlapping and wastage of effort will he eliminated. If these arrangements come into force it will be guaranteed that sufficient ships will be run to lift the cargo offering, but we shall 'not have ships running half empty. For instance, two boats may run to Townsville,' and take in full cargoes of meat. That will be much better than half a dozen boats calling at that port to lift small parcels of meat, and then calling at other ports along the coast to load other small parcels. If a boat is filled at one port, it can go direct to its destination, and the meat will open up in better condition than if the hatches have to be lifted half a dozen times before the holds are filled. The same remarks apply to fruit. One boat will be able to go to Tasmanian ports, for instance, and fill up, and another boat go to mainland ports and fill up, which will be better than both boats calling at all the ports and only partially filling at any of them. </para>

                            <para>- No; but it appears to me that it would greatly facilitate their work if they did so. However, the Government is not taking any responsibility for the methods that are being adopted. A body is being set up to organize the tonnage and control the cargo available from time to time, so that the shipping companies will know the number of boats that will be required. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; it is set out in the agreements that the tonnage shall be adequate, efficient and regular. The agreements apply only to the  regular  berth cargo, and not to the cargo of chartered boats such as carry our wheat overseas. The wheat organizations have only been represented in the  negotations  because a certain proportion of wheat is exported on the regular lines. The great bulk of our wheat is carried by tramp steamers. These will not be affected by the agreements. The freight charges of chartered boats are, as a rule, somewhat lower than those of the ordinary boats. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so in special cases; but chartered boats will still be necessary for the handling of our wheat. The bulk of the harvest will be still handled by special wheat boats, and the regular berth boats will handle  only  small parcels of wheat. The agreements affect only the boats trading regularly with Australia. </para>

Throughout the whole discussion, members of the Cabinet and myself carefully watched the interests of Australian producers. We were met on every point we raised, and I believe that every possible safeguard has been made. Honorable members must realize that this is a matter of organization by both parties; not by the Government. It is an arrangement that the two parties concerned will give each other service, and not give their service to any one else. The ship-owners guarantee that they will not give the same freight rates to persons not in the agreement, but no one will be debarred from coming into the agreement if he chooses to do so. On the other hand, shippers agree to ship only by these 22 lines. </para>

                            <para>- None at all. The wording of the bill makes it plain that those who offer to come into the agreement cannot be discriminated against. If the ship-owners refused to admit any one, and then charged him the higher freight rate, this provision would not relieve them from any of the penalties to which they would be subject under the existing act.. That is a further safeguard. Unless the producers in Australia can obtain the cheapest rates and the quickest service for their wheat, fruit, butter and other produce it will seriously affect the development of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Osborne,</inline> representing the butter cooperative and cheese factories, stated that all the producing industries were unanimous in their desire to bring about this agreement. He said that the New Zealand Dairy Produce Board had made a satisfactory agreement as a result of which their products are transported at freights considerably lower than are paid by Australian producers. The Dairy Produce Board here is in a position to control the whole of its exports, but it is unable to arrange a contract with the ship-owners owing to the existence of section 7a of the Industries Preservation Act. This agreement is not intended to cover wheat, flour, or cargo of that kind, which will be left to tramp steamers. The ships which carry the bulk of the wheat are chartered in London. If honorable members desire further information I shall be pleased to give it during the committee stage of the bill, and also to deal with any paragraph in the agreement upon which they desire enlightenment. Although the agreement is nor embodied in the bill, and the Government is in no way responsible for it, we must be guided by the terms of the agreement in determining the wisdom of this legislation. The Government believes that the interests of the producers will be' safeguarded by their representation on the Association. If any producers feel that organizations at present in existence are not representative of them, there is nothing to prevent them from forming new organizations, and becoming parties to the agreement. There is nothing to prevent an individual farmer or exporter of goods from becoming a party to the agreement on the same terms as are enjoyed by organizations. </para>

                    <para>It may be argued that this will enable the shipping combine to make contracts with the producers to the exclusion of the tramp' lines; that it is in effect buttressing trade combines. In this connexion it is well to remember, however, that  whatever combination can be effected in the shipping trade exists already. There is hi existence a shipping conference which has organized the Australian trade fairly completely, though it has not organized the allocation of ships to various ports. Arrangements in that regard are still haphazard, and there is much overlapping and waste. On the other hand, the exporters are not organized at all. When there was an Australian-wide wheat pool in existence, organization was very complete. Those in control knew exactly what space would be required, and arrangements were made to get it. We must face the fact that this is a period of trade organization. Whatever opinions one may have on the general subject of shipping combines, it must be admitted that it is better for our producers, through their organizations, to enter into an agreement such as this, and thus have some control over freight rates, than that they should remain at the mercy of the ship-owners. I do not use that expression with any desire to be offensive to the ship-owners. From my discussions with them, I believe that they realize that it would be unwise for them to risk killing the goose which lays the golden egg. * They are aware that excessive freight rates would so seriously hamper Australian production as to injure their own trade. They desire to leave freights as they are, provided they can carry on at a profit to themselves. Hence the need for 'regulation. I believe that it would have been better to have kept the Commonwealth Shipping Line in operation as a check on the combine, but we must face the fact that the line has gone, and the shippers now must deal with the shipping conference. I contemplate, with serious misgiving, any possibility of an increase of present freights on Australian produce. For that reason we have gone into this matter, and have agreed to amend the law in the manner set out. I commend the measure to the favorable consideration of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad to be able to approve fully and wholly of this bill. The measure had been prepared in part by the last Government, and steps would have been taken to bring it before Parliament had that Government remained in office. It is a step towards the rationalization of one important industry affecting Australia. We are, I think, beginning to realize that while we may .be afraid of combines, trusts, monopolies, and the like, the successful conduct  of modern industry demands organization, and unless we are prepared to follow the example of other countries, we shall find ourselves doing everything on a small scale, and in a foolishly competitive manner. I believe in competition, but competition in some cases can be overdone. In past years we have had an unnecessary number of ships calling at some of our ports. There has been, in consequence, irregularity of service, and failure to serve the interests of the community as a whole. The scramble for cargoes reminds me of a bus running ahead of a tram and picking up the passengers on the same route. There is no sense in it. When the Commonwealth Shipping Line was sold by the last Government it was done because of the serious losses which were occurring, and because of certain matters of principle on which the two sides of the House were acutely divided. At that time, it was apparent that all shipping lines trading to Australia were losing heavily. It was predicted that freights would inevitably increase as a result of selling the Line. The Government was anxious that the best shipping service possible should bp rendered to Australia at the lowest cost. Consequently, when an announcement was made that freights would be increased, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> invited a delegation of British ship-owners to come to Australia. This bill is partly the result of the work of that delegation, and partly of the work of the Australian producers, as mentioned by the Prime Minister. The Australian Oversea Transport Association was formed, and it is a very representative body indeed. As soon as those interested began to get down to the facts, and sought to arrange co-ordination of sailings, security of loadings, freight rates, &amp;c, they found themselves faced with the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906-10. That act belonged to a past age in regard to many of its provisions. I agree that some regulation of these matters is required, but I think that honorable members will agree with me that if we were reconsidering the matter now a good many modifications would  be made. This bill is a modification of the act, and I am glad that the Government has introduced it, because it constitutes a recognition by the Government of the very obvious principle that industry must be profitable if it is to be carried on. Section 4 of the existing act imposes very heavy penalties, up to £500 a day, upon any person who enters into any contract in relation to trade and commerce with other countries, or among the States, in restraint of, or in an attempt to restrain, trade and commerce. That is rather an amazing provision. The' act specifies defences, and if it can be shown that what was done was not to the detriment of the public, no offence is committed. Nevertheless, persons would hesitate to take part in a transaction which might render them liable to such a heavy penalty. Section 7 also provides a penalty of £500 a day, and of £1,000 a day in the case of corporations, against those who monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with others to monopolize any part of the trade and commerce with other countries or among the States, with intent to control, to the detriment of the public, the supply or price of any service, merchandise, or commodity. Section 7a fixes a penalty of £500 upon- </para>

                    <para>Section 7b contains similar provisions with respect to refusals to supply services for the reason that the other person concerned does not deal exclusively with the person so refusing. The agreement proposed is one under which the shippers contract in relation to the shipping of specified articles to deal exclusively with the shipping companies who are the other parties to it. That agreement almost certainly would be an offence under the provisions of section 7a of the act, and action in pursuance of it would involve an offence under section 7b. Accordingly, if this degree of rationalization of the shipping industry is to be brought about there is very little doubt that a measure like this is necessary. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has stated that the bill is introduced to remove a doubt that exists as to the legality of the proposed agreement. I have seen that agreement only this morning, and from a first reading of it have not the slightest doubt that under our present law it is hopelessly illegal, and that therefore it is necessary to enact this legislation. The Prime Minister has referred to certain of its provisions. The agreement fixes the rates of freight for a period of twelve months. Clause 3 provides :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">If the terms of this agreement are not final, it might be advisable to reconsider the wording " any shipper is entitled to enter into any agreement." The agreement is made between certain persons of the one part, called the ship-owners, and certain persons of the other part, called the shippers. The object of Clause 4 is to provide that every person who desires to ship goods shall have the same rights. It might be worth while to consider an alteration of the phraseology so as to make it read " any person desiring to ship goods of the class mentioned in the agreement shall be entitled", &amp;c. </para>

                    <para class="block">Clause 15 limits the agreement to a period of twelve mouths and thereafter, subject to determination upon three months' notice being given in writing. That is reasonable. There are one or two matters which, from a drafting point of view, I might mention, but if the Prime Minister will allow me to do so I should like to bring them privately before officers of the Attorney-General's Department. They are small matters which do not affect the main principle. </para>
                    <para>There is only one other matter to which L particularly invite the attention of the Prime Minister. This bill gives a good deal of power to the Australian Oversea Transport Association. I know personally a considerable number of the gentlemen who are in that association, and I think that we can rely upon their good faith in all respects. At the same time, however, when one reads the bill one sees that by its first provision it removes from the penalties which would otherwise be applicable contracts of a certain description which are approved by the Australian Oversea Transport Association. The Australian Oversea Transport Association means the association formed under that name in Sydney on the 25th June, 1929, and includes the council of the association. I have frequently said that I have no desire to see governments interfering in business ventures; but I suggest that, having regard to the unique position in which this association is placed by this legislation, it would be reasonable for the Government to require it to furnish an annual report as to all agreements that are entered into in pursuance of this legislation. When I say " all agreements " I do not wish it to be understood that I am suggesting that there should be a voluminous return setting out all the bills of lading that are issued in a year. Anything of that nature would be hopeless. I suggest that there should be a report indicating the operations that are taking place under and by virtue of this law. If a report of the transactions of the association were submitted annually, it would be a safeguard. I do not believe that the association would have any hesitation in agreeing to supply it. </para>

                        <para>. - While giving the Government every credit for endeavoring to do its utmost in the interests of primary producers, I am not altogether unperturbed regarding this bill. This is an age of combines and trusts, and the fixation of prices. The law as it now stands makes it an offence for combinations to take advantage of any section of the community in the sale of commodities. The object of this proposed amendment of the law is to give them immunity from the penalties provided. As a layman in. shipping matters I believe that one safeguard against the raising of freights is to have a continuous stream of tramp steamers entering our ports. In many countries there is a surplus of shipping accommodation. In the exporting season vessels that trade to Australia secure full cargoes, and that has a tendency to keep freights down to a reasonable level. The effect of entering into an agreement with 23 or 24 big steamship companies will be to crush out the tramp steamers. The agreement will operate for only twelve months, and when that period has elapsed this strong combination of shipping interests will be iri a position to make what terms they care to dictate to shippers, because there will be no competition to exercise a restraining' influence upon them. It is remarkable that, at a time when such great stress is laid upon the necessity for reducing costs, the shipping companies should threaten to raise freights. </para>

                            <para>.  - I have no desire to prolong a discussion upon a matter that appears to be noncontroversial ; but as the representative of a rural constituency from which considerable quantities of primary produce are exported, I wish to voice my entire agreement with the bill that has been brought forward this morning by the Prime Minister, and to say that it is indeed a pleasure to be able to congratulate the right honorable gentleman upon having taken action with which I cordially agree. Reference has already been made to the fact that when, early last year, it was reported in the press that there was a likelihood of an increase in freights on goods coming from overseas to Australia, the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> invited representatives of the shipping companies to visit Australia and meet importers and exporters before taking action in that direction. The shipowners accepted that invitation, and met representatives of the importers and exporters in Sydney. At that conference the representatives of the ship-owners pointed out very forcibly that the tonnage coming to and going from Australia was far greater than was warranted by the quantity of cargo offering. It was stated that freights must inevitably be higher in the long run if ships left Australia with cargoes that taxed their capacity only to the extent of  50  per cent. or  60  per cent. It was unanimously agreed to ask the Governments of the States and the Commonwealth to reduce port dues, to alter the incidence of income tax, and also to amend this act, as it prohibited the making of agreements between shipper and ship-owner. For some years agreements have been made by the Export Control Boards, such as the Dairy Produce Export Control Board and the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, that were set up by legislation by a former government. Those boards were given power to negotiate on an industry basis with the ship-owners with a view to obtaining the best possible terms for the carriage of the produce, the export of which they controlled. As a layman I have been unable to understand why a body set up by the Commonwealth could make agreements which ordinarily are prohibited by another statute. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> expressed the view held by some people, that the greater the number of tramp steamers coming to Australia to lift cargo, the lower the freights will be. </para>

                    <para>Certainly, at times, tramp steamers have picked up, at cut rates, cargoes which otherwise would have been carried by other lines, and the shippers have enjoyed a temporary advantage. But we have to remember that ultimately the exporters must pay for all ships that come to Australia to carry their products. If the number of ships is in excess of requirements, the shippers will have to pay more, and ultimately an excess of shipping must mean an increase of freights. Certain steamship lines can be relied upon to maintain a regular service, not only in the busy season, but also at times when the trade is not sufficient to be profitable, and they deserve special consideration. I recollet a sentence, in a report by a committee appointed by the British Government, to the effect that the shippers expect the ship at the wharf without fail, whilst the ship-owner expects the cargo on the wharf without fail. Shipping companies, which provide a regular and dependable service, have a right to expect the shippers to provide cargo for them, rather than to give their business to tramps, which call only when profitable business is offering, and give, at best, a spasmodic service. The only practical way of ensuring the concentration of cargoes for the regular shipping lines, is by the shippers agreeing to send the' whole of their products by those lines in return for concession rates. If these agreements should result in the reduction of the number of tramp steamers to such an extent as would make possible an increase of freights by the regular lines, some action to protect exporters might be necessary, and the Prime Minister stated that, in such an event, the Government would be prepared to repeal the clause that he is now proposing to insert in the. Industries Preservation Act. The arrangement proposed by the Government may be highly beneficial to Australian exporters, and proves that despite the dismal prophecies of Labour members, no harm was clone to the primary producers by the sale of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the bill. It proposes an experiment that is worthy of a trial. We are not sanctioning the creation of a shipping monopoly that will be able to exploit disorganized shippers; there is to be organization on both sides, and that will provide the necessary safeguards. The suggestion that competition will bring down freights comes strangely from Government supporters. Usually the praises of competition are sung most loudly by honorable members on this side of the House. To-day the trend in industry and commerce throughout the world, is towards organization on a big scale, and the contention that the bringing to our shores of a larger number of ships than is needed to carry the cargoes offering, would mean a reduction in freights, is strange reasoning. I believe that this measure for what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has described as the rationalization of shipping, will prove beneficial. Shipping is divided into two classes - the regular lines to which the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> referred, and the tramp steamers which roam the seas in search of profitable cargoes. If the proposed wheat pool is established it will be an organization of shippers which will prevent undue exploitation by the tramp steamers.- There is a danger that the 22 regular shipping lines may increase freight rates; but I believe that counter organization will prevent that. As a representative of the primary producers I cordially approve of the bill. </para>

                        <para>- The Public Works Committee considers that besides the 160 acres already acquired it will be necessary to obtain an additional 21-&amp; acres in order to provide sufficient space for runways. We are now contemplating the provision of a gravel runway 500 yards long by 25 yards wide. Provision is also being made for two other runways to be available when it is impossible to use the main runway because of cross winds and other adverse conditions. It may also be necessary to acquire portion of the land at Mascot which is now being used by a golf club. When the scheme is finally completed, Mascot will be one. of the finest air ports in the world. The Public Works Committee has reported fully on the details of the scheme and the cost will be somewhere in the region of £40,000. </para>

                <para>The Public Works Committee has fully considered the details of this scheme, and is of the opinion that the time has arrived for the development of civil aviation in Tasmania to the extent of acquiring a suitable area of about 192 acres and providing certain improvements thereon. The expenditure involved will be about £13,000. It will be necessary to clear, grade, drain and fence the land, and to erect a club house and the necessary hangars thereon. It is the policy of the Government to develop civil aviation by every means within its power, and to connect up the principal cities of Australia by providing suitable landing grounds and proper facilities at various centres. </para>

                    <para>. - I enter my protest against the manner in which this legislation has been brought down to this House. Section 128 of the Constitution makes provision not only for certain methods of altering the Constitution, but also certain safeguards for the protection of the smaller States. The Government has not asked for the repeal of that section, and I wish to know why that provision is not being repealed seeing that this Government is asking the people to give to this Parliament absolute power to alter the Constitution at its own sweet will. I do not know whether the Government has any special object in view in not repealing section 128. </para>

                        <para>- That is very evident. Is section 128 to remain in the Constitution in order to cajole or deceive the people? Is it a trick of some sort? If the intentions of the Government are honest, that section should be repealed at the same time as the proposed amendments of the Constitution are given effect. If section 128 is not repealed, some of the electors who study the Constitution may well believe that even if the Government's proposals were accepted, the Constitution could not be altered except by referendum. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care a rap whether it does or not. The honorable member's suggestion is contemptible. Naturally I wish to give to Western Australia for all time the protection that it has to-day under the Constitution. I hope that the Tasmanian newspapers will publish what I am saying. Under the Constitution Tasmania has in the Senate the same representation as New South Wales or Victoria. But if these proposals are accepted by the people, this Government will have the power to reduce that representation or abolish the Senate at any time. I have the greatest confidence in the Prime Minister. I do not believe for a single moment that he would entertain any dishonorable ideas, but we must remember that he will not be head of the Government for all time. Future governments will not be bound by the pledges of this Government. A large public meeting was held recently at Beverley, a well-known farming community in Western Australia, and the farmers there strongly protested against the effect of the tariff on the cost of production. </para>

                        <para>- I have often said that the Constitution should be amended to enable the Commonwealth to give tariff concessions to certain parts of Australia. It will be absolutely impossible for us ever to develop our far-northern areas unless concessions are made in respect of our tariff and navigation laws to encourage people to settle there. The Nullabor Plains separate Western Australia from the rest of the continent as effectively as an ocean would do it. We there are essentially a primary-producing people, and we have suffered from federation to a far greater extent than either Tasmania or South Australia. I want to force a division on this issue, so that the people of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania may see which honorable members of this Parliament are prepared to hand over absolute power to the Commonwealth Parliament, and so remove from us the safeguard we at present have in the Constitution, namely, equal representation in the Senate and- a minimum representation in the House of Representatives. Some honorable members have said that I can see only the disasters that might follow the adoption of this proposal. What I want to do is to make it unnecessary for any State to come to the Commonwealth for financial sops. That policy always leads to extravagance. We want an opportunity to produce from the soil under conditions which will enable us to compete in the markets of the world. We are an exporting country, and we can get for our principal products only the prices ruling on the world's markets. It appears to me that if the people approve of the proposal in this bill, the smaller States will have taken from them the pledge of equal representation in the Senate and minimum representation in this chamber, which caused them to enter into the indissoluble union of federation, but if you break this contract then the union is no longer indissoluble. The object of the Government is, in my opinion, to nullify the provisions of section. 128 of the Constitution ; if it is not, I should like to know what it is. Perhaps the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McTiernan)</inline> can tell mc? </para>

                        <para>- That remark indicates the incompetence of the honorable member to give any valuable legal advice on this subject. I certainly prefer to rely upon the opinion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham.)</inline> on a constitutional question of this nature. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price)</inline> must surely realize that the adoption of this proposal will be injurious to South Australia. In pref federation days South Australia had many small but flourishing engineering industries. Some of them were among the best that we had in Australia. But to-day they have all disappeared. I cannot see any future for the Holden Motor Body Works in South Australia if we insist upon enforcing the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act and by prohibitive tariffs make it impossible for them to compete with Sydney or Melbourne. The proposals of the Government are undoubtedly wholly  in the interests of those two centres. Our whole fiscal policy necessarily increases the- cost of timber and other raw materials required for motor body building. In order to ascertain definitely whether it is the desire of the Government to take away from the smaller States the right to equal representation in the Senate and minimum representation in the House of Representatives, I move the following amendment: - </para>

                    <para>.- I second the amendment. Twenty-five years' experience of Commonwealth industrial arbitration has shown that this Parliament is not capable of exercising effective control in this sphere. It surely cannot be denied that state or local authorities are much more fitted to deal with industrial matters than a central authority, for they are able to gauge local conditions and decide accordingly. If the power to control industry were vested in local authorities, this continent would benefit from one end of it to the other, for there would be a closer personal contact between employers and employees. One of the most serious vices of our Arbitration Court system is that it tends to keep employers and employees apart. Invariably, the unions apply to the court for shorter hours and higher wages, and the employers for longer hours and lower wages. The issues are fought on party lines', and it is always left to the judge to determine them. If we could bring the people more closely together we should do something that would result in more efficient and less costly methods of production, which, in turn, would help to overcome the unemployment crisis which faces us. I believe that under a system of industrial control by local authorities, our people would get substantially higher wages and better conditions than are possible under the existing arrangements. It was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that industrial matters should be dealt with in the legal atmosphere ' of a court, nor was it anticipated that the court would give the unexpected decisions that ever come from it. </para>

                    <para>.- It appears to me that one aspect of the subject before the committee has not received the attention that it deserves. . Sufficient has been said about the differences between the limited authority of the non-sovereign legislature under the American Constitution, upon which our Constitution was modelled, and the unlimited sovereign power of the legislature in England under the British Constitution to render it unnecessary for me to make any further reference to the subject; but I doubt whether we have yet demonstrated the character of the cleavage insofar as it affects the actual needs and lives of our people. In every direction in which "this legislature has attempted to move it has been obstructed by decisions of the High Court. We surely reached the culminating point recently when events occurred in an industrial dispute which were without precedent in our industrial and constitutional history.  As honorable members know, we have been sorely tried by a great industrial crisis on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales. After the Government had exhausted every constitutional means to effect a settlement, the High Court was approached for an interpretation of the legal position. The incident to which I have referred occurred only after  the late Chief Justice of the court had exposed his undoubted partiality for the mine-owning interests. </para>

I submit, with great respect, that the honorable member for Warringah has no right to make any such request. It is your right, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> to deal with the matter, and you have exercised that right with credit. It is your duty, if I may say so, to direct members of the committee that they may not reflect upon members of the judiciary. It is not the right of the honorable member for Warringah to call upon the honorable member for Martin to withdraw anything he may have said in criticism of a judge. He may call upon the honorable member for a withdrawal of anything reflecting upon himself, or upon this Parliament. It is your duty to direct the honorable member who is speaking as to how he should address himself to the subject of the judiciary. As I have said, you gave a ruling in accordance with well-established practice to the effect that an honorable member may not reflect upon the judiciary, or upon a judge, but he may discuss a judgment of the court. I submit that the matter should have ended there, without honorable members opposite attempting to make party capital out of the incident. </para>

                        <para>- You have ruled, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that it is in order for honorable members to criticize a judgment of any court. All honorable members know that. They also know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Adrian</inline> Knox gave no judgment in the coal case. and, therefore, no question can arise here regarding any judgment of his. Honorable members heard the honorable member for Martin say that he intended to direct attention to the partiality of the ex-Chief-Justice, which had been, exposed That is an attack on the integrity and honour of a judge in the exercise of his office. It is quite immaterial that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Adrian</inline> Knox has now resigned his post. The remarks were directed to the exercise of his judicial functions in his judicial office. I was astonished to hear the Attorney-General speak as he did. Surely it is the duty of the Attorney-General to protect members of the judiciary. They are unable to appear on the floor of this House, to answer insinuations directed against them. One of the first duties of the Attorney-General is either to protect the judges or, if he considers them to be unworthy of protection, to take appropriate action. </para>

                <para>The debate has largely proceeded along legal lines. I rose from a strict sense of duty to express the sentiments that I have uttered, and to register my protest against the incidents I have mentioned. </para>
                <para>May I be permitted to remind the committee that laws and constitutions' have neither meaning nor reality, except to the extent that they secure justice for, and increase the sum .of human happiness of the people they are designed to serve. Rightly considered, these proposals assume an importance of the first magnitude. They affect the future of our great country and the well-being of every man, woman and child in it. I pause here for a moment to ask, what, after all, is the greatest thing to every person in this Commonwealth? It is that they are alive! Much of the discussion suggests that some of our opponents have come from that place - the cemetery - which the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cusack)</inline> has stated is a profitable locality for .the securing of votes under certain circumstances. When all is said and done, what is our life? We are entitled to the belief that all the necessaries of life exist round and about us in overwhelming abundance, and amid beauty too wonderful for human powers of speech adequately to express. But side by side with that fact is the tragic spectacle ' of thousands of the human family suffering the agonies of unemployment, impoverish ment and want, who at every turn are -faced with distress and defeat amid ugliness too terrible for words to depict. That these conditions exist is no fault of the Creator nor of nature. It is our fault. 'All that is necessary for human beings exists in overwhelming abundance around and about us in this world on which we live and die. To a very considerable extent the power is given to human beings to shape their present environment and their standard of living apparently without limitation, and, what is still more profound to contemplate, to shape the unborn future. This Constitution of ours was framed 30 years ago, and ii is monstrous to suggest that it shall remain unaltered for all time. Our friends opposite, who frequently profess admiration for British methods should at least realize that the competence of the British legislature is a sovereign poyser, that the constitution of that country is the greatest in the world, and that the American constitution, which is modelled on presidential government, should not be taken as a guide by a country such as Australia, which functions under parliamentary government. The. proposals before the committee are thoroughly justified from every point of view. During the progress of the conventions ' that preceded the founding of federation the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. "Wise on one occasion said, in effect, that the federation was designed to enlarge the self-governing powers of the people of Australia. I claim that we have reached a stage at which we are entitled to consider amendments that will still further enlarge the self-governing powers of the citizens of our country. We should not lose sight of the most important fact that we are alive. The contributions to the debate that have been made by some honorable members opposite have been as from the dead. They have consisted of nothing but expressions of fears, doubts, and pessimism in every direction. </para>
                <para class="block">I conclude by expressing the hope that the Opposition will realize the benefits that may be derived from these proposals, and that they will help the Government to carry them and so contribute to the security, the prosperity and the happiness of the people of our country. </para>

                    Mitchell's opinion affirms several propositions. One of those is that section 128 of the Constitution extends only to the amendment of the Constitution itself, and not to the covering sections which constitute an act of the Imperial legislature. That is certainly admitted; indeed, it may be accepted as a truism. But if. is a truism that does not touch the validity of the proposed amendment, which, by adding a section to the Constitution, merely provides an alternative method for altering it.

                <para>The second proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell may "be said to be that the amendment of the Constitution which may be made -under- section 128 must not be repugnant to the preamble and the covering sections, which create an "indissoluble 'Federal Constitution", as it is described. I would not be inclined to admit that that was not an arguable proposition as it stands, but, for the sake of this argument, it may be admitted as correct, for the very simple reason that the proposed amendment is not inconsistent with those sections. In section 128 the Constitution contains a power that is unlimited as to subject-matter to amend the Constitution. That power is part of the Constitution itself, and, being such., is necessarily subject to amendm en t. The Constitution, when so amended, frill not thereupon, at least, cease to be a Federal Constitution. Whatever may happen afterwards, the amendment of the Constitution in that way does not cause it to cease to be a Federal Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell may be taken to say that section 128 is unalterable. That proposition, of course, as appears from what I have already said, is challenged. The amending power applies1 to the whole Constitution, of which section 128 is a part. No limitation of subject-matter is stated, and no such limitation can be implied, nor has any argument been adduced to show on what principle one part of this Constitution which may be amended should, or could, be amended more readily than another part. The machinery for its amendment is applicable to all parts of the Constitution. In my view it is not open to serious argument that the Constitution runs from section 1 to section 128, and excludes entirely the covering sections; it confers a power of amendment applicable with complete and perfect uniformity to every part of the Constitution. </para>

The opinion he expressed, as I understood it- and I agree with it generally - is that, viewed as a legal and purely constitutional 'question-, there is, at the present time, following upon the Balfour note arid the latest definitions, complete constitutional independence. The honorable member foi- Corangamite was more than n'ecessarily emphatic that that did not imply, even iti the slightest 'degre'e, a desire on the part of Australia to dissociate herself from the commonwealth of nations nor involve separation or disintegration of any practical kind, the honorable member is well able to defend himself, as he is well able to state his case, and I followed his remarks with great interest. Purely captious and political interjections were heard with very little sympathy, so far, as I waa concerned, and I may add with very little respect. </para>

                    Mitchell suggests further that the manner of altering the Constitution cannot be changed. This proposition is contained in the preceding one, and it also is challenged. The Constitution is "full of machinery for necessary adjustments and re-adjustments, which may be tightened up or loosened by use' of the amending power, and yet it, is suggested and argued that the key amending power - section 128  -  the compartment, so to speak, which must be opened before the other adjustments cai) be attempted at all, is itself exempt from the possibility of amendment. That argument, I submit with great respect, reduces itself to an absurdity.  In other words, it is suggested that we may amend all sections and parts of the Australian Constitution, except the most material and vital part so far as its working and structure are concerned, and that, according to the views expressed, may not be amended. To the contention, as put by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline>
                    Mitchell, that constitutional amendments made under the proposed amending power which purported to bring about unification would themselves be invalid, no answer is necessary, except the question why we should  jump before we come to the stile, why we should begin to anticipate difficulties that may never arise? It seems to me as illogical as the stand taken by the honorable member for Swan
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline>
                    who, in what I venture to describe, with great respect, as a spirit of pitiful parochialism, always seems to. suggest that the power of the majority in the Australian Parliament, and in Australia itself, would necessarily and inevitably be exercised against the best interests of the minority. Such an argument, if it had substance, would be applicable to every Parliament and to every State in the Commonwealth, and to every part of a State, and, if pursued to its logical conclusion, it would mean that parliamentary government is necessarily a failure, and ineffective to protect the rights either of the minorities or of persons resident in the more outlying parts of the electorate.

                        <para>- The honorable member cannot claim all wisdom; if he does, he claims too much. It is admitted that all forms of government have their imperfections, and all statesmen have their manifest limitations, too; hut 1 am speaking in general terms of systems of government, and especially of the system of democratic government which is admittedly imperfect in the very fact that it involves the government by majorities of minorities, and the coercion of minorities by majorities. If the history of federation has taught us anything at all in the last 30 years, it has manifested an extraordinary readiness on the part of the more populous Slates to recognize the disabilities of the people resident within the boundaries of what are known as the smaller States, and governments have faithfully endeavoured to adjust revenues to meet the disabilities under which they labour. But the very fact that for so long the Constitution has remained as it is proves the good-will , of the more populous areas to the less 4 populous, reserving, as we have, equal representation in the Senate and minimum representation in the smaller States. </para>

                <para>Returning to the point taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell when he said that constitutional amendments passed under the proposed amending power which purported to "bring about unification, would themselves be invalid, I asked why we should meet that difficulty before it has arisen, when it is not involved in the proposed amendment of the Constitution now before us. It is well to remember that such amendments would be no more invalid, if they were passed in the new way than in the way already existent. The truth is that the present proposal only provides an easier way of amending the Constitution. It does not purport to extend the scope of the amendment of the Constitution, and it does not extend it. Indeed, it could hardly be extended, because the present power to amend the Constitution is absolute, but cumbrous, difficult, and expensive; so much so that amendments which might long ago have been won for the long-suffering people of the Commonwealth have been long delayed and difficult to obtain. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell's objections seem to be completely answered in the much more succinct opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon, when he was still a brilliant member' of the bar, and before he became an ornament to the High Court judiciary. He summed the matter up in these words - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The existing power of amending the Constitution is contained in section 128, aud the question is whether that power authorizes the alteration in section 128 itself, which would be required in order to confer for the future the power of amendment upon Parliament alone. In my opinion it does authorize such an alteration. </para>
                    <para>When section 128 speaks of " this Constitution " it refers to the whole " Constitution of the Commonwealth " mentioned in and following section 9 of the covering clauses. It includes section 128 itself. I do not think that there can be any doubt that complete power of amending the whole instrument, including the provision prescribing the methods of alteration, was intended to be given by section 12S. </para>

                    The truth would appear to be that in a very small compass he has completely answered the objections.  His  view I entirely endorse. The Government launches its major proposal for the amendment of the Constitution with the utmost confidence in its validity, and with the fervent hope that it will be carried in all States. Some honorable members say that the smaller States will reject ir contumeliously ; but the recent election in South Australia was a vindication of the claim I am making; because the party which succeeded and has since formed a Government stood for the simplification of government in the smaller States, the abolition of useless and expensive trappings, including the unrepresentative council, and the setting up of less expensive and .more effective forms of local government. That principle has been accepted by the people of South Australia.

Such matters should include all those with which the members of this Parliament think fit to "deal. Less than that we should not have; more than that, we do not ask. We seek for this sovereign legislative power, local legislatures for local affairs, and power for this Parliament in the last resort to speak for Australia upon those matters that the duly appointed representatives of the people in this Parliament think it wise after consulting the constituencies, to consider. </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General has dealt with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline> Edward Mitchell's opinion that section  128  cannot be amended in the same way as other portions of the Constitution, and has cited a contrary opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon. As a matter of opinion, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon that section  128  is amendable, although I am impressed by the fact that so eminent an authority as my learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell takes the opposite view. The preamble to the Constitution refers to " an indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown," and difficulty would arise if a proposal were submitted for amending the Constitution in such  a  way as to remove the Commonwealth from the Crown. I am glad, however, that that stage has not yet been reached.  A  further difficulty arises from the fact  that  section  128  commences, " This Constitution shall not be altered except in  the  following manner." It is arguable  that  the first  127  sections set out the frame of government, and that section  128,  prescribing the only method by which that frame may be altered, is permanent. The question which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell has discussed most interestingly is whether section  128  can be amended by the procedure of amendment which it sets forth. I  have  said that I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon, but I recognize that the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell is quite tenable. It is a dubious course to submit  to  the people a proposed amendment  which, if  carried, would throw upon the High Court the responsibility to determine whether on -legal grounds it should overrule the political opinion of the people. </para>

                        <para>- That is my contention, but it goes further than that.  If  proposed section 129 were carried in four States any amendment  of  the Constitution affecting the matters mentioned in the last paragraph of section 128 or any other matter could be made applicable to those four States by parliamentary action, but it could be made applicable to the other two States only by the procedure prescribed in section 128. That would create a chaotic condition of affairs. Summarized,- section 128 provides that the Constitution may be altered by parliamentary action plus a referendum. Proposed section 129, if accepted by four of the States, will mean that in respect of those four States the Constitution may be altered by parliamentary action alone. Suppose for the sake of argument that this Parliament proposed to alter the Constitution by conferring power on itself to legislate in respect of education. "If the amending1 bill were passed after a month's delay by an absolute majority in both Houses of Parliament, the Constitution wouk be amended accordingly, but only in relation to the four States which had endorsed section 129. If it were desired to legislate in respect of education in the two States that rejected section 129, it would be necessary to adopt the procedure prescribed by section 128, which requires that the alteration shall be approved by a majority of the people and a majority of the States. </para>

Under those conditions we shall never know where we are. </para>

                        <para>- The proposed amendment affects the last paragraph of the most important provision in the Constitution, namely, section 128, itself relating to these matters. The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McTiernan)</inline> will see that  the last paragraph of section 128 provides that unless the States concerned agree there shall be no alteration (1) diminishing the proportionate representation of any State in either House of the Parliament, (2) the minimum number of representatives of a State in the House of Representatives, (3) increasing, diminishing, or otherwise altering the limits of the State, (4) in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation thereto. I submit that the proposed section 129 comes under the last heading (4), " in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation thereto," because it in itself is an alteration affecting a provision of the Constitution namely section 128 in relation to the three other headings. Honorable members will find this subject discussed on pages 228 and 229 of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution. That is the view that I put forward though not with mathematical dogmatism. It appears to me to he sound. I think that, if this amendment is passed by a majority of the States, but not by all the States, we shall inaugurate an era of legislative and political confusion in Australia which all honorable members will later profoundly regret. </para>

                    <para>.- During this debate we have heard many constitutions mentioned, discussed, and debated, and constitutional authorities galore have been cited. We have listened to valuable contributions by learned and legal gentlemen in this chamber. It has all been very enlightening, but still the fact stands out vividly that this Parliament has not sufficient constitutional powers. The experience of the past few years has borne that out. Every honorable member will admit that this Parliament should have more powers, and all that the Government is now proposing is to ask the people to confer greater constitutional powers upon this National Parliament. I stand for giving full and unfettered powers to this Parliament. I was much struck by the point made by the honorable member for "Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> yesterday, that one of the State upper houses, elected on a narrow franchise, could flout the will, not only of the lower House, but of the big majority of the people. Such a position is intolerable and untenable. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members opposite fear, not the good but the abuse that may be brought about by conferring greater powers upon this Parliament. Every member of this House has certain privileges. We can say things in this chamber which we dare not say outside; yet, we do not abuse that privilege. If individually we do not abuse our privileges, why should we collectively, as a Commonwealth Parliament, abuse the powers that may be conferred upon us as a result of the referendum? No Parliament dares to abuse its powers, because it knows that it must face the electors every three years. The people are our masters. </para>

                        <para>- Any legal contract or agreement may be modified with the mutual consent of the parties concerned. The Constitution is a contract that was entered into between the Commonwealth and the States, and why should there be any objection to an alteration of the Constitution by mutual consent. This Government is merely submitting its proposals to the people. I see nothing undemocratic about that. The Constitution made provision for the passage of legislation to prevent and settle disputes* by conciliation and arbitration. Legislation was passed, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court established. It has been operating for 25 years, and yet the Bruce-Page Government was prepared to abolish it without in any way consulting the people. That was not a democratic proposal. This Government is quite satisfied to seek the consent of the people before making any alteration to our system of conciliation and arbitration.

                        <para>- Another member of the Opposition said that it was useless to ask the people for these increased powers, because they had refused them on three previous occasions. That  is  no argument. If a young man proposed three times to a young lady and was refused three times, would she expect him to take that as final; would she not. expect him to propose again ? I certainly think she would. Take the case of the Labour party. We made many attempts to gain office, but the electors said " no." The Labour party refused to take that as  a  final answer. We kept on asking the people for their support, and at the last elections we won handsomely. I believe  in  Australia, as a nation, with one flag  and one  destiny. The Commonwealth Parliament should guide the destiny of Australia, and to that end it should be clothed with plenary powers. Had the Commonwealth greater industrial powers, many of the industrial disputes of the last few years would have been settled  in  their infancy. Under the Constitution as it stands at present, the power of the Commonwealth Parliament, in respect  of  industrial affairs is restricted. I am confident that the people will see the necessity for granting greater constitutional' powers to the Commonwealth Parliament, and I look forward to the time when these dark and gloomy clouds  of  depression will be broken and dispersed, and Australia will be bathed in the sunshine of peace, prosperity and happiness. </para>

The object of the mover of the amendment is to provide that if these powers are granted, they shall not be enforced against any State that votes against the referendum proposals. The amendment certainly needs re-drafting, and should be considered quite apart from the general merits of the Government's proposals. Any State which is opposed to the granting of these powers to the Commonwealth should not, if the proposals are accepted by a majority of the States, be compelled to surrender to the Commonwealth any of its present powers. For that reason the amendment might very well be accepted. </para>

I agree with him. The section may be amended, but only in the manner therein set out. </para>
                <para>I take it that the Government is earnestly desirous of obtaining the assent of the people in all the States to the proposal in the bill before us, in order that it may end, once and for all, the present intolerable position. This Parliament, as the Attorney-General has said, though asked to do the nation's work, has been given little more power respecting certain things that really matter than that of a municipality. But if the argument of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> is sound, and I think that on the whole it is, there can be no amendment of the Constitution regarding the matters set out in the last paragraph of section 128, except with the consent of each particular State affected. It follows, therefore, that even if this Parliament were given the authority sought in this bill, it could not create new States, except, of course, by the subdivision of such States as might assent to the proposal. It appears to me that we should not unnecessarily risk the industrial and trade and commerce proposals by submitting the first proposal, seeing that even if it were approved it would only give the Parliament power to legislate in respect of those matters contained in the last paragraph of section 128 in the States which assented to the proposal. </para>
                <para>I am not in favour of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> because it would take from this Parliament the power to deal with matters which are in their scope and essence national; but it is undeniable that if the proposal of the bill is carried the power given to this Parliament will  be ineffective except in the States which carry it. It is most necessary that we should have power to create new States. Our development will proceed along those lines. The conception of honorable members opposite and of myself, is that there should be a devolution of wide powers upon the central or National Parliament, and that bodies clothed with full powers of local government should be set up. The local governing powers of these bodies would, of course, be great, but they would nevertheless be merely those of provincial legislatures. This conception is, I believe, quite conformable with the principles of democracy. "We have a Constitution which was intended to be amended only in the way set out in section 128. Any departure from that method, such as the method proposed in the bill before the committee, is a violation of the spirit of the federal pact. "Whatever the legal consequences which might follow the attempt to pass this proposed law, the people were under the impression that when this Constitution was assented to it was a bargain that bound them indissolubly in a certain form. That the powers of the Parliament should be extended in this direction or that, and that there could be a better distribution of power among the Commonwealth and the States, is undeniable. But it is clear that it was intended that in their own particular spheres the Commonwealth and the States should be supreme. If this proposal of the Government is carried, that will no longer be the case. Yet the provisions of the Constitution are entirely opposed to democratic principles. If is odious that a progressive  people should be told, when they seek relief in a certain direction and can find no relief in any other, that the dead hand of the past makes it impossible for them to obtain what . they desire. It is repellant to every concept of democratic Government that we should be bound by the edict of men who, 30 years ago, prescribed certain remedies for the conditions that then existed. The democratic ideal is that the people of each generation should legislate for their own needs. That is a sound principle. </para>
                <para>But my main object in rising was to point out to the Attorney-General the difficulty and risk of subscribing to this amendment. Unhappily, there is yet very much to be done before the citizens of the Commonwealth are made to understand exactly what will be the consequence of amending the Constitution as proposed. They will be told <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> about the rights of the States, and they will be told that those rights - whatever they may be - are gravely threatened. I cannot help thinking that this bill will very seriously imperil the other amendments. However, I leave that for the present. The Government can hardly say now that this amendment goes as far as we could wish. Very obviously it will not clothe the Federal Parliament with power to introduce the system of proportional representation in this chamber. "When the Constitution was before the people in 1900, I opposed its acceptance to the utmost of my power. I believed then, as 1 believe now, that the only sound democratic principle is representation according to numbers. However, a compromise was made, and a tradition has  been established which it is now very difficult to break down. We are attempting to amend the Constitution in a way which must inevitably fall short Of what we desire, namely, to give this Parliament power to make laws for the good of Australia on all matters national in scope. We ought to consider very seriously, whether we cannot, even at this eleventh hour, amend this proposal so that it will at least do what it purports to do. In its present form it will not do that. </para>
                <para>While unable to vote for the bill, I am whole-heartedly in accord with the Government in the object it has in view. I ask the Attorney-General to examine most carefully the position as now disclosed to ascertain whether there is not some way in which wider powers, plenary and unchallengeable, may not be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

I think that it would be a friendly act on their part, and beneficial to their State, if they were to support  thi3  measure, because the bill proposes to empower the federal legislature to amend the Constitution. There are certain sections of the Constitution which have the result, possibly, of inflicting those disabilities upon Western Australia to which honorable members have referred. For example, section 51, which confers the power of taxation, contains the following: , , </para>

                    <item label="(">

                <para class="block">It is impossible for this legislature to pass: any taxation measure which would discriminate between Western Australia and the other States of the Commonwealth. The incidence of taxation must be uniform throughout the whole of Australia. If this bill is passed, and the Federal Parliament is empowered to amend the Constitution, it will be enabled to relieve Western Australia from any unfair incidence of taxation that arises from the fact that taxation must be uniformly imposed. Section 88 of the Constitution provides that uniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth. That time having elapsed, the tariff must be uniform in its application throughout Australia, and the citizens of Perth must bear equally with the citizens of Sydney, Melbourne, and other cities the taxation that is imposed. If the Commonwealth Parliament is granted the power that is sought by this bill, and the representatives of Western Australia can show that any tariff schedule operates unjustly against that State, because of any special circumstances that may exist, it- will be competent for this Parliament to make provision to meet those special circumstances, and to vary the incidence of customs taxation. We know from experience that members of this legislature have not been deaf to appeals that have been made to them by representatives of what are termed the smaller  States. One of the first debates to which I listened after my election to this Parliament was that which took place on a bill to make available financial assistance to some of the States. It was urged that that measure was necessary because the federation had subjected those States to particular disabilities, and a great deal was made of the fact that  customs duties  were levied uniformly on all the States without regard to their industrial or economic circumstances. </para>

                    <para>. -  If I represented one of the smaller States I should not lose sight of the fact that the Constitution contains certain provisions that safeguard the rights of the small States, and that those rights will disappear if the referendum is carried, because the Commonwealth Parliament will then be the sole arbiter of their case. Are they the more likely to be protected by the safeguards that are embedded in the Constitution, or by the promises of politicians? There can be no comparison between the two. I have r.ot the slightest doubt that the rights of the small States an- safeguarded by the Constitution, and that those rights will be retained so long as those safeguards are not removed from the Constitution. As a layman, it appears to me that the provision that the representation which the States enjoy to-day shall not be altered unless the States concerned agree to such an amendment, is part and parcel of the machinery that is being used to alter the whole of the Constitution. </para>

I have never been in favour of the principle of equal representation of the States; but at the same time, from the point of view of the small States, and in view of the fact that they entered into an indissoluble union under certain clear and definite provisions, it is necessary that their rights shall be adequately safeguarded.

I am glad, however, that I brought it forward, because I feel satisfied that the debate that has taken place upon it will have the effect of influencing many electors to vote against the Government's proposal, especially in view of the suggestion of the Attorney-General, that any State which became depopulated would not be justified in having equal representation in the Senate, nor a certain number of representatives in this chamber, even though that depopulation was the effect of federation. I have been induced to withdraw my amendment by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> who pointed out that the difficulties that, were likely to arise under it would be greater than those which have so far been encountered. If the committee had been agreeable to the proviso that I wished to have inserted, many electors in the smaller States might have been induced to vote for the Government's proposal, on the ground that the special protection of their rights, for which provision is now made, was being retained. They are not likely to listen to sophistries such as those of the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>

When the people realize the nature of the powers that are being sought, they will be very chary about granting them. It is mere sophistry to talk about having a democratic Parliament with sovereign powers. The Government's desire is to obtain power to amend the Constitution in future without consulting the electors. Under the Constitution as it now stands, the people can be approached whenever an amendment of the Constitution is desired. They have been appealed to time after time, and on each occasion have shown emphatically that they do not trust this Parliament, and are not prepared to grant it any further powers. It has not lived up to what the people believed the National Parliament would be. If I had my way, the State that I represent would secede from the. federation immediately. </para>

                <para>MrGREGORY.-That would mean a continuance of all the difficulties that we have experienced in the past owing to overlapping awards.The Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in answer to a question that I asked yesterday with respect to complaints made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> McDougall,  president  of the Chamber of Manufactures in Melbourne, regarding dual awards said the very fact that the people were being appealed to to confer increased industrial powers on the Commonwealth Parliament would result in the abolition of dual awards. For a long time I have been opposed to compulsory arbitration, and particularly the establishment of the Commonwealth Arbitral tion Court. When that court was first set up the parties to industry went to it in the belief that that would result in industrial peace; but it was soon found that those who swore the hardest secured favorable verdicts. The Bench was occupied by a judge who knew nothing about industry, and from that time the employers and employees, by means of their organizations, began to fight, until to-day we. have a degree of antagonism between employers and employees that cannot be found in any other country. I do not say that either the employer or the employee is responsible for this feeling; but we know that the awards of' the court have produced; it. Last night I was, studying figures relating to the wages paid in Canada. There it was the boast of the. Minister of Finance last; year that Canada, which adjoins the United States of America, with all its mass production and one of the lowest tariffs in the world, had been able in 1929 to export more of its. secondary products than its total exports in 1914. I was looking for the reason for that position, thinking that it must have, been due to the payment of low wages. But, when I read the wages and hours of labour as published by the Department of Labour in Canada, I found that blacksmiths received from1s, 10½d. to 3s.1½d: per. hour; or 15s. to 25s. per day of eight hours; machinists and millwrights, 18s. 4d. to 23s. 4d. ; toolmakers, 16s.8d. to 25s., and labourers from 10s. to 16s. 8d. per day. Those wages apply to the. manufacture of agricultural implements. In my opinion the trouble experienced in industry in Australia is not due to high wages, but to the animosity that exists between employers and employees. When they go to the court, the employer usually suggests a reduction of wages and an increase in the hours of work, while the employee asks for shorter hours and higher wages. When the judge gives his award he generally compromises, and the workmen immediately have an idea that they owe nothing to their employers so they determine that they will give back in return for their wages as little service as they can. What industry in Australia most needs to-day is efficiency by the manufacturer and good service by the worker. Turning again to the Canadian wage-sheet as shown by the official statistics, in the building trade I find that in 1929 the wages for an eight hours' day were- Bricklayers, 33s. 4d. to 51s.; carpenters, 23s. 4d. to 36s. 8d.; electrical workers, 23s. 4d. to 58s.; painters, 16s. 8d. to 30s. ; plasterers; 33s. 4d. to 50s.; plumbers, 16s. 8d. to 41s. 4d. ; stone cutters, 26s. 8d. to58s.,. and labourers,11s. 8d. to 21s. 8d. Compositors earn up to 47 dollars a week, which is more than is earned by the average journalist in Australia. I do not believe that wages generally in Australia are too high, but the dual control of industry by Commonwealth and State courts creates an enormous amount of, difficulty, whilst the operation of the Commonwealth court has fomented antagonism between worker and employer. If honorable members opposite are resolved to continue the present system of dual control the existing chaos will be accentuated. Of course, if the Commonwealth Parliament is given complete industrial power the present Government will be able to do almost what it pleases, but the workers should realize that equally wide powers will be enjoyed by its successor. I want the people to have an opportunity in connexion with the forthcoming referendum to declare whether the Commonwealth or the States shall have absolute control of industrial affairs. For that purpose I have submitted this amendment, but I realize that if the Government will not accept it, I cannot pursue the matter further. </para>

                <para class="block">Throughout the world the tendency is to organize marketing on a national basis. A notable instance of this activity was the action of Greece a few years ago in organizing the whole of the national resources behind the marketing of currants, and by this means substantially increasing the return to the growers. In America at the present time a big effort is being put forth to ensure the profitable marketing of primary products on a national scale. Although honorable members on this side of the chamber are opposed to a complete grant to the National Parliament of power over trade and commerce, because the State Parliaments would thereby be deprived of four-fifths of their powers and duties, we are anxious that this Parliament shall have power to deal with the marketing of products, on a nationwide scale. I trust that the Government will accept the amendment, because it would certainly be carried, whereas there is considerable doubt concerning the fate of the proposal in the bill. Hitherto Australia has not been able to deal satisfactorily, in a federal way, with the problem of marketing. During the war time, when certain provisions of the Constitution were in abeyance, a Commonwealth wheat pool was established. At the present time, although this Parliament has taken action to ensure the orderly marketing of dried fruits, dairy produce, canned fruits, pearl shell, and other commodities through export control boards, and proposes to create, in conjunction with the States, what is in effect another export control board in connexion with a compulsory wheat pool, there is still left a bare area that is difficult to cover. In any case, the existing procedure is circuitous, slow, and expensive. We are anxious that this power shall be included in the Constitution.We do not desire that the general trade and commerce powers should be in the hands of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but it will cover a million other things that we do not want, and consequently to secure what we do desire and to make certain that this power shall be placed in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament in the immediate future, I have submitted an amendment which, being of a more or less non-contentious character, will be readily carried by the people, whereas, the proposal to hand to the Commonwealth full trade and commerce powers is almost certain to be defeated. My desire is to safeguard the interests of the primary producers, who are the great exporters of Australia.For the last ten years they have produced something like 96 per cent. or 98 per cent. of the total exports of Australia. They should, therefore, have an opportunity of organizing themselves, while this constitutional fight is raging in respect of other matters about which there is much difference of opinion in the public mind and among the political parties. I appeal to the Government, on behalf of the primary producers, to give them this opportunity of organizing upon a sound basis. </para>

                    <para>I support the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> I sincerely regret that this bill has been brought down in a form which, prevents me from supporting it as a whole. As a former Minister for Markets, I realize the disability that we are. suffering, because of being unable to organize as completely as we would like in respect of the sale of our exportable! products, both in this country and overseas. If the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Cowper were carried, it would give us sufficient power over trade and commerce to enable us to bring about the more profitable disposal of Australian products. Let me give one or two concrete illustrations of the difficulties which beset us because of the lack of this power. I shall take first the position of the wine industry, which is to some extent in the minds of honorable members because of the difficulties with which it is faced, and because this Parliament has, for' some years, been paying to that industry a bounty, which the Government now proposes to extend. The late Government paid a bounty on the wine exported and this Government is extending it, both Governments being actuated by a desire to assist, not so much the wine-maker as the grape-grower. The Government cannot compel the winemaker to pay a fair price for the grapes that he buys, but it can make that a condition of the payment of the export bounty. The Government can say to the wine-maker, " We will pay you this export bounty on condition that you pay the grape-grower a certain price, not only for the grapes used in wine that is exported, but also for grapes used in wine that is sold locally." The wine-maker, who buys grapes with the object of selling his wine entirely in Australia, is not interested in the bounty, and can consequently snap his fingers at anything that the Government may do to ensure a fair price to the grape-grower. Again a winemaker who sells not only overseas and obtains a bounty for that part of his product which is exported, but also in the local market, pays full price for the whole of the grapes which he uses. He, therefore, may meet with unfair competition from the maker who sells only on the local market and pays any price he likes for his grapes. That is one difficulty which we have to face. It seems insuperable unless we obtain the powers set. out in the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> A further concrete illustration may be drawn from the dried fruits industry, although it is true that it has been possible, by following a very difficult and complicated course, to give to growers a substantial measure of marketing organization. The dried fruits industry produces a large exportable surplus which is sold at world's parity. It is sold at the rate obtaining in the big centres overseas, less the cost of transport. Without a complete selling organization it only is possible to obtain in Australia the prices ruling for export, and the producer in such circumstances is compelled to accept for what he sells in Australia*, world's prices less all the costs incidental to transport overseas. The export parity determines the local rate. That means that the producer has to suffer deductions from world's prices to the extent of the cost of transport, marine insurance, the exchange position in London, and deterioration in transit, on goods sold in. Australia, and even though those costs are not actually incurred. </para>

                        <para>- I did. The local price, without marketing organization, is based on the export price less all the discounts that I have mentioned. The man who is producing on that basis finds himself very often unable to carry on, and it is essential, if he 'is to continue his business, that he should enjoy the benefits of complete marketing organization to enable him to obtain a fair Australian price for what he sells in our home market. Steps were taken by the former Commonwealth Government and StateGovernments to do this, but it involved many difficulties. State boards were appointed, and, they have certain powers- in regard to sales within the various States. A State board cannot compel any producer within the State to export his goods. It can, under the statutory powers that it possesses, restrict the sale of those goods within the borders of that; State; but without complete organization the producer would be able to send his goods into another State, and by cutting prices do serious injury to the growers of that State. </para>

                        <para>- As the right honorable member for Cowper has said, the bill covers the amendment, but it also covers a thousand other things which we do not desire. It is probable that the people of Australia will not be prepared to confer the whole of the trade and commerce powers upon this Parliament, but it is extremely probable that if this amendment were substituted, the people would accept it. The point I wish to stress is the great difficulty which besets an exporting industry in attempting to organize its marketing, so long as the Commonwealth is limited to its present powers. Even after State boards and a Commonwealth Export Control Board had been established, we had to resort to further legislation to make use of our interstate powers and a bill was brought down about eighteen months ago which made use, as Commonwealth instruments, of the State Dried Fruits Boards for the purpose of regulating interstate trade. They were given statutory powers requiring licences to be granted for interstate trade. By adopting this extremely round-about method, we were able to compel growers to export a certain proportion of their production. </para>

                <para>I support the amendment because I believe that although these additional marketing powers are necessary to overcome the difficulties of procedure I have mentioned, the wide powers which the Government is seeking are not needed. I support it also because it will have a much better prospect of securing an affirmative vote than the proposal contained in the bill. </para>
                <para>Mr,..SCULLIN (Yarra- Prime Minister) [ 5.16].  -  I listened with a great deal of interest to the speeches of the right honorable member for Cowper (Dr.Earle Page) and the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> They have displayed a much belated enthusiasm for organized marketing. In all the years that they were members of the previous Government, they did not even suggest that this power was necessary; but now that this Government is seeking to do something effective to organize the marketing of out  produces  they are doing their best to side track it. The amendment is entirely without substance and is neither more nor less than a placard. </para>

                        <para>- The sponsors of this amendment must know that it cannot achieve the end that they pretend to desire. I ask the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> with his legal knowledge, to give us an assurance that the amendment will do the thing that is suggested. We know very well that the proposal in the bill will do it. While the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> was speaking in favour of organized marketing, the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr., Stewart)</inline> interjected pertinently that the proposal in the bill would make organized marketing possible.

                <para>The amendment purports to seek power for marketing our products in the Commonwealth and other places. What does the phrase " in other places " mean ? </para>
                <para class="block">What does" marketing" mean? It surely means buying. and selling. If the mover of the amendment and the honorable member for Gippsland, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson.)</inline> knew anything about the discussions that have occurred in the High Court on the meaning of ordinary words in the Constitution, they would guess how this word "marketing" would be treated by the judges on the bench. We all thought we knew the meaning of the words "industrial dispute" until the High Court began to discuss it, and then we decided that we knew nothing about it. The ordinary meaning of marketing is buying and selling. Apparently the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> and the. honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson.)</inline> desire to limit the power of this Parliament to the buying and selling. of products. That would merely give the Parliament the power of a private trader, which is, something very much less than the power to organize marketing. The power of organized marketing must include the power to compulsorily acquire products with the consent of the majority of the producers. If a wheat pool, or anything of the kind, were desired, a vote of the producers would be taken, and if it were favorable we should require power to acquire their produce before we could market it in an organized way. </para>

                        <para>- That is a quibble over a term. There is inherent in the Constitution of every State full power over trade and commerce within the State. The acts under which the States. work are not always called, marketing acts. The leader of the Country party is playing with terms. If the amendment is carried this Parliament, will merely have power to buy and sell. The power that the Government is seeking includes the power to acquire, to control transport, and to make financial arrangements. The object of the amendment is to get the people to give us some other power which will be insufficient for our purpose. If the amendment is carried it will sidetrack the object of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It is a mere placard without any substance or reality. It cannot do the thing that the Country party pretends that it will do. The mover of the amendment could have introduced a proposal of' this kind at any time during the six years he was in office, but he had not sufficient interest in the subject to do so. This new-found enthusiasm will deceive nobody. The Government! is endeavouring to. do something effective and the Country party is trying, to counteract the move. The amendment is not worth the paper upon which it is printed. </para>

                    <para>.- The gratuitous assumption and over-righteous indignation of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in regard to my proposal show to what poor shifts the Government is reduced to justify its attempt to secure complete power over trade and commerce.. He gave us no legal opinion whatsoever to support his view that the amendment would not provide sufficient power to market our products.. The amendment was drafted by  lawyers,  and will do what we have asserted. There is no justification whatever for calling it a placard. Seeing that the Government knows very well that there is not the slightest chance of carrying its first proposal, we are entitled to call that a political placard. On the other hand there is a good chance of securing an affirmative vote for my amendment. Seeing that a referendum is to be taken, this is an. appropriate opportunity to try to secure this necessary additional power. If the Prime Minister had not introduced his trade and commerce proposal, I should not have moved my amendment. If the Government really believed that its first proposal would be acceptable to the people it would not have introduced its industrial powers and  trade and commerce proposals. I obtained expert advice before moving my amendment, and it is ridiculous for the Prime Minister to suggest that there is no substance in it. The talk of the Government about desiring to assist the primary producers does not mean anything. I am amazed that it should have been suggested that our interest in organized marketing is of sudden growth. If the Prime Minister will consult almost any issue of <inline font-style="italic">Hie Round Table</inline> published in the last six years, he will find numerous articles by independent and non-partisan persons, which declare in no uncertain terms that the Bruce-Page Government did a very great deal for organized marketing. Everybody knows that the dairying industry was converted from a condition of penury to a decently paying proposition by the efforts of the previous Government. The Dairy Export Control Board has done remarkably good work. The Paterson Scheme has placed the industry on a new level of prosperity, while a revision of the tariff, for which the former Government was responsible, put an end to the importation into Australia of large quantities of New Zealand dairy produce. </para>

The Dried Fruits Export Control Board has rendered invaluable service to fruit-growers generally. Another thing that the previous Government did to assist in the marketing of our primary products was to establish a Rural Credits Branch of the Commonwealth Bank, through which, during the last four or five years, advances up to 80 per cent, have been made in respect of products marketed under voluntary pooling schemes. In spite of what the Prime Minister has said, I moved my amendment with the honest and deliberate object of securing necessary additional power to the Commonwealth, and I am certain that the primary producers of Australia will realize this. </para>

                    <para>. - The righteous indignation of the Prime Minister, to which the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has referred, was as nothing to the indignation of that honorable gentleman because his little scheme has been exploded. The whole object of this amendment is to enable the Country party, in its next "weekly bulletin," to tell the primary producers of Australia what a big effort it made to assist them, and how it was ignominiously thrust aside by a Government which is out of sympathy with them. Unfortunately for the right honorable gentleman the bubble has been pricked, and the real purpose of the amendment exposed. The right honorable gentleman said that certain newspapers, including <inline font-style="italic">The Bound Table,</inline> have called attention to the wonderful organizing methods put into operation during the regime of the last Government. During the four or five months I have been associated  with  the Markets Department I have had an opportunity of studying this organization, and I say unhesitatingly that chaos reigns even to-day in regard to the activities of every one of those industries served by boards brought into existence by the Bruce-Page Government. The right honorable member for Cowper mentioned the Dairy Export Control Board. He would have us believe that as a result of the setting up of that board everything is now quite all right with the " dairying industry. But. I assure honorable members that there is very much wrong with it, and I challenge any honorable member on the other side to contradict me. There is in existence an advisory body known as the Australian Dairy Council, which speaks for the dairying industry throughout the. whole of Australia. Members of that council, in their very latest advice to me. said that it was impossible, to organize the dairying industry properly until a proper marketing act- was passed. At the present time we have trouble in marketing our butter overseas owing to its excess moisture content. If, as the right honorable member for Cowper suggests, everything is right with the dairying industry, we should have power to rectify such difficulties of a manufacturing nature no matter where they arose. Actually, however, the position is that federal officers can go a certain distance in regard to controlling the manufacture of butter, but no farther. They cannot go into the factories in the various States  and  enforce the proper grading of cream. They would be quickly told by the State authorities  that  they had  no  power to interfere there. Even the amendment proposed by the right honorable member would not confer power to control the industry right from the grading of the cream up to the export of the butter overseas. The dried fruits industry was never in a more chaotic state than it is to-day. Yet one would imagine from listening to the right honorable member for t Cowper, that as a result of the achievements of the Government with which he was associated, all the disabilities of that industry have been removed. I found only the other day, however, when I was trying to allot the export quotas, that although I had power to control the export trade in dried fruits from one State to another, producers had the right to do what they liked within the boundaries of their own States, and could disorganize the market in any way they pleased. That is typical of what obtains in other industries of a like nature. The right honorable member for Cowper stressed the fact that the Rural Credits Bank had been making advances to producers during the- last five years, but he did not mention that not one penny more had been advanced than during the previous five years. I have said enough in regard to dried fruits to show that, without the power which we seek, we cannot organize any primary industry as it should be organized. The only reason for this amendment is to enable the Country party, in its next bulletin, to delude primary producers into the belief that the parliamentary representatives of the party are trying to do something tangible, and to make out that the party is something other than what it has always been, a sham and a bluff, and an imposition ou the producers of the country. </para>

                    <para>. - I have for long advocated increased powers for the Commonwealth Parliament to permit of the control of the marketing of primary products within and without Australia by producers themselves. The amendment proposed by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> is designed to confer such power. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> maintained that there was no substance in the amendment, but it seemed to me that the heat which he put into his argument, if one can call it such, indicated his perturbation at the possibility of having to vote for or against a proposal which meant so much to the primary producers of Australia. He said that the amendment meant nothing, but it was framed on the advice of a greater authority on such matters than the Prime Minister can claim to be. The Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Parker Moloney) did not deal with the merits  of the amendment at all, but" contented himself with abusing the Country party; and imputing improper motives to those who sponsored the proposal. This amendment was introduced in good faith, and with a desire to further the interests of the primary producers along lines desired by them. If it is  carried   it' will do more to assist the primary industries than any of the proposals being put forward by the Government. We do. not wish to lose what is so. patently necessary far the development of Australian primary industries in the general scramble for concessions, which will follow the&gt; acceptance of the Government'3 third proposal. We wish to cut away all extraneous matter, and to concentrate on securing the power which the Labour party itself says it is: anxious to obtain. If it is as "anxious, as it professes to secure; this, power, it should support the amendment. We are all agreed regarding the disabilities, suffered by primary producers as a result of the inability of the Commonwealth Parliament to&gt; legislate on matters relating to intra-state trade. We wish to alter the Constitution in such a way as to give- to- the producers complete control over the internal and; external marketing of their products. We- are not asking for anything  in  the nature of socialistic powers,, but only  power for the Commonwealth Parliament to- make laws enabling the primary producers to control their own products on, a cooperative- basis.. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>St has been said1 that it is difficult to  understand  what the amendment means in. regard to marketing abroad. It is becoming evident, particularly in the great wheat-growing countries, that those concerned in the industry must have power, not only to organize among themselves, but also- to- control the: sale of their products abroad. Canada and the United States of America are- organizing in this way, and Australia should do the same; This amendment provides for creating full: marketing facilities at home and. abroad. To say that the amendment does not mean- anything because the word', "marketing" is used, is ridiculous. Many of our enactments have to do with marketing boards. I feel that some honorable members are opposed to this amendment because they think that it would, if carried, make foodstuffs dearer f.o the consumer. That is not the desire of those responsible for the amendment. We believe that the scientific control of the disposal of primary products will result in returning to the producer the full value of his product, without overcharging the consumer. Honorable members cannot dispose of this amendment by abusing it, nor by having statements published in the press to the effect that the bubble has been pricked; nor can the Prime Minister dispose of it by waxing warm, and getting angry. We wish to pin this committee to a vote in order to see whether it is the intention of the Government to grant the power we ask for if its referendum proposals' are carried. So far, there has been no' indication that, even if the proposals are carried, the facilities we seek will be conceded. I hope that honorable members' will accept this amendment in the spirit in which it has been put forward. I advocated this principle as far back as 1922 ; earlier, I think, than any one else. Last night I supported the second reading of the bil']' in the hope that the power we seek might be obtained; though I recognized the danger of its being lost in the midst of amaze of superfluous- powers which the Commonwealth might never desire to use.. </para>

It did what had never previously been done in connexion  with the organization of marketing. It brought down measures  dealing;  with the control of the export of dairy produce, dried fruits, fresh fruits, canned fruits and wine, as well as a bill relating to pearl-shell; but the producers of pearl-shell entered into contracts which made it unnecessary to take a poll- to -see- whether they were prepared, as a body, to come under the operation of that measure. </para>

                <para>The Minister for Markets has stated that the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank has been of little use to primary producers.

That is an evidence of the tremendous advantage which the rural credits department has been to the primary producers. </para>

It brought down legislation which, at that time, was quite unprecedented, quite new to this Parliament, granting to an authority power to regulate interstate trade. In that connexion, also, it blazed the trail. I point out to the Minister for Markets that it is only now, after the powers which the Commonwealth possesses have been exercised to the full for some years, that it is possible to determine to what extent they are insufficient to deal with the position. Judging by the remarks of the Minister, one would think that it is possible to seek additional powers from the people every twelve months. Very few governments go to the people, by way of a referendum, on more than one occasion during their tenure of office. The last Government used to the utmost, for the benefit of primary producers, the constitutional powers that it possessed; and we are only now able to determine fully the extent to which those powers fall short of what is necessary. Having determined the extent to which they fall short, we have brought forward this amendment. I repeat that we believe that if this amendment is put to the people it will have a much better chance of being carried than will the proposal that the Government intends to place before them. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> referring to the Government of which he was a member, said "We blazed the trail." How did that Government blaze the trail? It is well known to every honorable member who has been in this Parliament for a number of years that it refused to ask for the powers that this Government is now seeking in regard to trade and commerce. It realized in 1926 that if it were granted these powers it would be called upon by the primary producers to bring down a comprehensive marketing scheme; and as that would have conflicted with the interests of those who dominate the Nationalist machine, it did not propose this amendment of the Constitution, nor did it ask for any other power in relation to trade and commerce. Now, however, honorable members opposite would have us believe that their hearts bleed for the primary producers, that they fear that this proposal of the Government will be defeated at the referendum, and that, in that event, the primary producers may not be able to secure an orderly marketing scheme.

In the setting forth of the facts as I have explained them above, T. have shown that the Council of Agriculture has endeavoured to co-operate with the Bruce-Page Government in the matter of legislation affecting the dairymen, and in the making of the full use by Queensland of the provisions of the Rural Credits Act. The Council of Agriculture, although admittedly established by a Queensland Labour Government, has been definitely non-political since its inception. 1 have been associated with it since its inception as a member of the rank and file, later as a member of a district council, . and subsequently as vice-president of the organization, and I know many of my colleagues who are prominent in the Queensland Country Progressive National party will bear me out when  I give an emphatic assurance that no course of action has ever been formulated, and no decision has ever been arrived at from motives of political exigency. . . .

                <para>The honorable member for "Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser),</inline> speaking at a dinner in my presence at Kingaroy, said that the Bruce-Page Government was responsible for the Paterson butter stabilization scheme. As a matter of fact, that Government had nothing to do with the scheme. I believe that the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson ) is generous enough to admit that the originator of the scheme was Mr.</inline> Delroy,  a Queensland farmer, and a constituent of the honorable member for Wide Bay. The late member for Wide Bay, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> B. C. Corser, was good enough to rise in his place in the Commonwealth Parliament in Melbourne and draw the attention of honorable members to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Delroy  originated the scheme, and circularized every member of the Federal Parliament on the matter. I give the honorable member for Gippsland, who at the time was a private member of the Country party, credit for having advocated the scheme before co-operative butter factories, and for the part which he played in getting it adopted. But to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Delroy  is due the honour of having originated the scheme. When the Bruce-Page Government was asked to introduce legislation to give the scheme its backing, the reply was that that could not be done, and in consequence the scheme was initiated on a purely voluntary basis. It would be politically dishonest of any honorable member to claim that the Bruce-Page Government was responsible for the Paterson scheme. That Government was in office for nearly seven years, yet it did absolutely nothing to bring about the organized marketing of primary products in Australia, because such action would have struck a blow at the men who stand behind the Nationalist machine, and other persons - the exploiters, the middlemen, the speculators, the men who have been battening on the primary producers, and who, in the words of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> dictated the policy of the Bruce-Page Government and caused him as an honest man to retire from the Cabinet because he could not tolerate the methods that they adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs has referred to the part which I played in promoting what is known as the Paterson scheme. He has also stated that that scheme was originated by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Delroy.  It is only fair to both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Delroy  and myself that I should state the position. When I first  thought of that plan to assist the dairymen I was not aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delroy's</inline> existence. When I placed it before an interstate conference of representatives of the butter industry in Melbourne, T had not heard of .either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delroy</inline> or his scheme. I believed at that particular time that 1 had originated the idea, and after I had placed it before the industry I brought it forward in the Federal Parliament. On the night that I did so, and just after I had finished speaking on it, the then honorable member for Wide Bay, father of the present member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser)</inline> showed me a newspaper cutting which informed me for the first time that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delroy</inline> had put forward in Queensland a proposal based on a similar principle. Until that time I was not aware either of the existence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delroy</inline> or of the fact that he had thought of this scheme before I had. I owed nothing to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delroy,</inline> but I immediately wrote to him and congratulated him . upon having, apparently, thought of it before I had. I was quite willing to give him any credit that he deserved. </para>

                    <para>.- I deprecate the party feeling that has been engendered in this debate. I have no desire to fan the flame; but if the Country party have been accused of political inconsistency, or worse, in this matter, I can only say that they have themselves to blame. I intend to vote against the amendment, but do not propose to allow members of that party to place me in a false position, which on more than one occasion they have attempted to do. The question has been asked, and I repeat it because it has not yet been answered, if these gentlemen are sincere why did they not ask for these additional powers when they occupied the treasury bench? There is no answer  to  that. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> said that the Government could not be running to the people and asking for fresh powers every few months. My reply to that is that in 1926, when the late  Government  framed its referendum proposals, I appealed to it to include trade and commerce powers, to enable it to do the very thing that the Opposition is anxious to do now? But it did not do so. Members of the late Government talk of what they have done for the primary producers. The Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has told us how they assisted the dried fruit industry. The fact is that the first thing I was asked to do, when that Government came into power, was to head a deputation to ask it to save that industry from economic disaster. </para>

                        <para>- The fact is that a price war is being waged for the first time for many years, particularly in New South Wales, because the Commonwealth Government has not power effectively to control the marketing of dried fruits in Australia. Now the Government is asking for increased powers. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and others urged that, in view of the danger of the first bill not being accepted by the people, a measure should be brought down to provide for increased power over trade and commerce. The Government has done that, and members of the Country party, with one or two exceptions, have voted against the proposal. Obviously, an impossible position would be caused in the country if the matter were allowed to rest there, so the members of the Country party, in order to clear themselves, evolved the brilliant idea of submitting the amendment now under consideration. We have heard the honorable member for Gippsland coolly giving a lecture upon the need for organized marketing, although, only last evening, he voted against the bill for the extension of the powers of this Parliament over trade and commerce, which would have cured all the ills to which he referred. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable member declines to say who gave that advice. I have the authority of the Crown Law Department of the Commonwealth for saying that this amendment will not do what is claimed for it, and, therefore, I shall vote against it. I think that the only effective way to organize the marketing of primary products in Australia is by the method proposed by the present Government. I regret that the Country party, with the exception of two honorable members who have been consistent in this matter, will not support the Government's third proposal; but I believe that the feeling among the primary producers is so strong that this proposal will be carried, irrespective of any decision by. the Country party, and I shall do all that I can to assist its passage. </para>

I have no wish to introduce argument as to who was responsible for the " Paterson " scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delroy</inline> was praised years ago by the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> for the excellence of the proposal that he had propounded for the stabilization of the butter industry, at the time when the honorable member was working on a similar idea. I regret that such argument has been used. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> said that I had stated that the late Government was responsible for the " Paterson " scheme, but I maintain that the honorable member's statement is untrue. At all times I have said that that scheme could not have been successful had it not been for the action of the Government in appointing the Export Control Board. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to express my appreciation of the courtesy of the Government in affording time, according to an undertaking given by the Prime Minister, to discuss the extraordinary tariff schedule which was submitted to this House a few days ago. Honorable members will recall that when the Government brought down these remarkable, and so-called emergency tariff proposals, we on this side asked the Prime Minister to consider two things, first, that these new proposals which were brought down for the ostensible purpose of adjusting the trade balance, should be kept separate from the ordinary duties imposed either for revenue purposes or for the protection of Australian industries; and secondly, that a time limit should be placed upon this emergency tariff. "When these proposals were brought down the financial position was extremely serious, and we admitted that the Government was justified in taking strong measures to cause some improvement of the situation. Although the Government's object was warmly applauded by the Opposition, serious doubt was expressed as to the wisdom of its action. At that time, honorable members were not in possession of the proclamation setting out the 60 or 70 prohibitions which had been decided upon. To some extent, therefore, we were called upon to express our opinion of those phenomenal proposals in the dark. The proclamation is now in our hands, and there has been time, although not sufficient time, for consideration of the Government's action. I am disappointed indeed that the Government has not anticipated this debate by acceding to our very moderate requests, that the Government has not stated officially that this new tariff is an emergency and temporary measure, and that it has not imposed a time limit, so that when the financial position improves we could revert to normal tariff conditions? </para>

I do not mistrust the Government. I have great respect for both the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs  and the Minister  for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">.(Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney), but this tariff schedule lias already had such disastrous effects in bringing about unemployment in this country that we want something more from the Government than a declaration that it should be trusted. I am surprised at the statement of the Acting Minister because already three members of the present Ministry have told this country that this prohibition is temporary and will be rescinded when the Government's object has been achieved. Even that statement is not sufficient, because a time limit must be imposed.

                        announcement increasing the tariff is not connected with the Government's general tariff  policy. It is an absolutely temporary measure designed to re-adjust Australia's adverse trade balance. I consider that within a few months the increases will be reduced.

                        <para>- A period of  six  months is ample. There were strong reasons for asking for the time limit a week ago, but there are very much stronger reasons for asking for a time limit now that honorable members and the people of this country are . familiar with the contents of the proclamation. The attitude of the Opposition when these extraordinary proposals were introduced was in no sense a party one. There was no carping on the question. We were actuated by a sincere and generous desire to give the Government every assistance within our power, but since I have had an opportunity of studying the proclamation and the list, of prohibitions, I am compelled to speak with far more reserve than' I did a week ago. I find it extremely difficult and practically impossible to accept the Governments assurance that there is no connexion between the balance of trade proposals and the Government's fiscal policy.' Indeed, I cannot escape the conclusion that the Government has made little or no effort to resist the temptation to exploit this national emergency and the adverse trade balance for the furtherance of its extraordinary tariff policy. I say that without any reservation. I regret to have to make such a statement, but I feel that I shall have no difficulty in substantiating it. At the same time I am quite open to be convinced that I am wrong. We must all be deeply concerned about the present position, and I hope that the Government will be able to show me that it has adopted this extreme, policy in an earnest and sincere effort to restore the balance of trade. </para>

                <para>Let me ask the committee. to consider the embarrassing situation in which the Government found itself before it imposed these surcharges and prohibitions. Last November it took a step which was entirely new in the fiscal history of Australia. Hitherto, even from our pre-federation. days, it has been the policy of Australia to take into consideration in imposing tariff duties the Australian cost of production and standard of living, and to give a measure of protection a little larger than that which would be sufficient to enable our manufacturers to maintain our standards and yet compete with the outside world. But when the Government introduced its amazing schedule of 300 items last November it entirely departed from, that basis. That schedule, and another tabled in December, created a wholesale monopoly of the Australian market for our manufacturers and the employees in secondary industries. </para>

                        <para>- I like the honesty of honorable members opposite who have interjected. But the introduction of those schedules created a most awkward position; it divided the manufacturing interests in the community into two classes.

                <para class="block">Manufacturer's  who were given the advantage of a monopoly and were, so to speak, stall-fed, weather-proofed and bedded down under luxurious conditions, were quite satisfied, while those who were left out in the bracing winds of the open paddock of competition came in droves to the .Acting Minister for Customs with requests for additional consideration. They had a certain amount of justification for their stand. They said in effect " Why pick a few manufacturers out ? Why make fish of one and fowl of another ? Why not put us all on a mon'opolistic basis?" If the Government had come down to the House and said frankly that it intended to do this, the policy could have been understood, if not appreciated* My charge against the Government is that it has exploited a national emergency to provide prohibitive duties for certain commodities. It has smuggled into the list of prohibitions many items which have no business to be there, and which could not be considered to have any bearing "upon our adverse trade balance. I make no apology to-night for adopting an attitude different from that which I adopted a few days ago on this subject. At that time I was in the dark, aud I was prepared to be generous towards the Government; but since then I have studied the situation, and I say quite frankly that the Government has exploited a national emergency for its own ends. </para>
                <para>Considerable pressure has been brought to bear upon the Government by the manufacturers of Australia who did not benefit through the increased duties imposed by the November and December schedules. The disposition among honorable members opposite to engage in prohibitive tariff making was well known - they have never concealed their desires in that respect - and the manufacturers have taken advantage of it. I do not, at the moment, quarrel with that policy, but I strongly protest against the false pretences and make-believe behind the surcharges and prohibitions. The Prime Minister had something to say this afternoon about a political placard. Here is a political placard, if ever there was One. This is an attempt to bolster up our protective policy by extraordinary methods. I should not' have objected so much -had the Government been candid. The Government will not correct the adverse trade balance by this means. I do not say that the surcharges and prohibitions will have no effect upon the trade balance, but I assert,  without hesitation, that they have been designed largely to give the Australian manufacturers and their employees a monopoly of the -Australian market. This, of course, will please the supporters of many honorable members opposite. </para>
                <para>But every honest protectionist must protest against this policy, no matter how ardent he may be. Such "methods of increasing our customs duties have never before been adopted in this country. Although the new duties will have very far-reaching effects, Parliament could,  if  the Government desired, be denied an opportunity of discussing them, for they have been imposed by proclamation. They may spread ruin far and wide. This policy has granted privileges to a few people only, and. for that reason, if for no other, it deserves condemnation. The charge that the Government is exploiting the financial position for the special advantage of the manufacturers and employees in secondary industries cast's a grave reflection upon its sincerity, but I stand by what T have said. Certain members of the Ministry have made the statement, which has been, published throughout the World) that the policy has been adopted to correct the adverse trade balance; but some of the prohibited items could not possibly have airy effect in that regard.- If the Government had selected a few big items and prohibited their importation, there would have been a minimum of dislocation and relatively few people overseas would have been offended; but widespread irritation has been caused, because among the 60 or 70 prohibited items there are many which are quite insignificant in volume and value. I could direct the attention of the Government to a few items which could have been prohibited, with the result that millions of pounds would have been kept in the country. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has not prohibited it, because it derives from it a large amount in revenue duties. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> said in Sydney that this measure had no association whatever with our fiscal policy. I propose to mention some 25 items against which prohibition has been imposed and ask the committee to consider, in a non-party spirit, whether any one of them could have any considerable influence upon the balance of trade. The first is glucose. Our total importations of glucose are valued at £9,531 per annum. Imagine the great effect that the prohibition of this item will have on our adverse trade balance, and the vast number of employees that will find work in making £9,500 worth of it! The next item is laundry blue, the imports of which in 1928-29 were valued at £1,351. How can any one say that the prohibition against this item is imposed for any other reason than to satisfy the demands of the manufacturers of this country? A prohibition is a profoundly serious thing, and invites retaliation. The only agreement tentatively reached at the Geneva Tariff Conference, on the whole tariff question, was that the countries represented would not impose absolute prohibition. They retained their right to impose what duties they liked, but they would not actually prohibit importation of any article. But this Government, in its ignorance of conventional tariff making, has rushed in where all others feared to tread. The importation of candles has also been prohibited. In 1928-29 the value of candles imported was £8,639, while the value of candles manufactured in Australia was £276,169. That furnishes a good example for my argument. It cannot be seriously advanced that the importation of candles is being prohibited for the purpose of adjusting the balance of trade. £8,000 one way or the other will not affect the matter to any appreciable extent; nor can it be advanced that the making of an additional £8,000 worth of candles here will help to relieve local unemployment. This action, in my opinion, has been deliberately taken to create a monopoly in favour of the candle-manufacturers of Australia, and to honour a promise made by the Government. We now come to eggs, of which £6,419 worth were imported in the year 1928-29. The Government is prepared to make enemies of countries with whom we hope to trade for the sake of keeping out £6,000 worth of eggs. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that there may be no reason for bringing eggs here, but if it is desired to keep them out, let us do so by imposing a prohibitive tariff, not by prohibiting their importation altogether. There is no need to do it by proclamation under the cloak of emergency. That is my complaint against the Government. </para>

                <para>In the year 192S-29, lemons were imported to the value of £6,709, and oranges to the value of £5,956. Again, I say, if it is desired to keep those articles out, let us do it by means of a tariff, and not by insulting and offending our customers overseas. For sheer stupidity and ignorance of tariff conventions, nothing like this has been done before either by this Parliament or by any other Parliament. Of cornflour, £10,838 worth was imported during the year 1928-29. The next item is jams and jellies, concerning which we have imposed a prohibition against the world. This smash in the face for the buyers of our wool, wheat and butter, has been imposed for the sake of prohibiting the importation of £13,133 worth of goods ! The Australian manufacturers, for the year 1928-29, supplied the Australian market with £2,180,616 worth of jams and jellies. It passes my understanding why the importation of this and other items has been prohibited. It can  only have been done to satisfy the demands of the Australian manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable member seriously suggest that that is why the Government has prohibited the importation of snuff, which was imported to the value of only  £1,288  during the year  1928-29,  or by prohibiting the importation of canary seed? In regard to canary seed, I have no doubt that this action has been taken at the behest of another friend of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs. The next item is lard and edible fats, and one can imagine the enormous sum in interest that will be paid on overseas loans by prohibiting the importation of  £11,188  worth of lard and fat. Then there is milk, dried, or in powdered form, of which  £12,286  worth was imported during  1928-29.  I do not wish honorable members to think that I have no sympathy with the Australian growers of oranges and lemons, and with those engaged here in the dairying industry. I do not say that I would not give them increased protection, but a responsible government should give that protection in a normal way by means of a tariff which comes for consideration before this House, and not by a proclamation of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs. </para>

                        <para>- We are reaching a low level of debate when a Minister of the Crown drags in the word " lie."  Foi1  the year  1928-29,  peanut butter, another of the prohibited items, was imported to the value of  £6,816,  and yet we are asked to believe that the prohibition of peanut butter will correct an adverse trade balance of  £50,000,000  or  £60,000,000,  and provide work for our workless men and women. Other items are starch,  of  which  £7,336  worth was imported, and starch flour, of which  £4,808  worth was brought into the country in  1928-29.  A further item is custard powder. In passing, let me point out that all these items come under a heading of household necessaries. The policy the Government is pursuing in this connexion will not assist in adjusting our adverse trade balance, but will have the effect of bolstering up local manufacturers, who will create monopolies. We are issuing to the manufacturers a definite and unlimited charter to exploit the people of this country. </para>

                        <para>- The total value of the  25  items is approximately  £228,000  and to each of the industries manufacturing the commodities I have mentioned, the Government is giving an unlimited charter. The Government is removing from  25  important industries in this country all element of competition, which will have the effect of increasing prices and lowering qualities. There will be no incentive for manufacturers or groups of manufacturers to maintain the quality of the goods which they are producing, because there will be no competition. It is not only a matter of price, but of quality, and by issuing this charter to Australian manufacturers we shall prevent the importation of goods valued at about  £228,000.  The total value of imports in- ordinary circumstances is in the vicinity of  £150,000,000  per annum. This is an example of extreme protection. </para>

                        <para>- If the Government had submitted a scheme under which it was restricting the importation of goods of a much higher value, and in so doing was materially assisting the financial position, it would have had the support of  the Opposition. But we strongly object to this party stuff which is being turned out by the mile. This is merely an alternative to another tariff schedule which the Government had not the courage to bring down, and which has been rushed through, signed by the Governor-General, and brought into force without any opportunity of debate. Tents are another prohibited item. The tents imported are valued at only £3,000, and the value of tents manufactured in Australia £654,000. What good will that do in relieving the financial position? The whole thing is tainted. The values of some other commodities, the importation of which is prohibited, are as follow: - Barbed wire, £20,000; railway dog spikes, £10,000; wire and other nails, £4,000. </para>

                        <para>- On that occasion I spoke in the absence of the schedule. The Opposition is willing to be generous to the Government, but we suggest that it should drop this scheme and introduce new proposals on national instead of on party lines. The value of other commodities, the importation of which is to be prohibited, are: - Glue, £11,000; gelatine of all kinds, £18,000; vinegar, £32,000. The total for the particular 25 items I have selected is £228,000, or an average for each industry of £9,000 a year. These proposals will not have any beneficial effect on our adverse trade balance. Moreover, few, if any, additional employees will be required to manufacture the goods necessary to meet the normal demand, and it is possible, and even likely, that the additional quantity could be produced with the existing plants and the present number of employees. This course has been adopted, first as a sop to the manufacturers, and, secondly, to benefit the trade union supporters of the Government, who in the end will not derive any benefit, as they will have to pay much higher prices than those at present prevailing. This is class legislation, and is an invitation to the manufacturers in the industries concerned to put up prices, and to the workers to increase their demands. In the end we shall be faced with higher prices, increased costs, and even more unemployment than exists to-day. I emphasize the point that the quality of the goods placed on the Australian market is of major importance, as the importation of a certain amount of goods must have a beneficial effect in keeping up the quality of Australian manufactures. The percentage of imports to the annual consumption of some of the items in the schedule is as follows: - Candles, 3 per cent.; lemons, 2.25 per cent.; oranges, . 4 per cent. ; cornflour, 14 per cent.; jams and jellies, . 6 per cent.; dried milk, 2 per cent. ; tents and sails, 0.4 per cent. The importation of these commodities, even in small quantities, must have a restraining effect on prices, and assists in keeping up the standard of Australian goods. If we prohibit imports we have no check upon prices or qualities. I am not reflecting upon Australian manufacturers when I say that there will be exploitation in the matter of price and quality. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman belongs to a profession by a member of which such a problem is liable to be propounded at any time. I particularly draw the attention of the committee - I know that I shall have its sympathy - to the effect of the proposals of the Government upon unemployment in this country. I believe that greater tariff protection, if given within reason, will inevitably result in more employ meat within Australia, so long as it is wisely applied to secondary industries in which there is room for expansion.  But let us consider what has happened since the Government came '' down with 300 prohibitive items in November last. When that new tariff was 'imposed the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, and practically every other member of the Cabinet, immediately began to announce, estimates of the  scores of thousands of additional workers who as a result of it would find employment. But what has occurred since this Government came into office? According to the latest official figures, there were 13,600 more trade unionists out of work on the 31st March last than at the end of the year 1929. I do not blame the Government for that, but I do say that the tariff which it brought down iri- November last ' has not bad the effect of reducing the amount of unemployment in Australia.  </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> says " Hear, hear." Let me tell him that, by the destruction of the import business thousands of Labour supporters in the ranks of the clerks, wharf labourers, carters, draymen, and other callings have been thrown out of work. At a time of dire economic and industrial distress such as that which we are now experiencing a wise Government would have kept in work those who were in work. One job of which an Australian is sure to-day, to-morrow, and to the end of the year, is worth five or six that might be found for him by a manufacturer who has not yet built his factory. I would . have supported the Government on a few major items; but when it introduces prohibition on a wholesale scale and in an unscrupulously extreme manner it is not deserving of the support of either this Parliament or the people of Australia. I charge the party opposite with having taken violent and unscrupulous action against industry in this country, but particularly against the interests of thousands of workers. The immediate result has been the dismissal of large numbers of employees. Ultimately the result may be the employment of thousands of other persons; but what good will that do for those who, as a result of the Government's policy, are paid off this week? </para>

                <para>It has been suggested that this action was taken on the advice of the associated banks. I am unable to say whether that is so or not ; but to my certain knowledge some of the most influential and highly-placed bankers in this country are diametrically opposed to this policy. I have evidence of that in my pocket at the present moment. There is as great a volume of banking advice opposed to it as there is in favour of it. Having studied the position fairly exhaustively since the Government took action, I have come te the' conclusion that the balance of trade  was rapidly readjusting itself, and that with a little assistance in the direction of stopping big lines of imports, in conjunction with action by the banks, it would automatically have adjusted itself. The only definite result of this action has been to create immediately widespread unemployment. Any other possible result is still " in the air." </para>

                    <para>.- The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> has just delivered an extraordinary speech, full of inconsistencies. The honorable gentleman appears to be concerned for the unemployed section of the community. Indeed, since he took his seat on the other side of the chamber, he has become almost hysterically eloquent on the subject of unemployment.  His  solution of the problem is to lift the prohibition on the importation of canary seed, eggs, candles, glucose, jams, and jellies ! He is not opposed to a large number of the major items which are now prohibited. On his own statement that the prohibition of imports causes unemployment, the honorable gentleman must bo adjudged guilty of advocating a policy which would intensify the unemployment evil. He would allow the importation of a number of articles, the volume of trade in which is not large; but he would prohibit the importation of those items which form the bulk of our imports, and consequently provide a greater amount of unemployment. The honorable member could scarcely have been more inconsistent. According to him, the prohibition of the importation of a few minor items is accentuating the unemployment problem. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman instanced 25 items, and said that the volume of trade in them was so small as to have no great effect on unemployment; and in the next breath he said that the Government policy in prohibiting their importation had increased the unemployment evil. He has entirely failed to substantiate the charge he levelled against the Government. By calling history to our aid, it would not be difficult to show that the Government of which the honorable gentleman was a' member was largely responsible  for the present unemployment. Our huge adverse trade balance was accumulating all the time that the Bruce-Page Government was in office. A very strong case in favour of fixing the responsibility for the present unsatisfactory state of affairs on the late Government could bc made out if one desired to deal with this matter from a purely party political stand-point. The honorable gentleman began his speech with a demand that the Government should declare whether the restriction of imports was permanent or temporary. He then proceeded to read a number of statements made by various members of the Ministry. He quoted a statement by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> that the proclamation restricting imports was not connected with the fiscal policy of the- Government, and would be reconsidered when the trade balance became more favorable.

                        <para>- On the contrary, they say definitely and clearly that the action taken is of a temporary nature, and is not connected with the Government's fiscal policy. When I asked the honorable gentleman what time limit he would fix, he stated an arbitrary period of six mouths. I now ask him upon what data he fixed that period, and on what date it should commence. ' The honorable member should recognize that at this stage it is not possible to say when the proclamation should expire. All that can be done is to set out clearly the principle underlying the proclamation. Despite his knowledge of definite ministerial declarations he pursued his customary course of professing profound suspicion of the sincerity and honesty of the Government. He clamorously demanded that the Government should declare its policy; then, having told us what responsible Ministers had said, he ventilated the darkest suspicion and distrust of those declarations. What is the use of the Government stating its intentions if the honorable member is resolved not to believe what Ministers say? The honorable gentleman proceeded to launch an extreme attack on the proclamation. He denounced it as an extreme departure from the tariff policy of colonial and post-federation days, and said that it was tainted with a sinister motive to help Australian manufacturers, and too drastic and radical to be the subject of moderate and temperate  speech.  After that vitriolic  and  vituperative comment he argued that the schedule was  not  drastic enough, and ridiculed it by picking out such minor items as glucose, eggs, and canary seed. The Government, he said, should not waste its time on trifles, but should direct its attention to the larger imports, the restriction of which would have a beneficial effect on the trade balance. He was asked to specify those mysterious commodities which could be beneficially kept out of Australia, but he omitted to do so. With his tongue in his cheek he professed to be taking a broader outlook than that of the mere party politician, and to have  a  genuine desire to help the Government in a time of national emergency; but, although he claimed to have a knowledge of voluminous imports that could be prohibited with advantage to the country, he kept it secret.  His  refusal to disclose the information he professed to have showed clearly that he was dealing with the problem as a nagging party political hack.  His  speech contributed nothing to the solution of the difficulties with which the Commonwealth is confronted. I believe that the Ministry, when issuing the proclamation, acted conscientiously and on expert advice, after pursuing every line of inquiry that was open to it. It is a genuine and patriotic attempt to restore the trade balance while causing a minimum of interference with internal industry. Although the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said that the effect of the proclamation was to increase unemployment, he has not mentioned one person who has lost his job because of it.  His  insinuations concerning the sincerity and political honesty of the Government are more justly applicable to himself. He has shown a poor appreciation of the courtesy of members of the ministerial party in remaining here to-night so that he might continue this debate. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but the honorable gentleman prefaced his remarks by expressing appreciation of the courtesy of the Government in affording him an opportunity to speak on the tariff. Evidently that was sheer hypocrisy. We expected something better from a gentleman who occupied the responsible office of Minister for Trade and Customs in the last Ministry. The economic and financial problems which the Government is called upon to solve have not developed suddenly; they have accumulated over many years, and the charge against the Government, that it is not doing anything to reduce the grave unemployment in Australia, comes with little grace from a gentleman who was in office while these unfortunate conditions were developing. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.']</inline></para>

                    <para>.- The speech of the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McTiernan)</inline> was distinguished more by its vigour than by its relevance. The honorable member did not appear to have followed in the least degree the arguments of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett).</inline> The point that the honorable member for Henty made in the first portion of his speech was that there were some 25 items in the schedule, the imports of which into Australia last year amounted to £228,000. According to the statement of the Prime Minister, the whole volume of imports affected by the prohibition and other tariff provisions introduced last week, amounts to between £10,000,000 and £12,000,000. Of the 70 odd items scheduled, 25 involve an amount of only £228,000. The statement advanced by the Government is that these restrictions upon imports were brought in to meet, the exchange position only,. and that. - I am using the words of the Prime Minister himself - they are in no way associated with its protective policy. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>No reasonable person could possibly believe that those 25 items were introduced for the purpose of altering the exchange position. That is the argument of i lie honorable member for Henty. He contended that this procedure by way of proclamation was adopted in order to satisfy certain claims which were not satisfied by the tariff schedules. Accepting the Prime Minister's maximum of £.12.000,000, the balance of the prohibited imports above and beyond those 25 items amounts to, say, £11,750,000. Surely it is obvious that the sudden stoppage of the flow into Australia within a single year of some eleven million pounds worth of imports must necessarily produce immediate unemployment. It may be that that will be caught up later and that an adjustment will take place, but it is patent that immediate and serious unemployment must result from the action of the Government. That, again was the argument of the honorable member for Henty. The honorable member for Parkes did not even begin to get near to an answer to it. </para>
                <para>I shall refer to a limited number of points, and I think that I can put them shortly to allow other honorable members an opportunity to speak on the subject, f call attention to the procedure which has been employed by the Government on this occasion. For many years there has been a simple provision in the Customs Act wilder which any imports can be prohibited by proclamation. Up to the present that provision has been utilized only in exceptional cases. No very serious action has been taken under it. On this occasion an entirely new use is being made of the procedure. The point that I am making is apart altogether from any views that any honorable member may have as to these particular prohibitions, ft is, that by a proclamation made by a Minister, not reviewable by Parliament, that cannot be effectively discussed in Parliament, upon which no amendment can be made in Parliament, and which Parliament is unable either to approve or reject, between ten and twelve million pounds worth of imports are to be shut out of Australia. That is done by executive act, by a stroke of the pen. If it were a proposal to impose a duty of 5 per cent, on an article, be' that article canary seed or snuff, it would be necessary to obtain the approval of both this House and the Senate. But when, instead of a duty of 5 per cent., it is a prohibition - a duty, let us say, of ten thousand per cent., the absolute exclusion of goods - then, if you please, Parliament is to have no say in the matter. It would have been possible to bring down a schedule prohibiting the importation of these goods, or to impose absolutely prohibitive duties. Had that been done, Parliament would have had an opportunity to discuss the provisions of the schedule which would nevertheless have operated forthwith. It is useless to say that the introduction of these proposals in the ordinary form of a tariff schedule would have created any difficulty for the Government, or placed any obstacle in its way. Except for the procuring of the assent of the representatives of tHe people, there would not have been any obstacle. The procedure followed means that no assent of the representatives of the people is required. I hope that at an early date I shall have an opportunity to ask this House to agree to a modification of the Customs Act to prevent such a course being followed in the future. Whether our views are in favour of or against the particular proposals, the procedure is radically wrong in this case. </para>
                <para>There must necessarily be a disturbance of business and of industry as a result of the action taken by the Government. It must inevitably increase unemployment immediately. It may be that the measures taken can be justified even though they will bring about that result. I call attention to the fact that the unemployment figure at the end nf September last  wa3  12.1 per cent. At the end of December it was 3 8.1 per cent... while on the 31st March it was 14.6 per cent. I do so for a particular purpose. We all know that the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> is an enthusiastic propagandist. For some months he has been conducting a publicity campaign in support of the November and subsequent tariff proposals of the Government. Many honorable members have heard of, and some have seen, the circulars  that have been sent to manufacturers, designed to elicit any evidence that might support the tariff proposals of the Government by saying that there had been some increase in employment. I suggest that there should be a clear distinction between official statements made by Ministers, based on information obtained from the Statistical Department, and propaganda by Ministers. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs has been indulging in the most remarkable propaganda. If what he said is true, the official figures in regard to unemployment must be false, because £he honorable gentleman has repeatedly announced an increase of employment to the extent of 50,000. The last occasion on which he did so was in Sydney. In confirmation, I refer honorable members to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of Monday last. </para>

                        <para>- That is an entirely different proposition from the allegation frequently advanced by the Acting Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> in his propaganda. It is largely speculative, problematical and hypothetical. It is a mere matter of opinion and is not capable of demonstration and proof. It is a proposition different from everything that the Minister has been saying up to date. An example of this propaganda is a speech made by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs at Marrickville on Saturday night last. He dealt with a number of industries, which, he said, were employing an increased number of hands. I hope that they are. We are all agreed that everything should be done to solve the acute unemployment problem, but I submit that the Acting Minister is doing an ill service to the community by conveying an entirely false impression of the facts. Speaking at Marrickville he said : - </para>

                    <para>While one or two mills had employed additional hands, the fact was that a larger number of operatives were now idle, and indications were that this number would be increased in the immediate future. It was expected, however, that when the trade readjusted itself, a number ot those at present unemployed would be absorbed in the industry. </para>

                <para>I sincerely hope that they will. That statement is by a union secretary who has no animus against the Government, but every reason for supporting it. He states that unemployment is unfortunately increasing in the textile industry, yet for mouths past we have had almost weekly statements about the increase of employment in the textile industry as a result of the tariff action of the Government. I put these facts before honorable members. The report which I just read is sufficient answer to the statement of the Acting Minister. I ask him to consider very seriously his propaganda methods in the interests of his own Government and the Commonwealth as a whole. The Acting Minister is overdoing this thing, and when the press publishes such a report as this from a union secretary, who probably is a strong supporter of the Government, it must naturally create mistrust in the mind of the general public in respect of the many statements emanating from the same ministerial source. </para>
                <para>The subject of prices has been referred to again and again by Ministers, both inside and outside this chamber. I find in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> of Wednesday last, a statement by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, which is just as flamboyant as are so many of his statements. It reads -  " Your Government's tariff will save and make Australia." This message forms the text of a number received during the last few days by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs following the introduction of the new schedule on Friday. </para>

He hoped it would not be necessary for the Government to take any steps to compel local manufacturers to realize that it was their duty to give the best service possible. Bather than increase prices he would like them to follow the lead set by the makers of farming implements, who had pledged themselves to reduce prices immediately by 5 per cent. Any instances of exploitation would bc investigated by the Government, and some action would be taken. </para>

                <para class="block">One journal referred to statements like that as " Ministers waving their tin swords." That is a- very apt metaphor. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs says that -some action will bp taken, but what action could be taken? Surely every honorable member knows that, whatever the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth may be, it is quite impossible to deal with price control. It would be impossible to deal with the various items of the tariff. There are some 500 classes of items and many subclasses,' and it is quite inconceivable that we could employ a method of price control in respect of any considerable number of those items. Again and again we have heard in this chamber the most formidable threat, mainly from the Prime Minister, but to a considerable extent from the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, that if the local sellers or manufacturers of articles do not behave themselves, duties will be removed. Everybody knows that that is idle talk, that the' Ministers are waving a rusty and a bent tin sword. If two or three manufacturers exploit the public, is the duty that protects 500 manufacturers to be removed? There is nothing in the Minister's statements, and every honorable member knows that. Honorable members may sit and applaud such statements, because they sound very fine, if delivered in a sufficiently stern style. Speaking generally, the only way to reduce the prices ' of commodities is by some measure of competition. If prices are unduly high, the people will refuse to buy, or else competitors will enter the field. There is no other real way of bringing prices to a reasonable level. </para>
                <para>I ask the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs to arrange for a census to be taken of the prices of all articles affected by last week's proposals as from the nearest convenient date prior to their introduction, and in addition to arrange for another inquiry into wholesale and retail prices at about the 30th April, and thereafter, say, at three-monthly intervals. This is an emergency measure. The Government has stated that it does not intend that prices shall be raised. To place the matter beyond all doubt, arrangements should be made to publish the necessary information a*&gt;  that honorable members1 may know whether or not prices are being increased as a result of the Government's action. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite indifferent on that point. I have not heard from any of my supporters on this matter.- The Prime Minister stated definitely that some manufacturers had given an undertaking not to raise prices. They should be held to their agreement, at least to the extent that, if they break away from it, they should be exposed and required to give reasons. I should welcome a census of prices before and after the prohibition of imports so that honorable members may be in a position to know the actual facts. Having regard to the exceptional character of the Government's proposals, special information should be prepared relating to those articles of manufacture which are affected by the Government's embargo upon imports. </para>

                <para>On Friday afternoon, I asked the Prime Minister whether he would allow honorable members an opportunity to discuss the imposition of a time limit upon the prohibition of imports. The right honorable gentleman replied that it was an important matter, that the Government had an open mind upon it and would be glad to hear the views of honorable members. Because of that definite pronouncement from the Prime Minister, I was surprised to-day to hear from the ministerial side of the House a chorus of jeers and gibes when the member for Henty and  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> mentioned the desirability of lm: posing a time limit upon the embargo. 1 hope that the" Minister in charge of the House will -follow the lead given by the Prime Minister on Friday afternoon la3t. Every one knows that the prohibition of imports and. the surcharge of 50 per cent, upon certain classes of imports is not part of' the" Government's protective policy. Its action, therefore, must result in a serious disturbance of the business of importers and distributors, which necessarily must inflict harm upon the community. If there is no time limit, and if business people are unable to prepare in advance for the lifting of the prohibition! give the Government credit for acting in good faith, believing that in due time the Ministry will lift the prohibition - there will again be a serious disturbance of business if it is removed without warning. The Government submitted its proposals as a means to relieve the exchange situation. If it is noting in good faith - and 1 arn assuming it is - unless a time limit is imposed, vested interests will develop and place the Ministry in an almost impossible position when it seeks to remove the prohibition. If, however, a time limit is indicated, every one will know that the prohibition of importations will last only for a season unless the continuance of abnormal conditions renders it desirable for the Government to allow the prohibition to remain in force a little longer. With a time limit, both importers and manufacturers will be able to make their arrangements in the full knowledge that the prohibition of importations will cease upon a given date. Without a time limit it will be impossible for manufacturers to expend capital in extending their plants for the purpose of providing for further employment. On this matter I have consulted a considerable number of leading business men, manufacturers as well as importers, and all are agreed as to the wisdom of a time limit. No manufacturer who gave credit to the Government for honesty of intention would incur expenditure under the existing conditions. On the "other hand, certain manufacturers might take a chance, thinking they could" " wangle " a continuance of the prohibition by bringing influence to bear upon the Ministry and! inducing it to break its pledge to the people of this country. Should a time limit be fixed - I suggest it should be six months - business men will know where they stand ; and if, two or three months before it expires, the Government considers it necessary to continue this emergency action, it will still be possible to extend the prohibition. I ask the Minister in charge of the House not to dismiss the suggestion merely because it. emanates from the Opposition. The Prime Minister on Friday last regarded it as of great importance, and promised to give it consideration. </para>
                <para>I hope the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> will not adopt the attitude to which, unfortunately, we are becoming accustomed in this House, of making a violent party speech interlarded with appeals for a non-partisan treatment of the subject. Honorable members on this side are becoming tired of this method of approach. We are all members of one or other of the political parties in this country. I am not ashamed of my association with the party which I have the honour to lead in this House, and 1 deem it my duty to endeavour to put into operation the ideals for which it stands and in which I believe. Why should there be so much pretence of non-partisanship in the discussion of government proposals? During the last three weeks we have been appealed to over and over again by Ministers and their supporters to consider in a non-partisan spirit legislative measure.8 absolutely reeking with party politics. J do not say that the proposals in question are wrong on that account, but they should be brought forward frankly as representing the ideals of the party in office, a lId no one need be ashamed of them. Again, I remind the Minister of the undertaking given on Friday last by the Prime Minister concerning a time limit" for the prohibition of imports and the surcharges on certain classes of goods. And I ask him to believe that in this matter I arn concerned not so much with the interests of party as I am with the interests of the community as a whole. </para>

                    I feel sure that the Leader of the Opposition could not have hoard the speech of his colleague, lt is quite apparent that honorable members opposite have been disappointed because these emergency proposals of the Government have been so well received by thinking people throughout the Commonwealth. Every one who has looked at our economic situation without party political bias, has admitted that something drastic had to be done, and that the Government has made a courageous effort to tide Australia over the trying period through which she is passing. The alternative was to persist in the drift policy of the previous Government. All that that Government did while it was in office for nearly seven years was to spend money lavishly, borrow largely from overseas or on the local market, and allow the ship of state to drift farthe rand farther towards the financial rocks. Bankeds and sane political economists throughout the couuntry and overseas have declared that, although the Government took some risk in adopting this policy, it acted with great courage. I am sorry that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition departed to-night from the statesmanlike attitude that he adopted last week in speaking of these proposals. He said on that occasion -

                <para>M 1. FORDE. - The honorable member knew enough to congratulate the Government upon its courage. After listening to his speech to-night, one can only conclude that a meeting of the rather attenuated party of which he is a member has since been held, at which it was concluded that the Government was receiving too much credit from thinking people for acting as it had done, and that it was necessary to criticize it irrespective of whether the criticism was well-founded or otherwise. The Prime Minister and I have both said in this House and elsewhere that this action has been taken to meet a national emergency, and has no relation to our general fiscal policy. The Government acted only after mature consideration. For two months it considered the whole position earnestly. It consulted the bankers of Australia, the experts of the Customs Department, and the members of the Tariff Board. The officers of the Customs Department combed the tariff schedules with a small comb, so to speak, and reduced the list of imports on which surcharges or prohibitions would be imposed to the smallest proportion, having regard to the necessity for avoiding unwise dislocation and hardship. Most of the items thai have been prohibited are luxuries or items that we can do without or are manufactured in Australia. The members  of the Tariff Board, including those who are not public servants, were asked by the Government to express a frank opinion on the items that it was proposed to exclude, and they could not point to one that should be removed from the list. The Governmentinvited the Leader and  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and honorable members generally, to offer any suggestions that they pleased on the subject, and the only response has been the statement of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition to-night that he could enumerate, though he would not do so, a number of items that could be prohibited, with the result that millions of pounds worth of exports could be excluded without hardship. The honorable member has fallen very far from the high stand that he took last week. </para>
                <para>It has been suggested to-night that the Government should indicate the period for which the prohibitions will remain in force. I remind the committee that the people returned this party to power with an overwhelming majority in October last, and entrusted it with the duty of getting the country out of the financial difficulties into which the previous administration had allowed it to drift. The Government has taken the responsibility of imposing these surcharges and prohibitions, and it will also take the responsibility of determining when they may safely be lifted. If we were to fix a date now for the lifting of them, the period might expire during a parliamentary recess, and many  anomolies  would result. The Minister in charge of the Customs Department has a large discretionary power to vary prohibitions or grant general permissions and to deal sympathetically with any cases of hardship that may be submitted to him. We have already indicated that goods in bond or in transit on the water on the date of the proclamation will be admitted under the old rates. It has also been intimated that the fullest and most sympathetic consideration will be given to any application by the importers of goods from the United Kingdom in respect of goods on order from the factory or actually in transit from the factory to the ship at the time the proclamation was issued. General permission has also been given for the importation of certain lines which it is ascertained are not made in Australia such as copper rivets, bifurcated rivets and horse-shoe nails. The Government will exercise the greatest care to ensure that no undue hardship is caused in the application of this policy. It would be farcical for the Government to agree to put a time limit upon its emergency tariff proposals, because it has the power at any time to vary or amend the proclamation. Previous governments have1 issued prohibitions and proclamations, and have inserted time limits only when it suited their particular purpose. In 1917 the Hughes Government issued a proclamation affecting approximately sixteen items, among" them being eggs, fur, apparel, perfumery, jewellery, potable spirits, ale, beer, and so on, and the prohibition then made continued for nearly three years. It is, of course, true that the prohibition was imposed because of the difficulty in securing shipping space, but nevertheless it had the effect of building up some great Australian industries, notably confectionery manufacturing and motor car body building. The point .1 wish to make is that the government of that day was trusted to determine how long that prohibition would continue, and surely the present government can be trusted to say how long the present prohibition shall continue. </para>
                <para>Complaints have been made about the  fiscal effect of the step the Government has taken, but, while that" consideration did not actuate the Government, any prohibition of imports must necessarily stimulate local production. </para>

                <para>There are 420 items in the tariff, of which 52 were affected by the schedule brought down in August; 77 are prohibited from being imported except. with the permission of the Minister; 11 are affected by a partial prohibition and 5 of the last mentioned are also subjected to the 50 per cent, surcharge in the schedule, making a total of 140 out of 420. Last year goods worth approximately £140,000,000 were imported. The step taken by the Government will affect goods worth approximately £16,000,000, and it is .estimated that the imports will be reduced by approximately £10,000,000 affecting the revenue by approximately £4,750,000. This action, together with the policy being <inline font-style="italic">followed by the</inline> banks in rationing credit, will, it is believed, rectify our adverse trade balance within twelve months. The policy of drift which characterized the last Government over a period of six and a half years has led to Australia having in the aggregate an adverse trade balance of £91,000,000. It is absolutely scandalous that the late Government did not attempt to tackle the position as this Government has done. If to the £63,500,000 by which our imports exceeded exports we add interest and cost of services abroad for the same period amounting to £213,300,000 we find that wc have a total of £276,800,000 to meet. </para>
                <para class="block">The late Government did not attempt to face the situation except by borrowing, and during six and a half years the Commonwealth and the States borrowed £162,700,000, and our dividend from Bawra amounted to £9,200,000, making a total of £171,900,000, which leaves a shortage of £104,900,000. No wonder the banks, at a conference with the leaders of the present Government declared that this policy of drift should not be allowed to continue. They were among the first to be consulted in the matter. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said he felt sure that the Prime Minister was wrong in saying that he had consulted the banks of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member went as near as any man could to saying that the Prime Minister had not told the truth in the matter. It is unfortunate that there is unemployment in Australia, but this is nothing to what it would have been had the present Government not tackled the position in a courageous way. When the Government was returned to power on the 12th October last our secondary industries were languishing; Australia was in the grip of big importing interests which were strangling our secondary industries. Those industries appealed in vain to the late Government, for protection. The generous measure of protection which this Government has given them in the first tariff proposals, hurriedly brought down and placed on the table, has resulted in thousands of men finding employment, and in thousands being kept on who would otherwise have been dismissed. I have had numerous letters from manufacturers saying that as a result of the protection given by the present Government they are able not only to keep their employees working but also to engage additional hands. Unfortunately, because of the serious drop in the price of wool and wheat, amounting approximately to £31,000,000 in the present year, and because of enforced falling off in our loan expenditure to an extent of approximately £20,000,000, there is in circulation this year £51,000,000 less than was in circulation last year, a condition of affairs which must have a serious effect on  employment. If the present Government had been returned to power in 1928, and had thus been in a position to bring down tariff proposals to give protection to Australian industries before the bottom fell out of the wool and wheat markets, there would have been a great revival in industry. Trying to grapple with the situation in a period of depression does not give the tariff proposals of the Government a fair trial. After all, unemployment is not peculiar to Australia; it is world-wide. Wu have read in the newspapers that there is almost an' unprecedented number of unemployed in the United States of America to-day. Germany has more unemployed than at any previous time since the war; England, and almost every other, country in the world, is in the throes of economic depression. Ours is not the only country that has taken drastic; steps to balance the ledger. It would have been easier to shirk tackling this problem, but the Government, after consultation with those who knew how the country was drifting, made up its mind to face the position resolutely. It came to the conclusion that this was the only way in which the existing national emergency could be met. This has nothing to do with the Government's fiscal policy. The Government took this step on its own responsibility, and it is for the Government to determine for how long these emergency measures are to be kept in operation. "We shall not shirk our duty in this matter. </para>

                    <para>. - I realize that honorable members are weary, and I do not propose to inflict a long speech upon them. I desire merely to record in a few sentences my concurrence with what has been said by the Leader and  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, to the effect that it is desirable that a time limit should be imposed upon the operation of these provisions. I still support that view in spite of what the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has just said. L do not think that he realizes that embargoes generally are the most drastic and dangerous weapon that can be employed. They are more likely to provoke retaliation than anything else that could bc done. If a time limit of six months, as has been suggested to-night, were adopted by the Government, so that at the end of that period the whole provision would automatically lapse and would, if necessary, have to be renewed, it would go a long way towards impressing on the minds, not only of the people of Australia, but of those elsewhere, that the Government was sincere in its statement that this was a temporary measure only to deal with an emergency. It would prevent the possibility of vested interests growing up under the extraordinary hothouse conditions which the 50 per cent, additional tariff creates. If these high duties and embargoes remain in force for longer than six months, certain vested interests will establish themselves, and it will be much more difficult to pull away the props than if a time limit of six months were definitely declared now. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs said that the House might not be in session in six months' time. That is probable, but it would not matter, because the Government acted by proclamation on this occasion and it could do so again. The imposition of a time limit would do something to minimize the possibility of retaliatory measures being resorted to by other countries. It was said by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> that he found it difficult to dissociate what had been done by the Government from the Government's general tariff policy. I assure the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs that there is a strong feeling in certain quarters that the Government did not require much persuasion to take this step, that its action was dictated rather by a desire to do this thing than by the necessity of doing it. </para>

                        <para>- I assure the Minister that such an impression does exist. There is a feeling that the Government is making use of the existing temporary exchange difficulty as an excuse for doing something which it wished to do, but which it. would not have dared to do except under the cloak of trade necessity. The Acting Minister accused the former Government of following a policy of drift. There are different ways of considering that matter. An Australian manufacturer, referring to the Government's action in bringing down this measure without placing a definite time limit on its operation, expressed his opinion in these words : " It was a gambler's last desperate throw to avoid facing the industrial position." He believed that the Government was following a policy of drift. The best answer which the Government can give to those who believe that it has acted rather in accordance with its expressed tariff policy than with any desire to correct the exchange position is to accede to the appeal made by the Leader and  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition for the imposition of a time limit of six months on the operation of this provision, after which it would lapse, and would have to be again renewed if that were though necessary. </para>

                <para>Mr.RIORDAN.- If it were, I can assure the honorable member that it would not be the army which he joined at Rothbury. The lad's mother, after watching the march-past in which her son took part, remarked that all the soldiers were out of step except him. It would seem that everybody is out of step in regard to this measure except the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett).</inline> He referred to the embargo on the importation of such articles as eggs, lemons, peanut butter, and canary seed, the value of which did not amount to anything worth considering. He said that if the Government would tackle this matter seriously, and place some really big items on the schedule, he would support it. If, as he suggests, the embargo on these articles is going to render so much assistance to local manufacturers, to how much greater an extent would they be assisted if the embargo were extended to the really important items? Several honorable members of the Opposition suggested that a time limit should be imposed upon the operation of the embargoes and of the higher duties imposed in this schedule. The Labour party has always stood for the protection of Australian industries, and for providing employment for our own people in our own country upon the manufacture of our own goods. What is responsible for the present unsatisfactory economic situation in Australia to-day? As a result of the decline in the exports of primary products such as wool, there was built up, during the time that the Leader and  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition were members of the last Government, an adverse trade balance amounting to £62,000,000 by the end of 1928. During its term of office the Bruce-Page Government was continually warned by influential Australian newspapers which had consistently supported its policy of the crisis which was approaching. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which has always been a strong supporter of the Nationalist party, advised it of the difficulties which it would have to face if drastic steps were not taken to check the drift. The members of the late Government, and those who supported it, remind me of the man who keeps on borrowing money to attend race meetings, and in the end finds himself " out." Since this Government has been returned, and has had an opportunity of giving effect to its policy of protecting Australian industries, a by-election has been held in Tasmania, and a seat which had always been held by a Nationalist candidate was won by a member of the Labour party. Last Saturday the South Australian elections were held, and although this Government has been in power since last October, and the people of Australia are fully conversant with its policy, the Liberal or National party in that State was practically annihilated. As a result of the Nationalist party's unsympathetic treatment of Australian industries nationalism is on the decline. During the long term when the Bruce-Page Government was in office, our financial and economic position steadily became worse. This Government is now making a determined attempt not only to adjust our adverse trade balance, but to make the conditions of the people better than they are to-day. Although the Nationalist party had the ball at its feet after 1916, it declined or was incapable of handling big national  problems. The Commonwealth is in a worse position now than it has ever been, but it is unfair to compare this sparsely populated and undeveloped territory with older countries. With the assistance of the Development and Migration Commission, and in other ways, the Bruce-Page Government increased the number of migrants coming to Australia, and as a result of its migration policy thousands of men have been compelled to walk the streets vainly in search of work. With winter approaching, the position will be serious, but it will not be so bad as it would have been had the Nationalist party been in power. Honorable members opposite, by declining to support Australian industries are largely responsible for the large army of unemployed that we have in our midst. They fostered a policy of bolstering up American industries, and of collecting revenue in various ways to construct and  maintain  main roads for the benefit of users of American motor cars. The importation of such luxuries should have been prohibited years ago. </para>

                    <para>- That is a question which the honorable member should place on the notice-paper. During the period the Bruce-Page Government was in office the value of importations of merchandise was as follows: - 1923-24, £132,000,000; 1924-25, £140,000,000: 1925-26, £157,000,000 and 1926-27 £164,000,000. Practically all of the goods represented by those figures could have been manufactured in Australia, and employment given to our own people. Honorable members opposite are, however, more concerned with the importation of goods from countries where cheap labour is employed and where workmen live under a standard of living inferior to our own. This policy has been pursued by the Nationalist party in an endeavour to bring about what they term a reduction in the cost of production, which really means the lowering of wages. One has only to read <inline font-style="italic">Smith's Weekly to</inline> realize the result of the Nationalist party's policy. If a census of the unemployed were taken to-day, it would be found that '95 per cent, of the men who are out of work are Britishers. I understand that during a period of four or five years no fewer than 20,000 foreigners were allowed to enter the Commonwealth without passing the necessary test. The customs revenue during 1922-23 was £17,000,000, but in 1928-29 it had increased to £31,000,000. If, during those years, when the Bruce-Page Government was  in  office, it had submitted an effective fiscal policy, the imports would have decreased instead of increased to the extent indicated. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> and honorable members with whom he is associated, have made an appeal on behalf of the unemployed; but they should realize that the policy which they have supported is responsible for the serious unemployed problem which now confronts us. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition also criticized the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs for saying that 50,000 men had been placed in- employment as a result of the Government's protective policy. That, he said, was merely political propaganda; but I remind the honorable member that he should approach these matters in a non-party spirit, as he advised us to do. If the Bruce-Page Government had been returned to power on the 12th October, there would be over 200,000 unemployed, instead of 120,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> on one occasion said that unemployment was not the concern of the National Government. I disagree with him. Both the States and the Commonwealth have a certain degree of responsibility in regard to the unemployed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> recognized that in 1925 and in 1928, when he appealed for the support of those who were unfortunate enough *o be unemployed. He then said: "If my Government is returned to power, it will bring down an unemployed workers' scheme." He made that plea in Queensland. The Queensland Labour Government, during its tenure of office, made an effort to provide for those who could not be absorbed in industry. Surely honorable members opposite will agree that human- labour is entitled to as much protection as animal labour! It is the only labour that will harvest crops, cut cane and shear sheep. This Government is making a -genuine effort to deal with the position, and that is recognized by every section of the community except members . of the Nationalist party. Prior to the 12th October last that party had had such a long tenure of office that it considered that it could not be removed. But the people of Australia at length became alive to the effects of its policy, and whenever it now appeals for support it is knocked over like ninepins. If the press of Australia supports this Government in its endeavour to relieve the unemployed position, some good will be accomplished. Nobody knows better than honorable members opposite that importers have large stocks of goods that it will take some time to quit. It would, therefore, be wrong of this Government to limit the time during which the prohibition shall last. If the result of the prohibition is to provide more work in our manufacturing industries, it should be continued indefinitely. Any person who is prepared to build factories and carry on manufacturing operations should be given the guarantee of protection so long as he charges a reasonable price to the consumer. Honorable members opposite allege that prices will rise. The price of the harvester on the Australian market is no greater than it- is in the Argentine. There will be competition among our own manufacturers, and that will have the effect of keeping down prices to a reasonable level. Whenever tariff schedules are to be discussed in this chamber we find the lobbyer/ or stool-pigeon, hanging round, endeavouring to obtain inside information. One  speaker  to-night expressed views identical with those that were voiced by an importer who came to Canberra by train last Tuesday.  He said : "I do not import a great deal. I give employment to wharf-labourers and carters. You will throw those men out of work." The men who are thrown out of work as the result of .this protection will be absorbed in the manufacture of the very goods the importation of which is. prohibited, and it is more than likely that their numbers will be augmented. I hope that the Government will pursue this policy despite the criticism of the friends of the importers, or any other criticism that may be levelled against it. If it puts into operation the policy outlined by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> on the 12th October last, it will have nothing to fear. </para>

                <para>When the proposal was first brought forward to impose a super tax on certain imports, and a prohibition with respect to others, I asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> whether any consideration had been given to the question of preference, and he replied, in <inline font-style="italic">effect, that</inline> this was not a fiscal matter, but merely an emergency measure to adjust the adverse trade balance. That reply was entirely unsatisfactory to me. </para>
                <para>I do not intend to-night to be captiously critical, but I shall put forward a scheme for the adjustment of the trade balance without the adoption of harsh measures. It must be admitted ' that this proposal of the Government is an experiment. It may be called courageous, or audacious, but it is difficult to say how it will react. To say that it is not a fiscal proposal is rather beside the point, because in its incidence it places a tax on certain goods that enter Australia, and a veritable prohibition of the importation of other goods. If these imports and prohibitions had been so arranged as to be equitable, as between debtor and creditor nations, and also respected empire reciprocity, they would have been more useful. </para>
                <para>Let me  first of all deal with the criticism of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">,(Mr. Gullett.)</inline> in regard to the fixing of a time limit. If the Government does not fix a time- limit the proposal may react very adversely against it. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has displayed a great deal of'- zeal in his defence of-' the action of the Government, and others <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> have spoken from the Government benches have shown a vehemence that I am sorry I cannot imitate. I point out, however, that a time limit is necessary, first from the manufacturers' point of view. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> wisely called a conference of agricultural implement makers, and obtained from them the promise of a reduction in price of 5 per cent., so that the primary producers would not suffer' by the imposition of the additional duty. But what is the position of those manufacturers? If they have no guarantee as to how long this impost will last, they will not be prepared to buy up-to-date machinery nor to make an effort to increase production and thus reduce costs. I have put it to certain manufacturers in that Ane whether they could not have made the reduction greater than 5 per cent. They have assured me, and I believe them, that competition is keen enough not to warrant any greater reduction, and that, as in the case with other businesses at the present time, they are hard pressed by the high cost of labour and overhead, and are thus unable to reduce prices to a greater extent. If there is no fixed period they will not install labour-saving machinery, or extend their works; consequently they will carry on as they are now doing and endeavour to obtain a larger production. The result will be that prices will not fall. </para>

                        <para>- There is another fact which this Government should consider. This is not a party matter. Every honorable member claims to speak in a non-party spirit, but usually any statement to that effect is not believed. But there are occasions when we must rise above party considerations.  Such an occasion arises when we are discussing industrial questions, any reference to which usually arouses honorable members opposite. That is particularly the case when the coal industry is mentioned. If the Government wishes to put its house in order, it must be courageous enough to settle the dispute in that industry. I had a passage with the last <inline font-weight="bold">speaker (Mr. Riordan)</inline> in regard to the Rothbury mine, where miners, whose only offence is their desire to work, are practically in a state of siege under police protection. I went to that field to investigate conditions there, and I commend such a course of action to honorable members who sit opposite so that they may ascertain for themselves what is going on. That I did some work there during my visit was merely incidental. It was for experience and not for gain. Honorable members opposite who think that I have never worked may be interested to learn that all my life I have worked as hard manually as any of them. I have been in industry for 25 years, both manufacturing and importing. I hope that hereafter honorable members will cease their gibes about Rothbury. In my speech in the House on the coal question I purposely made no reference to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> or other representatives of coal-mining districts, chiefly because of the honorable member's then absence from the chamber, and because I realized the embarrassing position in which he found himself. Yet he saw fit to attack me on his return. I have quoted definite figures to show the wages paid to miners and the difficulties under which the coal-mining industry is operating. These, I submit, are an effective reply to their utterances. The effect of the high price of coal on the agricultural implement trade will be realized when we reflect that it takes two tons of coal to make one ton of steel. It is a disgrace to Australia that coal can be brought here from other countries more cheaply than it can be hewn here. Steel which could be imported for £6 a ton costs £13 a ton to manufacture in Australia. Honorable members will realize from these figures how the primary producer is being hit by the industrial turmoil on the coal-fields. These difficulties and charges react, on both manufacturers and primary producers. A time limit is essential; without it there will be greater unemployment, because manufacturers will not know where they stand, and will be afraid to launch out in bigger undertakings. On the other hand, the fixing of a time limit will assist to establish new industries on a sound footing. It will enable them to do what the motor body building and confectionery industries have done. When the embargo is removed they will be able to hold their own. It is true that there will be a 5 per cent, reduction in the cost of agricultural implements under the new imposts; but that reduction may be offset by higher shipping rates. If our imports are less, the ships trading with Australia will carry smaller cargoes. The result will probably be that in order to maintain their businesses, shippers will be compelled to charge higher rates on exports from Australia, in which case the primary producers will be hit again. Australia is in desperate straits, and something must. be done if we are to avoid a financial crash. At the moment the essential consideration is how shall we get more money on the other side of the world. We shall not get it by prohibiting imports. I do not say that a restriction of imports is inherently wrong. We shall probably have to wait until our harvest of wheat and wool is exported at, we hope, favorable prices, before our financial position will improve to any extent. Australia supplies only about one-third of the world's wool, and is only fifth in the list of wheat-producing nations. Had the Government in imposing restrictions discriminated between creditors and debtors, and encouraged inter-Empire trade, it would have done something to bring about financial stability and at the same time stimulate Empire trade. </para>

                <para>Let us look at the trade figures of the countries with which we trade. We should not antagonize the nations which buy from us. Australia is only a very small part of the civilized world and is unable to stand on her own feet. In 1928-29, Australia exported to France goods to the value of £15,141,155, and purchased from that country goods valued at £3,700,303. The respective figures relating to our trade with Italy were £5,169,404 and £1,449,629. We sold in that year to the United Kingdom goods valued at £55,172,552, and purchased in return, goods valued at £57,028,238. The figures for the previous year were respectively £54,279,714 and £63,098,037. It will be seen, therefore, that the big adverse trade balance which has been built up is not connected with those countries. Let us now turn to our trade with the United States of America. In 1927-28 we imported from that country goods valued at £35,005,736, and exported to it goods valued at £8,954,823. In the following year the imports and exports were respectively £35,308,345 and £5,831,794. Honorable members will see that our large adverse trade balance is largely due to the great disparity between our imports from and exports to the United States of America. That is the country against which .we should be justified in discriminating. </para>
                <para>Not every person in Australia realizes the extent to which Great Britain purchases our products. The Empire Marketing Board has estimated that Great Britain annually consumes agricultural products to the value of £426,000,000.  Her  imports of grain and flour each year are valued at £98,000,000, while the figures in respect of meat, wool, and hides and skins are respectively, £109,000,000, £64,000,000, and £26,000,000. In 1928 Britain bought 52,787,000 cwt. of wheat from other parts of the Empire, and 51,000,000 cwt. from foreign countries. Australia supplied only 10,233,000 cwt. of that wheat. Britain buys annually about 672,000,000 lb. of butter, of which in normal years Australia supplies about one-eighth. Importations of cheese into Britain total 336,000,000 lb. per annum, Australia's  proportion being about 7,000,000 lb. Those figures show how wide a field still exists in Britain. If we believe in Empire trade - as we must if we are wise - we should work, not to offend Great Britain, but to make her a better customer than she is now. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch),</inline> who I regret is not now in the chamber, appears to suffer from some  inferiority complex whenever he thinks of Englishmen. He said that ah Arab in Bagdad told him that no nation was ever given its independence - that independence had always to be taken. I also had an introduction to Arabs at Bagdad, but I was a prisoner of war, and was spat upon and beaten by the mob. The British Empire lost about 90,000 lives in wresting Mesopotamia from the Turks, and in accordance with its traditional generosity and fairness when  dealing with subject-nations, has installed an Arab as King of Irak - formerly Mesopotamia - is allowing the Arabs to work out their own destiny under the mandate, and no doubt ultimately will give to them complete autonomy. I was pained to hear an honorable member, who was once an officer in the Australian Defence Force, and wore the King's uniform, deplore the fact that Australia is still within the Empire. One of the aims sought to be advanced at every imperial conference is Empire unity. To that end Empire trade is necessary, and the sentiments of the Government will be suspect if it does not continue the preference to British goods in its tariff policy. </para>

                        <para>- It is almost our only market though, incidentally I may say, we are Britain's second best customer. We cannot afford to affront our best customer. Moreover, Australia's little navy is inadequate for the defence of our coast and trade, and our very existence as a nation is dependent on the protection afforded by the British Navy. In time of trouble we can look to the Mother Country for help. But, if we antagonize our kindred overseas by prohibitive tariffs, whilst giving favorable treatment to foreign nations, whose only interest in Australia is to sell us goods, we cannot expect a continuance of the good will and protection of the British people. In this regard I am struck with the fact that American films are not on the list of new imposts. That also makes the policy of the Government suspect, because the fact is well known that the Labour party was substantially supported by the American picture interests during the last election campaign. </para>

                <para>The criticisms by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett ) are absolutely warranted. If the Government had been fair and brought forward these prohibitions as a tariff measure, it would have received some assistance and support from the Opposition. I am proud to be a protectionist, and look forward to the day when Australia will be self-contained. I see no great hardship in being deprived of certain foodstuffs from overseas. It is an anomaly that sauces and other edibles, which could be readily made in Australia, should be imported in large quantities. But when the Government pretends that the prohibition is proclaimed only as an emergency measure to rectify the trade balance, it is suspect and deserves all the criticism that is offered. This Government is destroying Empire trade, as it destroyed the compulsory defence system, on the grounds of financial stringency, whereas it is spending more money and getting, as I predicted, only an inadequate defence force, in spite of the efforts of those of us who are in it to make it a success. Preferential duties are vital to our industrial existence, and to the continuance of the Empire, which, however, is not popular in some quarters, because it is an obstacle to the designs of revolutionaries. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Fenton)</inline> has been endeavouring to extend the marketing of Australian goods in the United Kingdom, and Australians travelling abroad will be able to further his efforts. It is not too late for the Government to reconsider its policy. Off-hand, I would suggest a graduated surtax of 10 per cent, on British goods; perhaps 20 per cent, on imports from big customer countries like France; and higher rates on goods from the United States of America. I propose this discrimination in no aggressive spirit. I have lived in the United States of America and admire its people, but when we are buying from a nation £30,000,000 worth of goods more than it buys from us, steps to adjust the balance are a business necessity. I am sorry that the Government has not been more frank in regard to its tariff policy. </para>

                        <para>- That is beside the question. I have already pointed out that last year Great Britain bought heavily from us. It is futile for the Prime Minister to ask the farmers to grow more wheat if we- cannot get customers for it, which may be the case if there are reprisals. If the latest schedule were not masquerading as an emergency measure necessitated by the adverse trade balance, but had been brought before us as a tariff policy that we could have discussed on its merits, with a view to the wise rationing of imports, it would have received from the Opposition some measure of support. Honorable members opposite, as well as those on this side, profess admiration- for the late Honorable Alfred Deakin and frequently quote from his speeches. I do so with diffidence but in the press of to-day is a quotation that is particularly apposite. Referring to an item of duty that was preposterously high, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said that " its effect was to pull down the flag of protection and hoist the black flag of prohibition." The Federal Government has hoisted the black flag of prohibition and perhaps the red flag is flying beside it. I deplore its attitude and join with my  colleagues and members of the Country party in condemning the Government for introducing this policy under false pretences. I do not offer this criticism in any party spirit, and I hope that the Government will consider the suggestions I have made for the sake of Empire unity, the defence of Australia, and the safety of our people in time of crisis. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government's honoring of the promise given by the Prime Minister to allow members of the Opposition an opportunity to debate the emergency tariff proposals has not been very gratefully received. The speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> was nothing but words, words, words. If he had any desire to assist the country in its time of trouble he did not give evidence of it to-night; for his speech did not contain one constructive suggestion. When he was asked what he would do to solve the problem confronting the Government he replied that that was a matter for the party in power. The honorable member was Minister for Trade and Customs in the last government, and is no doubt the chief exponent of the tariff policy of the Opposition. One would have thought that he would have endeavoured to assist the Government and the country with his knowledge and experience. AH he did was to seek to obstruct the Government's policy. I am satisfied with what the Government is doing. </para>

                        <para>- That is an unjustifiable interjection. The honorable member knows that I am much concerned about the unemployment that prevails. The Government is earnestly endeavouring to solve the unemployment problem and its tariff policy <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> evidence of that. I welcome these proposals and am glad that the increased protection of our industries has already enabled them to give more employment. I believe that as time goes on and this tariff is given an opportunity we shall be able to employ many more thousands of people in Australia. That is the idea that prompted the action of the Government. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> is very displeased that the Government has made good in handling the affairs of this country. I regret his attitude. The people of Australia looked to the honorable member, who previously occupied the high and dignified position of Minister for Trade and Customs, at least to give a helping hand in these troublous times. The manufacturers and exporters of Australia have assured this Government of their support. They believe that it is out to save Australia. I am sure that it will do so. I am confident that it is working along the right lines, and that its efforts will meet with success after success. I am concerned about the primary producer, of whom we hear so much, but I believe that side by side with the development of our wool, wheat, wine, fruit, dried fruit and other industries, we should encourage our secondary industries. I think that that will be done by this Government. </para>

I remind him that this Government is doing a tremendous lot to encourage Empire trade. My view is that we should first look after our own affairs and then do all that we possibly can to foster trade within the Empire. That will be effected through the medium of our tariff schedules and the protective policy of this Government. The honorable member for Henty claimed that the new tariff will build up monopolies. I shall certainly do my best to prevent that occurring. It is my opinion that the employers will be loyal to the Government and to the people of Australia. However, if they fail the people by increasing prices I shall be prepared to give my support to the introduction of legislation to deal with them. </para>

                    <para>.- I notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> today under the heading of " Gold Bonus and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier's</inline> Intention" that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> is reported to have said, " My Government has definitely decided that there is no better means of providing work and absorbing unemployment than by granting a gold bonus." The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green),</inline> speaking at Merriden, is said to have stated he had received a promise from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> that if the Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> made representations to him that that State was suffering many disabilities through the decline of gold-mining the Federal Government would favorably consider making a grant to that State. As the State elections are to be held on Saturday, and as that statement savours very much of election propaganda, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the request made continuously for the last eighteen months or two years for assistance to the gold-mining industry, which in the past has felt the effect of the high tariff policy pf the Government, and will in the future feel the effect much more keenly, he has now made up his mind to give some special assistance to this industry. </para>

                    <para>.- The remarks of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> remind me that there is another matter of interest to honorable members and to the community generally arising out of a number of statements made from time to time by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green).</inline> I am sorry to have to mention this in his absence, but I shall give three examples. As honorable members are aware, towards the end of last year, shortly after the elections, the Minister for Defence said that no change would be made in the system of compulsory military training for at least a period of about six months. That was accepted as a statement by a responsible Minister on behalf of the Government, because it has been the practice to regard statements made by any Minister in relation to his department as made on behalf of the Government. Events showed that the statement was inaccurate. Early this year the Minister for Defence was in Adelaide. He gave an interview to the press, and later stated in this House that he had been correctly reported. He said in that interview that the Jervis Bay Naval College would definitely be closed at a very early date. When an inquiry was made in this House we were informed that the matter was under consideration and that the Government was considering the possibility of amalgamating the Duntroon and Jervis Bay Colleges. The definite statement of the Minister for Defence was apparently not in accordance with the policy of the Government. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has given a third example of a similar statement. I ask the Prime Minister when replying to the honorable member for Swan to indicate whether he regards the general principles of responsible government, which have hitherto been applied by Ministers of all party complexions, as applying in the case of this Ministry. It will be remembered that the Minister for Defence said the other day in Perth, and this is a fourth example, that he had put up a fight against the rest of the Cabinet but had been defeated in connexion with, some important matters relating to Western Australia. </para>

That was the position at that time when we were exploring avenues of economy and the statement of the Minister was consistent with the Government's policy then and now. The Government was not prepared to continue both the Jervis Bay and the Duntroon institutions. I shall be glad to hear if  the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to justify the extravagant expenditure at those two colleges. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman made no attempt to reduce the cost of those colleges when he had the power to do so, and because this Government is facing its responsibilities and endeavouring to keep down costs, the Opposition is becoming exceedingly perturbed. Our first method of approach was to consider whether the Jervis Bay College could be closed, and the trainees removed to Duntroon. The officers of the department considered' the problem from that angle. When the statement to which the Leader of the Opposition has directed attention was made by the Minister for Defence the investigation was proceeding along those lines. Then we had to consider what we should do with the Jervis Bay College. Before coining to a decision we visited Jervis Bay, and realized that there was a difficulty in the way, since the Government property there was more valuable than at Duntroon. As a result departmental officers were asked to consider the amalgamation of the two colleges, not at Duntroon as was at first suggested, but at Jervis Bay. It will be seen that our policy was the same, but there was a change in regard to the proposed location of the amalgamated college which was to serve the dual purpose. </para>

                <para>I do not wish to detain the House, but I should like to reply briefly to the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> who urged the payment of a bonus on the production of gold. The Government has not favorably considered that proposal. We have not disguised that fact. Neither did our predecessors in office. But we have been impressed with the case that has been made out for the stimulation of the gold-mining industry. If this can be done, it will be of great advantage to Australia at the present time. The payment of a bonus ' merely to ensure extra profits to established mining companies, however, would ii ot stimulate gold production. We should prefer to grant financial assistance for the carrying out of experiments in regard to cheaper methods for treating those large deposits of low-grade ore which are known to exist in all the States. Some months ago it was proposed that the Government should assist in the development of the proposition of the Wiluna ' Gold Mines Limited in Western Australia. On that subject we have received advice from experts of the Government of Western Australia. It was represented to us that the Wiluna proposition was the, most promising experiment that had yet been made in the treatment of low-grade ores, and I understand that if what has been claimed for it can bc substantiated, it will revolutionize gold-mining in Western Australia as well as stimulate the industry in other States, where considerable bodies of low-grade ore are awaiting treatment. I mention this to  indicate that the Government is not merely talking about these things. I understand that the Wiluna Company has already expended about £30,000 on its plant, but that in the absence of guarantees it was experiencing difficulty in increasing its capital. Wc have been in touch with the Government of Western Australia on this subject for some time. If that Government is satisfied after investigation that it can guarantee a loan of £300,000 proposed to be raised by the company in question, then, as the Treasurer has already said, we are prepared to shoulder our share of the responsibility by standing behind that Government in respect of the guarantee. We believe that this policy will be of substantial help to the industry. In this matter we are working through the State Government rather than by direct negotiation, because we have not at our disposal the necessary facilities to conduct investigations into mining propositions. I believe Western Australia has a special claim for consideration. Gold production in that State is greater than elsewhere in the Commonwealth, and Western Australia has not benefited by the national policy of protection to the same extent as the eastern States, particularly New South Wales and Victoria.  To some extent protection has been detrimental to Western Australia. This fact would not justify the scrapping of protection, but it would justify the Commonwealth in giving special consideration to industries indigenous to a State which has not benefited from protection to the same extent as others. And so the Minister was told that wc were hot prepared as a Government to provide a gold bonus, but we were prepared to consider the giving of every assistance to the Government of Western Australia in developing the raining industry if it could be shown that the State Government .required that assistance. We have already shown our earnestness by our agreement concerning the Wiluna proposition. When that decision was made we had no thought of State elections, and the suggestion now made with the object of discrediting the Minister for Defence is unworthy of the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
