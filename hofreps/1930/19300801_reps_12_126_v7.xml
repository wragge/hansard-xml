                    <quote>
                        <para>The Association strongly dissents from the viewpoint expressed by the Postmaster-General regarding the necessity for secrecy in respect of its system of tenders. This policy of secrecy which was initiated by the Director of Postal Services constitutes a violation of the spirit and intention of the Common wealth law cited above. It places Australian industries at a great disadvantage and prevents local tenderers from ascertaining the details of the successful tender. It provides no method of checking the bona fides of officers who have at their disposal the placing of millions of pounds worth of contracts in the public interest. </para>

                                <para>- I genuinely regret that the Government was unable to get the bills out sooner, so that they might have been distributed throughout Australia before the tax began to operate. But, as I explained when introducing the bill, the Government has budgeted for a 10 months' collection of the sales tax during the present year, and any postponement of the date of operation of the tax would seriously affect the budgetary position. A postponement of the tax for only one month would involve the loss of ¬£500,000. The difficulties are not so real as honorable members may be led to believe by the sheaves of telegrams that they are receiving. They are not anything' so great as when a big tariff schedule is suddenly laid on the table. The business people will find that they will not experience as much difficulty through the operation of the tax as they imagine. It applies to wholesale transactions only, and if there is a doubt about an item, it can be invoiced subject to a later charge in respect of the tax. There can be very little doubt as to the list of exempt items, as lists of exemptions have been telegraphed to every part of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have not yet had time to read the criticism of the Premier of Queensland, The honorable member forLilley, however, has not accurately described the position. Last Saturday a deputation  representative of sugar interests, accompanied by honorable members from both sides of the House, waited upon me. The minutes of that deputation show that, after its members had placed their case before me, I discussed with them two alternative proposals. One suggestion was that, if an inquiry into the industry was to be made, the agreement should be extended for one year. I laid it down that the Government could not decide without an investigation whether the agreement should be extended. It was urged that there should be an early decision, be- cause financial arrangements had to be made for the planting of the following season's crop. We discussed the question whether an inquiry could be completed in time toen able a decision to be made before the expiry of the agreement, or whether it would not be advisable to extend the agreement for twelve months. I stated definitely that no decision could be made until the matter had been considered by Cabinet; an extension of the agreement was therefore not promised. It is true that finally the discussion centred upon an extension of the agreement for twelve months, and the possibility of the inquiry being commenced early next year; but there was neither a definite promise nor a definite decision. I took the whole of the results to Cabinet, which examined the matter thoroughly. In the period that intervened between my reception of the deputation on Saturday and the meeting of Cabinet on Tuesday, I received from numerous sources a request that others interested in the sugar industry should be given an opportunity to present their views before any extension of the agreement was made. No matter what views honorable members may hold, they must be impressed by the reasonableness of that request. Consequently, the Government decided to proceed immediately with the inquiry, and not to extend the agreementeither temporarily or permanently until the investigation had been made. The present embargo expires on the 31st August, 1931. When the agreement was made on the last occasion in 1925, no extension of the previous agreement was granted until December, 1924. It will thus be seen that there is ample time for the report to be considered before the expiry of the present agreement, and for an agreement to be made at a date as far removed from that event as on the last occasion. That is the view which is held by Cabinet. Moreover, it was pointed out to me by the sugar interests that the present is the best time to conduct an inquiry into the industry, because all the mills will be working. I assure the House that there will be no delay. A temporary extension of the agreement would carry the embargo to August, 1932, without inquiry. The Government feels that an inquiry should precede any extension, either temporary or permanent. </para>

                            <para>- I have been guided by those who have had very considerable experience of the industry. Having consulted with an officer of the Department of Trade and Customs whose experience has been lengthy, and with other persons, I have come to the conclusion that two months will prove to be adequate. It will not, I think, be necessary for the corn mittee to travel over the whole continent. Of course, it will visit States other than Queensland; and provision is being made for it to do so. Because Sydney, Melbourne, and perhaps Adelaide are visited, it does not necessarily follow that Hobart and Perth also should be included in the itinerary. </para>

Further, is he aware that all the essential points made by that deputation were already in writing and in possession of those who waited upon the Minister, and were handed to officers of the department who were present? </para>

                <para>The amendment made by the Senate follows upon a suggestion made by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> when the bill was in committee. It was felt unwise to accept his suggestion without thoroughly going into the matter, because while it might appear to remedy a position in one direction it might also create complications in another. I have been informed since that this particular matter has been under discussion on former occasions, and the difficulty seems to be that the Superannuation Board has one definition for this class of contributor and the Military Board another. However, the whole question has again been investigated, and after a consultation with Air Commodore Williams and the  President  of the Board, it was agreed that the use of the word " officer " would be quite satisfactory and would meet the situation. It has been incorporated in the bill. I hope that this meets with the approval of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White).</inline></para>

Section 50 of the principal act prescribes the action of the board following the restoration to health of an invalidity pensioner. As section 49, which concerns medical examination, will in future apply to the members of the military and air forces, it is considered that section 50 should similarly apply. I move - </para>

                        <para>- The Imperial Conference of 1926 was marked by the full recognition of the attainment of complete self-governing status by the Dominions of the British Empire or, as they have frequently been called since that conference, the nations which, are members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The conference of 1926 met after a period during which there had been a great and rapid development of dominion autonomy. Imperial conferences since 1907 had been characterized by an increasing degree of consultation between the Government, of Great Britain and the governments of the various parts of the Empire. It is not necessary now to trace the stages of that development, or to indicate the steps, all in the same direction, which were taken from time to time. During the war, the representatives of the dominions were admitted to the fullest consultation with the authorities in Great Britain, and every effort was made to ensure for them a real participation in the determination of the policy which was pursued by the. empire throughout the war. During the war, what has been described as the Imperial War Cabinet was formed. It consisted of the Prime Minister of Great Britain and one or two other British Ministers, and every Prime Minister of a dominion and some other dominion Ministers who were in Great Britain. The Imperial War Cabinet was, however, a consultative body, although it is described sometimes as having been an executive body. In truth and in fact, although the Imperial War Cabinet discussed, and in a sense determined most important matters of policy, all executive action taken in pursuance of the decisions arrived at had to be taken by the governments concerned. The Imperial War Cabinet as such was unable to take, or directly and of itself determine, executive action. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>At the Peace Conference a further stage in the development of self-government was reached. The dominions were admitted to that conference upon an equality with all the powers there represented. They had separate status, were separately represented, and were able to act independently of the rest of the Empire if they so desired. The machinery of the British Empire Delegation provided the means of arriving at a. common policy. Speaking generally, the Empire as a whole maintained a common policy in relation to the matters which had to be determined by the Peace Conference. </para>
                    <para>These changes in practice naturally induced a demand for a redefinition of the  constitutional relations between the various parts of .the Empire. In 1917, and again in 1921, the question of a precise consideration of the constitutional relations of the various parts of the Empire was raised. It was determined, however^ in 1917, that it was undesirable in the midst of a world war to endeavour to enter upon the consideration of this question. The matter was again postponed in 1921. Thereafter, the relations between Great Britain and Ireland which, unfortunately, had been very troubled for many years, became intensely acute. In 1922, however; a settlement of those difficulties was reached, and the Irish Free State was constituted by an Act of the British Parliament. In that Act, the Irish Free State was described as " a co-equal member of the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations." The implications of that declaration, made as it was, in a statute of the British Parliament, were, and are, very important. It will be observed that the Irish Free State is described as a coequal member of the community of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations. That description is evidently founded upon, and indeed declares the principle that all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations are equal with one another - that each dominion is the equal of every other dominion as well as the equal of Great Britain. The step taken in the act constituting the Irish Free State was regarded as very significant in other parts of the empire, as indeed it was. But little attention was paid to it, from the constitutional point of view, in Australia and New Zealand. The people in those dominions have been little concerned with constitutional problems as affecting the relations of the different parts of the empire. In Australia and New Zealand there is no inferiority complex, no suspicion or feeling that, from the constitutional point of view, they are not sufficiently independent. </para>
                    <para>I agree with the statement of the right honorable W. M. Hughes who, when Prime Minister of Australia in 1917 and 1921, said that a written constitution for the British Empire would be a very dangerous thing in- deed. It is necessary, however, to consider the point, of view of other parts of the empire. Immediately before the Imperial Conference of 1926, there had been an election in&lt; Canada in which the subject of the constitutional powers of the Governor-General became an acute question. The people of Canada desired a definition of the true position of their Governor-General. It had been declared in the act constituting the Irish Free State that the position of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, and, indeed the relations of that State to Great Britain, were the same as in the case of Canada. Accordingly, both Canada and the Irish Free State desired to know exactly what those relations were. In South Africa, in 1926 and the immediately preceding years, there had been strong differences of opinion as to the rights of South Africa and its position in the British Empire. When the Imperial Conference met in October, 1927, I was present as a representative of Australia. I well remember the declaration made by General Hertzog in these words - </para>

                        <para>I think it will be generally admitted that the corner stone of the empire is the will, the good-will, of those who compose it. Without that will the empire must collapse. If the empire is to be maintained, if it is to nourish and fulfil that great task which we all hope it will achieve in the history of the world, we mast see that the will to live in the empire, iis a Commonwealth of free nations, will in future, as it is to-day, be present and active with every one of its constituent elements. Whether at present all the conditions are there to ensure the permanency of that will, and therefore of the empire, is a question which I think we should inquire into at this Conference. Speaking merely for South Africa, I think they are not. South Africa is anxious to possess that will equally with every other member of the Commonwealth; but that will can be assured for the future only if she can he made to feel implicit faith in her full and free nationhood upon the basis of equality with every other member of the Commonwealth. That implicit faith she does not possess to-day; but she will possess it the moment her independent national status has ceased to be a matter in dispute and has become internationally recognized. </para>

                    <para class="block">The conference began with that rather unpromising declaration of General Hertzog that, as things were, South Africa was not satisfied that the basis upon which alone the empire could continue to exist was a real thing so far as that dominion was concerned. The result was  that in 1926 the constitutional relations, described as the inter-imperial relations, of the various parts of the British Empire, were fully discussed, and a conclusion reached. All the dominions and Great Britain expressed themselves as being perfectly satisfied with the description of those relations which was given in the report of the conference. When General Hertzog returned to South Africa after the conference, he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Et will be observed that the Dominions are described as autonomous communities, in no way subordinate one to another in any respect in regard to their domestic or external powers. On what does the autonomy of the Dominions really depend? It depends upon the continuance of a strong. British Empire. I agree that the foundation of the British Empire is to be found in the freedom, equality and co-operation of its members. But the unity and strength of the Empire are the conditions of our freedom and of the possibility of continuous co-operation. Within the Empire each dominion has equality of protection and equality of rights. Equality of responsibility is, however, as important, and in many circumstances, even more important, than equality of rights. Australia does not wish to exercise her rights in any other way than in co-operation with the sisterdominions of the Empire. We, in Australia, recognize that there is no longer any interference in our affairs from Downing-street. There is no longer " a certain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Rogers</inline> " to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higinbotham, when a Minister of the Crown in Victoria, referred in a celebrated controversy in that State. In practice we, in Australia, have all the freedom that we can possibly desire. 1 think that I speak for all members of this' House and of every party, when I say that we, as Australians, have no grievances against Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>It was felt, however, that the general declarations of the conference to which <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have referred - couched as they were in political terminology - ought to be expressed in legal phraseology. It was stated in the report that it was the right of each government to advise the Crown in all matters relating to its own legislation, and that legislation by the British Parliament should apply to the dominions only .with their consent. The committee whose report is now before this Parliament, or as it has come to be called " the conference on the operation of dominion legislation and merchant shipping legislation, 1929," seeks to work out the legal results of the political conclusions reached at the conference of 1926. This report is the product of lawyers. They are good lawyers who did their work well; but in this sphere the statesman is much more important than the lawyer. A lawyer likes to make a complete system - to tie all things together neatly ; to make everything fit. But in statesmanship, as Bacon said of divinity, "many things must be left abrupt ". It is impossible to have a smoothly finished off and complete system. I am content with a system that works successfully - a system that does not in practice, whatever it may do in theory, infringe our rights of self-government, but allows us the fullest opportunity for determining our national policy having due regard to our responsibilities.  [ would rather leave some things unfinished and undetermined than make a completely rigid system of constitutional theory which might break under a strain that would have little or no effect on a more flexible or elastic, though less well defined, constitutional understanding. I prefer fluid conventions, the interpretation and application of which are left to statesmen, to legal formulae to be applied by judges. I have gone so far as to express my views on this subject in a small book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Australia and the British Commonwealth</inline> which I brought out last year. At the conference of &gt;926, I saw the risk of allowing lawyers to have free rein in matters of statesmanship. I agree with General Smuts, a lawyer himself, that it is not desirable to allow the Empire to get into the hands of lawyers who insist upon expressing political relations in legal formulae. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the specific matters with which this highly skilled committee dealt. Et must not be thought that I in any manner deprecate the work of the committee. I appreciate its value and the degree of success which it has achieved in dealing with a difficult problem. I urge, however, that it is unnecessary and unwise to express in legal terminology all of the political conclusions of the conference. The first subject with which the report of the conference on the operation of dominion legislation dealt was that of the disallowance of dominion legislation. The power of the King to disallow has never been exercised in relation to Commonwealth legislation. Section 59 of our Constitution provides - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That section specifics, controls and limits the power of disallowance in respect of Commonwealth legislation, but it has never been exercised. It is entirely our own business whether we retain this section in our Constitution. If we think that the power of disallowance should be abolished, it is within our power to abolish it by amending the Federal Constitution. This is indeed indicated in the report of the com- </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The next subject with which the committee dealt was that of the reservation of dominion legislation for the King's assent. There are, in the Constitution, provisions dealing with this subject - sections 58, 60 and 74. Section 58 reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">Section 71 relates to appeal to  His  Majesty in Council. There are also provisions in the Merchant. Shipping Act, sections 735 and 736, which require reservation for the King's assent of certain dominion legislation dealing with merchant shipping. As to the constitutional provisions, I repeat what I have said on the subject of disallowance. If we desire to alter the power of the Governor-General or of  His  Majesty the King with regard to the reservation of any Commonwealth legislation,  avc  arc able to make an alteration by action taken in Australia. That is our own affair, and it is unnecessary for us to act jointly with any other dominion or to invite any intervention by the British Parliament. In the case of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1 suggest that the position is different, and that the provisions in that act should be altered. I propose to refer briefly to that act later in my speech, and shall say nothing further about it at present. </para>
                    <para>The next subject dealt with in the report of the conference is that of the extra-territorial operation of dominion legislation. The legal position as to the power of a dominion parliament to give its legislation extra-territorial operation is, in my opinion, obscure, though it has often been said to be " certain. It is generally stated that the power of the colonial legislature is limited to the territory of the colony. The meaning appears to be that legislation which purports to control persons outside the colony, or to punish persons inside the colony in respect of things done outside, is invalid. It seems to me that the decisions of the court are by no means clear on this subject, and that our own High Court has made pronouncements which may bc a source of difficulty in determining the limits of the legislative powers of this Parliament. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Commissioners of Stamps, Queensland</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Weinholt.</inline> No. 20, <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> page 540, the High Court held- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Unless, therefore, either by express words or necessary implication, the Stamp Acts are shown to violate the principle of territoriality, they must be construed as limited in their operation to the State of Queensland, and, consequently, not to select as the subject of taxation any person, thing, or circumstance not within the territory. </para>
                        <para class="block">That statement suggests that in the case of legislation upon taxation, it would be beyond the power of a colonial legislature - to use the general phrase that is, as a rule,, used in discussions of this matter - to select as the subject of taxation any person, thing, or circumstance not within the territory. In a sense, that is obviously true, but if the statement is to be interpreted as meaning that taxation to be imposed upon persons who are amenable to the jurisdiction is not to be measured by things . or circumstances outside the territory, then, with all respect, I conceive that that is not an accurate state.ment of the law. In a later case - <inline font-style="italic">The Federal Commissioner of Taxation</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Munro</inline> -  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke dealt with the subject of the extraterritorial operation of dominion legislation in relation to taxation, and referred in particular to the well-known case of <inline font-style="italic">Macleod</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Attorney-General.</inline> His Honour said - </para>
                        <para>Such  cases  as <inline font-style="italic">Macleod</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Attorney-General</inline> show, however, that a proper interpretation of the act would limit the receipts within its scope to receipts within the competence of the legislature, 'namely, to those earned or derived in Australia. </para>
                        <para>There is a statement by a learned justice of the High Court that the Australian legislature - the Commonwealth Parliament - is able to impose income tax only in respect of receipts earned or derived i u Australia.' </para>
                        <para>During last week this House discussed and agreed to an amendment of our Income Tax Assessment Act designed to tax receipts earned or derived from sources outside Australia. My view as a lawyer is that this Parliament has power to tax such receipts, and I have given reasons in the book to which I have already referred for holding that view, and have quoted both the British and Australian supporting authorities in a footnote to the page on which I deal with this subject. </para>
                        <para>There are certain limits upon our power to pass extra-territorial legislation. The well-known case of <inline font-style="italic">Kingston</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Gadd</inline> decided very early in the history of the Commonwealth, indicates the nature of these limits. That case arose through the desire to tax ships' stores consumed in Australian waters. It was recognized that it was beyond the power of the Commonwealth to make it an offence to break, on the high seas, seals set upon taxable stores, but the difficulty was met by making it an offence to enter port with the seals broken. The desired result was, therefore, achieved by an indirect method. It seems to me that the declaration that dominion and colonial parliaments cannot make laws having extra-territorial effect is involved in a considerable degree of uncertainty and obscurity. The real test of legislative power should be, " Is the law in question one for the peace, order, and good government of the dominion concerned?" Legislation by the Commonwealth Parliament purporting to control the conduct of people in South America could not be regarded as legislation for the peace, order, and good government of Australia. But if the law fairly falls within the description which I have suggested, my submission is that it is within the power of the dominion legislature to make it. The recommendation of the expert committee on this subject is to be found on  page 11 of its report. It reads as follows : - </para>
                        <para>After careful consideration of possible alternatives, we recommend that the clause should be in the following form: - "It is hereby declared and deducted that the Parliament of a dominion has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation." </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">With all due respect to the committee, it appears to me that that phrase is vague, and by no means unambiguous. It is certainly not desirable that all the Parliaments of the Empire should have the power of extra-territorial legislation in the sense in which the British Parliament possesses and exercises such power. </para>

                            <para>- The British  Parlia-ment  has power to legislate for British subjects in all parts of the world ; but I suggest that it is most undesirable that the South African Parliament, let us say, should have power to legislate for Australians in all parts of the world because they are British subjects. A similar remark would apply to other dominions. It appears to me to be impossible to confer on all the parliaments of the Empire the power to make laws having extraterritorial operation such as the British Parliament at present enjoys. If we had a clear category of dominion citizenship, such as possibly may be developed in the future, it would be possible to provide that each parliament should have full power to pass extra-territorial legislation so far as the subjects of its own dominions were concerned. But the phrase in the report, to which I have referred, is, in my opinion, vague and unsatisfactory.

The final opinion was that such an express provision was superfluous. The purpose of the main clause was notorious, and would secure its primary effect- that the " extra-territorial " laws of a dominion would be valid in its own courts. As to their enforcement elsewhere, the general character ot the proposed act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom was to establish and protect the legislative independence of a dominion, and that would be shown by the express provisions giving power to repeal </para>

I, therefore, suggest that the necessities of the case would be met by a provision which would avoid the ambiguities of this phrase, to the effect that no law passed by the parliament of a self-governing dominion should be held to be invalid for the reason that it attached legal consequences, civil or criminal, within the dominions to acts or omissions outside the territory of the dominion. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that it is unnecessary, and indeed impossible, to put the dominion legislatures in the same position as the British legislature in this regard, and that it would be unwise to endeavour to do so. I will mention one case only to indicate why I hold that opinion: Take the legislation dealing with offences on the high seas. It is fundamentally important that so far as British subjects are concerned, there should be no uncertainty with respect to it. I consider that it would be much more convenient if only one legislature had power to pass such legislation. If all the dominions had the same power in this respect, and exercised it, there would be serious risk of confusion, and consequent injustice. In other words, I am not prepared to ride the idea of equality of status to its logical conclusion, for to do so would produce grave practical inconveniences, and, in some cases, actual injustices. Considerations of convenience and practical common sense should be preferred 'to following to their logical conclusions all the declarations of the 1926 conference. These are my views, but I recognize that there is ample room for genuine differences of opinion on these subjects among persons equally qualified to consider them. It would be a mistake, in my opinion, to endeavour to state in a legal formula the significance of all the political declarations of the 1926 conference. </para>

                    <para>I shall now proceed to deal with the Colonial Laws Validity Act. This measure cleared up a position of grave doubt and difficulty, which had arisen as to the power of the dominion legislatures to deal with the law of England which was originally in force in a colony. In this connexion paragraph 48 of the report reads as follows: - </para>
                    <para>The act expressly conferred upon colonial legislatures the power of making laws even though repugnant to the English Common Law, but declared that a colonial law repugnant to the provisions of an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom extending to the colonies either by express words, or by necessary intendment, should be void to the extent of such repugnancy. </para>
                    <para>In Australia certain difficulties have arisen with respect to the  Colonel Laws  Validity Act, arising out of the interpretation and application of the Commonwealth Navigation Act. Some cases have given rise to protracted and expensive litigation which has led to appeals to the Judical Committee of the Privy Council. It might be thought that on this matter it would be desirable to abolish the pre-eminence of the legislation of the Imperial Parliament. Indeed the committee of lawyers draws the conclusion that the logical result of the decision of the Imperial Conference is to abolish the legal supremacy of the British Parliament. In this connexion <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Harrison Moore says in his report - </para>
                    <para>The general application of the principle of equality laid down by the. Imperial Conference in 1926 was at once accepted, with the result that the unqualified paramountcy of the legislation of the Parliament of the United Kingdom must go. </para>
                    <para class="block">But, there is, in my opinion, a considerable degree of convenience in having a paramount legislature in the British Empire, provided that it is understood that its paramount powers shall be exercised only with the consent of the dominion concerned. There are many imperial statutes in force in the Commonwealth within the meaning of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. </para>
                    <para>Acts of the Imperial Parliament which are in force in Australia relate to the following subjects :  - </para>
                    <para>Fugitive offences. </para>

                <para>Bankruptcy</para>
                <para class="block">There are also imperial acts in force relating to shipping and Courts of Admiralty. It is very convenient that many of these matters should be subject to uniform control. My submission on this point, is that the legal position of paramountcy should be left as it is, as a matter of law, but that there should be a' political understanding as to the manner in which these paramount powers are to be exercised. It is impossible, as a practical proposal, merely to repeal the Colonial Laws Validity Act and to abolish the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament. That cannot be done. One reason, among others, is that our own Constitution is an Imperial statute; it draws its legal force and effect from the fact that it was passed by the British Parliament. What we in Australia ordinarily refer to as the Constitution is section 9 of an imperial act, namely, 63 and 64 Victoria, Chapter 12. That act consists of nine sections, and the ninth section begins with these words, " The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows-". Then follow the 128 sections which constitute the Comonwealth Constitution, section 128 of which gives to the Commonwealth Parliament and people, jointly, power to amend the Constitution itself. The mere repeal of the Colonial Laws Validity Act - the enactment of a declaration that British law should no longer be in force in a dominion - would abolish our own Constitution, and the practical result would be disastrous. But, further, it is legally impossible for the British Parliament to surrender its supremacy. If it passed a statute saying that it no longer had a  particular power, it could repeal that statute on the following day. </para>

While I say, as a lawyer, that by no statute of the Imperial Parliament can that parliament effectively and finally abolish its own legal powers, I recognize as a member of this parliament, and as a man of experience in public affairs, that it is possible to have an understanding; - a constitutional convention - as to the manner in which these powers should be exercised. </para>

                    <para>I think that it would be desirable to make some improvements in the Colonial Laws Validity Act. I can see no reason whatever for retaining the provision that an imperial act should extend to a dominion where it appears only by what is called " necessary intendment " that it should so extend. There appears no reason whatever for retaining that part of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. A mere general statement in a British act of Parliament ought not to be capable of being interpreted as applying to a dominion. It ought to appear explicitly in the statute itself that the enactment is intended to apply to that dominion, whatever constitutional practice might be adopted. So the first point that I make is that it would be desirable to omit the reference to " necessary intendment " in the Colonial Laws Validity Act. </para>
                    <para>Further, I suggest that it would be desirable to give power to dominion legislatures to amend or repeal, by express words, existing British statutes applying to the dominions so that the dominions would have full power to deal with any subject dealt, with in a British statute applying to the dominions, so far as that statute fell within the competency of the dominions, and that an understanding should be recorded that the legislative power of Great Britain should not be exercised with respect to a dominion except with its consent; but I urge that that understanding should not be recorded in any statute. In effect, this understanding is already recorded in the report of the Imperial Conference. The conference of 1926, not only declared that the dominions were autonomous within the British Empire, and in no way subordinate to one another in the control of their external or domestic affairs, but it also affirmed that the constitutional practice was that legislation by the Parliament at Westminister applying to a dominion should bc passed only with the consent of the dominion concerned. As an Australian, I unreservedly support that declaration, and say that, at the present day, it is the only principle that we are prepared to accept. Our parliaments make their own laws, and legislation passed at Westminister hereafter should apply to Australia only with its consent. It is already on record that the British Parliament can legislate for Australia only with the consent of Australia. The report of the expert committee of lawyers, however, asked that something further be done, and that this political agreement should be expressed in a legal formula. In paragraph 53 of the report, the recommendation of the committee is that a statute be passed providing that - </para>

                        <para>With regard lastly to the problem which arises from the existence of a legal power in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to legislate for the dominions, we consider that the appropriate method of reconciling the existence of this power with the established constitutional position, is to place on record a statement embodying the conventional usage. We, therefore, recommend that a statement in the following terms should be placed on record in the proceedings of the next Imperial Conference :  - " It would be in accord with the established constitutional position of all members of the Commonwealth in relation to one another that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any dominions otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that dominion." </para>

                    <para class="block">I hope that the Prime Minister will act very cautiously in relation to the suggestion that a constitutional convention be recorded in the preamble of a statute. Such a preamble has no force or effect whatever, if the enacting part of the statute is clear and unequivocal. A preamble can be referred to only in cases where the enacting words of a statute are ambiguous or obscure. The preamble does not, in itself, enact its contents, although it is part of the statute. It appears to me to be rather a recognition of the impossibility of dealing satisfactorily with this matter that the lawyers on the committee have recommended that there should be a preamble to this effect. </para>
                    <para class="block">Looking at the matter as a lawyer I have grave doubt as to the legal meaning of the terms used. It will be observed that the recommendation is that it should be stated that "no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom should extend to any dominion otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that dominion ". Does that mean that first there must be a request, and that, after the law has been passed, there must further be a consent? That is a remark able procedure. It may be that that is intended ; if so, it should be clearly stated. As a general rule, a request to any person to do a thing implies a consent to what is done ; but if these conventions are to be put into statutes we want to know exactly where we are. Honorable members familiar with the processes of legislation know how often amendments are made in bills in committee. Suppose particular legislation is requested and is made with slight amendments, is that legislation effective? Is that legislation made by the Imperial Parliament to be regarded as made fully at the request of the dominion? </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with that aspect of the matter. Is it really intended that the words should be construed strictly, so that before the legislation is passed, there should be, first, a request, and secondly,  a  consent. By whom, and to what body, is the request to be made, and by whom is the consent to be given? Is the request to be made by the government of the day? If so, is that request to be assented to as a matter of course? Is the British Parliament to act, whenever requested by a particular government in a dominion, to legislate in a. particular manner? Take the case of the present Government. In respect of some of its legislation, it is in. a difficulty owing to the fact that, while commanding a majority in this House, it does not control the other House. Is it to be a constitutional convention that a government situated as this Government is can ask the British Government to legislate for Australia, and that the British Government is thereupon to legislate accordingly, without any option? I am not suggesting that any such action might conceivably be taken by this Government; but it is important to understand exactly what is the position. If the British Government can be moved simply by a request from a dominion government, the position would seem to be open for a dominion government to put through legislation, per medium of the British Government, which it could not pass here, because it was not in command of its own legislature. </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible to draw a distinction between the substance  of  a law, and its applicability. Suppose a request is made by a dominion government, and legislation is passed by the British Parliament and consented to. At what point does the law come into operation? Is it seriously suggested that an act passed by the British Government, at the request of a dominion government, and applied in express terms to a dominion, is not to become effective until there is a subsequent consent that it shall become applicable? In legal matters it is important that there should not be any ambiguity or doubt. </para>

                    <para>So far I have been dealing with the proposed preamble. It is also proposed that an act of the Imperial Parliament shall contain an enacting clause to the same effect. The recommendation is in these terms - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Be it therefore declared and enacted that no act of Parliament hereafter made shall extend or be deemed to extend to a dominion unless it is expressly declared therein that that dominion has requested and consented to the enactment thereof, </para>

                    <para class="block">A law is made in accordance with the request and consent of a dominion government, and presumably the law is then enforced. Probably, once the statute is passed, the declaration in it that the dominion had requested and consented would be regarded as final and conclusive in the courts; but how a dominion can be said to have " consented to " - as distinct from " requested " - legislation not enacted is a problem of which I can see no solution. Another point is this: Suppose a government can request and consent, and so ensure that imperial legislation shall apply to a dominion, is parliamentary action necessary in order to make that legislation cease to apply to that dominion? Suppose legislation passed by the Imperial Parliament is, at the request and with the consent of the Commonwealth Government, made applicable to Australia in the year of grace 1929. In 1935 another government is in power. Will that government be able to make that legislation inoperative so far as it applies to Australia simply by withdrawing its consent? If that is the position, we should be informed of it. </para>

                            <para>- I have been assuming that it means only governmental action. Let us suppose that it is so, and that an act has been passed and is in force. Will it be possible for a subsequent dominion government to withdraw its consent to that act, and so render it inapplicable? If not, we have, this position : that, while an act of the British Parliament may be made applicable to a dominion at the request of a government, it can be rendered inapplicable only by parliamentary action. That situation would be plainly unreasonable, and brings us back to the suggestion 'of the Prime Minister that the original request and consent must be  parliamentary and not merely governmental. Could a federal government "by request" obtain the enactment of legislation for a dominion upon a subject and beyond its federal powers of legislation ? These questions have been left in the air by the report, and should be the subject of further careful examination. If there remains room for misunderstanding the result may, in cases of acutely contested matters, be disastrous. I suggest that the Prime Minister should think long before accepting the proposals made in paragraphs 54 and 55. I have made some suggestions which, I think, would .meet the case, and would conserve to ourselves the fullest legislative powers in practice. </para>

                    <para>This is a legal subject, but I have been trying to emphasize the point that the political aspect is incomparably more important than the legal aspect. If we go too far along legal lines, we run the risk of incurring grave political difficulties. I' remind honorable members that all these proposed provisions could, as a matter of law, even if enacted by the Imperial Parliament, be afterwards amended or repealed by that parliament at any time. Therefore, this proposed agreement provides no real legal solution of the present difficulties. That is looking at it merely from a lawyer's point of view, and there are, besides, the political difficulties I have mentioned. </para>
                    <para>There still remains open a question of particular importance to Australia, that of the covering clauses of the Constitution. These covering clauses are beyond the legislative competence of the Australian people through this Parliament, or even, by way of referendum. The Government should consider making a request to the British Government to amend covering clause 5 so that it will apply to all ships registered in Australia. </para>
                    <para>It should be remembered, in dealing with all these subjects, that the position of the States has to be considered. It is undesirable that State and Commonwealth practice should diverge to any extent in these respects. Paragraph 69 of the report points out that the most urgently required field of extra-territorial powers is in regard to criminal law which, in general, is within State power in Australia. The Commonwealth cannot bind the States by anything done at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. It is important to bear that in mind. This applies to such matters as reservation and disallowance of legislation, extraterritorial operation and effect of legislation, and the Colonial Laws Validity Act, as well as to matters affecting intra-state shipping. That being so, it is important that nothing of the definite nature should be done without consultation with the States. </para>
                    <para>The report deals with the subject of nationality, but makes no recommendations. In regard to nationality, uniformity is most desirable. The rights of a British subject are the most valuable asset any of us could have in a foreign country, and it is important that every effort should be made to establish, uniformity in this sphere of law. </para>
                    <para>In respect of merchant shipping, obviously, there is a great advantage in having uniform laws applying to ships which travel all over the world. In this regard the interests of the whole. Empire are substantially the same as the interests of Australia. The right of a British ship to the protection of the British flag abroad is, perhaps, the most valuable attribute that a vessel can have, and I am confident that Australians recognize that. I have referred to sections 735 and 736 of the Merchant Shipping Act, which impose certain limitations upon the legislative power of the Commonwealth in respect of merchant shipping. There is no Australian register of ships, and, accordingly, the Commonwealth has certain powers in respect of the coasting trade only; British ships on the high seas are controlled generally by the Merchant Shipping Act. The existing position, which is very complicated and involved, is set out in paragraph 87 of the report, and, as it is impossible for me to deal with the subject adequately in the short time at my disposal, I shall confine myself to one or two observations regarding it. I believe that there must be further consideration of merchant shipping before any action is taken. The report sets out the matters in respect of which uniformity at present exists, and, in paragraph 97 and following paragraphs, many matters as to which uniformity is desirable, and concludes - </para>

It is quite probable that uniformity in such matters will be found to be practicable. The co-ordination of the various registers is also a matter which might well be considered with a view to an arrangement being made. </para>

                    <para>Summarizing my views, I suggest that clause 5 of the Constitution be amended to make Commonwealth law applicable, if this Parliament thinks fit and proper, to ships registered in Australia. As to section 735 of the Merchant Shipping Act, I suggest that the British Parliament be asked to repeal the requirement that the legislation to which the section refers shall be reserved for the assent of  His  Majesty the King. Sec tion 736 imposes certain limitations upon our legislative power in relation to the coasting trade. It has never been effective and can easily be evaded; therefore, it should be repealed. Paragraphs 91, 92 and 93 of the report fairly express the views which I hold on this subject. It is important that we should establish uniformity so far as possible in our shipping laws. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Harrison Moore says, in paragraph 22 of his report - </para>

                        <para>One object underlying the report is the attainment, under a system of equal andunlimited legal power, in the hands of each of several legislatures, the maximum of effective operation by each for its own laws re garding a thing so essentially mobile as a ship, which is, during the greatest partof its trade life, outside the territorial waters of any of them. Another object is to diminish the hindrance of trade and commerce which may come from the application to the same ship, and the same adventure of divergent and. perhaps, conflicting laws'. Both objects require such a measure of co-operation among the legislatures as will recognize in practice some limitation in the exercise of their full legal powers. </para>

I hope that caution will be exercised before anything of the sort is done. I have no enthusiasm for a tribunal to be established simply for the purpose of settling such disputes. Such a body might go looking for work, and it might happen that a party which had failed to attain certain objects would think it worth while to state a claim before that body. </para>

The Privy Council provides adequate means for the settlement of all inter-Empire disputes of a legal character, and all others may be left to the negotiation of the governments concerned; if they decide that in respect of a particular matter it is desirable to obtain the judgment, of an independent and impartial body they can agree to appoint one. I urge the Prime Minister not to agree to the creation of a tribunal for the specific purpose of settling inter-Imperial disputes, because I fear that the existence of such a body would create disputes which would not otherwise arise. </para>

                    <para>I conclude by repeating the warning I have ventured to give on other occasions against allowing the lawyer to overrule the statesman. I value our self-government as our most precious political possession^ but I consider that it is possible and actual only because of the unity and strength of the British Empire. I am much more concerned to conserve and strengthen that unity than to insist upon any theoretical rights as a mark and symbol of an independence which would not be real outside the Empire. We must, however, take account of the views of other dominions, and it is for this reason, and not because I consider that Australia suffers any real disabilities, except to some extent in respect to shipping, that I agree in part with the suggestions for alteration made by the conference of legal experts. We must, however, be on our guard against exaggeration of the need for legal completeness. We cannot get a constitution of the Empire that will be, as in the old Latin phrase, <inline font-style="italic">- lotus teres</inline><inline font-style="italic">atque rotundus</inline> - all smooth and neatly rounded off. Some things must be left abrupt. A family would not last long if its members insisted upon denning their relationship by legal rules. T have no great enthusiasm for laws which are designed to define an absence of relationship within the Empire, and I ask the Government to proceed slowly and cautiously, and not to bind itself beyond what I suggest as the desirable minimum. I ask the Government to remember above all things that the interests of  Australia  - its self-government and economic welfare - are bound up with the success, prosperity, and continued unity of the British Empire. </para>

                        <para>. - I was glad to hear the Leader of the Opposition say that he did not desire the lawyer to overrule the statesman. After the Imperial Conference of 1926 we thought that Australia had attained constitutional freedom - that from that year it was an independent nation, enjoying equality with the United King dom, and not subordinate in any way to any other parliament or people. We have since been rudely undeceived by the lawyers. Legislation passed by the Australian Parliament, which was absolutely essential to our national independence, is inoperative because the lawyers have decided that the statesmen  from  1924 to 1926 were in error. Some oi our most treasured rights have been challenged by the invalidation of portions of the Navigation Act. Now, when an attempt is being made by a conference of constitutional experts to give to Australia the real power which most people thought it already had, we are warned by the Leader of the Opposition, to go slowly, and accept a subordinate position in the Empire, because Australia always has been subordinate. </para>

                            <para>- I shall substantiate my statement as I proceed. History shows the remarkable fact that every British plantation, settlement, or colony, has, on attaining age and strength, asserted its right to national independence. That is true notably of the Irish people whose civilization is at least as old as that of the English. I find that, in 1643, the Irish people presented to the King of England a "Remonstrance of Grievances." One of the demands that they made was as follows : - </para>

The American colonies were established by the United Kingdom, but so soon as they reached man's stature and were able to look after themselves, they insisted upon the innate right of English-speaking people to govern themselves. Blackstone and Coke, two eminent English lawyers, have laid it down that every English-speaking community has inherent in it the right of nationality; that right does not arise out of any outside power. At the first continental congress, which was held in 1774, the people of the United States of America advanced the following principles : - </para>

                    <para class="block">There is a similarity between that act and the legislation which is to be the subject of the forthcoming Imperial Conference, and which will be passed by the dominions as well as by the United Kingdom with a view to giving expression to 0U equality. The belief has been held by some persons that the term " dominion " signifies inferiority. My definition is altogether different from that. It is expressed in the words, " They shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the rivers to the ends of the earth ". Although Queen Victoria objected to the term Commonwealth, because it reminded her of the protectorate of Cromwell, it has been adopted to describe not only Australia, but the association of the various dominions with Great Britain that comprises the Empire. King Edward considered that the Australian federation had arrived before its time. From our entry into the community of nations in 1919, and the passage of the Irish Treaty Act in 1921 which declared the Irish Free State to be a nation in the British Commonwealth of Nations, our national status has been recognised. I cannot see that there is any very great necessity for this legislation; but as, unfortunately, the High Court of Australia has declared that the Colonial Laws Validity Act and the Merchant Shipping Act of 1865, still operate in Australia and hamper its independence, we had better accept it. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has rightly stated that if we appeal only to legality we shall not get very far. There is not the slightest doubt that what one Parliament passes the next Parliament can repeal, because a Parliament cannot bind its successors. If we depended upon legislation passed by the United Kingdom, and the matter was regarded strictly from the point of view of legality, we might find our position altered whenever the character of the British Parliament changed. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has said that it would be an agreement; but I want it to be more than that. I am not aware of what the other dominions intend to do; but as the United Kingdom proposes to confer these powers upon us, and assumes that it has the power to do so, we should accept them, not as a gift, but because it suits our convenience to do so. This Parliament should also pass whatever legislation is necessary to assert its rights and its status; and the Parliaments of the other dominions should act similarly. </para>
                    <para>It is unquestionable that the term " alliance " which was used by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Macdonald in Canada, in 1865, properly describes the present position of the British Commonwealth. But an alliance is not possible except between equals. The greater the equality and initial separativeness  the stronger the subsequent union. That is very properly pointed out by Professor Schuyler, Professor of History at the Columbia  Unversity,  in <inline font-style="italic">Parliament and the British Empire.</inline> He says - </para>

The mid-Victorian antiImperialists by no means deserve the censure that Imperialists have been fond of heaping upon them. " On the whole," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Duncan </para>
                        <para class="block">Hall judiciously remarks, " it is fair to say that the emphasis put by the separatists on the development of an independent and self-reliant spirit in the colonies, played a large part in helping to foster the growth of dominion nationhood, and an even greater part in forcing England to recognize this vital factor." Personally, I believe that when we are free from the present galling bonds, greater friendship will exist between every portion of the British Commonwealth. One free man can regard another as a friend, but he cannot treat him as an equal if there is not equality between them. </para>

                            <para>- It is admitted that, at the present time, the Parliament of Great Britain can alter our legislation. It refused to accept the Constitution that was sent to it with the backing of the Australian people. The Constitution that it assented to contains provisions that state the position which we should adopt towards British merchant shipping, as well as to the warships of every part of the Empire, and other matters. The hearing of appeals by the people of Australia is not limited to our own courts; appeal lies to a court that sits in London. I, as a Britisher, residing in Australia, want to feel that I have equal rights with a Britisher who resides in England. It is repugnant to me that I should be in any sense subordinate to a Britisher who lives in London, and insists upon his right to govern this country. A big step forward was made recently with the signing of the protocol for the revision of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and the protocol for the accession of the United States of America. For the first time in the history of treaties between the British people and other nations, there was then a recognition of the independence of Australia in these matters. On that occasion the signature of the British Government had application only to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Crown colonies other than the dominions, which affixed their signatures independently of Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that that would be done. If South Africa were not given power to legislate for Australia, why should the United Kingdom have such power? The Leader of the Opposition seems to think that the residuum of power is to be left with the United Kingdom. I certainly object to that. In addition, when he was speaking with regard to the authority on the high seas, I tried to interject that at the present time the Danube is controlled by eight or nine nations bordering its banks. Something similar to the equal authority and conventions among those nations in respect of the Danube should exist among the Parliaments of the British Commonwealth in regard to their jurisdiction on the high seas. </para>

                            <para>-I agree that the United Kingdom should retain that power, but only with an equal power to this dominion. I, for one, should not be prepared to give away our rights of extraterritoriality by legislation without having the right to call another conference for the purpose of revoking that legislation. The Leader of the Opposition has said that we should not have this power, but if that were so, we should be putting ourselves in an unfair position. As the Balkan States are able to make conventions in their own right in respect of the Danube, there is no reason why the British Commonwealth of Nations should not have similar rights in respect of the high seas. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition has referred to the Royal Title. The 1926 conference at which we were, unfortunately, represented by that anti-Australian, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> passed a new declaration as to what the Royal Title should be, and that title does not apply to Australia at all. It is to this effect : " George V., by the Grace of God, of Great Britain and Ireland and the dominions overseas, King". From my point of view, Australia is not a dominion overseas, and, therefore, that title does not apply to Australia. I should call Canada a dominion overseas. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> when in London, would look upon Australia as an overseas dominion, but, from an Australian stand-point, this country is not an overseas dominion. </para>

In addition, there is not to be any alteration of the law in respect of the succession to the throne, without the consent of all the Parliaments of the dominions and the Parliament of the United Kingdom. I do not suppose that if the law of succession, which the Leader of the Opposition is so anxious to preserve, were altered, it would take away the right of succession from the descendants of the  Electress  Princess Sophia. It would be a good thing if the law were not altered, and without the consent of the Parliaments of the dominions, the United Kingdom would make no attempt to alter it. </para>

Honorable members must know that the third now in succession to the English throne is the daughter of the Duke of York. If, by any chance, a son were not born to the Duke of York, but a second daughter were born, the elder daughter would not have the right to succeed to the throne. If there are only daughters in the line of succession, the selection of the successor has to be made by Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">The position is extraordinary. On the one hand, as citizens of the Commonwealth, we have equal status with the people of Great Britain, but, on the other, as citizens of the various States, we are still subject to the Colonial Laws Validity Act, and the Imperial Parliament will exercise a power of disallowance and reservation in respect of our legislation. I particularly ask the Prime Minister to look into this aspect of the subject while abroad. The States will have no representatives at the conference, so be will be the only person who can watch their interests. It will be remembered by some honorable members that the States asked for representation at one of the earlier Imperial Conferences on the ground that they. as well as the Commonwealth, enjoyed a particular status in relation to the Imperial Parliament; but their request was not' acceded to. We <inline font-style="italic">are,</inline> undoubtedly, subject to two allegiances, one, as people of the Commonwealth, and the other, as people of the States; but whereas in the former case we are regarded as a people of equal status, in the latter, we are regarded as subordinate, and will be subject to what I regard as galling restrictions. It is absurd that, in one relationship, we should be under servitude to Downing-street, and in the other, we should be regarded as equals. This matter should be investigated and the position corrected at the coming conference. </para>

                    <para class="block">Country. There is no one who regards the Old Country with greater pride and affection than I do* I desire to maintain a continual alliance with every part of the British Commonwealth. I am proud, indeed, to be of British stocky and regard the great ideals . of the people of those famous isles in the North Sea with the utmost honour. England is the originator of the liberties that we enjoy, and the freedom and democracy of which we are so proud. But we should be considered as sons who have left their father's house, and are supporting ourselves. We still have every  respect  for the old political beliefs and business practices,  but we  are now independent, and should be so regarded. Our rights as a nation, to discontinue the figurative language, have been asserted, and ah attempt is now being made to reduce them to a legal formulae. Although I do not know that such legislation is necessary- our rights already exist - I think it should be done. I want our nationhood to be absolutely asserted. That does not mean that in a time of stress I will refuse to stand by the Old Country; but only that I want alliance, and not subordination. I am sure that the Prime Minister will place Australia's .views before the conference in a way which will advance the best interests of this great country. </para>

                    <para>I Lave always been a zealous upholder of the rights of the self-governing dominions, and have insisted, in the face of much opposition from my friends overseas, that these rights should be respected. But I have also always been a zealous upholder of the unity of the Empire, upon which the safety of this country depends. I hold just as tenaciously now the views that I expressed in the 1919 and 1921 conferences. In a book I published a year or two ago, I referred at some length to the foolish attempt made at the 1926 Imperial Conference to reduce to writing the conventions of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I said - </para>

                        <para>Against this folly I have always set my face. None have stood more firmly than I for the right to full autonomous powers, or pressed more insistently for the recognition that the various nations of the British Commonwealth are perfectly equal in status; but these things being freely accorded, I have always held that we can maintain the unity of the Empire only if we exercise the rights we all possess with the utmost discretion and watch that our acts do not deletriously affect the Empire or any part of it. </para>
                        <para>The' constitutional relations between the dominions and Britain, and between the dominions <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> have proved wonderfully adaptable and elastic, but that elasticity and adaptability are limited. We must recognize that although constitutionally we, in the dominions, or the people of Britain, can do whatever would be possible if we were separate nations outside the Empire, some things we cannot do without grave dangers of disrupting the Empire. But we cannot write these things down in black and white. They depend upon circumstances. What is possible to one dominion is not possible to all; an act which may be done safely to-day may lead to grave trouble in six months' time. The unity of the Empire depends upon the wise restraint with which its rulers exercise the limitless powers entrusted to them. </para>

                    <para>Those observations set out my views clearly and concisely. In 1921 the conference endorsed and acted upon them unanimously, rejecting the suggestion to set- out in writing the conventions of Empire relations. Unfortunately, in 1926, other counsels prevailed, with results such as might have been expected. The 1926 report, which was to have settled everything, has created confusion, doubt and alarm, where formerly were order, -certainty and confidence. The report now before the House is another attempt to set down in black and white the conventions and traditions which have been re cognized by the British Commonwealth of Nations. This, too, though less ambitious than that of 1926, settles nothing. No one can read it without being convinced that every attempt to reduce to writing the constitutional relations existing between the various parts of the Empire must fail. Let me show why this must be so. It was proposed that a constitutional conference of representatives of the British Empire should be held in 1921. Addressing myself to this proposal, I said at that time - </para>

                        <para>It has been suggested that a constitutional conference should be held. ... It may be that I am very dense, but I am totally at a loss to understand what it is proposed that this constitutional conference shall do. If it that the dominions are seeking new powers, or is the conference to draw up a declaration of rights, to set down in black and white the relations between Britain and the dominions? What is the conference to do? What is the reason for calling it together? I know, of course, the resolutions of the 1917 conference. But much water has run under the bridge since then. Surely this conference is not intended to limit the rights we now have. Yet what new rights, what extension of power, can it give us? What is there that we cannot dp now? What limitations are now imposed upon them ? What can they not do - even to encompassing their own destruction by sundering the bonds that hind them to the Empire? Yet what do they lack? Canada has asserted her right to make treaties.' She has made treaties. She is asserting her right to appoint an ambassador to Washington. Are these the marks of slave States or of quasi-sovereignty ? In what essential thing does any one of the great self-governing dominions differ from independent nations ? </para>

                    <para class="block">In making those remarks, I had in mind the position of South Africa and of Canada. At that time my friend General Smuts was the Prime Minister of South Africa; but the arguments are just as applicable to that dominion, although its affairs are now being administered by a government of which General Hertzog is the leader. What I said then I say now. It would be folly to attempt to encompass in writing the relations of these great dominions, because they are everchanging. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is to be observed that this distribution of powers has been gradual, extending over a long period of years; but, during the last few years, it has proceeded more rapidly than previously. The great merit of the constitutional relations between Great Britain and the dominions has always been their elasticity. To this is due their wonderful adaptation to changing circumstances, arising from the growth and development of the dominions. To attempt to substitute for this a rigid constitution, or to define or set out in writing the relationship between the dominions, is most undesirable. That becomes increasingly obvious as the years go on. What this commission, whose report is before us, makes more clear than before is that, while it is possible, in practice, to reconcile that complete autonomy which the dominions possess - which they exercise by virtue of British statutes and waivers by British Governments - with the sovereign rights of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and with the unity of the Empire, provided that the ambit of these conflicting -jurisdictions is not put in writing. The moment it is committed to writing it becomes impossible. There is a hopeless inconsistency between the complete autonomy which has been claimed by the dominions and has been freely admitted by Britain, and the unity of the Empire, the maintenance of which is only possible by such a restraint in their exercise as, in effect, imposes very real limitations upon our autonomous powers. This is the price we pay for unity. We cannot be at once independent nations and members of the British Empire. We can claim to be independent nations, and technically, can remain so ; but, if, actually, we attempt to exercise our powers as if we were, independent nations, the unity of the Empire becomes impossible. If unity of Empire is a thing of priceless value, as I believe it to be, and essential to the existence, independence and progress of Australia, we must face facts, and recognize that, while, technically, there is nothing that we cannot do, actually there are limits set upon the exercise of our powers, which we, as sensible men, must observe. </para>

                    <para>At the conference of 1923, and, particularly, at that of 1926, an attempt was made to improve upon perfection; because there never was a constitution like that of the British Empire, so vague, so impalpable, yet so admirably  adapted  to the basic principles of democratic government and Imperial unity. However in 1926, an attempt was made to set out these principles in writing, and the result has been disastrous; or, if that be too strong a term,  at any rate  confusion has been created. It has settled nothing, but it has unsettled everything. It was done to smooth the path, if you like, for two members of the Empire - the South African Union and the Irish Free State. In part, too, it was done to please the then Prime Minister of Canada. No demand was made for it by Australia or New Zealand. Those who represented the three dominions demanded, each in his own way, that the position should be put into writing, so that they might convince sceptics at home; so that when they stood on the hustings they could say, " We bring you freedom, you who were in chains." The dominion is now veritably a nation. That is the message which General Hertzog, the representative of the Irish Free State, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackenzie</inline> King, wished to take back from the Imperial Conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackenzie</inline> King complained that he had recommended  His Excellency  the Governor-General of Canada, to grant a dissolution, and he had refused, That, he said, was incompatible with the national status of Canada, which has been declared equal to the national status of Britain, where the practice of the last 40 years  is that advice tendered to His Majesty by his Prime Minister is invariably accepted. He demanded that the position be now regulated so that Canada should not be denied those powers which are exercised by Britain in regard to this highly important constitutional matter. Lord Byng, in the exercise of that discretionary power, which it was generally recognized, lay within the province of the representative of the King in a dominion, had refused to grant a dissolution. The conference agreed that what was asked for should be done, and, so far as the conference could do it, the Prime Minister of every dominion was clothed with the same powers as those of the Prime Minister of Great Britain. When the Prime Minister of a dominion now advises his Governor-General to dissolve Parliament, His Excellency must dissolve it; he no longer has any discretion. Whether that was right or wrong, it was done, not because all the dominions wanted it, but because Canada wanted it. The Constitution, in practice, has been changed completely. </para>

                    <para>Then there was an effort by General Hertzog to define more clearly the status of South Africa and the position of the King in relation to the dominions. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> made some reference to that. He looks at the matter from another angle. General Hertzog claims that the status of South Africa has been raised by the 1926 Conference report, and that  His  Majesty now occupies a position different from that he formerly held. In fact, nothing in substance has been changed, yet it is true that things are not quite the same as they were, for South Africa has been led to believe that since it, is a nation, it may do all things that it could do if it were outside the Empire, and still remain within the Empire. What will come of this we do not know; but that the unity of the Empire is imperilled' by this attempt to put in writing something which will satisfy that section of the electors of the South African Union that supports General Hertzog is undeniable. The Conference of 1926 has, I say, unsettled the foundations upon which the unity of the Empire rests. We were perfectly satisfied to remain as we were, relying upon the processes of evolution throughout the years to adjust things nicely to everchanging circumstances. We were content because that process, as time went on, had amply satisfied our every want. But, as General Hertzog desired this alteration, it was made. There is no real change, yet little by little the foundations of the Constitution are being undermined. There must be in this federation of nations some head. The concept of nations wholly  equal in status, each going its own way without regard to the others and yet maintaining unity, is illogical, and, in practice, impossible. We have maintained that unity in the past through the exercise of a wise restraint, a recognition that, though we are equal in status with Britain, we are not equal in stature - that one must speak for all, and that each must adjust its circumstances so that unity can be maintained. Not seeking in any way to disturb that position, I have urged that in regard to foreign policy, which affects every one of us, although Britain speaks on behalf of all, it must be after consultation with all. Britain is the one that speaks, but she speaks after having consulted us. So there is lent to her slightest word the authority of a united empire. </para>
                    <para>One might pursue this subject at very great length. I have no intention of doing that; but there are one or two points that I wish to emphasize. Take the commission's recommendation on the Colonial Laws Validity Act. Honorable members know that in 1917, 1918. 1921, 1923, and 1926, it was laid down at the Imperial Conferences, on the motion of the Prime Minister of Britain, that the dominions were equal in status to Britain, and were entitled to all the rights and privileges, and to the exercise of all authority in regard to matters within their jurisdiction, as was enjoyed by Britain herself. No more complete surrender of all that overlordship and sovereignty which Britain previously exercised over the dominions could ever  have been put into words, precise, definite, andunambiguous. </para>

                    <para>The Colonial Laws Validity Act is a statute of a dragnet character, passed in 1865. Its effect is to impose certain limitations upon the legislative competence of the various dominions, and, of course, upon States of the Commonwealth, and on Crown colonies. The provisions of that act are clearly inconsistent with the declarations of 1917, 1918, 1923 and 1926, namely, that we have a status equal to that of Great Britain in every respect. A dominion cannot have the right to make whatever laws it pleases applicable to its own jurisdiction, and within its own territory, and be at the same time subject to the overlordship of a British statute. I have maintained all along that the way out was to repeal the Colonial Laws Validity Act which, in my opinion, is now an anachronism. Some of the difficulties with which we are now confronted, and which are the inevitable result of the march of progress, can be remedied only by British legislative action. On this point I have written as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The reference of dominion legislation to the Dominion Office, the reservation of certain classes of legislation for the approval of the British Government, the hamstringing of dominion legislation by restricting their power to territorial limits in matters where their interests demand that the laws shall have force outside those limits, and the operation of the Colonial Laws Validity Act - a statute passed over sixty years ago, when the dominions were small outposts of the Empire - all these, I say, are incompatible with the status and importance of the dominions - and ought to be swept away by an act of the British Parliament. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is clearly the position. The Leader of the Opposition said that if the Colonial. Laws Validity Act was repealed it must affect our Constitution, which rests upon a British statute. My answer is that the Colonial Laws Validity Act as it now standsignores the  passage  of time and the changes that have taken place. During the last twenty-five years we have come out of our swaddling clothes and put on the <inline font-style="italic">toga virilis.</inline> Therefore, all these restrictions should be swept to one side. The Colonial Laws Validity Act should go. That, of course, would involve a settlement of such matters as the extraterritoriality of our legislation, and of other points which have been raised in the course of this debate. </para>
                    <para>Our Constitution is actually a British statute, and the position is exactly the same in Canada. The Constitution of Canada rests upon a British statute known as the British North America Act. It is, in effect, a treaty between the French and the British-Canadian peoples. It followed upon longdrawnout negotiations, and paved the way to a united Canada. It cannot be amended except as provided for, namely by an amendment of the British statute. It is well known that the British Parliament will not amend  a  statute relating to a dominion except upon the invitation and  at  the request of that dominion, but its legislative competence to do so is undeniable. It could at this moment alter our Constitution. It could at this moment alter the Act of Union with Scotland, or upset the Act of Succession, or vary the Treaty with Ireland. There is nothing to stop  it.  Therefore, the question of the legislative competence of the British Parliament  can be put on one side ; that is not in dispute at all. The point is that for hundreds of years, and certainly since the union with Scotland, certain acts have been regarded as final and exhaustive exercises of legislative authority. The Act of Union between England and Scotland having been passed, it ha3 never been suggested that it should be repealed, although, technically, the power to do so resides in the British Parliament. The same thing applies in regard to Ireland, and less obviously, perhaps, in regard to the British North America Act, and to our' own Constitution. Having been enacted, they are how regarded as sacrosanct-. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition dealt with this subject in a most interesting fashion ; but I point out to him that whether the Colonial Laws Validity Act is repealed or not, the legislative competency of every dominion to amend a British statute relating to that dominion cannot be questioned unless we are to say that the declarations of the Imperial conferences count for nothing. The legal position is as the Leader of the Opposition has said. Legally, certain limitations are placed upon our legislative competency by virtue of the Colonial Laws Validity Act and other acts, included our own Constitution, which is a British statute embodying an agreement between the States of the Commonwealth ; but, if the conference declarations are to have any force, the right of a dominion to amend a British statute relating to itself cannot be questioned. </para>

He had achieved a victory, and Lord Byng had, in the popular imagination, fallen from his pedestal. Everything seemed as he wished; but in reducing this principle to writing, they had gone so far that they had undermined the foundations upon which the Confederation rested.

                        <para>These British statutes are known as the constitutions of the various States or dominions to which they apply. They are at once the charter of liberty of the State or Dominion, and its guardian: They set out what may or may not be done. Generally, they do not limit 'the self-governing powers of the people, but they do limit the authority of the legislatures. Certain classes of legislation cannot become law unless and until the people have been consulted, and have approved. The British statute usually gives legal effect to agreements necessary for federation between, or unions of, several States - that is, it  allocates  to the Federal or Central Government or to those of the States certain enumerated powers, and reserves all others to the contracting States. Alternatively, the enumerated powers are allocated to the States, and the residuum of authority granted to the States under their respective Constitutions passes to the central government. And this division of powers neither the central nor any of the State legislatures, nor even the people themselves, -can alter "except in the manner prescribed fay the British statute. </para>

'No matter how powerful a province or group of provinces might become, the British Parliament alone could blot out a line of it - and only when all the parties asked. But where there was certainty there is now doubt, and many of those who most loudly demanded that the autonomous powers of Canada should be more definitely declared are now going about in chastened moods deploring the inevitable consequence of the granting of their prayer. </para>
                        <para>The position is this: If Canada is a nation equal in status to Britain, nothing that concerns 'Canada can be outside the ambit of the Canadian Legislature and the Canadian people. When the British North American Act was passed, every one accepted the overlordship of Britain, and, wishing to safeguard their interests 'under a confederated system of government, the provinces naturally turned to Britain. In no other -way could the union have been achieved, and there was certainly no other authority with power to give legal effect to the pact.- . . . </para>

I deny most emphatically that a state of subordination and colonial inferiority is essential to the preservation of the rights of minorities in Canada. </para>

                    <para class="block">The French are in the minority, and if the Constitution of Canada can be altered by the dominion parliament, those safeguards upon which they rely may disappear. Therefore, if the 1926 conference clothed the Canadian Parliament with power to do in Canadian matters all that the British Parliament can do in British matters, the conditions upon which the French agreed to the confederation of the Canadian States may be changed at any time. And, unless all the decisions of the conference mean nothing at all, that is their effect. I am not concerned with what lawyers may say; they have nothing to do with the matter. There is no court before which a nation can be haled. If we passed a law, let us say an act repealing the Constitution, who would declare it unconstitutional? The problem is very difficult only because we have got into the habit of regarding British statutes as sacrosanct, and entirely beyond our power of amendment. Either the resolutions of Imperial Conferences mean what they say or they mean nothing. But the declarations of the Imperial Conference were made by persons clothed with full authority to make them. The Prime Minister of Great Britain went to the conference clothed with all the authority of a sovereign parliament, and conferred with dominion representatives clothed with all the authority of their respective parliaments. And, mark you, a complete surrender by Britain of all her powers is absolutely within her competence. If she chooses to strip herself of all powers, there is none to say her nay; if the dominions choose to accept those responsibilities, there is none to deny them. And when the dominions have published to the world their independence, and given evidence of it by appending their names to treaties as separate nations, declaring over and over again their equality of status with the Mother Country, we have gone so far along the road that I do not know where we shall stop.

                        <para>As to the legislative competence of the Canadian legislature to act as the guardian of its own Constitution, and to amend or repeal the British North America Act, one may say a word or two. Some may perhaps contend that a resolution of the Imperial Conference does not confer upon Canada the right to repeal a British Statute. That may be so. In themselves, conference resolutions are without legal sanction. But that is not to say they mean nothing. If those resolutions leave things where they were, of what use are they? </para>

                    <para class="block">We have left that safe anchorage in which we had been content to exercise the powers that were freely handed to us as and when our state of development demanded, and like foolish and untrusting people, have asked that these things be put in writing that we might boast about them, that they might serve our purposes at elections, and that we might crown ourselves with garlands, and say as Hertzog said after the 1926 conference, "I have brought to you a King. The King of England is nothing to us. We have a King of Africa." Being pressed to explain, he said, "He is the King of England, but he is King of Africa." There has been no change. Yet we have been dragged along a road to the edge of an abyss. We have dropped the substance for the shadow. We are pursuing paths that must ultimately lead to disunity. At the forthcoming conference another effort will be made to correct that which cannot be corrected, to define that which is indefinable. When we set down in. writing the relations between two ever-changing bodies, every term must in the nature of things amount to words of limitation. It is impossible to conceive and define what will be the relations between A and B, developing bodies, in ten years' time without saying, "A must not do that, and B must do the other." But when, as before, we were given powers sufficient unto our needs, we knew where we were. Whatever we wanted we knew we could have when the time came, and as we could not foresee the powers we would want we did not demand that they be put in writing, for writing would only limit them. Since 1926 resolutions have been passed again and again to explain the inexplicable. We cannot explain in writing the constitutional relations of the British Empire. They are to be found in the history, in the tradition, in the constitutional development of the British Empire. No one, fifteen years ago, could have foreseen or predicted that we would stand where we are now. When Andrew Fisher went to the Imperial Conference in 1911, and met the leaders of the Empire, the first statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> made was that Britain could not share the responsibility of foreign policy with the dominions. Who could have foreseen at that time that at conference after conference </para>
                    <para>Britain would seem to be animated by a desire to strip herself of the last vestige of authority, to seek in many respects to placate the implacable, not realizing that the partners in the Empire must be content to trust one another and allow their relations to be determined by the circumstances of the moment. Never when we have demanded the right to exercise a power has it been denied to us. When we have demanded a power necessary for our circumstances it has been freely given to us. Why, then, should we seek to define what our powers are? It is enough to say that we are equal in status with Britain herself. Who shall say what our requirements will be tomorrow? The moment we set down in writing our powers we set limits to them, and people say, " Cannot we do that ?" "No, because if you do, you will dismember the Empire." Thereupon foolish and short-sighted enemies of the Empire seek to do that very thing. I regret now more bitterly than ever that we have departed from sound principles, and I ask the Prime Minister to pursue a policy that will, so far as humanly possible, arrest the tide of this process, and to be content with a plain declaration of the fact that there is nothing Australia wishes to do that it cannot do. But, if she does some things, she cannot remain a member of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. To the extent that these resolutions were incompatible with the overlordship of Britain, which is assumed necessarily by the legislation which purports to limit the ambit of dominion legislation, they are inconsistent. But, so long as they were undefined and not set out in a general way, they left us to meet the situation as we came to it. We do not know yet what has happened. A reference was made today to the Act of Succession. Whenever an attempt is made to define or explain what has already been done, difficulties are encountered and one finds oneself floundering in a bottomless bog. It is suggested  in this report that the question of succession is to be submitted to each of the dominions. That would naturally be done if the occasion should ever arise for doing it. But is such a contingency likely to arise? There never was a royal family so firmly established as is the House of Windsor. </para>

                    <para>I desire to re-affirm the attitude that I have always taken up. I stand as a zealous upholder of the rights of Australia. No one has fought for those rights more insistently or more determinedly than I. I have upheld them against Great Britain as I have done against every other nation. But I have always recognized that there are some things that cannot be done if the Empire is to remain united. Because of that, I say that we cannot express these matters in writing. I hope, therefore, that the Prime Minister will approach the Imperial Conference in London, recognizing clearly that he can get nothing that he does not already possess. When the declaration was made that we were equal in status with Great Britain, and when it was re-affirmed in Parliament and in conference, there remained no more worlds, either legislatively or administratively, to conquer. Real limitations are imposed upon both Great Britain and Australia. The Parliament of Great Britain is a sovereign Parliament ; it can wipe out the present dynasty, repeal the Act of Union, and the Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, and thus destroy the foundations upon which we rest. But it dare do none of those things, and it would never dream of making the attempt. But as limitations are imposed upon its legislative competency - and no one suggests that either its sovereignty or its dignity is thereby impaired - why should we hesitate to admit that there are imposed also upon us restrictions which we may recognize without any impairment of our dignity or our nationality? </para>

To illustrate that, I shall show the extraordinary delay that has taken place in giving consideration to an application for the removal of one of the most scandalous sets of duties ever introduced. About a fortnight ago, a deputation waited upon the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to protest against the exceedingly high duties that had been placed on glass.

A girl shorthand writer was present - from the department presumably - and took a shorthand note of the proceedings. To my certain knowledge, the transcript of that note has not been considered by the Minister. When I questioned him after a week had elapsed he said that the department was so hopelessly overloaded that the transcript of the shorthand note had not been made. Only a day or two ago a report of the remarks that I made at the deputation was sent to me for revision. I told the clerk who brought it along that he could collect it from my room, but a page of it is still lying there. That is a particularly scandalous state of affairs. A great wrong has been done, a great injustice committed. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has been absent from Australia for some months, and probably is not aware of the extent of the congestion in his department. I appeal to him to investigate immediately the administrative side, nol only in Canberra, but in the different States. A year ago, when I was in charge of the department, a considerable number of what are known as requests for by-law admissions were received. I have no hesitation in saying that, as the result of the introduction of these new schedules, those requests have increased at least fifty-fold. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to what extent the staff of investigation officers who have been inquiring into these cases has been increased ; how many complaints and requests in connexion with these new schedules remain unanswered at the head office, and how many weeks behind is the work of the department in connexion with the enormous correspondence that it has been receiving during the last few months. This congestion has come about because of this new and amazing policy of tariff-making in a hurry. It has never been done in the world successfully, and it will never be done in Australia successfully. The head office of the Customs Department is hopelessly overburdened. It is not giving the business people of the Commonwealth anything like a fair deal. Never before has a Commonwealth department fallen down on its job to such an extent. That is not the fault of the department, because, in normal times, it is as capable and efficient as any other department of its kind in the world. But it is being submerged by its work. I understand that the congestion will be made ten times worse by the departure overseas of .the first tariff expert of the department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott.</inline> I have made this charge of congestion on two or three occasions, and I ask the Minister to let honorable members know the exact position. There are two Ministers directly connected with the work of the Customs Department, and yet we can get no information in respect of its work and of tariff items generally. The silence preserved by those Ministers is unprecedented in this chamber. I regret that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> have ruled that no discussion, is permitted on the glass scandal. </para>

                        <para>.- Some little time ago an embargo was placed upon certain imports, including agricultural machinery. Recently I received a letter in regard to the sale of machinery in Western Australia. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> McKay, of the firm of H. V. McKay and Company, has altered the conditions of sale in respect of agricultural machinery. The sales are now based on a cash payment of 25 per cent, of the value of the goods, the balance to be paid in February next. There would be no objection to that if it were an ordinary condition of sale, but it is a drastic step under existing conditions. At present there is an embargo on the importation of agricultural machinery, and if this firm is permitted to use that embargo in this way, it will inflict a great hardship upon the farmers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ferguson,</inline> when giving evidence before the Royal Commission on the Constitution, admitted that agricultural machinery in Western Australia costs 12 per cent, more than it does in Victoria, principally because of the freight. If the Government insists upon the embargo, and the Western Australian producers are compelled to purchase their requirements from Victoria, a further heavy impost will be placed upon them. I ask the Minister to ascertain whether there has been any important departure in connexion with the tracing arrangements of H. V. McKay and Company, and, if so. to take steps to rectify the position. If that, is not done, it will be my duty to move the adjournment of the House before the session ends in order to place this matter before honorable members. I trust that the necessary action will bc taken, and that the Government will remove the embargo that has been placed upon the importation of . farmers' requisites. </para>

                    <para>I come now to timber duties and the report of the Tariff Board in respect of the timber industry. I wish to deal not with the new duties, but with the obligation of the Government in respect of the ordinary duties on timber. In 1921 pressure was brought to bear upon the Government to introduce a tariff board bill, because of information that had been obtained abroad by one of the Government officials. He reported upon the methods adopted by the high protectionists in the United States of America the home of tariff scandals. We passed the Tariff Board Act, and, under it, all the best known star chamber methods were adopted. The Tariff Board could sit in private, and there was no need to take evidence on oath. Several honorable members, including myself, fought that legislation bitterly, but at that time no alteration was made. Some time afterwards we were able to effect an alteration. We brought the Tariff Board into the open. That body has probably done good work, but anybody who reads its majority report on fertilizers will realize that it has fallen down on its job. If the recommendations of that board ' were given effect to a certain firm would obtain an absolute monopoly of the sale of fertilizers in Australia. If its local supplies were not sufficient to supply Australian requirements, it was to be allowed to import fertilizers duty free, while other firms who imported that product had to pay the duty. The Tariff Board has reported on the timber industry. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> Certain obligations are placed upon the Minister by the Tariff Board Act. which provides for instance that - </para>

                        </list>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The act also provides that evidence in regard to these matters must be taken in public and on oath. But a remarkable thing has occurred in connexion with the imposition of the new timber duties. Honorable members will remember that an agitation has been conducted for a number of years for an increase of the timber duties. In 1924, the Tariff Board refused to recommend an increase in duties, but in 1927, the Government brought forward a proposal for increasing them in opposition to the report of the board. Although that proposal was withdrawn, pressure was later brought to bear upon the Government, with the result that it was reintroduced, and the duties increased. </para>

                            <para>- My object in making these observations is to point out that the provisions of the Tariff Board Act are not being complied with. Quite recently a conference was held in Canberra, at which persons interested in the timber industry, particularly in Victoria and Queensland, met the Minister and requested him to grant an increase in the existing duties. The act makes no provision for the holding of a conference with suppliants for increased duties. The requirement of the statute that the board shall take evidence on oath in regard to these matters was not observed in connexion with the imposition of these new duties. The result is that certain big timber merchants in Melbourne, who hold large stocks of timber, will be able to take unfair advantage of the new duties. This is a matter which requires explanation by the Minister. </para>

                    <para>One would like to discuss in detail many matters in connexion with this department, but there is not time to do  30.  Yet I felt obliged to direct attention to the manner in which the new timber duties have been imposed, because in my opinion, the whole procedure is in the nature of a scandal. </para>
                    <para>I trust that before the session ends the Government will give honorable members an opportunity of discussing questions relating to the imposition of duties on agricultural machinery and farming requisites generally. I earnestly appeal to the Government to take into consideration the very difficult position in which the primary producers of "Western Australia have been placed, because of the prevailing low prices of their produce, the additional charges which are being imposed upon all their requirements, and the disadvantages under which they labour in comparison with primary producers in the eastern States. I know that there are constitutional difficulties in the way of - granting special relief to the "Western Australian farmers; but I sincerely hope that some method may be devised of assisting them to overcome the troubles which they are finding so oppressive. </para>

                            <para>- I think that I am entitled to point out that the delay in the consideration of the tariff schedules is inflicting the utmost hardship on large sections of the community. Owing to the congestion in the department, men are losing their incomes, or are being thrown out of employment, and they can obtain no redress, either by the ventilation of their difficulties in Parliament, or from the department itself. These persons cannot get an answer from the department. If an honorable member asks for information which business men outside are desirous of obtaining, it is refused, and the Government declines to give members an opportunity to discuss individual tariff items. We are in the anomalous position of being members of a free parliament, and yet unable to prevent all kinds of injustice being done. Despite the provisions of the Tariff Board Act, the Government has departed from the recommendations of the Tariff Board in regard to timber duties. </para>

Taxation proposals dealt with by the Treasury, such as income tax, land tax, and sales tax, have effect only if approved by Parliament. The Customs Department, however, can be used as a taxing machine for a considerable period without parliamentary sanction. Duties imposed in 1929 will not be discussed till 1931. </para>

                            <para>- I shall endeavour to show that this department is to some extent incompetent. I have the highest respect for the members of the Tariff Board, but this body, for which we are asked to provide nearly ¬£14,000, can be deceived in the inquiries that it makes. In many cases it hears only one side of the case. There are firms in Australia who used to be called importers, but are to-day termed distributors, because, instead of their business being mainly confined to the distribution of imported items, it is now concerned very largely with the distribution of manufactured articles, as well as of imported articles. If a manufacturer approaches the Tariff Board, and asks for a very high tariff in connexion with the manufacture of certain goods, the distributors of those goods feel that their tongues are tied, and so the Tariff Board is incapable of obtaining from them evidence which they could give if they so desired. Naturally, if they gave adverse evidence, and later the manufacturers secured the desired tariff, the distributors would be unable to obtain the goods for distribution, and would practically be driven out of business. It is open to question whether this committee should provide further moneys for the maintenance of a body that can be so misused. </para>
