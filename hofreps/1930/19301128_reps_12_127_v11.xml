If it has been so decided, will the honorable gentleman, in view of the injury that will thus be caused to Australia's principal primary industry, give to representatives of the wool-growers an opportunity, similar to that given to the fellmongers to place their position before the Ministry? </para>

                        <para>- This matter was raised recently at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers which was convened to consider the position of the wheat industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell, the Premier of "Western Australia, expressed the opinion that the bankruptcy law of that State conflicted with the federal law, and that it would be necessary to confer on the matter. The representative of South Australia also raised the question. The Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department was asked to go into the matter, and it has prepared an opinion to the effect that, if the State laws are drafted along the lines of the South Australian law, they will not conflict with the federal law. The Federal Government views the whole matter sympathetically, and the honorable member for Galore may rest assured that whatever stops are necessary will be taken to deal with the position. </para>

                        <para>- The intention is to bring down these measures during the present sittings of the House, and at the earliest possible moment I shall indicate their contents. I may say at this stage, however, that the bills deal only with what may be regarded as technical defects that have been discovered in the administration of the Sales Tax Acts, and that a general review of the operation of that legislation will not be undertaken until the Prime Minister, who introduced the original measures, returns to Australia. </para>

I understand that, although no direct request was made, a hint was dropped that the present Arbitration Court did not feel itself qualified to determine a proper basic wage for Australia at the present time. If a just decision can be arrived at after investigation by this royal commission, a splendid service will have been rendered to the country. </para>

                        <para>- The revenue from the post office is not coming up to expectations, but that has no bearing upon the refusal of applications for telephone connexions. Those applications have been refused because the Government's works programme has been limited. The amount of money available for works connected with the post office and, indeed, for the Commonwealth as a whole, has had to be cut down because money cannot be procured. Additional telephone connexions cannot be made, because we have not the money with which to do the work. </para>

Then the whole matter of a loan council and a finance agreement was thoroughly gone into, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> had left that meeting heartily endorsing what had been done. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> said that was the first loan council meeting at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> was present. At that meeting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> agreed to the proposals for forming a loan council, and also to passing necessaryState legislation. When the Government which succeeded him introduced this legislation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> was the strongest opponent. In view of this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> solemnly warned <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell that his new friend might twiston him, and concluded by expressing the hope that there would be no unholy alliance between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> to smash the Loan Council"? </para>

                    <para>.- I protest against the' adjournment of the House until Wednesday of next week. . Parliament was called together on the 30th October, and consequently members from  distant States have now been at Canberra and away- from their homes for five *weeks, and, because of the indecision of the Government, it appears that "we may be here another five weeks without accomplishing anything definite, notwithstanding that the business on the notice-paper is so trifling that it could easily be disposed of to-day. What has this Parliament accomplished since it met on the 30th October? It is true that we have passed a few bills; but they really mean nothing. Apart from the tabling of tariff schedules by the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> no definite attempt has been made to cope with the present situation. The Ministry should take control of the House, and conduct its business, as has been the case in the past. It is absurd that we should meet only two or three days a week, and then adjourn for another week. I understand that the members of another place are not to meet until next Wednesday. I protest most emphatically against the tactics adopted by the Government. In view of the serious position of the country, one would have expected the Government to face the position bravely, and make an honest attempt to deal with it. It is all moonshine to say that it is necessary to adjourn until Wednesday next, unless, of course, the Government does not desire to accomplish anything at all. I protest against the way in which honorable members have been humbugged and against the expense associated with keeping this Parliament sitting without anything definite being accomplished. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the protest of the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay).</inline> The Government adopted an unusual course when it called Parliament together on a Thursday to continue the session. It is evident that that day was chosen to suit the convenience of the Labour caucus which was then endeavouring to formulate a policy. Indeed, ever since Parliament assembled, the Labour caucus has been struggling to frame a policy to place before the House, but so far it. has not been successful, and is still floundering. The sittings of the last month . have been the . most futile, humiliating and puerile in the history of this Parliament. If the business which we have been called together to transact is as important as we have been led to believe - and there is no question of the urgent necessity for doing something - we should not have to wait until next Wednesday before resuming our sittings. Every person in the community, with the exception of the members of the Labour caucus, realizes the necessity for Parliament doing something to stem the financial drift. Instead of doing nothing, Parliament should do its work, and then allow members from distant States to reach their homes for Christmas. I protest against this continued delay. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel that the Government is acting unfairly in proposing to adjourn from to-day until Wednesday next. Parliament was called together on the 30th October, only to sit for a few minutes that day before adjourning for practically another week. The Government should give consideration to the position of honorable members who represent remote constituencies; some of them travelling 2,700 miles to get to Canberra. One would not object to being brought here if the Government allowed Parliament to settle down to business; but, instead of doing so, it indulges in dilly-dallying tactics which get the country nowhere. We are now approaching Christmas, and those of us whose constituencies are in distant States, desire to return to them in order that they may give personal attention to the many needs of our constituents. Those whose constituencies are close at hand, can attend to their business over week-ends. It is unfortunate that the Government party is split into so many factions, with the result that there can be no united effort on the part of honorable members opposite to assist the country out of the serious position in which we now find it. I protest against this unnecessary adjournment until Wednesday next. </para>

                    <para>. - I. desire to voice my protest against the haphazard way in which the Government is conducting the business of the country. There is not the slightest justification for the House' not meeting on Tuesday next. Cabinet has frequently met in Melbourne at a weekend, and the business of the country has still been conducted in this chamber. Apparently, there is to be the usual performance of the " Brawlers' opera " in " cawk-ass ", and the business of the country is to be heldup in consequence. I put it seriously to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> that if the ramshackle contraption in this Parliament that terms itself a "Ministry" does not take care, it will fall to pieces before much longer. </para>

As the result of inquiries that i have caused to be made, I have been informed that the company proposes to vary the itinerary of three of its vessels which provide a shipping service between Australia, Manila, Hong Kong and Japan, so as to include Rabaul as a port of call, and to omit Cairns, Thursday Island and Sandakan. The three vessels concerned are registered as follows : The <inline font-style="italic">Nellore,</inline> Greenock ; the <inline font-style="italic">Tanda,</inline> Glasgow; and the <inline font-style="italic">St. Albans,</inline> London. It is not intended that the Government shall grant any subsidy in connexion with this alteration. </para>

                <para>That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para>This bill provides for the variation of the sinking fund law on the lines announced in the financial statement that was delivered by me on the 5 th of November. The national debt sinking fund was established in 1923 to provide for the redemption of Commonwealth debt. It was designed to pay off the post office debt in 30 years and war and other debt in 50 years. The act, as originally framed, provided for the Treasurer paying the necessary contributions from revenue to the sinking fund. These annual contributions amounted in the case of post office debt to 30s. per cent. of the debt. On war and other debt the annual contribution was to be 10s. per cent. of the debt. All these sums were to be accumulated at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum. The annual contributions thus payable to the sinking fund, compounded at 5 per cent. per annum on the basis provided in the law, would have sufficed, without any other assistance, to redeem the Commonwealth debt within the periods provided for in the act. </para>
                <para>In addition to the contributions referred to, other moneys are payable to the sinking fund under the present sinking fund law. These sundry additional payments would, if continued, provide for paying off the debt in a much shorter period- than that originally contemplated. The most important of these excess contributions are reparation moneys and half the profits of the Commonwealth Bank. Moreover, £7,415,755 of surplus revenue has been applied to the redemption of debt since the establishment of the sinking fund. Though debt to that amount has been paid off from the surplus revenue, the contribution to the sinking fund of 10s. per cent. on the whole debt has been continued and would, under the law as it now stands, be continued for the full 50-year period. While these generous payments towards the redemption of our debt could be readily justified in times of abundant revenue, the continuation of such heavy contributions, in present circumstances, would place an undue and unnecessaryburden on the taxpayers of Australia. The position is that in flic last seven years the sinking fund received considerable sums in the way of windfalls. lu our present financial position, we cannot continue to provide windfalls for the sinking fund, and we are fairly entitled fo put the fund buck on the basis of 30 and <inline font-style="italic">;&gt;Q</inline> years, as originally planned. In each of the last two years the actual provision for Commonwealth debt redemption has exceeded £6,000,000. The amount for 1928-29 was £6,230,000. For 1929-30. £6,422,000 was provided. For the present year provision under the law as it now stands was estimated nt £6,S50,000. These figures include payments to the British Government in redemption of our war indebtedness to Great Britain. There is a separate law for the redemption of our debt to the British Government, and payments to that Government are made directly from, revenue, and do not pass / rough our sinking fund commissioners. </para>
                <para>It must not be forgotten that, though the Commonwealth has had a sound debt redemption scheme for seven years, it lias been incurring new debt for new works at the same time as it has been redeeming old debt from the sinking fund. An important stage was reached in bur sinking fund operations last year, when, for the first time, the debt redeemed from sinking fund considerably exceeded new debt created as a result of new borrowing. Even on the reduced basis of sinking fund provision now contemplated we shall be paying into debt redemption this year considerably more than we shall be spending on new loan works. In other words, the sinking fund is doing the work which it was intended to do, and, up to the present time, lias paid off an additional £14,000,000. </para>
                <para>In  considering the Commonwealth sinking fund law it is important to remember that the bulk of the Commonwealth debt is war debt. Australia is doing as much as can reasonably be expected in paying off this debt over a 50-yoar period. As a matter of interest and comparison, I may point out that the debt of Great Britain to the United States of America, and the war debts of the allies to Great Britain, are being repaid over a period of 62 years, whereas the Commonwealth, even under the amended arrangement authorized in this bill,  Will  repay her war debt over a period of 50 years. As regards the non-war debt, approximately half was incurred for post office, telegraph and telephone works, and these amounts are being amortized over a period of 30 years. </para>
                <para>In the light of all these facts the Government considers there is ample justification for adjusting the sinking fund to the original basis of 30 and 50 years, particularly at a time like the present, when Commonwealth and State budgets disclose deficits. The bill therefore provides that only so much as is necessary to carry out this plan shall be paid to the National Debt Commission during each financial year. When discussing the financial statement the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> suggested that provision btmade to ensure that reparation payments and profits from the Commonwealth Bank should continue to go towards debt redemption. The bill makes the provision, but the annual revenue contribution now provided for will be reduced so that the fund will only receive in each year the appropriate amount dm1 in: that year for the redemption of the debt on the 30 and 50-year plan. If Commonwealth ' Bank profits fail to provide sufficient money to redeem the debt, in the 30 and 50-year' period, additional sums from general revenue will have to bc contributed. This, I think, meets the point raised by the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>- No ; it will date from 1923. The result of this adjustment in the sinking fund contributions for the present year will be a reduction in the revenue contributions of approximately £1,950,000. The amount which will still be available for Commonwealth debt, redemption this year will be £4,900,000. which sum will exceed the amount of loan money expended. </para>

                <para>I, strongly resent the suggestion that these proposals represent a raid on the sinking fund. Statements of that nature are altogether unwarranted. They serve no good purpose, and are liable to damage the credit of Australia, because, as I have shown, we are maintaining a sinking fund that will compare favorably with sinking funds established by governments in other countries. We are continuing to give effect to the intention of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- We are not taking  a  bit more out. The Commonwealth,when it established the national debt sinking fund, contracted to pay off its debts in. periods of 30 and 50 years. This hill does not interfere with that arrangement; it merely places the sinking fund on a basis which will carry out the original intention of Parliament when the existing law was passed. To make unnecessary calls on taxpayers to the extent of nearly £2,000,000 a year would, in the present condition of finance, be wrong. The sinking fund position of the Commonwealth is sound. The moneys provided for debt redemption in. the first seven years of the scheme far exceed the provision contemplated. No country appears to be doing more relatively for the redemption of its debt. In order to ensure that the proposals contained in the bill shall provide for the redemption of the Commonwealth debt within the periods of 30 and 50 years, the amendments now before the House have been submitted to actuarial examination. The actuary attached to the Commonwealth Superannuation Board, after completing his examination, has stated that the sums to be paid under the scheme in this bill will provide for the redemption of the debt as desired. </para>

                <para>The adjustment proposed in the bill does not in any way affect the sinking fund for State debts established under the financial agreement.

                    <para>. - I appreciate the action of the Acting Treasurer in submitting this alteration ; but I do not think that he has gone far enough. The exemption should really be £300, so that the present position would be unaltered. There is no reason why discrimination should be shown in taxation he.tween personal exertion income and income from property. Those who are dependent on income from property are frequently unable to perform any work at all, and, therefore, could not have an income from personal exertion. The whole purpose of exemption was to meet such cases. I cannot see why there should be any difference in taxation between a man earning £300 per annum, and another, who is unable to work, drawing £300 per annum from property. Therefore, I regret that the Government has not seen fit to retain the exemption of £300. Still, £200 is, to my mind, much better than £100, and I, therefore, accept the Government's proposal. Subsequently, I intend to submit an amendment, the effect of which would be to make the exemption disappear less rapidly than is now provided for. As the clause stands, the exemption of £100 disappears entirely when the income reaches £200. Under the amendment proposed by the Acting Treasurer, an exemption of £200 will disappear entirely at £400, which, I think, is far top low a figure. I suggest that the disappearing point should be £S00, because between £600 and £800 the amount of exemption to be granted will be very small. My desire is that the exemption shall be £200, less £1 for every £3 by which the income exceeds £200. That would remove much of the inequality to which I referred yesterday. Under this bill an income of £350 from property will have to bear increased taxation to the extent of 2,900 per cent. That is a staggering increase, which should surely be avoided. The amount of tax that would be lost by a reduction of the tax on the lower incomes would be relatively small. The taxation of the higher incomes will not be affected by the exemption. On incomes of £800 per annum and upwards there will be no exemption, and every penny will be taxed. Consequently, I desire that persons with the lower grades of incomes should be placed in a position equivalent to those with the higher incomes.

                    of £500 per annum, amounts to about 1,000 per cent, and on incomes of £750 per annum, about 600 per cent. I trust that the Treasurer will be able to accept the amendment that I shall submit.

                    <para>. - I support the amendment. The clause deals solely with the exemption, and does not, in any way, affect persons with large incomes. Those who are affected are persons with comparatively small incomes, say £250, £300 or £350 per annum. I have no objection to a differentiation between the rate of tax charged on income obtained by personal exertion, and that on income obtained from property; but that is an entirely different matter from exemption from taxation, and the two should not be confused. There is no justification for differentiation with regard to the amount of exemption, even though different rates of taxation are charged, according to the source of the income. I have not protested against the reduction of the exemption from £300 to £200, because a reduction to £100 was at first proposed, and I realize, in regard to the amendment just made, that half a loaf is better than no bread; but none the less I strongly hold the view that the exemption allowed should be the same, regardless of source of income. What is the object of allowing exemption from income taxation? It seems to me that it is to ensure that a taxpayer shall be allowed to retain a sufficient amount of his income free from tax to permit him to meet reasonable living expenses. If that is so, surely it cannot be contended that an income of £200 from property is equal in purchasing power to an income of £300 from personal exertion. It will not be contended seriously, of course, that £1 for £1, the income from the one source is worth any more than the income from the other,. For this reason I submit that there is no justification whatever for any differentiation in the amount of exemption in the case of the two classes of income. But a differentiation is'- being made in two ways. First, the amount of  exemption is being reduced, and, secondly, the exemption is being made to disappear at a more rapid rate in the case of income from property than in that Of income from personal exertion. This, in my opinion, is harsh treatment of the taxpayer who enjoys a small income from property. His exemption will totally dis- appear when his income reaches £400, while a taxpayer who obtains his income from personal exertion will enjoy some degree of exemption until his income reaches £1,200. This is a very strong argument in favour of the amendment. </para>

                <para>I do not know whether the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Page)</inline> feels happy at having the support of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cusack)</inline> for his proposal. Yesterday this honorable member said that the exemption should be made to disappear more slowly, and that it .should not totally disappear until the taxpayer was receiving £800 of income. That is about the first really wise remark I have heard the honorable member make. </para>
                <para>In order to show honorable members exactly how the proposal of the Government and the amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper will affect taxpayers with small incomes, I shall submit two or three concrete illustrations. A man with an income of £350 per annum or, roughly, £6 15s. a week from property, could hardly be called a plutocrat. Under the existing law he would be obliged to pay a tax of £1 per annum, but if the exemption is reduced to £200 and it is made to disappear at the rate of £1 for £1 above that figure, he will be obliged to pay £29 8s. 4d. per annum in taxation, or 29^ times more than at present. This impost will be in addition to his State income taxation, and any taxation he may have to pay for unemployment relief and other purposes. But, although the Government proposes to place this heavy impost upon such a taxpayer, it has refused to agree to the suggestion that civil servants enjoying an income of anything below £725 per annum. shall be called upon to suffer any deduction therefrom. In the one case the taxpayer with £350 per annum will have to pay £29 8s. 4d., or an increase of 2,940 per cent, on his present rate of tax, while, in the other, the taxpayer with more than double the income of the other man, will lose nothing. A man in receipt of an income of £250 per  annum  or, roughly, £4 16s. per week, -^-little more than the basic wage - will be obliged to pay a tax of £9 2s. per annum under the present proposal of the Government. This is nearly equivalent to two full weeks of income. A man with an income of £300 per annum or, roughly, £5 15s. per week, which is still a comparatively low income, will be obliged to pay under this proposal, £18 13s. lid. in taxation, although his income is only about two-fifths of the income of some civil servants, who, in the opinion of the Government, should be exempt from any special impost. These cases show how harsh this proposal actually is. </para>
                <para>The amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper would reduce these exactions to some extent. If the amendment is adopted, the disappearance of the exemption will be at the rate of £1 in every £3. Taxation paid by a person receiving £250 a year, or £4 16s. a week, would be £6 instead of £9 2s. ; on £300 a year, or £5 15s. a week, about £12 instead of £18 13s. lid. ; and on £350 a year, or £6 15s. a week, £18 13s. lid. instead of £29 8s. 4d. I do not believe that there should be any discrimination in exemptions and the rate at which they disappear, but I admit that there i3 some justification for a higher rate of taxation on unearned increment than on income from personal exertion. An exemption is granted simply to enable a person to have sufficient income free from taxation to enable him to meet his ordinary expenses. Surely it cannot be contended that there should be any differentiation in the exemption as between income from property and from personal exertion. Yet, although I contend that there should be no distinction, I arn prepared to accept a reasonable compromise. As I regard the amendment moved by the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> to raise the exemption from £100 to £200 as something in the nature of a compromise, I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Cowper, under which the lower exemption will disappear at the same rate as the exemption on income from personal exertion. I support the amendment, and trust that the Minister will accept" it. </para>

                    <para>.- The proposals embodied in this bill indicate the enormous increase in taxation imposed by this Government as compared with the general decrease in taxation provided in the legislation passed by the late Government. It is important that the people should understand exactly what they have to pay for an absence of economy from Commonwealth administration. I propose to quote three or four examples to show how taxation on income from property will be increased. On an income of £250 a year from property I find that in 1921 - a year in which taxation was heavy - the federal income tax payable was £7 15s. 9d.; by 1928, on the same income, it had been reduced to £4 18s. 7d.; but, under this measure, and allowing for the amendmentjust adopted, it will be £24 3s. 5d. Summarized, the position is as follows: - In 1921 it was £7 15s. 9d.; 1928, £4 18s. 7d.: and 1930, £24 3s. 5d. On an income from property of £500the figures are:- 1921, £20 9s.7d.; 1928. £12 19s. 3d.: and in 1930, £51 15s. 2d. On an income of £750:- 1921, £43 3s. 9d.;1928, £27 6s. 9d.; and 1930, £90 16s.8d. </para>

                        <para>- Between 1921 and 1928 taxation on the incomes I have mentioned and on all other incomes from property was substantially reduced; but in each of the cases I have mentioned it is now being substantially increased. In one instance it is double and in another it is nearly three times as much as was paid in 1921. The result will be to impose a heavy burden upon a large number of thrifty persons in the community, who, with a high degree of self respect, have saved sufficient to render themselves independent of any assistance from the State. Even with the modification now suggested by the Treasurer, the immediate effect will be to impose great hardshipupon the people. Surely there is a much better way to deal with the matter than adopting proposals of this character. I do not intend toenterupon a general discussion of taxation matters, but surely it would be preferable to exercise economy along some of the lines suggested  by  the  Opposition  than to inflict the heavy taxation now proposed. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that it would be more equitable to reduce these taxes than to continue to pay a maternity allowance of £5 to women whose husbands are in many cases in receipt of incomes of £1,000 a year. That cannot be justified at present, and a modification of the maternity allowance would prevent the imposition of unnecessarily heavy taxation on an important section of the community. I support the amendment. </para>

In asking the Acting Treasurer to accept the amendment, I am not making an appeal in the interests of the wealthy section of the community, but on behalf of those who are deriving incomes of from £200 to £300 a year from property; incomes not equal to those of many trade unionists. As pointed out by the honorable member for Gippsland, the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cusack)</inline> has expressed views similar to those of honorable members on this side of the chamber, and I am sure that a number of those supporting the Government will admit that its proposals are unreasonable. If the amendment is adopted, it will benefit a large number, and will not affect the revenue to any great extent. </para>

Probably, if I were in a less responsible position,I would be speaking against the tax, but knowing that the Commonwealth must obtain additional revenue, I, as Acting Treasurer, am compelled to ask the people to make sacrifices that I would not otherwise suggest. I have already made a substantial concession to those who have asked for a higher exemption, and the amendments which the Government is proposing will reduce the estimated revenue from this tax by one-third. In other words, we are surrendering £500,000. </para>

                        <para>- It would have come from various classes. I refer particularly to the abandonment of the double taxation of income from property. Under the bill as drafted, companies would pay taxation on their income from property, and when the dividends were distributed to the shareholders, they also would pay taxation at the property rate. The Government has agreed that such income should be taxed only once, and that is a substantial concession. I regret that some honorable members of the Opposition should suggest that there is something vindictive in the proposals of the Government. No honorable member on this side of the chamber would desire to impose these rates if they were avoidable. In fact, I know that they are anxious to afford further relief to the smaller taxpayers, and I am prepared to compromise with the mover of the amendment. If he will substitute " every two pounds " for " every three pounds ", I shall accept the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">Presumably, a rates measure will be introduced to give effect to that proposal: but is it not necessary,in this assessment bill, to provide definitions of income from personal exertion and income from property? It is all very well to say that later, in a rates measure, certain taxation will be imposed on income derived from property; but what does that mean? A company isa corporation, that is, an artificial, legal person, and, as such, is incapable of personal exertion. In the familiar phrase, it " has neither body to be kicked nor soul to be damned." Not possessing a body, it has not hands to work with. It is, therefore, difficult to apply to a company the idea of the taxation of income derived from personal exertion. Section 4 of the Income Tax Assessment Act contains a long definition, setting out certain classes of income as income from personal exertion. Income from property is defined as meaning all income from sources in Australia not derived from personal exertion. Accordingly, all income is income from property unless it can be shown to be income from personal exertion. If a special tax of 71/2 per cent. is to he imposed on the income of a company derived from property, it will be necessary to examine all the items of a company's profits, and to consider whether they do or do not fall within the definition of income from personal exertion. Income from personal exertion covers " earnings." Perhaps a company could have earnings, but I doubt whether it could receive a " salary " or " wages ". It could receive " commission ", " fees"; and " bonuses ", hut not a " pension ", " superannuation allowance ", or " retiring allowance ". Income from personal exertion includes the proceeds of any " business carried on by the taxpayer ". When certain requirements of the Companies Acts have been satisfied, a company commences business, and it would be difficult to suggest that anything it did in accordance with its memorandum of association was not " carrying on business." Practically everything that a company does can be said to be the carrying on of business. If that view were adopted by the court, then practically all the income of a company is income derived from " business carried on by the taxpayer ", that is, by the company. Therefore, the taxation of a company's income from property might produce nothing. Even the making of investments is part of the business of a company when there is power conferred on the company by the memorandum of association to invest money. The House of Lords has held that full effect must be given to all objects contained in the memorandum of association. Everything done under it is part of the business of the company, and if there is power, as there generally is, to invest money, then that is part of the business of the company. So, if the definition of income from personal exertion is left untouched, most, if not all, of the income of a company will be income from personal exertion. It may be that the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has an answer to what I have said. I am raising the question now in order that there may be full opportunity to consider it. Attention should be given to the point, because there seems to be a risk of the Government being seriously disappointed in the amount of revenue that it hopes to obtain from this source. At any rate, there is a risk of much litigation, which, I am sure, is not the desire of honorable members. The Government should take pains to see that no doubt exists. Obviously, as the impost is so heavy, if there is a loophole in the legislation, full advantage will be taken of it. It appears to me difficult to dealwith this question satisfactorily in the rates bill - of course, I have not seen that bill. The provisions of clause 2a, and any provisions which involve the distribution of the income of a company as income from personal exertion, and income from property, will increase enormously the present difficulty and expense of complying with income tax requirements. It will mean dissecting the accounts of all Australian companies carrying on  business  here, picking out the items of income derived by the companies from property, and distinguishing them from those derived from personal exertion, accurately allocating deductions in the way of expenses and other matters, and calculating income tax payable on two different bases. Then there is the passing on of the rebate of the tax paid by the company to the shareholders, who will have included the amount of their dividends in their income tax returns. One could almost wish himself an accountant Or a taxation expert in order to have an opportunity of working in the new field of employment which will be opened up by this legislation. </para>

                        <para>- No. They are new difficulties arising from the necessity, in order to apply the taxation proposals of the Government, for distinguishing, in the case of a company, between income derived from personal exertion and that derived from property. I am not at all sure that there is a distinction between the two, but the work of dissecting accounts on this new basis will require the employment of scores of additional clerks and accountants in the Taxation Department, and of taxation advisers, accountants and solicitors outside. I am inclined to think that in a year or two the work of the department will be hopelessly in arrears. How, for instance, can these new considerations bo worked in with the averaging system? Without having seen the rates bill it appears to me that there is a real risk of legal trouble arising, and, in the best spirit, and not with any party object, I invite the Acting Treasurer to consider these matters very carefully. </para>

                    <para>That the following new clause be inserted: - 1a. Section 4 of the principal act is amended by inserting in the definition of " Income from personal exertion," after the word, " money," the words, " or disposing of goods by hire-purchase". </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">This new provision is designed to meet the special position of interest that accrues under hire-purchase agreements. That interest, under the existing definition, is classed as income from property, although, actually, it is not in the nature of income from property. When one examines the line of demarcation that has been drawn, one notes that income from personal exertion was intended to comprise income derived from some sort of activity or industry ; and, on the other hand, income from property connotes the ownership of some sort of property, whether it be real property, shares in companies from which dividends are received, or interest from investments such as mortgages, bonds, and the like. It will readily be seen that the interest which accrues under hire-purchase agreements does not really fall within the category of income from property. Hirepurchase agreements contain a provision for the payment of interest at certain periods, ordinarily monthly or quarterly. Usually, the rate of interest is stated at  8  per cent. or  10  per cent. ; but if regard be had to the periods of payment, the amount of interest in nearly every case works out at very much more than that stated in the document,  8  per cent. rising to  15  per cent. and  10  per cent. to  18  per cent. That does not mean that a person who sells goods under a hire-purchase agreement receives those profitable rates. The fact is, that in these transactions, it is the practice to include in the interest rate a very considerable proportion of the gross profits of the business that is being carried on, and the interest goes towards making provision for general overhead costs, such as the cost of warehousing, advertising, selling, &amp;c. In the majority of businesses the aim of the proprietor is to turn over his capital five times in a year; that is generally regarded as a fair average for a substantial business. </para>

                <para>Mr.NAIRN - Certainly, it is turned over more than once a year ; any business that could not do so, would not be able to carry on. I believe that, in nearly all businesses, the proportion to capital of what may be termed overhead costs, works out at from something like  30  per cent. to  40  per cent. of the gross return. Therefore, the amount of interest payable under a hire-purchase agreement is no index of the actual profits made from the hire purchase business. If persons who sell motor vehicles, sewing machines, farming implements, &amp;c, under hire-purchase agreements, are to be charged71/2 per cent.  on the interest as expressed in every transaction, they will be charged over and over again on their  income  for the year. The only fair method is to treat this as a business in which money is employed for the purpose of the business, and to levy taxation, not on the gross amount of interest which the taxpayer receives, but on the net amount of profit which he makes out of his business. That principle is recognized in the principal act, in which the definition of "Income from personal exertion " reads - ' Income from personal exertion " or income derived by any person from personal exertion " means income consisting of earnings, salary, wages, commission, fees, bonuses, pensions, . . . aud the proceeds of any business carried on by the taxpayer </para>
                <para class="block">The interest earned under a hire-purchase agreement would come under the heading of "proceeds of any business carried on by the taxpayer and would be returned :as income from personal exertion were it not for the concluding portion of the definition, which refers to interest, and reads - but does not include interest, unless the taxpayer's principal business consists of the lending of money </para>
                <para class="block">There is a recognition of the principle which I contend should find expression in this bill. The principal act recognizes that the money-lender or pawnbroker ought not to be charged taxation on the gross amount of interest that he receives during the year, but only on the profits that he makes in the employment of the money which returns him the interest. Hire-purchase agreements are in exactly the same category, because the person who sells goods under such agreements uses his capital in connexion with his business. But the interest he gets on the several transactions does not represent the profits he makes on his capital. The only fair method of taxing these persons is to tax them on the actual profit they make out of their business. This amendment, if carried, will not have the effect of granting specially favorable treatment to persons selling goods under a hire-purchase agreement. They should, of course, be required to pay a tax on their profits in the same way as other people have to do, but they should not be taxed on what does not constitute profit at all. The shareholder who receives a dividend will receive it as income from property, and he will very properly be taxed at the property rate; but while the money is in the hands of the company - the " undertaker " or corporation carrying on the business - the gross interest received  on hire-purchase sales should not be treated as income from property. I feel sure that the Acting Treasurer will realize that if the provision remains unamended it will have the effect of mopping up probably the whole of the profit arising from hire purchase businesses. Of course, such a situation could bc met by the traders striking out interest altogether from their calculations, and increasing the nominal price of the article so as to include interest. Many hire-purchase agreements are, however, still extant, and grave injustice will be inflicted upon those who sold goods under such agreement unless the clause is amended. </para>

If the amendment were accepted, and the interest received in respect of hire-purchase sales were regarded as the reward of personal exertion, there would be no logical reason why the same should not be done in the case of interest on business accounts. That would involvea very substantial loss of revenue which the Commonwealth Treasury is not able to afford. In 1922 the last Government decided, with the approval of Parliament, to exclude all interest. except money-lenders' interest, from the definition of income from personal exertion, and to treat it as income from property. The Government at that time was, to some extent, anxious to get more revenue, but it; was particularly anxious to avoid the administrative difficulties associated with the then existing system. Those difficulties would crop up again if this amendment were accepted. The Government has given full consideration to the representations which have been made on this matter, but it can see no reason why the amendment should be accepted. I trust that the committee will not agree to it. </para>

                <para class="block">This clause is necessary in consequence of a. proposal which will be introduced by resolutionin Committee of Ways and Means for an additional tax of1s. 6d. in the £ 1 on income from property. Those proposals apply to companies as well as to individuals; but they do not apply to  dividends paid to the shareholders of a company out of income upon which the company has paid the additional tax of 1s. 6d. in the £1. As shareholders are thus exempted from the additional tax in respect of such dividends, it is necessary to provide that they shall not be entitled to any rebate of the additional tax paid by the company on the income out of which those dividends are paid. If this amendment is not made, those who are not taxable at all under ordinary circumstances would be entitled to claim a rebate. Persons who are exempt from the payment of tax should not be entitled to claim rebate in respect of it. </para>

                    <para>.- I ask the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> to make clear what will be the actual effect of this clause. Sub-section 4 of clause 20, to which he referred, is a general section dealing with rebates to shareholders who receive dividends representing the distribution of profits on which a company has already been taxed. It is proposed in future, I understand, to collect company tax, which now stands at1s. 4d. in the £1 on taxable income, and also another tax of71/2 per cent. on income derived by the company from property. The object of the amendment, so far as I can make out, is to prevent shareholders who have not paid any tax from obtaining a rebate in respect of the 71/2 per cent. tax on property. If we look at sub-section 4 of section 20, however, we see that the effect of the introduction of these words will be to limitthe application of the section to assessments for the  financial year prior to. the 1st of July, 1923. This section is a general rebate section, so that after the date mentioned there can be no rebate to shareholders in respect of taxes paid by companies. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the honorable member is wrong. In 1923 the act was amended, and since then taxation has been imposed year by year whether the dividends were distributed or not. Upon a literal application of the provisions of section 20 (4) of the principal act, a shareholder to whom a company pays a dividend out of income upon which it paid the proposed additional tax, would be entitled to a rebate of that tax. Those proposals, however, are merely a survival of the law as it stood when companies were only taxed on so much of their incomes as they did not distribute to their shareholders. While the law so stood, it was necessary to provide for a rebateto shareholders when the company distributed income upon which it had paid tax. In 1923 the basis of company taxation was altered, and tax became payable on the whole of the taxable income of a company without regard to any distribution of that income. Appropriate rebates of tax paid by a company on the new basis were provided for by the provisos- following section 16 <inline font-style="italic">b.</inline> (iii) of the principal act. It was, nevertheless, necessary to retain the provisions of section 20 (4), to provide rebates to meet the case of dividends paid out of income upon which the company had paid tax at the high rates in force under the old law.. It was still necessary to retain that provision ; but, in order that it shall not be invoked for a purpose for which it was not intended, namely, to obtain rebates of the new property tax, it has become necessary to amend the provision by inserting a clear declaration that it shall only apply to distribution by a company out of income upon which the company has paid tax under the old law, that is, the law in force for assessments for financial years prior to 1923-1924. New clause 1a is an amendment which will have that effect. </para>

                    <para>.- The doubt which has been cast upon the effect of this clause by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> makes it imperative that very close consideration  be given,, to it. It seems probable that if it is. allowed to go through, in its. present, form a good many hundreds of thousands, of pounds will be paid away to lawyers in the course of litigation which will ensue. Suppose the income of a company amounts to, £100^000 a year, and of this <inline font-style="italic">£80,f)00</inline> is due to personal exertion, and £20,000 is derived from other sources. If the company distributes only £50,000 or £60,000, how is any one to determine whether the distribution to a shareholder is made from the £20,000 derived from property, or from the £80,000 derived from what will be described as the personal business of the company? How is it to be determined? Has any machinery been devised for the purpose? Will it be settled on a proportionate basis? Before we can consider this complex matter we ought to know what is in the mind of the department in regard to it. What disturbs me is that the taxpayer or shareholder who has not internal knowledge of the working of the company, and does not know where its dividends come from, will be absolutely in the hands of the Taxation Department. He will not know whether he has been given a fair rebate or not. I should like to see more machinery clauses introduced in order that this matter may be put beyond doubt. Is the object of the Government to prevent the shareholders of a company from obtaining a rebate in respect of" the income tax on property paid by the company? </para>

                        <para>- I am assured by the officers of the department that there will be no difficulty in separating the amounts into their respective categories. The important point to be remembered is that this super tax will not affect the individual except to the extent to which it reduces the dividend that he will receive from the company. The company will pay the super tax of1s. 6d. in the £1, but the dividend, after being distributed to the individual shareholder, will not bear the super tax. That will be definitely provided in the bill that is to follow. I give that assurance to the committee, and it will be carried out to the satisfaction of honorable members. If there is any doubt about the clause when it comes before the committee, honorable members need have no hesitation in suggesting methods by which it may be tightened up to ensure that no injustice shall be done. </para>

                    <para>.- It appears to me that there is a serious risk of confusion and of submitting taxpayers to an injustice if we pass the provision as it stands. Take the case of a shareholder who receives a dividend of 1s. a share from a company. For assessment purposes he at present returns the total amount of the income that he receives from property, and is allowed a rebate of the amount paid by the company in respect of the dividend received by him. It is now proposed to imposeon both companies and individuals a special tax of 71/2 per cent. on property income. Suppose that the gross income of thishypothetical company amounts to £50,000, and that the net income, after deducting expenses and the like, is £20,000. The latter amount is the taxable income, and it is to be distributed between property and. personal exertion sources. I suggest that no one in this chamber at the moment has any idea how that is to be done. The portion which is derived from property will pay the ordinary rate of1s. 4d. plus the super tax of 71/2 per cent., which amounts to1s. 6d. in the £1. The rest, which is regarded as having been derived from personal exertion, will pay the1s. 4d. rate. The shareholder will be granted a rebate of the1s. 4d. on his personal assessment, where that impost has fallen on his dividend, but no rebate of the 1s. 6d. rate. The dividend has to be distributed in some way between property and personal exertion. One would suppose that, in respect of part of that dividend of1s. per share, there would be a deduction upon the basis that the company had paid1s. 6d. plus1s. 4d. or 2s.10d. and upon the rest of the1s. there would be a deduction at the rate of only1s. 4d. The Acting Treasurer informs us, however, that instead of working it out in that way, provision is to be made that the shareholder shall not be taxed under this new provisionwhich imposes a super tax of 1s. 6d. on property income, in the case of dividends from companies. It can be worked out in that way, but, honorable members will realize that the distribution of the company income between personal exertion and property is itself an operation of some considerable difficulty. Then there will be some provision for the notional apportionment of the dividend from property and personal exertion sources, in order to determine the proper method of dealing with the matter. It may be that I am misunderstanding the position, but it appears to me that there are serious risks of complication, more particularly at the company end. If it is definitely provided somewhere that the shareholder is not to pay the super tax of1s. 6d. on his dividend, that will remove one difficulty that I have mentioned. He will then simply have to pay the1s. 4d. /rate on the whole of his dividend, whatever it may be. But, even if that provision is made somewhere else in the law, there will surely be some machinery required to apply the distinction between personal exertion and property income, in. the case of company income. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 should like to have much more information with regard to this matter, because to me it appears to bo very complex. I have in wind the case of a company with an annual income of £30,000. It holds shares in another company which returns an income of £500, and has reserves of £10,000 invested in Government stocks which return £600. Thus the total income of the company is derived from certain business returns and the actual carrying ou. of its own business. It  shows  a profit of some £3,000 per annum. It pays in dividents £1,500, and the balance of profit is taken into reserves. What I cannot understand is this: Mow will the shareholders of that company ascertain what proportion of the dividend has been taxed at the property rate of ls. 6d. in the bauds of the company? We are given to understand that one-half of the profits of the business of a company in this case is to be taxed in the hands of the shareholders, and that that will be a rebate on the dividend of the profits from property. Are the profits from property £1,100 out of £30,000 or £1,100 out of £3,000? This legislation will prove to be the most complicated ever introduced into the income tax law. By comparison, the provisions of section 21 will be extraordinarily simple. We should not allow this clause to pass without a more adequate explanation from the Minister concerning the protection to be given to shareholders of companies. Are we to understand that the Commissioner will exercise his discretion as to the allocation of the property income of a company? And what will be- the position of a company which makes a loss on its general operations and uses its property income to pay a dividend? These practical illustrations of what is likely to happen, occur readily to my mind; I should like, to hear  what the Minister has to say concerning the points which I have raised. </para>

The Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has assured us that it is not intended to levy double taxation; in other words, that mEe a company has paid 7-J per cent, taxation on its income derived from property, if it declares and distributes a dividend, its shareholders should get a corresponding rebate. If if is not intended to levy double taxation, this could be secured by refraining altogether from making any apportionment of the income in the hands of the company. Why not simply charge 7£ per cent, on the dividend in the hands of the shareholders? This would arrive at the same result without the extraordinary difficulties which have been foreshadowed by the previous speakers. </para>

                <para class="block">Section  94  of the principal act, of which section thisclause is an amendment, was inserted with the object of preventing a mortgagee from passing on his liability for income tax on the mortgage interest to the mortgagor. As it stands, the section applies only to mortgages of land. The objects of the amendments proposed innew clause  3b  are -  (1)  to extend the provision of all mortgages, as defined in section  4  of the principalact, namely, every charge, lien or encumbrance to secure the repayment of money upon which interest is payable; and  (2)  to remedy certain defects in the provision disclosed by the decision of the High Court in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Brett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barr Smith</inline> 26,  Commonwealth Law Reports, page  87.  The first object will be effected by amendment <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the new clause. Amendment <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is designed to effect the second object. It is necessary to explain the position to which that amendment relates. The class of case originally contemplated by section  94  was that in which a mortgagee stipulated in the mortgage deed that the amount payable to him by the mortgagor during each year should be such amount as would, after payment of the mortgagee's income tax on the annual interest at a specified rate on the mortgage debt, leave a clear remainder of the' amount of interest at that rate. The effect of section  94  was to render any such stipulation void, assuming the mortgage was entered into after the inception of Commonwealth income taxation. The case of <inline font-style="italic">Brett</inline> v.Barr <inline font-style="italic">Smith</inline> was a result of the efforts of conveyancers to evade the provisions of section  94.  This clause is intended to provide against what has happened in the past; but while it will clear up the position so far as existing mortgages and contracts are concerned, it cannot, of course, give protection for the future. In many of these cases, the mortgagee has not exercised his option; but,  in view of the proposed super tax, there is a fairly good indication that attempts will he made by such mortgagees to exercise their powers under contracts. This provision has been included to ensure that the collector of the interest shall pay the super tax. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 can see no objection to extending to all mortgages a provision already applying to mortgages of land. This is another incident in the long war, that has gone on for many centuries, in connexion with the law of real property, between the legislator and the conveyancer. The conveyancer often finds a way of outwitting the legislator. The Commonwealth Parliament has legislated to provide that the person who receives interest under a mortgage, that is the mortgagee, shall pay the income tax upon it, and shall not pass it on to the  mortagor.  It may be most desirable to achieve that result; but it is almost useless to attempt it, because, if the legislation were "successful, it would only mean that the rate of interest would be increased. There is nothing in this proposal. It is a thing to talk about; but it is rather a placard than anything else. If the proposal is successful, it defeats, to a very considerable extent, its own object of protecting the mortgagor ; but I admit not completely, because of the fact that income tax is graduated, and the rate paid by some mortgagees would be very much heavier than that paid by others. It is only to that extent that, after a period, the provision would be effective. I am inclined to think that the general effect of such a provision will be rather to raise the rate of interest against the mortgagor, and not to give him the advantage which it is conceived such measures confer upon him. </para>

                <para>Under section 94 of the act, it is provided that " a covenant or stipulation under a mortgage of land, which has or purports 'to have, the purpose or effect of imposing on the mortgagor the obligation to- pay income tax on the interest to be paid under the mortgage," shall be void. There are certain provisions as to mortgages made antecedent to the passing of the act. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Brett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barr Smith,</inline> the High Court had to consider a. clause drawn by a' skilled con veyancer, I think, in Melbourne, for tha purpose of meeting this provision. Honorable members who are following this debate with close attention will appreciate the point that the existing legislation applies only to a covenant which imposes an obligation to pay income tax on the interest. The clause in the mortgage in question, in the <inline font-style="italic">Brett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barr Smith</inline> case, imposes no obligation, and it is in a form which has become more or less common since the introduction of this legislation. The clause in that mortgage gave the mortgagor an option; it did not impose an obligation on him. It provided, in effect, that interest should be paid at the rate of, say, 8 per cent., provided that if the mortgagor chose to exercise the option of paying an amount equivalent tq 6 per cent., plus the income tax payable by the mortgagee on the interest received under the mortgage, the mortgagee would accept such amount in lieu of the 8 per cent. The High Court held that this section conferred only an option on the mortgagor, and. did not impose an obligation on him; in no case was he bound to pay the 6 per cent., plus income tax. Accordingly, as the rates of income tax happened to be such as to make the burden on the mortgagor less, if he accepted the option, it was accepted, and the payment made was 6 per cent, plus the income tax. Under the present clause, , an attempt is made to deal with this position. </para>
                <para>I rise, not for the purpose of discussing the provision generally, but to tell the Government that in this realm it must walk very warily, and must be quite sure that it knows where it is going.

                <para class="block">If this proposal became law. and I were not a member of this Parliament, I should confidently anticipate receiving a brief within ten days to draft a clause to get round it. One of the things I should do right away would he to make quite sure that the additional payment would not be included in the interest. This provision only applies to a covenant or stipulation which has, or purports to have, the purpose of " including " in the interest payable any income tax payable by the mortgagee. I should make a clear distinction between the interest payable and the further sum falling due, but I should probably also point out to a mortgagee that this clause makes a stipulation void only to the extent that is has, or purports to have, the effect of including income tax with the interest. Take the case of :i covenant in which a mortgagor ioveni ants to pay S per cent., or, at his option, a sum of 6 per cent., plus  income  tax. What is made void? It is i ntended, I presume, that only the part of the clause that adds the interest shall In- void. I think that there is some doubt whether the effect might .not be that, as the purpose was not to present the alternative between 8 per cent, and 6 per cent., but between S per cent, on the one hand, and fi per cent, plus "x" on the other, the whole alternative would be void. Therefore, the mortgagor might be loft by this legislation, benevolently intended to operate in his interest, under the obligation to pay S per cent., the rest of the provision being made invalid by this clause. That, of course, would produce exactly the contrary effect to that intended. I know that the draftsman has not been unaware of the risk that I am mentioning, and an effort has been made to meet the position by saying that a covenant shall be void to the extent only to which it has, or purports to have, that purpose or effect. Now that may produce the intended result. All that I am saying is that it is certainly arguable whether it does or does not do so. and that there is a risk of the mortgagor being left to pay 8 per cent. Tt is quite doubtful whether this provision, as it is drawn, is a fair piece of retrospective legislation. After all, the parties to these mortgages have, in each case, gone into the business with their eyes open, and the mortgagors know perfectly well that they have agreed to pay S per cent.. or 6 per cent., plus income tax. Why not, therefore, let the existing mortgages run out? No one intended that the money should be loaned for 6 per cent. bare. In these circumstances, is it fair to alter the law in this way? Such a provision would, of course, confer tremendous benefits upon some persons, but it is doubtful whether it is right to make it retrospective. I know of some cases in which such a provision would profoundly affect many thousands of pounds. I am rather inclined to think that in trying to determine the precise incidence of taxation in the case of mortgages, Parliament is yielding to a natural impulse which it is quite impossible to carry out effectively or fairly. Generally speaking taxation is really considered as a charge on business. A man takes into account his income taxation when he is determining the charge that he intends to make for his goods. Although many theorists assert that income taxation should not be regarded as part of the cost of a business, because it is paid out of profits, it is, in fact, taken into account in fixing charges. It is quite useless to think that consideration of income taxation is not a vital element in the determination of the details of business transactions of the kind now under notice. No law can prevent mortgagees taking income taxation into account. Having regard to the uncertainty of the effect of the proposed new provision, and to the fact that it is almost sure to be the subject of litigation if passed, it is hardly worth putting into the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - As to whether this provision will achieve the object for which it is designed, all I can say, as a layman, is that it has been very carefully drafted, and that an honest attempt has been made to meet a difficulty that has arisen. Those responsible for the drafting of the provision readily admit the soundness of the points raised by the Leader of the Opposition. . They recognize that this will deal with the case of <inline font-style="italic">Brett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barr Smith</inline> and similar cases in the future, but there can be no guarantee that it will give complete protection. I disagree with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the possible effect of, the retrospective aspect of the provision. There is not the slightest doubt that, unless something is done to protect the interests of the mortgagor, the mortgagee would get an increased benefit, for the additional income tax-, instead of being paid by the collector of the interest, would be paid by the mortgagor, which would accentuate difficulties a hundredfold. That would certainly happen unless we inserted a provision of this kind in the bill. If the provision had the effect of forcing up interest rates on mortgages, which I sincerely hope it would not have, there would he very serious difficulties ahead of this country. Unless we can get a general reduction in the rates of interest I do not know how we are going to finance the country. If the proposed now sub-section were amended by adding after the words " including in ", the words " or adding to ", would it, in the opinion of the Leader of the Opposition, be strengthened? </para>

                    <para>.- It is quite evident that we are, so to speak, handling a two-edged sword. In fact, I think, the sword has not only two edges on its blade, but four others on its handle. By our attempt to protect from the incidence of this new taxation those who are at present paying interest we arc apt to create a very difficult position for interest payers for the future. The Acting Treasurer has just suggested that certain words should be added to the proposed new sub-section in the hope that it will meet a situation which the Leader of the Opposition has suggested may occur if the sub-section is passed in its present form. Had the subsection been agreed toas printed, the only alternative for a mortgagee would have been to pay 8per cent. or 6 per cent. plus tax, which would have meant £6 9s. per cent. The amendment, it seems to me, would take away the alternative from him. At any rate, he would no longer be able to exercise it. There is, in my opinion, an extraordinary danger about this whole matter. In the light of my own bitter experience in these matters, 1 urgently suggest to the Acting Treasurer, that instead of agreeing hurriedly to the insertion of certain words in a carefully drafted provision, he should give us an undertaking that if the provision isagreed to he will carefully consider theeffect of the proposed addition before the bill is passed by another place. Otherwise, everybody may rue the insertion of these words, which may have a result that nobody ever intended. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I would prefer, however, that the Government should take its courage in both hands and drop the whole provision, because in my opinion, it is dangerous. The ultimate effect of it must be thein creasing of interest rates. I do not. see how anything in the world can prevent that result if the provision is passed. While the provision may have a good, helpful effect temporarily, from thepoint of view of some people, it must undoubtedly have unfortunate effects subsequently, because money will always beinvested where the best return can besecured from it. If we place obstacles in the way of the investment of money in Australia, which will prevent investorsfrom obtaining what they regard as a fair return, they will simply invest their - money in other places where such difficulties do not exist. I urge the Government to consider whether this provision is justified. Personally, I think that it has been inserted merely to show others who are making sacrifices that those receiving interest should also contribute their share. It is all right if the Government can get away with it; but the difficulty will bo to obtain any revenuefrom this source. A person wholoaned money to the Commonwealth at 3 per cent. some years ago had to continuereceiving that rate, although interest increased to 6 per cent. The Government did not grant him an additional 3 percent., and it cannot now reasonably deduct 11/2 per cent. or 2 per cent. by imposingtaxation in this form which in essence isa form of repudiation. The position issurrounded with all sorts of legal difficulties. The provision can apply only toexisting contracts, and the only result will be to force up the rate of interest. I sincerely trust that the Government will consider the alternative of substantially reducing expenditure so that thismeasure will be unnecessary. </para>

                    <para>.- One can only make a guess at the effect of the amendment moved by the Acting Treasurer. The clause covers assessments for the current and subsequent years. Why should not the other provisions also apply only to those assessments? Surely it is not proposed to reconsider the past assessments of mortagees or mortgagors  who  have transacted business in terms of the mortgage and who have been assessed and have paid the tax? Is the Minister suggesting that these covenants shall be void in the sense that they shall always be deemed to becapable of being assessed retrospectively? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand the meaning of the amendment. A measure comes into force from the day on which it has received the Governor-General's assent. I see the necessity for clause 4 in its original form, because some assessments for this year have perhaps been made, and it is desired to provide that these amendments shall apply to all assessments for this year. There should not be a purely casual or arbitrary distinction between assessments for the current year. That is the object of clause 4. Why should not the clause also apply in a like measure to these mortgages ? I cannot appreciate the necessity for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Between fourteen and sixteen members have spoken on this bill, and every one, with the possible exception of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cusack),</inline> whose speech I did. not hear, but who asked for an. amendment, condemned it. Although a dozen members spoke from the Opposition side, we were not able to stimulate a supporter of the Government to say a word in defence of the hill. Not one of them has pretended to reply to our criticisms. I propose to set out shortly the facts which have been established against the measure. First, it is undeniably a breach of a definite agreement with the States that the Commonwealth would not encroach on their field of taxation. Secondly, the bill is unjust in its incidence. It proposes an  outrageous increase of the burden on thrifty people - an increase as high, as 2,900 per cent, in some cases. Thirdly, it will not produce the revenue which the Acting-Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has estimated'. He has, I admit, accepted an amendment which will reduce the anticipated returns to- some extent ; but apart from that I doubt whether the yield from this tax will be nearly what the honorable gentleman has predicted. In his financial statement the Acting-Treasurer said - </para>

                        <para>- There may be a few who are placing more to reserves as aprecaution. But whatever the reason the result is what I have stated. The experience of landlords have been the same. Rents are down at least 25 per cent, all round; many houses cannot be let at all. The moratorium provisions that are being introduced in respect of rent and interest indicate the position of persons who have fixed incomes. A recent investigation by the Melbourne Stock Exchange showed a depreciation of 40 per cent; in the dividends of a large number of leading companies. In Adelaide, the reduction was from 50 per cent, to 60 per cent. The truth is that income from property is not available for taxation, and therefore the Treasurer cannot obtain a great deal of revenue from that source. But the imposition of this further burden will undoubtedly have the effect of increasing unemployment, and that will be followed by increased demands for old age pensions. I support the contention of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Page)</inline> that the Government must make a real cut in the expenditure of the Commonwealth. That is not being- attempted now, and I shall not be surprised if, in March next, the House is asked to receive another financial statement. The delay of the Government in taking effective measures is making the position worse for all citizens, except those who desire to maintain the pretencethat they are not reducing wages or allowing standards to depreciate. The Government has not been supported from its ownside by argument ; it has been supported by votes only. It is true that some honorable members opposite: said that if they had 2'jOOO votes they would cast them against this measure, but those heroeswere absent when the division took place. I have never previously known a government that would so tolerate any attack from its supporters. Ministers say, in effect, "We are lying down; kick usagain." They seem to like maltreatment, and meekly ask for more. Except for an occasional mild interjection from the Government side, there has been no reply to the arguments of the Opposition. Only a short year ago the Labour party marched into the House, 47 strong - thestrongest single party ever returned to&gt; the Federal Parliament - with banners waving, drums beating, trumpets blaring and members singing "Solidarity for Ever." They sing no more; they do not even speak. No longer do we hear thecorridors of this building resounding with the rhythmic strains of " The Red Flag " and " Solidarity for Ever ". Now, devoid of ideas and bereft of policy, the Labour party is stumbling along aimlessly. Twelve months ago it believed itself to bean eagle ; to-day it is like a wounded duck on the ground with a large left wing, and a broken right wing, and this legislation is what this Parliament has to suffer, and the people have to tolerate, because Labour has not a policy or, if it has, does not know what it is. </para>

                            <para>- They knew the whole story because this legislation was foreshadowed in the financial statement. They knew exactly what taxation was proposed, and to what extent State realms were being encroached upon. They brought this question up and, with the exception of the newly-appointed Premier of New South Wales, offered no objection to it. The other representatives of the States were present when the undertaking was given by the Prime Minister. They passed a resolution to the effect that no further encroachment was to be made upon State realms. Since that resolution was carried, the Government has modified its taxation proposals. The original proposal was to collect an additional revenue of £1,500,000. Under this bill only £1,000,000 will be collected by way of taxation. The following table shows the effect of the compromise which was arrived at as a result of the amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Page)</inline> :  - </para>

                        <para>.- There are two points to which I wish to refer. The first is that the taxation proposals of the Commonwealth and the States should be discussed not at a meeting of the Loan Council, but at a Premiers Conference. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but the Loan Council should confine itself to its proper work - the indebtedness and borrowing policy of the Commonwealth. I am satisfied that if detailed matters such as this are dragged before the Loan Council, trouble will arise which we shall not be able to correct. My second point is that the Acting Treasurer has suggested that these proposals do not completely carry out the undertaking given at the Premiers' Conference. The particulars of that undertaking were given by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> subsequent to the Premiers' Conference. An attempt was first to be made to balance the budget by bringing about substantial reductions in expenditure. and  only when that had been accomplished was taxation to be increased, and then in such a way as not to encroach upon the field of the States. Not only has there been no reduction in expenditure, but no State Treasurer was aware of the manner in which the Government's proposals would increase the total direct taxation of the Commonwealth and the States. Under this legislation, incomes of a certain size will be taxed practically 12s. in the £1. That is a staggering imposition, and is not likely to bring about any real good; in fact, the industries and governments of this country will bo given no opportunity to recover. I regret that the Commonwealth Government has not taken the right course,and that is to reduce expenditure before increasing taxation. Ienter my protest against the whole of this legislation. </para>

                    <para>.- [ wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the position of certain primary producersin an outback part of my electorate, who are being dealt with harshly and whose treatment will result in a definite loss of revenue to the Commonwealth. The position is this : Some years ago certain farmers became subscribers to theFernbrook exchange. They bad to guarantee for three years a certain amount towards the cost of the construction, of a telephone line. They were told at the time that at the end of the guaranteeperiod,a reductionin rental charges would take place. Those three years haveelapsed and there has been no reduction in rental charges. In fact, because of an investigation of the actual mileage, the subscribers are being charged from 15s. to 30s. a year more than before. These men are suffering a reduction in their total income, and ifthe charges are increased instead of being reduced, as was promised by the department, many of them will be forced to discontinue their telephone connexion. I ask the Postmaster-General to give this matter his personal consideration, and, if possible, to continue the present rentals and thus retain for the department the revenue from the line. </para>

                    <para>. -In view of the increasing seriousness of our financial position,may I suggest to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> the advisability of convening a conference of the leaders of all parties in this House, somewhat on the lines of the consultation to take place with the Commonwealth Bank next Tuesday. The combined action and guidance of such an all-parties conference might in some way or other initiate something to the advantage of Australia, and help to steer it. into a position of financial stability. If the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> would be bigenough on this occasion to invite the loaders of the various parties to meet him and his Cabinet, nothingbut good could result; it would certainly inspire greater confidence in Australia overseas. The directors of the Commonwealth Bank, although they should be the first to be consulted, are not the only financial interests to be taken into account in regard to the terrible difficulties of Australia to-day. There are other great financial institutions in Australia, and if, in addition, an invitation to consult with them were sent by all parties here to the Bank of England and other financial institutions in Great Britain, and to the Government of Groat Britain itself, I am sure that Australia would derive some of the benefits which would have accrued to us had effect been given to the suggestions of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir OttoNiemeyer.</inline> I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will take my suggestion into his serious consideration. </para>
