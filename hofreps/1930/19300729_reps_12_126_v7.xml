So many deputations have been waiting on Ministers that the departmental stenographers have not yet had an opportunity to transcribe their notes. As soon as the transcript of the representations of the deputation regarding it is available the points raised by it will receive full consideration. </para>

                        <para>. - The Income Tax Assessment Bill is a hardy annual in this Parliament. About fifteen years have elapsed since the first of these measures was introduced, and almost every year since then it has been found necessary to amend this law. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In point of size, the measure that we are now considering is practicaly equal to the original act. Because of the detail that it contains, consideration must necessarily be given to it chiefly in committee. </para>
                    <para>I congratulate the Treasurer upon having printed an explanation of the provisions of the bill. Although such explanations do not always clarify the position, they at any rate make possible a certain understanding of the legal phraseology that is adopted. But after all it is the text of the act that governs the collection of taxation, not the explanations that accompany the measure. </para>
                    <para>I accept the general principles of most of the amendments made by this bill, which, to a large extent, were laid down by the Bruce-Page Government. During the last two years the necessity for making these amendments has gradually become more urgent. The proposed amendments naturally group themselves into six sections. First, there are amendments that are designed to express clearly the concessions that have been granted in the past by the Commonwealth Parliament to certain taxpayers, which, . on account of some legal technicality, it has not been found possible to grant. That applies particularly to co-operative societies. Other amendments are designed to tighten up the law, and to prevent concessions that have been given for a specific purpose from being used by taxpayers to whom they were never meant to apply. There is a series of amendments for the correction of anomalies that have crept into the law because consequential alterations that were rendered necessary by other amendments were not made. By other amendments an attempt is to be made to guard against the evasion of taxation, which causes a considerable loss of revenue to the Commonwealth. The provisions relating to the taxation of profits derived from the sale of leases are being revised. That principle was accepted by this House in 1924, but was rejected by the Senate, and it has not made its appearance in Commonwealth legislation since that time. Finally, it is proposed to bring ex-Australian income within the provisions of the taxation law in certain circumstances. </para>
                    <para>This last; amendment raises the most important considerations of all, because it changes fundamentally the whole character of the Commonwealth taxation law. Up to the present, that law has always been confined to iiic taxation of income that is derived within Australia. In 1927, this Parliament gave expression to its opinion that in certain directions the ex-Australian income of Australian residents should be subject to income tax. In arriving at that decision, it, undoubtedly, was influenced by the hope that a wide field of taxation and a considerable source of revenue were available for exploitation. The Bruce-Page Government promised to communicate with the other Governments of the Empire, so as to ascertain the  posilion  that was likely to arise in regard to double taxation if the Commonwealth should tax income derived from overseas. Its investigations proved that the only hope of augmenting substantially the revenues of the Commonwealth was by the imposition of double taxation on Australian citizens. The last Government was faced with this difficulty also. A few years previously a very satisfactory arrangement bad been made with the Government of Great Britain for the elimination of double taxation on. Australian residents, and the question arose as to the extent to which any new and different arrangement made with other dominions of the Empire, or with other countries, might affect the existing arrangement with the British Government, leading to its possible termination. According to the present arrangement, the British Government grants a rebate of taxation on doubly-taxed incomes to the extent of the tax levied by the Commonwealth, hut not exceeding half the British tax. Any further relief desired must be granted by the Commonwealth Government. In the majority of the cases the whole of the rebate is granted in the United Kingdom, because the Commonwealth ' rates are usually lower than those of Great Britain. The concessions made by the British Government run into several hundreds of thousands a year. Under the present system, if the Commonwealth  were  to tax Australian residents on income already being taxed by the British Government, that Government would have to allow rebates to the Australian taxpayers. This would involve a definite entrance on. the British field of taxation. The last Government, after discussing the matter fully with the Government of Great Britain, arrived at a conclusion which was set out in my budget speech of August of last year, as follows:- </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It was stated in the budget speech of 1928-29, that, in accordance with an undertaking given to Parliament in the preceding session, the Government was communicating with other governments in relation to the taxation in other countries of residents of Australia for the purpose of examining all the facts connected with the taxation of that income in those countries, and of considering the difficulties to be overcome to eliminate double taxation in the event of the Commonwealth taxing its residents on income derived from sources outside Australia. </para>
                        <para>The present income tax laws of the Commonwealth provide for the taxation of. income derived from sources within Australia, whether by residents of the Commonwealth or by persons who reside beyond the Commonwealth. Persons who derive income from sources external to Australia arc subject to the taxation laws of the countries from which the income is derived. The major portion of income derived by Australian residents from external sources is derived from the United Kingdom, where this income is subject to taxation. In certain cases income derived from sources within the Commonwealth is also subject to British taxation. An arrangement has been made with the British Government for the diminution of the hardship arising from the imposition of double taxation in such cases. The "arrangement is embodied in Commonwealth and British legislation. It is an arrangement which is regarded by the Commonwealth as fair and equitable, but which, owing to the higher rates of taxation operating in the United Kingdom, is favorable to Commonwealth revenue. It is not desired to prejudice the continuance of this arrangement unless it is reasonably certain that the adoption of a new system would not result in diminishing federal revenue and inflicting undue hardship upon Australian citizens. </para>
                        <para>In reply to the communication from the Commonwealth Government, the British Government has stated that any expansion of the scope of dominion taxation to income derived from the United Kingdom will tend to diminish the revenues of the British Exchequer, and that action in the direction of taxation of ex-Australian income will raise the question of the necessity of revising the basis upon which relief from double income tax is now allowed. The reply of the British Government invites attention to the report recently presented to the League of Nations by the Government experts on double taxation and tax evasion. It is also suggested that the subject might appropriately be reviewed' at an Imperial Conference. </para>
                        <para>In anticipation of the possibility of the question being raised at the next Imperial Conference, the Commonwealth Government isseeking further information from the governments of other dominions before finally reaching a decision on the matter. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Before adopting the system laid down in this bill, and applying to the other dominions of the Empire, or to other countries, a different standard from that which we apply to Great Britain in regard to double taxation, we should again discuss the matter fully with the British Government, which has met us with, such consideration in the past. The Prime Minister will shortly visit Great Britain to attend the Imperial Conference, and I suggest that this matter might well be held over until his return. While he is away he could take the opportunity of discussing it with the British authorities. There would still be time after his return to deal with it by legislation before the end of the present financial year, as I presume he will be back by February or March at the latest. </para>

                            <para>- But we have already entered into a different arrangement with the Government of Great Britain in regard to double taxation, and we should not make more favorable arrangements with other countries without at least consulting the British Government. I. suggest that we should take every precaution to pass the clauses of the bill which relate to this subject in a form which will not cause them to be considered unfriendly or showing lack of consideration by the British Government. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that the class of income upon which this taxation is to be levied should be defined much more clearly than it is at present. Insofar as the Government is endeavouring to impose taxation on income which is not being taxed anywhere at present, I am at one with it. I do not think that any person should be able to avoid taxation on income above the amount exempted by statute simply by investing in some other country. Every one should bear his burden of taxation in proportion to the amount, of income which he receives, irrespective of the sources from which it is derived. I ask the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> to take every possible step to see first that, no misunderstanding occurs between the British Government and the Commonwealth Government in this matter; and, secondly, that banks which are using portion of their funds in London at present, or may do so at any time, shall not have to pay taxation on the profit so made, seeing that it is taxable by the British authorities. It is desirable that the banks shall be given the fullest opportunity of meeting the exchange position in the most satisfactory way at present. It would of course be very much to the advantage of Australia if they had more money in London than they have at present. I am anxious that no income shall be taxed twice&gt; but that every possible step shall be taken to impose reasonable taxation upon persons who are at present deliberately avoiding their obligations in this regard. I trust that the Prime Minister will discuss these matters with the British authorities when he is in London, in order that there may be no possibility of misunderstanding. </para>

                            <para>- I have not very much to say in regard to the other provisions of the bill. The position of certain co-operative societies in Australia has undoubtedly been anomalous; but that has been due to accident. The fact that the shares of such societies have been quotable on the stock exchange by the terms of their articles of association has prevented them from taking advantage of certain exempt provisions of the act. I agree with the action that the Government is proposing to take to meet the position of such societies. I had given an undertaking that the previous Government would take similar steps. The organizations which are not co-operative bodies in the full sense, but are taking advantage of the co-operative exemption provisions of the act which were intended to apply only to proper co-operative organizations, should be obliged to pay taxation on the profits which result from their business. </para>

                    <para>My long experience in the Treasury has caused me to be somewhat pessimistic as to the possibility of dealing effectively with tax-evaders, but I hope that the efforts of the present Government in that regard will be more  succesful  than those of previous governments. It would he a good thing for the country if the legal profession could devise a means of drafting two sets of taxation laws, one of which would be flexible and apply equitably to those persons in the community who desire honorably to meet their taxation obligations, and the other so rigid and comprehensive as to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to deal effectively with all tax-dodgers. Unfortunately, we are subject to a constitutional limitation which prevents more than one subject of taxation being dealt with in one act, and that makes it difficult in Commonwealth legislation to deal with these people. In the past, when we have attempted to patch one hole in the wire-netting fence which surrounds our field of taxation - if I may speak in this figurative way - we have made another break in it near the old one which has been mended, and this has often allowed more and bigger rabbits to get through than were able to get through the old one. Unfortunately, every honorable person who endeavours to meet his taxation obligations, has to bear a heavier burden because of dishonorable persons who escape their liabilities in this  regard.  lt is the privilege and duty of citizens to make their fair contributions towards the expenses of government. </para>
                    <para>The ' subject of the taxation of the profits on the sale of leases is, of course, difficult to deal with. We had a big discussion on it in 1924, and, after considerable difficulty, a measure was passed through this House with the object of imposing what was considered to be reasonable taxation upon profits from this source; but it was incontinently thrown out in another place. Unfortunately, because of the manner in which the Senate dealt with the taxation measures that year, an anomaly created at that time has remained up to the present by which a' deduction has been given for the amortization of the lease while no tax has been levied on profits of sale. It seems reasonable that this provision should be reinserted. But I should like to sound a note of warning as to whether this is the right and proper way to do what is desired. The two hills were brought down together in 1924, because of the doubt that had been cast on the constitutional validity of this taxation if included in the Income Tax Assessment Act. It was held to be a taxation of capital rather than of income. I trust that in this instance the Government is absolutely certain of its ground. It seems to me that leases for agricultural or pastoral purposes should also be excluded from the provisions of the act. They are in quite a different position from hotel leases. In connexion with clause <inline font-style="italic">16h,</inline> I have already circulated an amendment to the effect that any realization of capital as a result of drought, fire, flood, or any other act of God, is not to be taken as income. I think that that amendment might readily be accepted  by the Government. The other points which I wish to raise in connexion with this bill can be dealt with in committee. </para>

I have before in this chamber stressed the importance of simplifying, if possible, our system of taxation. Since 1915 fifteen income tax assessment bills have been introduced, and five other amendments have been made. Some little time ago the Chamber of Commerce in America made special reference to this subject in remarks which are particularly appropriate to our system of taxation. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Adams,</inline> the  president  of the American Chamber of Commerce, is reported as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">Let me repeat the appeal that I have made previously in this chamber for a simplification of our income tax system, under which the taxpayer would, even in the most unpleasant circumstances, have at least the feeling that his tax had been arrived at on a fairly reasonable basis. </para>
                    <para>I wish to refer to three or four other matters, one of which is not dealt with to any extent in the bill, and is more a matter of administration; .1 refer to the interminable time which the department takes in returning to the taxpayers amounts which they have overpaid. The judges of the High Court have animadverted upon this practice because of the serious annoyance that it causes the taxpayers. If one day late in paying their tax, these are subject to a 10 per cent, fine; yet the department may retain their money for years and years, and the taxpayers can obtain no redress whatever. I suggest that as the taxpayer is subject to a 10 per cent, fine for late payment of taxes, it is only fair that he should be paid at least a bank overdraft rate of interest on money that is withheld from him by the department. I commend that suggestion to the Prime Minister. </para>
                    <para>There is in this measure a clause dealing with private companies. A further measure is to be introduced for the purpose of increasing the assessment of these private companies in certain circumstances. I propose at a later stage to suggest an amendment to fix definitely the amount of taxation which may not be exacted in cases of that kind. </para>
                    <para>Then, under section 23 of the act certain deductions are permitted, such as State income tax. In New South Wales there are three additional taxes which I submit should be deductions in respect of Commonwealth taxation; I refer to motor taxation, the tax payable in respect of family endowment, and the taxpayable under the Prevention andRelief of Unemployment Act. I suggest to the Treasurer that it is reasonable that those taxes should be deducted in the same way as is State income tax, because they are paid in exactly the same way. If they are not to be deducted, the taxpayer will be paying taxation on money that he is contributing to the Crown. I suggest that in the circumstances the amendment that I have suggested is fair and reasonable. </para>
                    <para>There seems to be some uncertainty as to whether the holders of certain loan stock, particularly the gold bond loans in America, are adequately protected, and I shall submit an amendment to safeguard their interests if the Treasurer thinks such a course necessary. In the United Kingdom, income from companies is taxed at the source. If a shareholder in an English company has been allotted £100 byway of dividend, taxation at the rate of 4s. in the £1 is deducted at the source ; consequently, he actually receives only £80.I suggest that, where British income tax is deducted from a shareholder's dividend, the net amount ho actually receives should be the amount assessable for the purposes of Commonwealth income taxation. </para>

                        <para>.- Any government that will introduce a consolidated and simplified income tax assessment act will deserve well of the people. It should be possible also by conference between the Commonwealth and the States to make the incidence of the two taxes more uniform. Although the rates of taxation of the Commonwealth and the States may differ, the taxpayer should pay on only one profit. But, because of the varying incidence of Commonwealth and State income taxation, the amount of profit on which a man is assessed for Commonwealth purposes is different from that assessed for State purposes. It almost seems as if the departments fake the taxpayers' balance-sheet to suit the taxation legislation they are administering; that is quite wrong. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The various amendments made by the last Government, supplemented by those now proposed, create in the mind of the taxpayer a great deal of confusion as to what the law actually is. Therefore, a consolidation of the Income Tax Assessment Acts is urgently necessary. This bill is mainly one for consideration in committee, but there are two or three features to which I propose to draw attention now. Organization seems to be the order of the day; unionism has been particularly approved by this Parliament; but organization costs something. In the past fees paid to such bodies as the Graziers Association, the Wheat Pooling Association, the Fruit-growers Association, &amp;c, were regarded as necessary expenditure either to secure or maintain revenue. But this bill proposes that such fees shall no longer be deducted. </para>
                    <para>In regard to other provisions, Parliament should express its mind more definitely, and not leave so much to the discretion of the Commissioner. One amendment provides that profits derived from the sale of a property may be taxable as income if, in the judgment of the Commissioner, it was purchased for sale at a profit. Who is to determine that a property has or has not been purchased with a view to selling for a profit? A man may purchase with the honest intention of retaining the property and working it. But after he has improved it, somebody offers him a profitable sale, and he parts with it for more money than he paid for it. The profit on the transaction is not income ; at most it is an accretion of capital. I recognize that a man who earns his livelihood by buying and selling property - an estate agent or a land dealer - must pay tax on his profits. But the man who bona fide buys a property for use  and subsequently disposes of it, thereby depriving himself of the means by which he earned his livelihood, is in a different category. One result of the present complicated income taxation legislation is that the taxpayer often has to pay an expert accountant more for making up his returns than he has to pay in income taxation. I have known men to pay five guineas and ten guineas to have their returns made out by an expert, and the amount of tax for which they were liable was only £2 or £3. I ask the Government seriously to consider the desirability of introducing a consolidating act as early  as  possible. </para>

                        <para>.- So far as I can discover, the main purpose of this bill is to remove anomalies and to close loopholes, whereby people have been escaping taxation. Every measure of income taxation is bound to meet with opposition; no government could devise a bill that would please all sections of the community. I remember that when the first Federal Income Tax Bill was introduced, I was engaged for about six months in trying to placate the various bodies who were protesting against it. Yet I came to the conclusion that the Commissioner was more often right than wrong. A widely-practised method of escaping taxation is the formation of private companies. By allotting one share each to a doorkeeper or a liftman and one or two others it is possible for a person to float the whole of his assets into a private company, and thus obtain the benefits that are derivable under the act. The proposal to bring Lloyds within the scope of the act meets with my approval. That company makes considerable profits in Australia, but so far has been able to avoid the payment of taxation to the Commonwealth Government, although it is exempted in Great Britain in respect of the income that it derives in Australia. All sorts of ingenious devices are employed in the attempt to escape taxation, and a great deal of ingenuity is displayed in the process. </para>

                    <para>I am quite satisfied that the Taxation Commissioner considers this measure to be absolutely necessary. Its provisions will be readily understood if honorable members will study the printed explanation that accompanies it. It is the type of measure that one would naturally  expect from a Labour Government. Many of the amendments that it proposes to make are probably opposed to the principles of the party that occupied the treasury bench for such a lengthy period prior to the advent of the present Government last October, and that may account for the delay that has occurred in the making of simple alterations that ought to have been made years ago. Australia has reached such a position that we cannot afford to adopt the suggestion of the right honorable member for Cowper to refrain from taxing ex-Australian income until the Prime Minister has had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. This Government is viewing the matter from an Australian stand-point, and if an alteration is subsequently found to be necessary, it can easily be made. I can assure the right honorable member for Cowper that if there is any loophole it will be found by Ministers of the Crown in Great Britain. </para>
                    <para>Any assistance that I can give the Treasurer to make the. bill as nearly perfect as possible will be willingly given. This is an honest attempt to improve the law, and good effects are likely to accrue from it. Those who are entitled to a remission of taxation will have their claims fairly met, but every effort will be made to see that those who are wrongfully evading the payment of taxation at the present time are prevented from doing so in the future. I trust that the bill will have a speedy passage. </para>

                        <para>.- I address myself to this bill mainly because of a remark that was made by the last  speaker.  The fact is that a majority of its provisions were prepared by the last Government, and are to be approved. Taken as a whole, the amendments that it is proposed to make are directed to the protection of the general taxpayer. There are in the community many individuals who devote themselves with a natural enthusiasm to the avoidance of the payment of income tax, and it is necessary that the law should keep up with the skilful endeavours that are so consistently and continually made in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- It is. But the collection of revenue is also legal, and it has resolved itself into a contest between the Commonwealth, which desires to collect revenue, and a considerable number of persons who devote themselves to the finding of a way through the meshes of the income tax law. I can speak with a considerable degree of knowledge on this matter, because for many years I have been professionally connected with these nefarious activities. I use the term " nefarious " in a Pickwickian sense. There are, however, other cases of an entirely different character; cases of evasion in a dyslogistic sense; evasion that is practically equivalent to fraud, or that actually amounts to fraud. The difficulty that arises in those cases is that of drawing the line between the honest avoidance and the dishonest evasion of taxation. Those difficulties are very well illustrated by the provisions of this bill that make certain matters determinable in the first instance, at least, by the opinion of the commissioner. I have received many representations objecting to the provisions that relate to the opinion of the commissioner, and with some of them I have every sympathy. But it has to be remembered that some years ago the taxpayers themselves asked for the institution of a board of review, or of some other body, that would not consist of judges or of men skilled in the law, for the purpose of determining questions relating to liability to taxation. That propaganda was successful, and as a result a board of review was set up. Now I find that many taxpayers are by no means enthusiastic concerning the activities of that body. It is quite impossible, of course, to satisfy everybody. The board of review was introduced for the purpose of reviewing particularly questions of fact or opinion which in the first instance are determined by the commissioner and his officers. Some matters must, according to the act, be determined by the commissioner or by such a board. If they were not, either there would be no opportunity for review, or all matters would have to be decided by the courts. It is proper that the taxpayers should understand that the alternative is that these matters would <inline font-style="italic">hu</inline> subject to appeal to legal tribunals in in the ordinary way. </para>

                    <para>Although the bill is primarily u committee measure, there are one or two matters that I wish to discuss now. The taxation of ex-Australian income may be necessary owing to the condition of the revenue, but I regard it as wrong in principle. At the same time, however, we have to frame our taxation laws in relation to those of other countries. If other countries do what I think is wrong iu principle, I, as an Australian, have to regard that as one of the facts of the case that must be taken into account in determining the nature of our legislation. When I say that it is wrong in principle for any country to tax income that is derived from sources other than those that are within its own borders, I mean that it would be far better for all concerned if it were a universal rule that each country should impose taxation only upon such income as was derived from sources that were within its borders. Such a practice would simplify taxation tremendously. It is a far better principle, and by its adoption very serious injustices which now occasionally arise out of double or even treble taxation would be avoided. But that is not the general view of other countries, and accordingly we are quite within our rights in imposing taxation upon ex-Australian income. If other countries were to adopt a different principle, we might be prepared to follow them. At the same time, I view with some apprehension the introduction of these proposals, because it appears to me that one of the first results will be that the States of Australia will begin to tax income that is derived from sources beyond their own boundaries. Each State has the same power to tax what we may call extraState income, "as this Parliament has to tax extra-Commonwealth income. If each State were to tax extra-State income, and the Commonwealth were to tax extra-Commonwealth income, heigh ho for the accountants and the lawyers for a few years to come. 1. am not satisfied that the bill does not subject to taxation extra-Australian income derived prior to the 1st July of this year.  It is possible that income derived even before the 1st July of last year from sources outside Australia may not become payable here until after the 1st July of this year. This might apply to company dividends earned and derived before the specified date, but not coming to hand until later. </para>
                    <para>The final point I wish to raise is in relation to the taxation of leaseholds, and what are generally loosely referred to in the legal sense as private companies. No doubt there has in the past been a great deal of avoidance of taxation in regard to leasehold transactions, and in regard to transactions based on the formation of private companies. It is possible, however, that endeavours to close up those loop-holes may inflict hardship on innocent people, and result in collecting from them more taxation than they ought to pay. I presume that the Government has been advised of the legal position, and of the risk of incorporating in a taxation act provision for the taxation of moneys derived on the actual transfer or assignment of a lease. The Treasurer is familiar with the history of the matter, and should well remember the proposal brought forward in 1924 for the taxation of leasehold transactions. It would be unfortunate if the present proposal were to raise a question as to the validity of the whole bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree generally with the purpose of the* legislation, which is to compel those who have been evading their income tax payments to meet their obligations. The collection of income tax on extraCommonwealth incomes is a. very difficult matter, and it is well known that many persons have deliberately invested their funds overseas for the purpose of evading Australian taxation. I know of several welltodo men who believe that, at the present high rate of the State and Federal taxation, it pays them better to invest their funds abroad. In regard to such incomes it is only fair that, if the taxation to which they are subject in the country from which they are derived is less than similar incomes have to pay in Australia, the difference should be collected by the Australian Government. </para>

                    <para>The Government has issued an explanatory booklet dealing with' taxation,  and it is regrettable that some of the statements contained in it are inaccurate. For instance, it states that the assumed income of insurance companies which have no registered office in Australia is to he fixed at 10 per cent. for taxation purposes. As a matter of fact, the net profit of insurance companies working in Australia averages slightly under 6½ per cent., and it is rather arbitrary to fix a profit at 10 per cent. for taxation purposes. In the case of film-distributing companies, the assumed profit is 30 per cent. ; but in their case there is provision for appeal to the Commissioner, and if a company can show that its profits are less than 30 per cent., its assessment is reduced accordingly. I suggest that insurance companies should be placed on the same footing as other companies, and taxed on their actual net profit. Most of the insurance companies operating in Australia are registered here, the outstanding exception being Lloyd's.We have no power at present to tax this company, because it is not a corporate body. I understand, however, that it is quite agreeable to pay its share of taxation. No difficulty should be experienced in determining the profits of an insurance company. Full information regarding premium incomes and claims may be obtained from the insurance and banking record in respect of all classes of business, whether marine, accident, motor, or any other form of insurance. </para>

                        <para>.- I thank honorable members for having dealt with the hill so briefly. I agree with them that it is a measure the discussion of which should be reserved for the committee stage. The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> raised a number of points which can be dealt with in committee. I assure him that we are carefully watching the position in regard to our arrangements with Great Britain covering double taxation of income. I have been discussing the matter with the Commissioner of Taxation, and I shall go into it further when I am in London. Nothing in this bill deals with extra. Australian income taxed abroad, whether earned in Great Britain or elsewhere. Some one raised the question of Australian banks employ ing accumulated funds in London for the purpose of profit-making. This bill does not provide for levying taxation on such profits. Exception has also been taken to conferring such extensive powers on the Taxation Commissioner. That objection was answered by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> No one desires to give arbitrary or autocratic powers to any individual, but it is unavoidable in a matter of this kind. I am sure that honorable members on both sides of the House will agree that we are placing these great powers in the hands of a very reliable and trustworthy officer. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> suggested that we should endeavour to simplify our taxation legislation. That has always been our dreamy but, in practice, the more we seek to do it the more complicated the legislation becomes. Commonwealth taxation legislation has already been consolidated, but there seems little prospect of consolidating Commonwealth and State taxation. It has been found impossible to get the States to agree to uniform methods. </para>

                    <para>Mr.SCULLIN.- Well, . we might try again; it is true that some little progress has been made. Many of the complications of our legislation arise from our efforts to catch those persons who endeavour to defraud the revenue. I agree with the. right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that it would be very desirable to have one law for the honest people, and one for the rogues, but that is impossible. Another source of complication is the discrimination made by the law between companies and private persons, with the idea of giving relief where relief is considered necessary. </para>
                    <para>The subject of the taxation of leasehold transactions has been well thrashed out by the Crown Law authorities, and it has been agreed that this is not a tax on capital, but on income. All profit derived from the sale of a leasehold is classified as commuted rent. It is treated as such, and deductions allowed in respect of it, when assessing taxation for other purposes, and so it must be treated as rent, and, therefore, as income for income taxation purposes. "We must be  consistent. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that a date should be fixed in regard to the taxation of extraAustralian income. An amendment will be brought in fixing the date at the 1st July, 1929. New Zealand and Canada already have legislation dealing with the taxation of such incomes, and their legislation is similar to that we are proposing. An amendment has been framed, and will later be introduced, dealing with the point raised by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green).</inline> I regret that these amendments have not yet been circulated. The Taxation Department has been working at high pressure, framing bills in connexion with the sales tax, but I hope to have the amendments to this bill circulated to-day. When we come to the clauses which it is proposed to amend, I shall ask that consideration of them be deferred until honorable members have had an opportunity of studying the amendments. One of the amendments is for the purpose of giving insurance companies the option of deciding whether they will be taxed on an assumed profit of 10 per cent., or whether they will show what their actual profits are. </para>

                        <para>.- I had hoped that the Commissioner of Taxation would exercise his ingenuity with the object of dealing a little more effectively, for taxation purposes, with persons who derive their income from Australia, but live abroad. There is, of course, a very great distinction between the different classes of absentees. There is the bona fide overseas resident who invests his money in Australia. This class of person deserves every encouragement. But there are many Australians who are enjoying overseas incomes made in Australia from wealth which they have inherited but have not made. These should pay taxation in this country on such incomes. I trust that when the next Income Tax Assessment Bill is introduced it will contain an improved definition to meet these cases. </para>

                        <para>.- The memorandum which has been circulated in explanation of the provisions of this bill, and for which honorable members are indebted to the Government and the Commissioner of Taxation, indicates that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of this clause, which is designed to amend the definition of "income", has been introduced with the object of preserving the effect of the decision of the High Court in Blockey's case, reported in 31 <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> 503, and to prevent a decision given by the English courts in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Jones</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Leeming,</inline> reported in 46 <inline font-style="italic">Times Law Reports,</inline> 296, from being applied to the income tax legislation of Australia. I appeared in Blockey's case and am very familiar with that decision of the court. I should be much surprised if it were ever overruled. It has been stated that this amendment has been inserted in order to make the position absolutely secure, and to maintain the law as it was declared in Blockey's case. But it is proposed in another provision of the bill to make the amendment retrospective as far back as 1922. I do not know why it should be made retrospective, nor why its retrospectivity should go back to 1922. Retrospective legislation may be justified in some cases, though they are very rare. Generally speaking, it is a " fair go " between the taxpayer and the revenue collector when it comes to a question of interpreting our taxation legislation. Each side takes the points which the law allows him to take. But the revenue collector has the tremendous advantage of being able to come to Parliament after a decision has been given to secure an alteration in his favour if he considers that that course is necessary. There is a very great objection to retrospective legislation; it can be justified only in  very special cases. Taxpayers and other persons who take advantage of the law to remedy their troubles are entitled to any benefits which they can properly secure in that way, and it is not desirable that we should prevent them from obtaining such redress by making our legislation retrospective. </para>

                        <para>. - The reason why it is proposed to make this provision retrospective is that a certain number of undetermined objections are still outstanding which involve a considerable amount of revenue. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, an amendment is being made in the definition of " income " to insure that the decision of the High Court in  Blockey's  case will be maintained, and to prevent the decision given in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Jones</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Leeming</inline> under the English income tax act, from being applied to Australia. Unfortunately our High Court does not always follow its previous decisions, and it may decide to adopt the principles followed in the English case. </para>

                        <para>.- As a lawyer, I consider that there is very little ground for any apprehension that the Commissioner of Taxation may have that the decision in  Blockeys'  case will be reversed. As a legislator, I am of the opinion that the making of legislation of this nature retrospective more than anything else makes the general taxpayers angry with the Commonwealth Parliament and the Commissioner of Taxation. If a man has taken ob jection in the proper way to the manner in which his income has been assessed,, he has the right to have his objection determined by the court or by a board of review, and Parliament should not deprive him of it. In giving judgment in the case of <inline font-style="italic">J ones</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Leeming,</inline> some of the learned lords referred to the phrase " annual profits and gains " and used it, in part, at any rate, to justify their decision. That phrase is not used in our legislation. I hope that the Treasurer will reconsider the fairness of making this provision retrospective. </para>

Every case of this kind must be considered on its merits. If Parliament passes a certain bill and the people generally honour the intention of Parliament in that regard, we should not permit a mere handful of people to escape honouring it through a mere technicality. </para>

                            <para>- But there is surely something bigger to be considered than mere technicalities. Whenever Parliament makes its intentions known with reasonable clarity, and the people in general honour those intentions, we should not permit a few people, by the employment of skilled, paid agents, to defeat the intention of Parliament, and avoid the payment of their reasonable dues in taxation. If one such case happens, I submit that Parliament is perfectly entitled to amend the law, and to give the amendment a retrospective effect, so that no other cases of the kind may occur. In doing so it is only acting justly by the general body of taxpayers. Almost every amendment of our taxation legislation that has been introduced into this House for many years has contained s retrospective provision of some kind. There is no injustice in taking steps to insure that the decision that the High Court has already given on this point hall not be reversed. Honorable members will, of course, be familiar with the distinction between accretion of capital and income in respect of profit arising out  of a  sale. It has been held by the House  of  Lords that profit from an isolated sale, although it is a sale for the purpose of profit making - a matter  of  buying and selling - is not income. But the High Court has said that it would regard profit made from* the buying and selling of properties, as income, and taxable as such.  ' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. West.</inline> - There would he no sale unless there were a profit. </para>

                            <para>- Sometimes a property is sold at a loss. There is this distinction. If a man buys a farm to work it and, after holding and working it for a number of years, sells it, any profit on the sale is regarded as an accretion of capita!1 and is not taxable as income. Such profit has never been taxed as income, and no alteration of that practice is contemplated under this bill. What we do tax as income - and we follow the practice of Great Britain - is profit made by the sale of a property which was deliberately bought for speculative purposes, in the same way as boots and shoes are bought and sold at a profit. The House of Lords held the sale in the case of <inline font-style="italic">J ones</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Leeming</inline> to be isolated, and that, therefore, the profit could not, under the English act, </para>

That decision has raised a doubt in the mind of the officers of the Taxation Department, and of our legal advisers, because it is possible that the High Court might adopt the decision of the House of Lords. To prevent that, this amendment has been brought down. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 agree with what the Prime Minister has said that the effect of section 42 and other sections of the act is that, after an assessment has been made, the taxpayer is able to lodge objection against it, and, if he so desires, his objection, if disallowed by the Commissioner, may be reviewed by the board of review under section 44. The board of review, in dealing with the objection, has all the powers of the Commissioner with respect to the making of assessments, decisions, and determinations, and, accordingly, any opinion of the Commissioner can be reviewed by the board of review. At the same time, that leaves this particular question for decision by the committee. It is possible to legislate upon such a subject as this in one of two ways. One way is that which has been adopted under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i a</inline> i, which applies to a person whose domicile is in Australia, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that his permanent place of abode is outside Australia, and under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i, a</inline> ii, which applies to a person who has actually been in Australia, continuously or intermittently, during more than one-half of the  financial  year in which the income which is the subject of the assessment was derived unless the Commissioner is satisfied that his usual place of abode is outside Australia, and that he does not intend to take up residence in Australia. In that case the matter has first to be determined- this being a question of exception - by the Commissioner. The other way of legislating would be to legislate by reference, not to the opinion of the Commissioner, but to the facts of the case. In that case paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i, a</inline> i would read - " whose domicile is in Australia unless his permanent place of abode is outside of Australia." The reference to " the satisfaction of the Commissioner " would then be omitted from paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i, a</inline> ii. The actual distinction in respect of our legislation is this: Where a matter is left to be determined by the opinion of the Commissioner, that opinion is final unless the board of review is of a different opinion. Where, however, the legislation is founded, not upon the opinion of the Commissioner, but upon the fact, then the decision of the Commissioner upon the fact is appealable, either to the board of review or to the court. The question which arises in each case is whether it is desirable that there shall be an opportunity for a full review by the court. In this case, these particular matters are matters of exception, and the opinion of the Commissioner is effective in excluding a person from the liability imposed by the section. It therefore may be thought that the Commissioner could act only in favour of the taxpayer. But, of course, it is obvious that if the Commissioner refuses to be satisfied as desired by the taxpayer, then the decision is against the taxpayer. I recognize that it is necessary to have some matters determined by an opinion. For example, the most difficult section of the act is section 21, which must depend upon a matter of opinion as distinct  from  a question of fact in the ordinary sense. It appears to me that under this clause there is a great deal to be said for giving the taxpayer the right of having these matters determined on the facts of the case, and for deleting all the references to the opinion of the Commissioner or to the Commissioner being satisfied. I am unable to see any particular reason for removing the power of determining these facts and circumstances from the court. It may be said against me that 1 believe overmuch in courts, but f do believe in the citizen who is subjected to a liability under the law of the land, having the right, as a general nile, to the adjudication of his case by a properly constituted legal tribunal. That does not involve any reflection upon the character or the capacity of the administrative officers of any Commonwealth department. I regard that right as one of the inherent civic rights of our people. Accordingly, my view is that only cases in which the question which arises is obviously a matter of opinion, and not determinable by evidence as a question of fact, speaking generally, should be determined by the opinion of the Commissioner or of the board in order to remove *hem from the possible adjudication of the court. It seems to me that under this -attempt to tax extra-Australian income under this clause which defines the term resident " or " resident of Australia ", some difficult- questions will arise. One of the elements introduced - I think I am right in saying for the first time -  -into  our legislation relating to income tax is the element of domicile. That conception is familiar in matrimonial law, but not usually in taxation law. It appears to me that we are opening up a new and, to my profession, a lucrative field in introducing the idea of domicile into income tax legislation. The domicile of most of us is probably a domicile of origin. We have the domicile of our fathers. There is also the domicile of choice. When a woman marries a man, she acquires his domicile. It would be rather remarkable if the liability of a woman to taxation turned out to be dependent upon the man whom she happened to marry, even though she continued to spend her life in the country in which she was at the time resident. That is one set of questions which will arise, and in respect of which the individual should have the right to have the actual facts reviewed by the court. </para>

                            <para>- By the court as well as by the board, on the facts. The distinction between the two cases is this: When, under our Income Tax Assessment Act, a matter is determined by the opinion of the Commissioner, 'there may be an appeal to the Board of Review, and the Board of Review may review the Commissioner's finding; but upon any proceedings before the court the opinion, if it is really an opinion, reached by the Commissioner or board is final, and there can be no inquiry into the facts. Where there is no reference to the opinion of the Commissioner the court, upon an appeal, can deal with the whole matter. It appears to me in regard to all these questions of the actual liability to be included within the scope of our income tax legislation, it would be proper to allow them to be determined by a court and not by an administrative officer or by a tribunal. Let me illustrate what will arise under this provision. In the case of a person who is obviously resident, in the ordinary sense, in Australia, no difficulty will arise. Obviously, he will be subject to taxation upon intra-Commonwealth and extra-Commonwealth income. Difficulties will arise in doubtful cases as, for instance, when a person, who has affiliations or connexions outside Australia, is taxed as a resident. He may contend that he is not a resident, but his liability will be determined by the .Commissioner, with the possibility of review by the board, which the High Court has declared to be a departmental administrative tribunal. In such cases it is wise to allow the liability to taxation to be determined, as the taxpayer will regard it, by a department, without the right of appeal to a court? This definition does not affect the amount to be paid in taxation by a person who is obviously within the scope of the law ; but it involves the determination of whether a person is or is not within the law. It is, therefore, a matter which the Government should consider carefully, for although it is small, it may create bad international feeling unnecessarily. </para>

Why not say, " during half the financial year " ? lt would be difficult to distinguish between the commercial traveller mentioned by the Treasurer and a man who visits the Commonwealth twice a year. I am convinced that difficult questions of fact will arise which might be avoided by redrafting. Sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> attempts to define the residence of a company. It is deemed to be resident in Australia if it is incorporated in Australia or, if not incorporated in Australia, carries on business here and has either its central management and control in Australia or its voting power controlled by shareholders who are residents of Australia. Obviously, it would be to the interests of companies which are sufficiently large to have branches outside Australia, to avoid incorporation here. That is important in relation to its actual effect upon the revenue of the Commonwealth and the States. It may be unavoidable, but we must bear in mind the possibility that large companies which have prospects of extending their operations beyond Australia will be driven to incorporate themselves outside Australia. The second part of the definition will encourage companies to remove their central management and control from Australia and arrange to be controlled by persons abroad, instead of by Australians paying taxation within the Commonwealth. The qualification relating to the control of voting power by Australian resident shareholders will be easily evaded. In order to escape the tax, a company will merely require to ensure that a bare majority of its shareholders are resident outside the Commonwealth; two companies may be identical in every respect, except that one has one less Australian resident shareholders than the other. One will escape the taxation and the other will be taxable upon its extra-Australian income, although the additional resident shareholder may hold only one share. I am aware that I am stating an extreme case, but the committee must remember that if the law provides possibilities of legitimate avoidance of taxation they will be utilized. </para>

On the other hand, the clause might be construed to mean that the whole management and control should be in Australia; if that were done, the majority of those companies which this definition is designed to catch would escape. ' Therefore, the omission of the word "central" would be dangerous. Some of the difficulties to which I have referred may be unavoidable with this system of extended legislation, and they raise the question whether it will be worth while, in the long run, to impose this new taxation, having regard to the fact that the bill proposes to tax only extra-Australian incomes, which are not subject to taxation in other countries. </para>

                            <para>- If a legal issue were involved, there would be an appeal to the court, but whether a person does or does not reside in Australia is as much a question of fact to be determined by the Commissioner and the board of review as is any , other. ' I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the wording of sub-paragraph 2 is somewhat ambiguous. That can be read in two different ways. The phrase "continuously during more than half a year " is quite plain ; but " intermittently during half a year " may apply to a man whose home is in Australia, who travels outside of Australia, and who comes back intermittently for not more than half a year. On the other hand, however, the intention may be that at least the aggregate term of his stay in Australia shall be more than half a year. I shall ask the Crown Law authorities to look into the matter, and, if necessary, the phrasing can be altered in another place. I should imagine that the intention is that the aggregate shall be six months ; but it may apply to a person who, although his home is in Australia, being a traveller, does not live at home. </para>

                            <para>- The revenue to be gained is variously estimated at between £100,000 and £200,000. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition indicate that the one thing certain is that the Commonwealth will have a very big crop of litigation, that may or may <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> be successful. If it be unsuccessful, the cost to the Commonwealth will be nearly as. great as the amount of revenue obtained. The cost of administration will be considerably increased by the intrusion of this new principle in our taxation legislation. It looks, also, as though companies that are incorporated in Australia will be penalized as against companies incorporated outside Australia. At the present time, our taxation laws discriminate against absentees. It appears to me that this new principle discriminates in favour of absentees and against residents of Australia, whether they be companies or individuals. Is that a wise principle to adopt? If the revenues were going to benefit handsomely as a result of this activity, the trouble might be worth while; but, as the gain is limited, we should hasten very slowly. Careful consideration should be given to the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> regarding the withdrawal of the stipulation that the commissioner must be satisfied as to the existence of certain facts, If persons of foreign nationality, who are accustomed to laws that differ from those of Australia, find that their only recourse is, not to a court of law in Australia, but to a commissioner or a departmental board of review, they will probably regard as very unsatisfactory the legal enactments of this country. I urge the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> to give very careful consideration to this question, and . to ponder whether the return will be adequate compensation for the difficulties that are likely to be encountered or created. </para>

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> gave an assurance that any exercise of discretion, any opinion, or any decision of the Commissioner is subject to review by the board of review. But he gave it rather diffidently. According to the latest work on the subject, it is by no means certain that there is a right of appeal from the Commissioner to the board of review. This is a very important matter, because it affects many sections of the act. The opinion is that, looking at the legislation as a whole, there, appears to be a right of appeal; but the learned authors of this work indicate that that is by no means certain, and they suggest that, if it is intended that there shall be a right of appeal from the Commissioner to the board of review, it would be better that that should be stated clearly in the act. I should like to sec that done, because it is not desirable that either the Commissioner or any other person shall have absolute power, and that there shall not be a right of appeal from . his decision. According to a judgment of the High Court of Australia, an appeal court is not entitled to interfere with the discretion of , a Commissioner unless his decision is utterly and palpably erroneous. The question, whether an appeal court can interfere with a decision of a. Commissioner depends very largely on the wording of the act. Section  52  of the New South Wales Income Tax Management Act of  1928  contains the following provision: - </para>

                        <para>.- The position is clearly set out in Commonwealth taxation law. Section  50  of thcact provides that a taxpayer who is dissatisfied with an assessment may make an objection, and ,the Commissioner shall consider the objection and give to the objector written notice of his decision upon it. A taxpayer who is dissatisfied with such a decision may request the Commissioner to refer it to a board of review or to a court. Section  51  provides that the Commissioner shall refer the decision to the board, if so required Section  44  specifies the powers of the board, and states that it shall have the power to review such decisions of the Commissioner as are referred to it. These necessarily include all the decisions which the Commissioner is bound, by virtue of section  51,  to refer to the board, because the taxpayer has asked them to be so referred. Section  44  goes on to provide that the board, for the purpose of reviewing such decisions, shall have all the powers and functions of the Commissioner in making assessments, determinations, and decisions under the act. Therefore, the power of the board of review  i3  equal to that of the Commissioner, not only in regard to the making of assessments, but also with respect to the making of determinations and decisions apart from assessments. Those words have been construed as entitling the board of review to review any matter which, by the act, is. left to the opinion of the Commissioner. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Moreau</inline> v. the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Commissioner of Taxation,</inline> section 37 was applied by the Commissioner. At that time its form was slightly different from what it is now. It then provided that the Commissioner might re-open an assessment in any case where he had reason to believe that there had been fraud or evasion. The decision of the court turned upon the interpretation of the words, " reason to believe ". That decision showed that the board of review would have been able to review the belief of the Commissioner, although the court itself could not do so. I understood the Prime Minister to say definitely and clearly that, wherever a matter is left to the opinion, the decision, or the deter- mination of the Commissioner, and wherever the determination of any liability depends upon the Commissioner being satisfied with reference to a certain matter, or upon his having a certain belief, it is the intention of the Government that there shall be an opportunity for review by the board of review. </para>

                    <para>In this matter I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> : It is quite clearly laid down that taxpayers have the right of appealing to the board of review in every case in which a decision is left to the discretion of the Commissioner. It was the intention of the last Government, as it is of the present, that there should be some form of appeal from the decisions of the Commissioner. With that end in view, a board of appeal was set up. That authority was declared to be illegal, and in its place we now have the board of review. I know of no case in which the right of appeal has been denied, and until the difficulty arises, I see no need to amend the law. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is very difficult to quarrel with the principle of the amendment. Those societies formed, not for the purpose of profit or gain, but to assist producing or manufacturing industries, may well have their incomes exempt; but, if they go into trade or business, or engage in any form of trading enterprise, it is difficult to see what right they have to exemption. The particular example given, and that to which, I understand, the measure is directed, is the business of insurance carried on in association with chambers of manufactures. Under the section as it stands at present the income of chambers of manufactures is exempt. It is stated, however, that these chambers have formed separate companies, which are distinct legal entities, for the purpose of carrying on the business of insurance. The notes circulated with this bill state that these chambers have, through separate legal companies, entered into the business of insurance, and the chambers of manufactures, <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> render active business assistance to chamber of manufactures insurance companies. The insurance companies are taxable on their profits just as any other company is taxable; but the chambers of manufactures, which render active business assistance to insurance companies, receive remuneration for those services. The insurance companies concerned receive a deduction, of their payments in their assessments; but the chambers of manufactures do not pay any income tax on the amounts so received, although these are actually remuneration for services rendered. I am informed, however, that under the proposed amendment, it may actually work out that the Commonwealth will suffer a loss of revenue. Certain representations in this .regard have been forwarded to me. I do not ally myself with every thing contained therein, but it is set forth that in one case a certain association receives from an associated insurance company a lump sum per annum for payment of rent, services of a secretary, office assistance, and standing charges such as rates, telephone, stationery, &amp;c. The act, as it stands at present, does not tax the association at all; but the insurance company pays taxation in accordance with the law. The insurance company confines its business entirely to the members of the particular trade in connexion with which it has been formed, and, owing to the mutual system and low expense rate of obtaining  business,  is able to give large rebates to policy-holders. The effect of these rebates is to increase the profits of the policy-holders to the extent of the saving in premiums paid. The taxation revenue benefits as a result of these increased profits. If, in future, the insurance company pays its expenses direct, instead of to the association, its profits will be reduced, the premiums of members will be increased because of the reduction in rebates, and, in the long run, it is contended, the revenue will suffer. I mention those things without referring to the name of the particular association, in order that they may receive the consideration of the Government. As regards the general principle of this proposed legislation, it seems difficult to object to the proposal that any one making profits from trade should pay income tax on those profits, subject to just exemptions. The exemption of income of associations for the purpose of assisting the progress of manufacture and industry is limited by this paragraph; but if the result will be that less revenue will be derived in the future than has been obtained in the past the matter should be reconsidered. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like the Government to take into consideration the desirableness of permitting taxpayers to claim exemptions in respect of certain amounts which they pay aged relatives for their maintenance. Many people feel that they should support their aged parents, for instance, by paying them a regular amount of money, and it is laudable that they should do so. Some of our old people are diffident about applying for the old-age pension, and if a relative is prepared to relieve the country of the responsibility of paying one he should be given credit for doing so. I trust that the Government will give this matter earnest consideration. </para>

                    <para class="block">The first point I make in regard to this provision is that it proposes to remove from the scope of taxable income certain income derived from sources outside Australia. The principle upon which this exemption is based is that if income is taxed in the country of its origin, it should not be taxed in Australia. The effect of this legislation will be that if the person resident in Australia, as prescribed in the act, has income within Australia, he will pay taxation upon it; but if he has income from outside Australia which is already subject to taxation in the country of its origin, he will not pay taxation upon it here. The words " to the extent to which that income is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner " to be taxed elsewhere are, I presume, intended to mean that if an Australian resident derives an income of, say, £1,000, from outside Australia which is subject to income taxationat any rate whatever in the country in which it is derived, it will not be subject to taxation in Australia under this legislation. </para>

                            <para>- It has been suggested to me that the phrase " to the extent to which " may cause some difficulty, and should be altered. The object of the words is to exclude the whole of the income which is taxed. It is said that the words exclude the income " to the extent to which" it is taxed elsewhere, and that, therefore, the question may arise whether the actual effect of them is not merely to grant an exemption in regard to the amount by which the income is diminished by such taxation ; but I. am not impressed by the point. </para>

                    <para>The words, " in the hands of the person deriving that income ", and, " from the sale of any produce which is chargeable in the hands of the person deriving that income with royalty or export duty by the Government of any country outside of Australia," which appear later in the paragraph, require to be carefully considered. These provisions will require the taxpayers, in some cases, to make extensive inquiries to ascertain how the income tax laws of some foreign countries operate, and how far a sales tax or other device of taxation, which may fall within the meaning of the words quoted, is imposed. It may, therefore, be a long time before any information can be obtained which will justify a' taxpayer in claiming an exemption under this provision. That, however, is a difficulty which is incidental to legislation of this character. The provisions of theclause in regard to the payment of royalty or export duty also appear to me to make ambiguous the exact intention of the legislation. At any rate, they do not seem adequately to express it. I should think that this exemption as now expressed  could  apply to only a very few cases. What ordinarily happens is that a royalty or export duty is paid by a company in which, the Australian resident is a shareholder. I understand that an export duty or royalty is chargeable on all the tin mined by the companies operating in the Malay States: but this is chargeable against the companies which win, export, or deal with the tin. In that case, the Australian shareholder receiving a dividend from such a company would not be able to claim the benefit of this exemption because the tin would never have been in his hands; it would only have been in the hands of the company in which he is a shareholder.

When the two provisions arc taken together the result is that a resident who derives income from a source outside Australia is taxable upon it only when that income is not chargeable with income tax to him outside Australia or when it is derived from the sale of produce which is not taxed by way of royalty or export duty in any country outside Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">That, statement is perfectly clear and intelligible: but the introduction of the words, " in the hands of the person deriving that income " appears to me to cause ambiguities which could be avoided. The illustration that I used in regard to the Malay tin minims: companies puts my point clearly. If it were intended that the Australian residents who' hold shares in these companies should be taxed on the dividends they derived from such sources, notwithstanding that export duty or royalty had already been paid on the tin, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> could understand why the words had been used; but. we have been told that that is not the intention of the Government. The Government is seeking to avoid, in these provisions, the imposition of double taxation on any income, but to ensure that all Australian income not taxed abroad shall be taxed here. I do not desire to move an amendment to this provision, but I ask the Treasurer to consider whether the use of these particular words, is desirable. * </para>
                    <para>The third point that I take in connexion with this provision is that as the amendment is drafted this extra- Australian income, from whatever source it is derived, would be subject to taxation if received by a taxpayer in this or any previous or future financial year. I understand that it is proposed to introduce a limitation somewhere, confining the taxability of such income to that which has been derived since the 1st July, 1929. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not quite satisfied that the Prime Minister's reply to the second point I raised is an effective one. In the case of a company which is subject to income tax, there may be income exempt under clause 6 ; but in the case of a company which is not itself subject to income tax, it appears to me to be difficult to say that its income is exempt if it never comes within the Australian domain at all. In the case  of  an Asiatic company, can one say that its income is exempt income? It appears to me to be income which is not subject, either as exempt or as non-exempt income, to Australian income tax legislation. </para>

                        <para>.- When I was speaking on the second reading of this bill I referred to this portion of it, and suggested that the difference between the tax chargeable overseas, on any particular income and the tax which that amount of income  Would  bear in Australia if the latter should be higher, was a perfectly legitimate charge upon that income. Of course, I realize that any bank credits obtained overseas by residents of Australia are beneficial to the country in more ways than one, and we should have no desire to prevent their creation; but many Australians have invested in bonds or stock of the United States of America, and the Government of the United States of America does not charge income tax on the interest derived from those bonds or stock. </para>

                            <para>- They are the people I particularly want to reach; but, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has pointed out, there may be small taxes imposed in countries overseas upon profits derived by Australian investors in those countries, and it appears now that, to the extent to which that taxation is imposed, the incomes of the Australian investors become automatically exempt from income taxation in Australia. That would be all right if the income tax chargeable in Australia were less than the amount of taxation actually paid overseas, but if the amount of taxation paid overseas is less than the amount that would be collectable in Australia, I consider that the difference would be a perfectly legitimate charge for the Commonwealth to make. </para>

                        <para>.- The real point is the actual collection of the tax. The Prime Minister has said that income on which tax of any sort has been paid, whether by means of a royalty, export tax, or income tax in any other country, will not be taxed in Australia, and that applies equally to the company and the shareholder of the company. But I want it to be made absolutely clear that income which is exempt from taxation will not be taken into account in estimating the graduated rate of tax upon the total Australian income. If an Australian derives an income of £1,000 from Malaya, what is to be the future practice of the Taxation Department? It will probably require the taxpayer to show in his taxation return the income derived from overseas, and the Taxation Commissioner will then satisfy himself that the £1,000 is exempt from taxation, because income taxation, or royalty, or export tax upon it has already. been paid in Malaya. But every one will be anxious to have an assurance that the income thus derived from overseas, and exempt from taxation here, will not be included in the assessable income, so as to raise the general rate of the tax on the taxable income of the taxpayer. If that is not so, there will really be taxation in respect of overseas income that is already taxed. I think it would be wise for the Prime Minister to make a definite statement on the point. </para>

                        <para>. -  The point the right honorable member makes is that if a resident of Australia is in receipt of income derived from outside Australia, and tax is paid on that income outside Australia, it is not taxable in Australia, but the income derived from outside might be added to the Australian income so as to increase the rate of the tax. That will not be so. The proviso of clause 6, which I have already read, declares that "where a company distributes to a member or shareholder any income upon which it is exempt, as dividends, bonuses, or profits, among its members or shareholders, the income so distributed shall not be assessable income of the member or shareholder." What is not assessable income cannot be added to a person's income, and, therefore, cannot be included so as to increase the rate of his tax. </para>

                            <para>- I brought up this matter a couple of years ago. I was able to point out that many Australians had invested their money in foreign countries, and that among them were many of our protectionist friends, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hume</inline> Cook, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> and others, all leading lights in the movement for imposing tariffs to build up industries in Australia. I pointed out that money they had made in Australia they had sent out of the country to earn profits by the employment of cheap foreign labour, a practice which is soundly condemned by honorable members on the other side of the chamber. I gave a list of the dividends they had drawn, and I was under the impression that our present Prime Minister agreed with me that Australia ought to be levying income tax on those profits. </para>

                            <para>- I find now that special privileges are to be given to people who make big money in Australia and who, instead of trying to develop the tin resources of Queensland or the Northern Territory, or the copper mines of Australia, invest it in mining activities outside Australia. A bill has been brought in to tax people on the profits they derive in Australia, but no tax is to be imposed on those people who, while advocating the building up of industries in Australia by the imposition- of heavy customs duties, invest their own money overseas. I am surprised at this, because I remember how heartily the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> endorsed my remarks when I drew attention to the fact that people, after enjoying the benefits of the laws of Australia and the wonderful liberties afforded by its protection policy, were sending their money out of the country. Now the Government is introducing legislation which will enable those people to evade the payment of income tax in Australia. The Government has fallen down on its job, and I cannot but express complete surprise at its action. </para>

                        <para>. - -The honorable member is quite right in saying that on a previous occasion we supported an amendment to tax extra-Australian incomes, so that those people, who invest their money outside Australia, and by that means evade the payment of taxation in this country which shelters' and protects them, should contribute to the Commonwealth revenue. I am now pioneering legislation with that object in view. With regard to the proposal to exempt from taxation residents of Australia who are taxed in other countries, I point out this to the honorable member: The first obstacle in the way of taxing extraAustralian incomes is that referred to by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> during the second reading of the bill. That is the arrangement that we have with the United Kingdom in respect of double taxation. So as not to interfere with that arrangement, we have been forced to exempt from income taxation all extra-Australian incomes derived in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- If we did that, we should be making serious inroads on our agreement with Great Britain. We therefore, have found it; necessary to exempt from taxation income earned in Great Britain and subject to taxation there. We were faced with this question : Should and could we discriminate in the imposition of income taxation between various countries? That would, indeed, be a serious thing to do. We were thus forced into the position of exempting all incomes on which income tax had been levied in other countries. Then we were faced with this anomaly. Take, for instance, Burma, which has certain tin mines. That country levies an income tax as well as a royalty tax. </para>

                            <para>- I have not that information. In Burma both income and royalty taxes are paid, so that if we make exemption in respect of extraAustralian incomes, Burma must be included in the list. When we come to compare the position of Malaya and Siam with that of Burma, we find that although no actual income tax is levied in those countries, there is imposed a tax infinitely greater in the form of export duties and royalties. Much heavier taxation is imposed upon the shareholders of companies in Malaya and Siam than upon the shareholders of companies in Burma. Therefore, any discrimination between the incomes from those countries would be unjust. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> asked where is -there any extra-Australian income that is not taxable. He will find the great bulk , of it lies in the investments in Australian loans made in Great Britain, the United States of America, New Zealand, and other countries. Those investors should pay their fair share of taxation, as do others who invest in Commonwealth loans in Australia. </para>

One condition of the issue of the gold bonds by the Commonwealth Government in America was to the effect that " the interest would be paid without deduction of any tax now, or at any time hereafter, imposed by the Commonwealth of Australia, or by any taxation authority thereof or herein ".

                            <para>- The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> has referred to loans issued since the war in Great Britain and America. I understand that the condition that the honorable member read is contained in the prospectus of the gold dollar loan, which was not a war loan. It is important that- nothing should be said, during a debate in this Parliament, which might give even the slightest impression to anybody that there is an intention on the part of the Government or Parliament to impose taxation on interest payable on any loan in respect of which the prospectus promises that interest shall not be subject to Commonwealth taxation. Accordingly, I suggest that careful inquiry should be made by the Treasurer as to the position in respect of the gold dollar loan. As I understand the suggestion of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> he proposes to exempt from taxation the income of certain stock, acquired before the passing of this measure, but to make the same stock, if acquired subsequently to the passing of the bill, subject to taxation. I suggest that he should reconsider that proposal. If the prospectus of a loan states that the interest upon the stock subscribed for will be free from Commonwealth and State taxation, that contract must be honoured. This Parliament is at liberty to legislate in regard to all loans in connexion with which there is no such contract; but to determine to impose liability to taxation upon interest payable in respect of Commonwealth or State loans, which hitherto have been free from taxation, would be, I suggest, a very doubtful, and indeed, wrong act of policy at  thiB  juncture. No distinction should be drawn between an original subscriber to a loan and any person who acquires stock in it subsequently. These bonds are negotiable securities. It is of the essence of the contract that the transferees should be in identically the same position as the transferors. It would produce a profound disturbance of Australian credit abroad if it were discovered that upon the same loan " A ", receiving let us say, 6 per cent, interest, was untaxed, and " B " holding stock in the same loan, and under the same prospectus, had to submit to taxation on his interest. All the bond or stock holders in  a  loan should be in the same position under the law; no distinction should be drawn in respect of the date when their interest in it was acquired. It must be remembered that people in the United States of America do not follow the legislation of this Parliament. They look  at  the contract inscribed on their bonds, and that contract ought to be absolutely inviolate. </para>

                        <para>. - I thought that I had made it clear and definite that there is no proposal in this bill that even remotely suggests any form of repudiation. The Government has no intention of introducing legislation to tax loans that were issued in the Commonwealth free from taxation. When, in a loan prospectus, it is laid down that interest shall be paid without deduction, that means that the interest will be paid in full at the due date; it does not mean that that interest will be exempt from taxation. I am inclined to think that the quotation made by the honorable member for Warringah was not quite accurate. If a loan were issued tax free, this Parliament would be doing a wrong thing in saying "we will not tax the interest if the stock is held by the original subscriber, but if it has changed hands then, after the passing of this measure, it will no longer be regarded as a tax-free loan." The suggestion of the honorable member that the Government might make a discrimination between the original and a subsequent holder indicates that he has in mind loans that are not tax free. The effect of this amendment would be to prevent the taxation of interest received by a person who had invested in a loan that was not tax free, but was floated outside Australia. Clearly such people, if residents of Australia, ought to pay taxation if the loan was not issued tax free. The Government cannot accept this amendment. If it did so, it might as well abandon the greater part of the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- Parliament should make the position on this issue very clear and definite, as it could materially affect the credit of Australia. Australian loans have been floated at a .very favorable rate of interest because of certain attractive features incorporated in the prospectuses. One of those features was that there would  be  no deduction for taxes imposed  by  the Commonwealth of Australia. That exemption enabled us to float loans both in London and in New York at rates of interest very much below what has been current in Australia. </para>

We must bear in mind clearly that these bonds should be negotiable in the freest possible sense. There should be no limitation on their negotiation as instruments of credit, either in Australia or elsewhere. We can deal with them in no other way. Any future loans that are issued may have applied to them the terms of any law that we may make now or hereafter, but those conditions must not be retrospective. </para>

                    <para>Quite a different position would arise if an Australian acquired New Zealand stock that was tax free in the country of issue. Any contract made on behalf of the dominion is not binding upon the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Australian investor purchases such stock entirely at his own risk. It is quite competent for this Parliament to place a new tax on that instrument of credit in the same way as it might impose a sales tax, land tax, or other taxation. But those who have a definite contract with the Commonwealth are differently situated. The terms under which their loan was issued must apply throughout its whole life. Perhaps the Treasurer may be able to obtain during- the dinner adjournment the exact conditions under which the New York loan referred to by the honorable member for Warringah was issued. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                        <para>.- This clause proposes to deal with certain co-operative companies that have experienced difficulty because of the nature of their rules in relation to the quotation of their shares on the Stock Exchange. The general idea has been that, in order to obtain the advantages which are conferred by the act, a co-operative company must be a genuine company of cooperators, and that its shares must not be sold in the ordinary way to the general public. Effect is sought to be given to that idea by the amendment of section 20 of the act. It is proposed to substitute two provisos for the existing proviso. The first of those provisos is in the following terms : - </para>

                    <para class="block">The question has been raised, does not the phrase "or in any other public manner whatsoever " go rather further than is intended? I understand that, when a co-operative company is being formed, it is a common practice to send men round to induce members of the public who are engaged in the industry  concerned to take up shares. That practice is similar to the quotation of shares for sale or purchase in a public manner. Et may be perfectly harmless, but, nevertheless, it may prevent a company from obtaining the benefits that are intended to be conferred by these provisions. I suggest that the Prime Minister look into the matter to see whether it is possible to invent a phrase that will permit an employee or an agent of a co-operative company to endeavour to persuade individuals who are interested in the industry concerned to buy shares in it, without running the risk of depriving the company of the benefits of the legislation. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause goes a very long way. It proposes that, in cases where the Commissioner is unable to ascertain who are the shareholders in a particular company, he shall be empowered to levy taxation upon the basis that it has only one shareholder. Such a practice, of course, may result in a very high rate of tax being imposed. I recognize the existence of the problem with which the clause is intended to deal; but I suggest that it will be worth while to examine the possibility of dealing with it in another way. In the case to which paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> refers, the Commissioner should be at liberty to tax in the way indicated, unless the company shows that it has more than one shareholder - in which case, of course, the tax would be imposed in accordance with the facts. I am aware that the clause as it stands may be thought to make that procedure possible; but when it is examined it will be seen that the position is this: The Commissioner makes his assessment at a point of time. At that point of time he determines whether or not he is to applythis provision. At that stage he is unable to ascertain the various facts to&gt; which reference is made in the clause.. He issues his assessment upon that basis, and it is final; there is no provision entitling those concerned to show that the facts are otherwise. The Commissioner may, as a concession, reconsider the matter and amend the assessment; but there is no right in the individuals concerned, upon showing that the assumption upon which the Commissioner had proceeded was inaccurate, to obtain a revision of the assessment. There should be such a right. </para>

If that provision were not made, there would be no power to compel an ex-Australian company to furnish the information required. No hardship is involved. If it be assumed that there is only one shareholder, the company is forced to give the names ; and unless it shows that there is more than one shareholder, the Commissioner mus assume that there is only one. A company should state the names of its shareholders, not merely say that it has more than one. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause is designed to deal with difficulties that have arisen in the administration of the law owing to the formation of companies with the object of circumventing the law. Accordingly, speaking generally, its purpose has my complete sympathy. There are various methods by which this circumvention of the law can be attained, but I cannot see that I should be rendering a particular service to the public if I were to advertise the details. As has already been stated in the course of the debate upon this bill, it is important that, in the endeavour to catch persons who are dishonest, fraudulent, or tricky, the law should not be altered in such a way as to impose severe burdens upon honest and honorable citizens. According to the marginal note, this clause relates to the taxation of what are called private companies. There is no general legal definition of "private company," or any generally recognized category in which private companies are included. This is a category proposed to be provided for the purpose of this provision. Companies to which it is to apply are those in which not less than 90 per centum of the paid, up capital is represented by shares held by or on behalf of not more than ten individuals, or a company having such a company as its principal shareholder which has been formed for the purpose <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> of relieving from tax liability any person or persons specified by the Commissioner. The words "principal shareholder " mean, I presume, holding the largest number of shares in such a company. The line of demarcation between the companies to which this drastic provision can be applied and other companies is entirely artificial.I can see that this legislation when brought into operation can readily be evaded. The proposed new section refers to companies wherein not less than 90 per centum of the share capital is represented by shares held by or on behalf of not more than ten individuals. That provision can readily be evaded by a company holding less than 90 per centum of the share capital. Reference is also made to shares held by or on behalf of not more than ten individuals. That can also be evaded by increasing the number of individuals to eleven. In these circumstances I doubt whether the proposed new section will be effective. It will be easy to prevent its application to a particular company. There are further provisions in the proposed new sub-section 2 which are designed to meet some of the obvious objections which I have mentioned; but I doubt very much whether they will do so. This provision has been drawn up in the most extensive form and applies to such companies as I have mentioned. The words "has been formed for the purpose <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> of relieving any person or persons specified by the Commissioner give it a tremendous scope, and make it possible for it to apply with indefinite retrospectivity. The proposed new section is not limited in its application to companies to be formed; but applies to any company heretofore formed or which may be formed if the Commissioner is of the opinion that it was formedinter <inline font-style="italic">alia</inline> for the purpose of relieving persons from taxation. When a company is formed, one of the matters taken into consideration is the effect of taxation legislation upon the interests of the individuals concerned. That is a perfectly proper and legitimate thing; but if the Commissioner is to form the opinion that such a circumstance as that I have mentioned results in the company being formed <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> for the purpose of relieving persons from taxation the proposed new section will have a very  wide application. The complaints which some honorable members have made, who are interested perhaps in spite of themselves with respect to clause 21, will hardly be a circumstance as compared with those that will pour forth if this new section becomes operative. It is so far-reaching that if the Commissioner is able to find a suggestion that an alteration of the incidence of taxation was considered when a company was formed^ this provision may be applied. Such companies may have been formed at any time subsequent to 1915, when the Federal Income Tax Act was first passed. The Commissioner will be able to treat a company in effect as if it were an individual. This matter requires very careful consideration. The Prime Minister should determine whether the legislation will not over-reach itself, and if the provision is not too extreme to meet any evils, which, in fact, may exist.

A " nominee " is a person nominated. When  a  transfer is made to a specific person, that person is in  a  sense the nominee of the transferor.- Of course this provision is not intended to cover such cases; but  ian  ordinary transferee comes within that classification. In order to make the provision quite clear, the words " other than a bona fide transferee for value " should be inserted. The provision would then be in accordance with the true intention of the legislation. </para>

                            <para>- That indicates the difficulties associated with effectively administering this proposed new subsection. Let us take the case of an ordinary sale, for what would be regarded as full value. If I sold shares on my own account for 20s., which was their market value, presumably that would be all right and the transferee would not be the nominee. But if I sold such shares for 15s., the Commissioner could say that they were worth 20s. I might be able to persuade the Commissioner that 15s. was all I could get for them. Some one else might sell similar shares for 7s. and the Commissioner could say that a portion of their value at least was a gift. That indicates the difficulty which will arise in connexion with a provision of this nature. Paragraph 7; of proposed new sub-section reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">I suggest to the committee that this paragraph can apply to many cases which it is not intended to cover by this legislation. I know of important companies in Australia which would be covered, and where there have been straight-out bona fide gifts of shares by a father to members of his family, and where it was not intended that such persons should act other than as full and independent shareholders. Such cases would be covered by the paragraph I have quoted. The provision also applies to cases where shares have been purchased with money received from a shareholder. A man could make a gift of £1,000 to his son, who a little later might purchase shares in his father's company from a non-relative. Who is to say whether such shares have been acquired by that person with money received from his father? It appears to me that the conception is too vague to include in legislation. The qualification which I suggest could, I submit, be accurately expressed by inserting after the word " shareholder " at the end of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> the words " and where the purchase of that shareholder in the transaction is to relieve himself of any liability to which he would have been subject under this act if he had continued to hold that share." It appears that the cases it is desired to cover are  those in which shares are transferred with intent to alter the incidence of 'taxation, and, indeed, to affect the proper operation of legislation. I, therefore, move - </para>

                    <para>Although I agree with the object of the proposed new section, which is to prevent the evasion of taxation, there is a possibility of injustice being done unless it is limited to deal specifically with those companies formed for the purpose of evading taxation. Many of the companies which might be held to be affected by this section were not formed for that purpose at all. They were formed for the purpose of limiting personal liability, and many of them came into existence before section  21  was added to the Income Tax Act in  1922.  The section might be held to apply to companies formed by primary producers and storekeepers for quite legitimate purposes. In New South Wales the minimum number of persons who can form themselves into a company is seven. In some such companies a certain number of higher employees hold shares, and the effect of this clause will be to make their incomes taxable at the property or company rate, even though there may not be the slightest suggestion of impropriety associated with the formation of the company. Such an employee earning a salary of  £1,000  a year would be required to pay, at the personal exertion rate, income tax amounting to  £27  a year ; but if he were one of seven shareholders of a company, he would have to pay  £41  a year in taxation. That, I understand, is not the Government's intention, but it would be the result of this legislation. No doubt, one of the ideas at the back of the minds of those who form such a company might be to reduce the amount of taxation payable; but it might not be the determining reason in the formation of the company. The universal instinct of mankind is to pay as little in the way of taxation as the law allows. One case which came under my -knowledge was that of a man who desired to make a disposition of his property among his family. He actually submitted his scheme to the Commissioner of Taxation in New South Wales, and asked his opinion as to whether it was a suitable arrangement to make. Years afterwards he found that he came within the ambit of a provision of this kind that was later inserted in the Taxation Act. It is proposed in this bill that companies formed since  1915  shall be subject to the provisions of this section. That is retrospective legislation of too drastic a kind. I approve of the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> As the bill now stands, restrictions of too severe a nature will be imposed upon the disposition of property, even though there has been no intent  to evade taxation. If this wide power is to be allowed there should be some provision for exercising control over the discretion of the Commissioner regarding the purposes for which dispositions of property are made. </para>

If it were accepted, a company formed to evade taxation would, in order to escape the provisions of the section, merely have to prove to the court that it had other objects in view as well. This clause provides that the Commissioner must be of the opinion that a company has been formed for the purpose of evading taxation. It may have been, formed for other reasons also, but if one of them is to evade taxation the Commissioner may take action. He is to use his own judgment. </para>

                            <para>. - What is meant by " value " in the honorable member's amendment? Value may be love and affection. It may be a penny, or some other nominal sum. No doubt the honorable member means full value, but " transferee for value " is a meaningless term. A nominee is a person nominated to hold shares.By no stretch of imagination could it be said that a transferee is a nominee if he is a bona fide transferee. This, again, is a matter for interpretation by the Commissioner. If a bona fide sale has been made, and it can he shown that fair value has been given for the shares, though not necessarily full market value, the transferee cannot be regarded as a nominee. </para>

                        <para>.- My amendment is that the word "nominee " in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 2 shall be followed by the words " other than a bona fide transferee for value ". Those words have a well recognized legal meaning. The word "nominee" has no legal meaning at all.It has a meaning in ordinary speech, and, as the Treasurer correctly pointed out, it means a person nominated. In that sense it includes volunteers, that is to say, persons who give no value; it includes persons who give value large or small; includes transferees who give value in the ordinary course of market transactions. A transferee, who for a penny received shares worth £1, would not be a bona fide transferee for value. The inclusion of the words " bona fide " safeguards the position, and eliminates the possibilities referred to by the Treasurer. As the proposed new section at present stands, it refers to any person nominated to hold shares whether as a result of a commercial transaction, or in consideration of love and affection, or in pursuance of a scheme of tax evasion. The Commissioner cannot make any distinction in favour of the bona fide nominees, for there is nothing in the sub-section about the opinion of the Commissioner. Subsection 2 of proposed new section 21 provides that for the purposes of that section the expression "shares held by or on behalf of " a person includes any share held by or in the name of any nominee. It does not matter what the Commissioner thinks about it; he has to administer the law as passed by Parliament. I regret that it is proposed to retain these vague words, which can only work upon the assumption that the Commissioner will not administer the law as passed by Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">This amendment would have the effect of confining the operation of this part of the measure to cases in which it was the object of the shareholder to relieve himself of taxation liability. That question would, in the first instance, be determined by the Commissioner. If his decision were disputed, the taxpayer could appeal either to the Board of Review or to the court. The court would then determine whether the circumstances brought the case within the words of the paragraph as amended. If, however, the paragraph is left in its present form, it is so wide that I confidently, but sorrowfully, predict that it will cause endless trouble and a great deal of litigation. </para>

                        <para>.- The whole of this proposed  new  section is subject to the provision that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the companies are formed for the purpose, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> of relieving any person or persons specified from any liability to taxation. Then we have in sub-section  2  various explanations. If we were to insert the words which the Leader of the Opposition wants inserted, it would be impossible to prove before the court the purpose of the shareholder. If the words are inserted where proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, the discretionary power of the Commissioner wouldnot apply. The honorable gentleman said that the matter would go, first, to the Commissioner, and then, if his decision were disputed, to either the appeal board or the court. If there were a provision that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the purpose was to avoid taxation there would be a discretionary power from which there would be an appeal to the appeal board or to the court. But here there is no discretion for the Commissioner to exercise, so that all the promoter of a company would have to do would be to deny that that was the purpose, although, in fact, the purpose of forming the company was the evasion of taxation. </para>

If, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the institution is not a charitable institution, there may be an appeal to the Board of Review or to the  court. The court determines whether the institution is, or is not, a charitable institution. The purpose is a question of fact just as much as many other matters are questions of fact, although, in the case of an adjudication by any tribunal as to the purpose, the conclusion must be drawn by inference. There is no foundation whatever for the statement that the mere allegation by an individual that he had not such a purpose is conclusive. Of course it is not. Every day the courts are determining questions of intent, purpose, motive, object and the like. I find almost immediately to my hand in section 21 of the existing act another example of the use of the word " purpose." Sub-section 4 of the section provides - </para>

                            <para>- If the Treasurer intends to adopt that attitude it is useless to argue the matter. There may be different opinions as to a purpose as there may be as to questions of fact ; and it may he more difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to the purpose of an individual than as to a fact. Authorities can be produced, going back over many hundreds of years of English law, to show that questions of purpose are questions of fact. In this case the Treasurer does not suggest that, even if my amendment were adopted, the opinion of the Commissioner would be conclusive; it would be subject to the decision of the Board of Review. I can only hope that the criminal law of this country, which depends, in very many of its branches, upon the determination of purposes, will never be interpreted against citizens in the way that the Treasurer suggests that this provision shall be determined against them. It must be apparent to the right honorable gentleman that, even if a company were formed for the purpose of evading taxation, say, ten years ago, and a transfer of shares were now made to " any person who is a relative by blood, marriage, or adoption, of the shareholder, if that relative has acquired the share by gift from that shareholder or by means of money received from that shareholder," it does not follow that the company is still a company for the purpose of evading taxation and that these extreme powers should be exercised in respect of it. The original purpose of the formation of a company may have nothing whatever to do with a subsequent transfer of shares; yet the person to whom the shares are transferred may be seriously affected. </para>

                        <para>. - I object to sub-section 3 of this proposed new section, for it will have the effect, in my opinion, of penalizing other companies than those formed for the purpose of avoiding taxation. In any case, the Commissioner may erroneously decide that a company formed for a legitimate purpose has been formed for the purpose of taxation evasion. A considerable number of companies have been formed by persons in order to satisfactorily administer their affairs during their lifetime and to conserve their estates after death. The Commissioner of Taxation will, unquestionably, give the department and not the taxpayers the benefit of any doubt in matters of this kind. I do not think that the Commissioner, with all the multifarious duties which he has to discharge, will have time to give adequate consideration to subjects like this; nor do I think that the companies concerned will always have the fullest opportunity to submit their views on the subject to the Commissioner. A decision on such a matter should not rest entirely with the Commissioner, who is not, we may presume, a superman. I am puzzled to know how this officer can possibly discharge efficiently all the duties that are  being placed upon him by the Government. We are rapidly reaching the position in this country that private individuals and companies are not able to conduct their business without the intervention of the Commissioner of Taxation. It seems to me that the Commissioner is being made a sleeping partner in every business in Australia, which is quite improper. The taxpayers should be permitted to conduct their business within the law without interference from the Commissioner. The all too frequently used words " in the opinion of the Commissioner " are not a sufficient protection of the interests of the general community. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>.-I make a final appeal to the Government to reconsider this provision which, although designed with the laudable object of preventing the evasion of taxation, has been drawn so wide as to make it an engine of inquisition of exaction and commercial destruction. I sincerely trust that the Treasurer will agree to redraft the subsection so that the taxation authorities will be able to encompass with their net only those persons who are attempting to evade the law. I urge the Government to postpone the clause and to reconsider it, otherwise I must vote against it, although I should like to see some provision in the act to prevent tax evasion. </para>

                        <para>. -  I hope that further consideration will he given to the taxation of family partnerships or family companies, because,- after all, people do not always form these 'companies for the purpose of tax evasion. Usually, by the time a young fellow has reached 21 or 22 years of age he has not saved sufficient money to buy into any concern, and if he does so with money provided by his father, or if his father gives him a share in a family company, that consideration is not to be regarded by the Commissioner of Taxation. There are many grazing companies in which the management is left to the sons, while the fathers live in the cities. It is quite natural for these sons to want some money of their own. They do not want to be always treated as jackeroos, drawing the pay of a jackeroo. It is, therefore, only natural for the father to attempt to provide in some way for their future by giving them shares in a family company. In many cases moneyed men, instead of giving their daughters money, have given them shares in family companies. When one of these daughters marries, she may wish to dispose of her share to one of her brothers. An original shareholder may hold half-a-dozen properties and divide them among his sons, or he may give some of the properties to his daughters, but because the recipients are flesh and blood of the original shareholder, such a distribution is to be. regarded as a tax evasion. If a young man is being paid for work done for a family company, either as secretary or manager, his salary is not to be allowed as a legitimate deduction by the company. I trust that the Treasurer will give consideration to these points. </para>

                        <para>.- The object, of the clause is to get at people who are deliberately and definitely endeavouring to defraud the revenue. The Government has no desire to deal with those legitimate cases, such as have been referred to, and I should say that there would be no difficulty in regard to any genuine case in which it can be proved to the commis sioner or to the appeal board that there has been no intention to avoid taxation. I have discussed the matter with the commissioner, and am satisfied that the provision will be administered without hardship, and interpreted in a generous way. Although it seems to be harsh, there are many provisions in taxation laws the terms of which are harsh, but they are administered with discretion. </para>

                            <para>- Only if it is administered in a vindictive and harsh spirit. But if we commence to legislate with consideration for cases of hardship that may arise we may allow people to cut right through the net of our legislation. We have to legislate for those with deliberate intent to defraud. Like previous governments the present Government has had experience of people with criminal minds who adopt every ingenious method to evade legitimate taxation. They are the class of people for whom we must frame our legislation. I agree with the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Page)</inline> that if we could distinguish in the application of our legislation between people- of that class and those who form genuine companies for the purpose of dividing property among the members of a family, we should do so. But as we cannot make that distinction, our only course is to leave the matter to the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation, and after consultation with that gentleman I am satisfied that he will apply this provision in the proper spirit. If subsequently it is found that it is working with the harshness suggested, I undertake to bring down legislation for the protection of the legitimate cases. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 am unable to support any taxation legislation which imposes liabilities upon the people of Australia on the promise that it will be administered in a kindly spirit and not harshly. We ought to so frame our legislation that it will apply only in the cases in which it should apply. I know of cases in which without intention of evading taxation honestly duc, family arrangements have been made for the control of businesses by the forming of companies, and the result has been to alter the liability to taxation of the members of the company. It is. however, easy in such a case for the Commissioner to form the opinion that the company has been formed for the purpose <inline font-style="italic">inter aiia</inline> of so adjusting the taxation liability and then this provision would apply. I feel that, rather than invent an engine so powerful and so indiscriminating in its action as to a large extent this section must be, I must oppose the clause. It is going too far in the direction of embarrassing entirely innocent and honest persons in attempting to catch dishonest persons. Other means should be adopted for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that that was suggested, but the suggestion has been made that there are two ways of looking at the matter. This provision, along with many other provisions of the taxation law, gives to the Commissioner of Taxation the discretion to exercise his opinion as to the motive of the taxpayer. It is indeed a matter that must be left to his discretionary power, and in coming to his decision as to the motive of the taxpayer he will not treat harshly those companies which in his opinion have been formed for a legitimate purpose. I do not know how we can have legislation that will not give the Commissioner strong powers if we are to deal with fraudulent cases. I do not anticipate that this provision will be applied harshly in legitimate cases.  I find in the records of the Treasury that the previous Government approved this very clause and proposed to bring it before Parliament. Circumstances appear to be quite different when one is not charged with the responsibility of protecting the revenue of the country. The present Government is now charged with the responsibility of so protecting the revenue that those who pay their legitimate' taxation will not have to pay more because others evade their legitimate' share. </para>

                            <para>- We have tried to facilitate the passage of the bill to the utmost of our ability, but, at the same time, we have endeavoured to see that it will give fair and equal justice to all iu the community, and especially that it will catch those who are trying to escape their just taxation. There is nothing in the records of the Treasury or elsewhere to  3how  that either of us approved of this particular provision. All that there is in the Treasury is a record that we were anxious to prevent tax evasion, and were prepared to draft a provision that would enable effect to be given to our desire. The Leader of the Opposition, who would have been responsible ultimately for the drafting of that provision, has given his view to-night as to how it should have been drafted. If his view were adopted, I should be prepared to accept it, and I am sure the party which I have the honour to lead would accept it, but as that cannot be done, I have no alternative but to oppose the clause. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause provides for certain amendments in respect of deductions of business losses. I wish to submit a point which has hardly yet been considered, but which arises out of an earlier amendment. Honorable members who have been following this debate attentively will remember that an amendment was made to clause 2 to include specifically in "income ", any profit arising from the sale by any person of any property acquired by him for the purpose of profit-making by sale or from the carrying on or carry ing out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme. The object of that amendment was to include isolated profitmaking transactions which did not amount to the carrying on of a business. The clause under discussion relates to deductions. Deductions may be made for losses incurred by persons in carrying on a business. There are quite a number of provisions for such losses. If profits from an isolated transaction are to be included in income for the purposes of the act, then . losses on isolated transactions should be deducted. The deductions of losses should not be limited to losses on business. I have not had an opportunity to look thoroughly into this matter since clause 2 was passed, but it is obvious that when the profits of a profitmaking scheme are included in income, its losses should be deducted from income. The Commissioner cannot have it both ways. I speak of the Commissioner as an abstract person representing the Commonwealth. There should be a definite provision to that effect. It appears to me that the provisions in respect of losses are unduly limited in these amendments, which are provisions relating to losses in carrying on a business. . An isolated profit-making transaction is distinct from carrying on a business, otherwise it would not have been necessary to insert an amendment under clause 2. </para>

                        <para>.- New clause 28a has the desirable object of compelling persons abroad who make large profits out of the exhibition of films in Australia or the sending to Australia of films for exhibition to pay income tax or something of that character. The payment is made by charging the agent here. I wish only to say that I hope that  in preparing this legislation the Government has taken into account the decision in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Spiller</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Turner</inline> some years ago, and a more recent decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Tomlin, in a case in which the British-Australasian Tobacco Company was concerned. It might very well happen that the persons in Australia who, under this legislation would, as agents, have to pay this tax for other persons or companies in America, would be quite unable to recover from those persons or companies the moneys which they pay in the form of taxation in Australia. I suggest that careful consideration should be given to that aspect, otherwise it may be that this taxation will fail to reach the persons against whom it is directed. </para>

                        <para>.- Clause 18 proposes to amend section 37, which is one of the most difficult and important provisions of the act. At one time the taxation authorities were able to re-open assessments without regard to when the assessment was made or tax paid. Then a limitation was introduced under which section 37 provided that the Commissioner may re-open assessments at any time subject to a time limit of three years, except in cases where the Commissioner is of opinion that there has been an avoidance of tax, and that the avoidance was due to fraud or evasion. That provision is being retained. Where the Commissioner is of opinion that there has been an avoidance of taxation due to fraud or evasion, the Commissioner may re-open assessments at any time. In normal cases there is still a limit of three years. The proposed new sub-section 1a reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">I draw specific attention to this considerable extension to six years. I, myself, think that it is reasonable that the taxpayer should keep books, accounts or records. A citizen knows full well that he is liable to be taxed and, therefore, he should be prepared to keep proper books, accounts or records. At present if the Commissioner is not satisfied with a return he is able to assess as he thinks proper, and the taxpayer has to prove that the assessment is wrong. The assessment is prima facie evidence, in all cases, of its accuracy, and except in respect of appeal or review is exclusive evidence. The Commissioner has already  a  very extensive power, and it is doubtful whether this amendment is necessary. At the same time, so long as it is understood that this provision is limited to cases of failure to keep hooks and not to the absence or loss of books which have been kept, it seems to me that it is reasonable. </para>

                        <para>. - I offer no opposition to this clause. It is only reasonable that the Commissioner should have the privilege of review in the case of culpable negligence over a period of six years. Taxpayers who have kept books, accounts or records are protected, because in their case the Commissioner may review over a period of three years. There is no question that the Deputy Commissioners throughout Australia are definitely of the opinion that there is probably £100,000 a year being lost in respect of this source of taxation. y </para>

                        <para>.- The object of this and the following clauses is to force all appeals to the High Court of Australia, ana to prevent the Supreme Courts of the States dealing with them. In the notes that have been circulated in support of these proposals, the author has pointed out that some taxpayers, and the legal advisers of other taxpayers, are displaying a preference to have their appeals heard by the State Supreme Courts. That preference has always been very marked in South Aus.tralia. Needless to say I do not intend to enter upon any comparisons, invidious or otherwise, of the Supreme and High Courts. No one can question the competence of the Supreme Courts of the States of Australia. The High Court sits only very occasionally in certain States - for instance, once a year in Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart - while in Sydney and Melbourne it sits twice or thrice a year. This clause is all very fine for the taxpayers of Sydney and Melbourne, and for the bar of those cities. It will mean that rather than wait to have their cases heard in the more distant States appellants will have them transferred to the High Court sittings in Sydney or Melbourne. Consequently, either Sydney or Melbourne barristers and solicitors will be employed in the cases, or others will have to be brought from other States at considerable expense. Is it a fair thing to submit the citizens of four of the States of the Commonwealth to that delay or the alternative expense if the cases are heard in Sydney or Melbourne ? </para>

                            <para>- No. However, that is the lookout of the parties concerned. I suggest that we need not spend any sympathy in that matter. They have the right of an appeal to the High Court, with a single judge. He may hear the case, and, if he desires, state a case that will be sent on at once to the full High Court. The same procedure applies to the Supreme Court of a State. But we should give some consideration to the smaller States where the High Court sits only once a year. This amendment will inevitably mean that if the taxpayer is not debarred altogether from appealing, which would be very undesirable as a man has the right to appeal if he is aggrieved, he will either be subjected to long periods of delay, or to considerable additional expense. No one can question the competence of the State courts which have been dealing with these matters. Why should not the individual go to his own Supreme Court if he so desires? I believe that I am on safe ground in assuring the Government that if this amendment is passed - which would be very convenient for the Taxation Department, as it will have its headquarters in Melbourne and Sydney, handy to the counsel and solicitors that it desired to engage - it will impose a burden upon the taxpayers that will, in some cases, be very severe indeed. </para>

I know that in my own State it is desired that the opportunity should be afforded taxpayers to submit their appeals to the South Australian Supreme Court. If people are compelled to wait for twelve months until the High Court sits they will have imposed upon them a distinct hardship. If they desire to expedite the hearing of their appeals by going either to Melbourne or Sydney they will probably be subjected to the additional expense of taking with them their own counsel and solicitors, men conversant with their affairs. I hope that the Treasurer will not persist in these amendments. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> on the grounds of economy. The Treasurer should not persist in these amendments. Taxpayers in far-distant States, such as Western Australia, would find it extremely difficult to obtain a hearing of t heir appeals before the High Court. Personally, I consider that the States' Supreme Courts are highly qualified to hear appeals. If it were necessary to lake a case fromWestern Australia to Sydney or Melbourne it would involve the taxpayer in tremendous expense. I remind the Treasurer that this is a time when we should conserve the financial interests of the taxpayers, as well as their rights. </para>

                        <para>- A little over 700 years, but it is still the keystone of British liberty, and it should be our guiding beacon to-day. The High Court visits remote States only once a year, but the Supreme Court is at all times readily available to the taxpayers. J suggest that this is an inopportune time to make these amendments to the principal act, as there is already a good deal of dissatisfaction in some of the States with regard to federal administration. I do not think that the innovation would be of very great value from the point of view of administrative economy. Certainly, it would accelerate and cheapen departmental activities to some extent, but that would be more than counterbalanced by the disadvantages placed upon the taxpayers generally. I remind the Government that this is not the time that we should choose to subject remote States to additional irritation. </para>

I see a good deal of force in the point made with regard to the disadvantages that they may inflict upon distant States. No question has been raised as to the relative efficiency of the State Supreme Courts and the High Court, but experience has proved that usually in an important case the Supreme Court does not hear the appeal, but states a case for the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, if a case goes against the department in a vital matter involving large sums of money, it would not rest with the decision of the Supreme Court, but would be taken to the High Court. That would add to thecosts of the taxpayers as well as of the department. However, because of the force of the reasoning that it would inflict hardship upon remote States because of the infrequency of the sittings of the High Court, and of the point made by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> that that disadvantage would irritate those States, I am not prepared to press the amendment.

                        <para>.- This is a very far-reaching amendment. It provides not only for the service of processes and proceedings, but also for the taking of proceedings against any director, secretary, or other officer of a company. Certain obligations are imposed upon directors, secretaries and officers of companies, and upon their attorneys and agents. The clause is designed to provide that if the public officer of a company makes default in a duty that has been imposed upon him, for that default the Commissioner may, if he should think fit, take proceedings against a director, the secretary, or any officer, agent or attorney of the company. I venture to doubt whether it is really intended that it should go so far as that. It is quite right that there should always be some person who is responsible for the observance by a company of the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and who can be held liable for any evasion of the law. Section 88 of the act, with which this clause deals, provides that a company shall be represented by a public officer, who of course is liable for any default that is made by it. If such an officer is not appointed, the company is liable for failing to appoint him. Section 89 deals with the liability of agents and the like, including the agents of a company. It may be that if the  officer  against whom proceedings have been taken shows that he has had nothing to do with the evasion of the law, he will escape a penalty; but that is not clear. Under the clause as it now stands, if the Commissioner thinks fit, proceedings may be taken against any director for the default of, let us say, a public officer. It may be argued that the Commissioner may not succeed. If that is  bo,  the clause means nothing. I suggest that in regard to this aspect it should be reconsidered. </para>
