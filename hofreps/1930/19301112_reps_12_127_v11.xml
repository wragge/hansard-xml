                    <para>- I rise to a personal explanation. Last week I made a motion of privilege to bring to the notice of the House the misrepresentation by the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> and other journals of my attitude towards the financial policy of the Commonwealth. During the debate that ensued, several honorable members said that I was wrong in complaining that I had been misrepresented. In the report of that debate published in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> and, presumably, supplied either by telephone or telegraph by its representative in this city, the following paragraph appeared - </para>

It contains not a single reference to " the paid hirelings of the press ". However honorable members may differ regarding my complaint of misrepresentation on the first occasion, here is evidence of wilful misrepresentation and lying, and I leave it to the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> and others to justify such misreporting of the proceedings of this House. </para>

The Premier of Queensland has intimated that it is intended to provide for a uniform roll during the next session of Parliament. In Western Australia during the past five years a bill to bring about a joint electoral roll has on three occasions been passed by the Lower House, but in each instance the bill was defeated in the Legislative Council. In response to further representations by the Commonwealth Government, the Premier of that State replied on the 8th August, 1930, that the matter was being held over, hut would receive consideration at a later date. The public advantages of the joint system are fully recognized by the Commonwealth Government, and every effort is being made to induce the States of Queensland and Western Australia to come into line with the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- I am advised that, in conformity with a resolution carried at a conference of State Premiers in Sydney in May, 1929, a conference of State marine officials was held in Melbourne towards the end of last year for the purpose of discussing what action, if any, should be taken in regard to legislation on the lines of the Commonwealth law on the subject. It may be mentioned in this connexion that, in December, 1929, a committee consisting of Captain L. J. Bolger,  Deputy  Director of Navigation. Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> Wallach, B.E., Director of Lighthouses, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Malone, M.I.R.E., Chief Inspector (Wireless). Postmaster-General's Department, furnished a report on the question of the suitability, for use on small coasting vessels not equipped with wireless apparatus operated by qualified operators, of an automatic wireless device submitted by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for transmitting signals of distress. Copies of this report were forwarded by the Prime Minister to the Premiers of the States on the 16th January, 1930. In acknowledging receipt of the Prime Minister's communication, the Premier of Western Australia pointed out that all vessels plying on the coast of Western Australia were equipped with wireless apparatus. I am communicating with the Premiers of the other States with a. view to ascertaining whether any developments have taken place in connexion with this matter, and will make the information available to the honorable member as soon as possible. </para>

                (Kooyong) [3.15 J.- Fur the first time in the history of the Commonwealth a second financial statement, which is in effect a second budget, has been made in the same year by a government. When this Government introduced its budget in July last, a motion was moved from this side of the House declaring that the expenditure of the Commonwealth ought to be brought down to the level of that of 1928-29, and the amount proposed reduced by, at least, £4,000,000. The arguments that we used in support of that motion were derided and scoffed at by members on that side of the chamber; but now the Government; has come before the House with the admission that the expenditure must be substantially reduced, and the contention that taxation should be increased. Everything that was said by or on behalf of the Opposition in July last during the budget debate has been confirmed by events. There could be no stronger confirmation than the statement of the Acting Treasurer, that in the light of results to date a deficit of between £12,000,000. and £15,000,000 was possible if things were allowed to drift on the basis of the presentarrangements, and trade and unemployment became worse; but that with a restoration of confidence and a revival of trade, the deficit would be between £8,000,000 and £10,000,000. Therefore, so recently as three months ago, this Government had not the slightest idea of the true condition of the Commonwealth finances. On the figures given, a restoration of confidence and a revival of trade are estimated, by the Acting Treasurer to be worth between £4,000,000 and £5.000,000 to the Commonwealth revenue.
            </para>
            <para>What has brought about the position set out in the financial statement of the Acting Treasurer? The cause is partly a. further fall in the prices of the principal commodities that we export, such as wool, wheat and minerals; but largely, a general lack of confidence throughout the community. The Acting Treasurer himself referred to the importance of a restoration, of confidence, but one of the principal factors in bringing about the existing condition of affairs has been and still is a lack of confidence in the present Government. - Just a year ago the Labour partyassumed office with a large majority, fresh from a successful election, full of confidence and arrogance. Where is it to-day ? </para>

                    <para>- This year has beon a year of almost unmitigated disaster for the people of the Commonwealth, and that is largely due to the policy or absence of policy of this Labour Government. Its members may well have lost  confi-de  nee in themselves. They were  warned  about the position before the last election. They knew the relevant facts, but paid no heed to the warnings that were given. They came into this House full of promises. They promised to give everybody the sun, the earth, the moon and the stars. To-day we find them grovelling in the mud. In May of last year the late Government outlined the financial and economic position as it saw it and as it truly was. Therefore, the present Government cannot say that it was not warned, and had not the means of informing itself of the actual position of affairs. But, determined to ignore facts, and resolved on winning the elections somehow or anyhow, the Labour party went to the people merrily and said that no changes need be made. At the Premiers Conference in May of last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> reviewed the public finance of Australia, setting forth the deficits in _ Commonwealth and State budgets. £b said that an increase of taxation would probably defeat its own object. Has this Government yet learnt that lesson? The budget introduced in July last proposed increases of taxation  amounting to £12,f&gt;50,000 ; and we now have before us the admission that, if that budget be adhered to for the remainder of the year, the deficit on the operations of the year may he between £12,000,000 and £15,000,000. </para>

                    also pointed out that there had been, a fall in the prices of wool, wheat and metals; that wo had less income to spend, and that consequently we would have to bc content with less. It. was not a question of anybody wanting to take less. So far, the Government has hardly recognized the diminution of national income, although it has given hart? expression to if in both the last and ;he present financial statement.
                </para>
                <para>It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> that, if we were to have a chance of maintaining our standard of living, it was essential that we should reduce the cost of production. That is still the position id Australia ; we have to recognize it, and the people have to appreciate it if prosperity is to re tura . </para>
                <para>It was pointed out, further, that loan expenditure could not continue upon the then existing scale, but had to be reduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> said that, unless this position was faced, unless the economic facts were recognized and policy was ordered in accordance with the factors governing the situation, the alternative was a diminution of our national wealth and an increase of unemployment until, faced  with a national crisis, we would be forced to lower our standard of living and readjust the whole of our national life. It was pointed out, both in this House and at the Premiers' Conference, that certain steps would have to be taken to deal with the position. It was because of the steps that the last Government proposed to take that the wonderful party which now sits opposite had its glorious victory at the elections held in October, 1929. </para>
                <para>It was pointed out last year that, unless the country were placed on a sound economic basis, our standard of living would be threatened, and eventually would decline. When the national income becomes less - and it is becoming less - we have all to take less; that appears to me to be simply a m'atter of arithmetical calculation. </para>
                <para>These propositions were quite untruly represented as advocacy of the reduction of wages. Every honorable member of this House, I believe, wants wages to be as high as possible. But if sufficient money is not available there ' cannot be the same national dividend as has hitherto been enjoyed. The last Government made certain proposals with respect to the reduction of expenditure in- the Public Service. Every honorable member opposite who then sat on this side of the House, and I think I am fairly safe in saying all of those opposite who are newly in this House, loudly proclaimed that those who how sit on this  side were attacking the allowances of public servants. Apparently they are still persisting with the old idea that standards can be maintained at any rate which happens to have been reached, irrespective of whether or not there is enough money to meet the requirements of the situation. During the election campaign the Labour party contended that wages bore no relation to economic facts ; that they were to be maintained whatever happened, and that they should be fixed as a matter of . political policy independent of the prosperity of the country. Until our people learn that such a policy is both impossible and. absurd, the affairs of this country will never be placed on a sound basis. The Labour party has induced a large number of people in Australia to believe that they can procure anything they want by voting for it, and that politics can ensure high wages. The last federal election, and the recent New South Wales election, are perfect demonstrations of the acceptance of those absurd propositions by a considerable proportion of the population of Australia. We have to discard those propositions. </para>

                    <para>It must be observed that economic problems, unlike political issues, cannot be solved by any expression, however vehement, of the national will, but only by taking the right action. You cannot cure cancer by a majority. What is wanted is a remedy. </para>

                <para class="block">That is what we in Australia have to learn to-day; we must recognize that there are economic limits to political action. I am not suggesting that we are unable to produce economic effects and consequences by political action; but I do say that there are certain economic conditions which constitute limits to political action, and that we are in the presence of some of those limits ali the present time. The Labour party, however, stands for the denial of these intelligent and intelligible principles, and for the affirmation of the principle that, irrespective of the prosperity of the country, wages and salaries and other rewards can be maintained at any figure that they happen to have reached. </para>
                <para>At the last election that party promised work for all, the maintenance of high  wages, no reduction of Public Service salaries and allowances, and the continuance of the system of Public Service arbitration. Yet it has now wiped out Public Service arbitration. First of all the Government got together representatives of the unions, and told them that if they applied to the Public Service Arbitrator it had not the money with which to pay substantial increases, and that, therefore, it was of no use for them to go to the arbitrator. Then the Public Service Arbitrator retired from his position, his period of appointment having expired. There is no Public Service Arbitrator at the present time, and Public Service arbitration has been abolished by the Labour party itself, notwithstanding the fact that at the last election it secured thousands of votes by promising to maintain the system and by falsely representing that the then Government proposed to abolish it. </para>
                <para>What has happened in and to Australia in one short year of Labour rule? I have already said that it has been a year of almost unmitigated disaster. I use the word " almost " because I think that the result will be to convince the people - indeed, they are becoming convinced day by day - that the rainbows held before them in the dim distance by the Labour party are unreal and can never be made real by Labour policies. Let us examine what has happened to this country which has now suffered under a Federal Labour Government for twelve months.  If there was one thing about which the Labour party professed concern, it was unemployment, and when in opposition it charged the Government of the day with being responsible for all the unemployment that existed. </para>

                        <para>- I observe that there are still some honorable members opposite who believe that. I shall not follow the example of the honorable member who interjected by charging the present Government with being responsible for all the unemployment that at present exists. It is true, however, that unemployment has increased .during the regime of this Labour Government from 12.1 per cent, to the terrible total of 20.5 per cent. The Labour Government promised work for ail, and yet, after one year of office, one-fifth of the registered trade unionists of Australia are out of work. The reduction of wages spread over the whole body of workers has been a great deal more than '20 per cent. Rationing of employment is only another form of unemployment, a humanitarian variation. If we consider the rationing figures in conjunction with the unemployment figures, we arrive at a truly staggering total, and this condition of affairs has come about during the regime of a government which promised the electors iu its circulars and speeches that it would find a solution for the unemployment problem. As a matter of fact, unemployment is worse now than it  ha3  ever been before within the memory of any one present. On this ground alone, apart from anything else, the Government has lost the confidence of the people, and even of those supporting it. It has shown that it made false promises in this House. It made promises which it cannot now carry out, and which it is making no attempt to carry out. </para>

                        <para>- Evidently the honorable member- would have us refrain from stating the truth. Australia's credit, measured by the London price of Commonwealth bonds, the criterion adopted by the present Prime Minister and the  Acting Treasurer, declined from the very day that this Government took office. The constitution of the Government was such as to make it impossible for it to command the confidence of sensible and responsible people, and so the price of bonds went down. For several years before the last election their price had been from 1 to 4 or 5 per cent, below that of New Zealand bonds, but in July last the price fell to 15.$ per cent, below. And the Treasurer informed ns the other day that the London price for £100 Australian bonds was £75 5s., a decline of something in the region of 25 per cent., as compared with New Zealand bonds. There is no confidence in the presenf Government, no confidence either in Australia or anywhere else, in its wisdom or in its fairness. All the facts point in that direction. Every criterion we can adopt, every standard we can apply, indicates the same thing. </para>

This is another proposal for inflation, and inflation involves repudiation. If that motion were carried into effect a man who had lent the Commonwealth money in good faith on the credit of the nation, and received in return for it a bond containing a promise to pay, might be told when, in due course, he came along to get his bond cashed : " Oh, we will give you another promise to pay in twelve months ". Of what use is such a promise after the first has been dishonored? </para>
                <para>It has been left to the Labour party to give these shocks to the confidence of the public in Australia and beyond our own boundaries. After only twelve  months in office the Labour party has hauled down the Australian flag and dragged it in the mud. This is the first British dominion in which any responsible political party has ever advocated repudiation. For the first time in history a British Minister, speaking from the same platform as an Australian Prime Minister, has thought it necessary to pay the latter the compliment of saying, in tones of mingled admiration and surprise, that he, at least, is an honest and honorable man - as I believe he is. The comparison between the Prime Minister and some members of the party which he is understood to lead is obvious. It has been left to the Labour party to bring about the present condition of affairs by proposing public and calculated dishonesty for the first time in the history of a British dominion. </para>

Every one who reads it must observe that it is divided into two parts, the second part of which by no means fits the first part. Throughout the second part of the statement the marks of compromise, and unsatisfactory compromise at that, are apparent. The first part of the statement evidently stands as it was originally prepared, and it is sound. I .congratulate the Government upon possessing some members who are trying to do things on sound and honorable lines. But even what is being done in that direction is being done too late, and not enough of it is being done.

I agree with practically every word of that part of the statement.

He then reminded us that in his budget speech last July the Prime Minister and Treasurer said that no further drift in the Commonwealth finances could be permitted.

                    <para>Further, if during any financial year there are indications of a failure of revenue to meet expenditure, immediate further steps will be taken during the year to ensure that the budgets shall balance. </para>
                </quote><para>The Commonwealth representatives at the conference voted for that motion because, no doubt, it was regarded as sound. I presume that the motion was agreed to with a full knowledge of all the facts. In the light of that knowledge the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed to balance their budgets this year. They did not consider that they were agreeing to an impossibility; but it may be that this Government has created a partial impossibility by their delay in giving effect to the resolution. </para><para>The Acting Treasurer mentioned in his statement that the deficit in the Commonwealth accounts for the quarter ended 31st September last was no less than £6,747,000. That sum is about equal to the accumulated deficit for the past three years. It was rightly pointed out that those figures could not be regarded as a fair measure to be applied to the whole financial year; but the Acting Treasurer went on to say that a deficit of anything from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000 might result from the year's operations unless changes were made. The figures published subsequently for October reduced the deficit in the accounts to £5,900,000. It appears from the Acting Treasurer's statement that a deficit of £9,000,000 may occur in the estimated customs revenue during the year. That is exactly what the Opposition said would occur, but the opinion was received with laughter by honorable members opposite. The sales tax may return about £1,000,000 less than was anticipated. </para><interjection>

The Opposition challenged the Government's figures, in regard to both revenue and expenditure, and events have thoroughly justified the challenge. While the sales tax may return to the Treasury about £1,000,000 less than was anticipated, there is likely to be an increase in pensions expenditure of about £400,000. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Corio apparently does not appreciate the fact that the budget figures of the Prime Minister balanced ; yet we are now told by the Acting Treasurer that unless there is a restoration of confidence and a revival of trade and employment there will be a deficit of between £12,000,000 and £15,000,000 this year, and with the restoration of confidence and the revival of trade a deficit of between £8,000,000 and £10,000,000. Parliament has been called together again because the Government had not enough sense to act on the advice given by this side of the House in July last. </para>

                </continue><para>The London position is serious indeed. There, an amount of £38,000,000 is still outstanding. The Treasurer, in his budget speech in July, said that the existence of this overdraft was likely to prove seriously embarrassing. The position is worse now ; yet the Acting Treasurer has given the House no information as to whether any steps are being or can be taken in accordance with the amended budget proposals to remedy it. If the problem had been tackled in August the difficulty would not have arisen. Had the Government immediately set to work to reduce expenditure by £4,000,000 the London debt would have been funded readily ere this, with the result that about £20,000,000 would have been released by the Commonwealth Bank. According to the Acting Treasurer's statement, overdrafts and advances due to the Commonwealth Bank in London amount to about £20,000,000. If that debt had been funded a corresponding amount would, have been available for financing Australian public works and industries. That would have been a proper and honorable way of releasing credit, and could have been utilized had the Government acted promptly as it promised to do. </para><para>The Acting Treasurer, after showing a net short-term indebtedness in Australia of £7,134,000, dealt with the banking position and showed that the banks have strained their resources to the limit in order to finance Australian industry. According to the statistics quoted by the Acting Treasurer the proportion of advances to deposits was 95 per cent; adding Government securities, which are really loans to the Government, the proportion of advances to deposits is not less than 105 per cent. In the light of those figures nobody can truthfully say that the Commonwealth and trading banks are not doing their utmost to finance the present requirements of Australia. The national income, the Acting Treasurer stated, has dropped since last year by £70,000,000, representing the decrease in the prices of wool, wheat, and metals, and the smaller amount of money coming into Australia through external borrowing. This estimate leaves out of account the annual turnover of income. Every £1 received by the farmer for his wheat becomes part of the income of the storekeeper and merchant in that year, and we can safely say that the national income was between £100,000,000 and £150,000,000 lower than it was in the previous year. Now we are told that in the immediate future the income from wool and wheat will be even less - </para><quote>
                    <para>Wool is now averaging about 9d. per lb., compared with1s. 3d. for the clip of last year and1s. 7d. for the clip of the previous year, and the price of wheat f.o.b. Australia is less than 3s. a bushel, as compared with about 5s. a bushel last year. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">Inevitably there will be a further serious decline in the national income. In those circumstances the Melbourne agreement between the Commonwealth and the representatives of the States was made and the Premiers subscribed to it, trusting in the good faith of the Commonwealth Government. According to the official report of the conference the Acting Prime Minister stated - </para><quote>
                    <para>The Federal Cabinet had also agreed that the budget shall be balanced this year, that the position will be watched carefully, and that steps will be taken at the earliest moment necessary to adjust the position; firstly, by a reduction in expenditure, and secondly, any adjustment of taxation required to be made so as not to encroach on the State field of taxation. </para>

It is obvious that the party overruled the Government, for the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> is proposing, not a reduction of expenditure at the rate of £4,000,000 per annum, but what purports to be a reduction at the rate of slightly more than £3,000,000 per annum. The Government's proposals may have to be accepted in the absence of something better, but we are entitled to examine their adequacy. </para><para>The Acting Treasurer mentioned various proposed savings on the Estimates amounting to £1,230,000, but no information is given as to how these figures are arrived at. For instance, we are not told how £375,000 is to be saved in respect of " miscellaneous works and services and other savings ". There is nothing to indicate the nature of the savings, and whether, in fact, they can be realized. The Acting Treasurer proposes also to apply to the expenditure of the year £1,950,000 of amounts that rightly belong to the sinking fund. This cannot be claimed as a reduction in expenditure ; it is merely a device to enable the Government to continue living on substantially the same scale and to avoid providing for the redemption of the public debt.

Obviously if without breach of faith Parliament can repeal paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> and sub-section 2, it can repeal all the provisions until no security in the form of a sinking fund is left, except the financial agreement as it applies to loans floated in behalf of the States. Then, in addition to these alleged savings there are proposals for increased taxation by way of customs and excise, but I doubt very much whether the result will be to add to the revenue at all. Take for example the increased excise on tobacco. In Melbourne tobacco is to-day selling cheaply, because of a tobacco war, but when the effect of an increase in excise to 9s. or 9s. 3d. is. realized, the price of tobacco must increase substantially and its consumption fall appreciably. It is doubtful whether the estimates of the Acting Treasurer will be realized in any of their particulars. I do not propose to examine in detail the customs and excise provisions, but I say. as . I said in August last in this House, that . I cannotsee that they will bring in the estimated revenue. </para><para>I now come to the income tax provisions. We have before us- some most remarkably discriminatory proposals - proposals which, I venture to say, are most scandalously unjust. The exemption in the case of income from property is to be reduced to £ 100. An alteration is being made in the rate of tax on income from personal exertion and property. I have with me some estimates showing the effect in Victoria of these changes. Take an income of £400 a year from personal exertion. Last financial year the State and Federal income tax paid in such a case was £6 4s. ; this year it will be £13 2s. Now take the same income earned from property in Victoria. Last year the income tax paid to the State and the Commonwealth was £10 10s.; this year it will be £56 6s. In the case of an income of £500 from personal exertion,the increase in taxation is from £11 10s. to £20 5s., but on the income from property the tax is increased from £18 8s. to £74 5s. An income of £200 is to be exempt from taxation if earned by way of personal exertion, but if derived from property in the way of rents from a cottage or two, or interest on money earned as a result of thrift and saved over many years, the tax is to be £21 14s. The fixing of this low exemption in the case of property income is most unjust, and will impose hardship all over the Commonwealth. Many Australians - we probably all know some of them - have a strong sense of personal pride and independence, and have saved throughout their lives in. order that in their declining years they may be independent of the old-age pension. I am glad to say that there are thousands of these citizens, yet they are to be hit by this tax, and brought down below the living wage. I do appeal to the Government to reconsider this unjust proposal to alter income taxation. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- There should be some substantial alteration. It is a mistake to think that income from property represents the income of a lot of millionaires. One has only to look at the shareholders lists of banks and trading companies, and at the lists of bondholders in Commonwealth and State loans, savings bank loans, Board of Works loans and the like, to realize that there are a large number of very thrifty people in Australia. The best indication of that is the deposits in the savings banks. There are some 4,000,000 depositors in the savings banks of Australia, including, of course, a large number of children who are learning thrift in their early years. These citizens, excluding of course, the children, will be hit, some of them most cruelly by these proposals. </para>

Under this special legislation, every public servant receiving a salary of £725 or under is to be exempt from any reduction. The proposed rate of tax on salaries of between £725 and £1,000 is 10 per cent., from £1,000 to £1,500 12$ per cent., and. above that 15 per cent. Let us consider the operation of this tax. The man in receipt of £725 will lose nothing, but the man in receipt of £800 will, lose £75. Can there be any justification for such <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> scheme? This is class taxation of a. most  exaggerated  character. What reason can there be for drawing the line at £725? <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> refuse to believe that members of the Public Service - large numbers of whom. I know personally - would resent a fair all-round proportionate and graded reduction. Their own self. respect would lead them, at least those with whom I am acquainted, to accept a reduction of salary in these troublous times. Yet we find this Government introducing class legislation. It says that it is not reducing salaries. It, of course, would never reduce salaries unless it could be reasonably sure that the people at whom it hits are not its own political supporters. The men in the Defence Department who cannot join a union have had their work rationed, but those who belong to unions have not been rationed. Only the non-unionist members of the Public Service - some of whom have applied for admission to unions and have been refused - are to have their salaries reduced. This Government refuses to reduce the salaries of any body of  men  who are its own political supporters. This Government promised at the Pre miers Conference in Melbourne that the budget would be balanced first by the reduction of expenditure. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> was responsible for a reduction of S-l/3rd per cent, in public service salaries in <inline font-style="italic">'New</inline> South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> merely to get votes, promised to restore those salaries. That was one of the most contemptible political promises ever made, and I hope that it will be the last example of its kind. The Labour party, because of its lavish and irresponsible political promises is now being brought up against the inexorable logic of facts. The people are realizing that they have for years been deceived by the Labour party, that it has a so-called policy which can only be put into operation when there is plenty of money to spend. It has no real political principles. The people will doubtless realize this position before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> has been in power very long. This Federal Government  now proposes that public servants in receipt of over £725 are to suffer a reduction in salary, but those receiving under £725 are to remain untouched. The hypocritical pretence is being made that salaries are not; being reduced, bur. that a tax is being levied. In any case the public servant affected is to get less salary. The tax is to be subtracted before he receives his salary. I suppose that there are some honorable members who think that they can deceive themselves by this vain pretence. It is obviously a hypocritical device to hide the inevitable reduction of salary. It is, however, significant that expenditure throughout the Public Service is being maintained substantially at its old level of about. £11,000,000'. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogan,</inline> the Labour Premier of Victora, relying upon thu good, faith of the Federal Government that it would also do an. unpopular thing, is carrying through the Victorian Parliament at the present time a reduction in the salaries of public servants of from 5 to 20 per cent.

Other State Premiers are doing it too; but I refer particularly to Labour Premiers, because I should have thought that this Government would keep faith with politicians of their own kin. </para><para>Let me say one further word in respect of this remarkable action of the Government in drawing a line at salaries of £725 per annum. In answer to a question that F. put to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton).</inline> I received this morning information to the effect that the number of permanent employees in the Commonwealth Public Service is 28,855 ; temporary and exempt employees, 4,179; total, 33,034. The members of naval, military and air forces number 5,959; other employees, 5,459; total, 11,418. Combining the Public Service and the naval, military and air forces, the total number of Commonwealth employees is over 44,000. I also asked the Acting Prime Minister how many persons in those classes were in receipt of salaries of £725 and over. The answer is that, apart from 112 members of Parliament, the number is 491, including  50 rationed military officers, who are outside of the taxation scheme. That leaves 441 persons, out of some 44,000 government employees, effected by this taxation, representing -just about 1 per cent. Does any honorable member in this House believe that this taxation is fair in principle or in its results? </para><para>I conclude by saying that the Government ought to have carried out the agreement made by the Prime Minister in Melbourne. It was not a casual agreement; but an agreement made as the result of a special Cabinet meeting held at the Prime Minister's own home. I say first that the Government has not done what it promised to do; that other governments are doing unpopular things,believing that the promise of this Government would be carried out. This Government has, therefore, broken faith with the States. Judging by what it has done, it will certainly fail to balance the budget. On the Acting Treasurer's own figures, even if all his anticipations are realized,there will be a deficit of over £1,000,000', and, if his anticipations are not realized, as I fear indeed will be the case, the deficit will be much greater. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline></para><para>The Government should not budget for a deficit as it is doing to the admitted extent of at least over £1,000,000.

                    <para>.- I second the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> I was not at all surprised at the summons which came to honorable members to meet before Christmas to assist the Government in revising its budget proposals. I was, however, surprised at the delay which occurred between the holding of the financial conference in Melbourne in August last, where the Prime Minister met the State Premiers, and the meeting of Parliament. Three months ago honorable members on this side of the chamber urged the Government to reduce its expenditure by at least £4,000,000 annually; but the members of the Government and their supporters placed a blind eye to the telescope and pretended that they did not see any necessity for any reduction in expenditude.  I told honorable members at the time that, although they were trying to evade their responsibilities, they could not avoid facing the situation for any length of time. I informed them that as sure as the harvest would ripen the position would have to be faced. We have now been called together to do something, inadequate as it is, before the harvest has ripened. The financial statement presented by the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> is a pitiably feeble effort to meet an  unprecedented financial situation. I do not believe that the Acting Treasurer is himself satisfied with it. I think that if he had been permitted to have his own way he would have introduced measures more likely to assist in overcoming our financial difficulties. The reductions which are foreshadowed in this amended budget are hopelessly insufficient - they are ludicrously inadequate. If it were necessary a few months ago to reduce expenditure by £4,000,000 annually in order to bring us back to the level of last year's expenditure, it is of even greater necessity to-day. The steps which the Government proposes to take, represent the last word in feebleness and futility, and disclose the extent to which the Government has departed from the budget proposals delivered in July last. How immeasurably have they fallen short of the Prime Minister's <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> words. The Prime Minister, in introducing his budget in July last, said - </para>

                <para class="block">The Government has abandoned its own resolution. It has gone back on the Words which the Prime Minister used in introducing the budget in July last. It has gone back on the resolution unanimously carried at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in August last. Apparently, the Government realizes that it cannot carry out the resolution which it supported except by calling upon all members of the community to make substantial sacrifices; but this it has not the moral courage to do. This Government prefers to break its word rather than run the risk of losing votes. It declines to carry out what it undertook to do in July and August of this year. The Government trembles before the voting strength of the Public Service. The proposals of the Government embody a scheme to impose additional income taxation on those in receipt of a salary of £14 a week and over. The figures given in reply to a question asked this afternoon show that only 1 per cent, of the members of the Public Service enjoy such a salary. What of the other 99 per cent.? One is reminded of a passage in the Scriptures which tells us that one lost sheep was for the time being of more moment than the other 99 within the fold. Did the members of the Government have this in their minds when considering this proposal or was it the salvation of the 99 votes that actuated them? Last week the Acting Treasurer said - </para>

                    <para>That the community generally is at present in a state of inertia, and is awaiting a lead from some responsible authority to restore confidence. That lead should undoubtedly  come  from the highest representative body in the: community, which is the Commonwealth Government. The Government recognizes this responsibility. The first need in the present circumstances is that the Government should take steps for the balancing of the budget. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The Government does not propose to act upon that principle. It is not giving a lead to the community. No one can say that the proposals outlined in the revised budget can in any sense be regarded as a lead to the community. Neither can it be contended that the steps proposed to be taken under the revised proposals will result in balancing the budget. The Government is deliberately aiming at a further deficit. The Government's aims is to add to the accumulated deficit, and then, like Macawber, to wait for something to turn up. Does the Government seriously anticipate that the revenue will be greater next year, and that it will be easier then to overcome the obstacles now confronting it than it is this year. The merest tyro must recognize that the revenue from income taxation, for instance, will be smaller next year than it is this year, for the simple reason that income taxation is invariably based on the earnings of the previous year. People will pay income taxation this year based on their earnings of la3t year. A large number will pay a fairly substantial amount this year based on last year's earnings, who will pay practically nothing next year. If the Government thinks that it will be able to balance the budget next year when it cannot do it this year, it is doomed to disappointment. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. It is certain that no government could have been more spineless - and that i3 a flattering term - in dealing with a difficult situation. Customs revenue cannot reasonably bo expected to be better next year than it has been this year. The arguments which apply to income taxation can also be used in connexion with customs revenue. Importations are usually the result of income obtained by business firms in the preceding year, and it is, therefore, extremely improbable that we can expect any immediate improvement in the revenue from this source. Next year will undoubtedly present its own difficulties without those associated with a deficit this year. The Government should take immediate steps to balance income and expenditure in conformity with, the Prime Minister's announcement in July, and with the resolution which the Acting Prime Minister and other Ministers assisted to carry at the Melbourne conference in August last. A man can bo excused for living beyond his income for one year, because he may suffer from an unexpected reduction of his income in that year. He may be excused also for proceeding on the old basis of expenditure for the second year, if he has a reasonable expectation of his income quickly reverting to its normal state. But if he continues to live beyond his income for a considerable number of years there is nothing ahead of him but insolvency. That is just what the Government is attempting to do; it is not even making an attempt to balance its budget, but is endeavouring to live beyond its income. </para>

                <para>For the last three years, unfortunately, we have had deficits. In each of those three years - two under the administration of the Bruce-Page Government, and the last under the administration of the / present Government - efforts were made by the treasurers to balance their budgets. They did not anticipate, nor did they aim at, producing deficits. This year, however, we are in the extraordinary position that the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> is deliberately budgeting to spend from £1,120,000 to £8,120,000 more than he will receive. He himself has told us that if trade should revive, aud if his most sanguine expectations should be realized, we may expect that, on the basis of the budget which was brought down in July, there will be a deficit of from £S,000,000 to £10,000,000. He has told us, further, that if the existing depression should continue and there should he no improvement, we may expect that, on the basis of the July budget, there will be a deficit of from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000. That means that, in the event of his most optimistic estimate being realized, the best, that ho can hope for is that his proposals in the financial statement that he delivered last week, will leave him with a deficit of £1,120,000; but that, on the other hand, if his worst estimate should prove to be true - and I profoundly hope that it will not - under this amended budget we shall have a deficit of £8,120,000. We have no right to further mortgage the future in that way. </para>
                <para>The savings and economies, as they are called, which are set out in the revised budget at page 8, total, in round figures, £1,230,000. If the Acting Treasurer's estimate of the gap which must be bridged in the event of trade not improving should prove to be correct, those savings and economies, on the basis of the July budget, represent a saving of only one-twelfth of what needs to be saved, which is equivalent to Id. for every ls., or ls. Sd. in the £1. In addition, the Government proposes to divert certain moneys that are now applied to the sinking fund. The diversion of those moneys, to the extent of a little under £2,000,000, will represent a reduction of the maximum deficit by 2s. 6d. in the £1. It is dangerous to tamper with any sinking fund provision. I recognize, however, the extraordinary difficulty in which the Government finds itself, and I would not be too critical of its action in taking what, to-day is applied to the sinking fund in excess of the 10s. per cent, stipulated iu the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, provided that that amount was ear-marked to be applied to the sinking fund of the States' debts. As honorable gentlemen well know, the Commonwealth provides one-third of the sinking fund of 7s. 6d. per cent, which has to be provided on State debt that existed prior to the commencement of the financial agreement. Upon all new debt incurred by the States through the Loan Council ' subsequent to that date, the Commonwealth provides one-half of the sinking fund and the States the  other  half. If the Acting Treasurer would undertake to see that this money which he proposes to divert from Commonwealth sinking funds, portion of which is obtained from the profits of the Commonwealth Bank, and portion from reparation payments, is ear-marked to provide that portion of the sinking funds of the States provided by the- Commonwealth, I would not be unduly critical of his proposal in a difficult period like the present. Reparation payments, particularly, ought to be used in that way. The Acting Treasurer's difficulties would not bc increased in the slightest degree; it would merely mean that money which formerly was applied to Commonwealth sinking funds in excess of the statutory 10s. per cent, stipulated by the financial agreement would replace money that the Common  wen  th would otherwise have to find to provide its quota of the sinking funds of the States. I hope that the Acting Treasurer will give consideration to my suggestion. </para>
                <para>I have stated that the savings and economies foreshadowed in this revised budget amount to only ls. 8d. in the £1 of the amount required on the assumption that we have the tremendous deficit which the Acting Treasurer has forecast, should the present depression continue, and that the diversion of sinking fund moneys represents an additional. 2s. 6d. in the £1. The new taxation proposals, which total £3,700,000' for the eight months of the financial year that remain, represent about 25 per cent., or 5s. in the £1. Those three items in the aggregate total 9s. 2d. for every £1 which the Treasurer would require in the event of his worst, expectations being realized. No provision whatever has been made for the other 10s. lOd. in the £1. </para>
                <para>On the other hand, if the Acting Treasurer's most optimistic estimate should prove to be right - and I hope that it will - we shall still have a deficit of from £1,120,000 to £3,120,000. Assuming there is a revival of trade, and a realization of the honorable gentleman's best estimate, he has budgeted to bridge the gap of from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000 to the extent of something under £7,000,000; therefore, he has budgeted with his eyes open for the deficit that I have mentioned in the event of his best hopes being realized, and for a deficit of from £5,120,000 to £8,120,000 in the event of his worst fears being borne out. Surely, the very least that could be expected of any government in such a position, even though only eight months of the financial year remain, was to budget to make income and expenditure balance on the most favorable estimate, Indeed. that would not go nearly far enough. It is the duty of the Government r,o endeavour to secure a balance upon figures taken at least at a point half way between the estimated minimum and maximum deficits. Had the Government budgeted to balance its accounts on the expectation that the figures would be adverse to the extent of mid-way between the Treasurer's best and worst estimates, we could have supported it with a little more enthusiasm than we can now. To do that, it would be necessary so to cut expenditure that, in the remaining eight months of the financial year, there would be an additional saving of £4,000,000, equivalent to £6,000,000 in a full year. Undoubtedly, that would be very drastic action ; but I believe that we have reached the stage when it ought to be taken, and that if it is not taken a very much more drastic reduction will have to be made next year. The reduction that I have suggested would involve a 20 per cent, cut on all controllable Commonwealth expenditure. If it were made immediately we might be able to continue permanently on that basis; but I believe that if it be not done now, next year we shall have reached such a pass that possibly a 25 per cent, or even a 30 per cent, cut will be absolutely inescapable, and a degree of hardship will be inflicted which can be avoided if the Government will take its courage in its hands and do the right thing. Why does the Government persist with its Micawber-like attitude of waiting for something to turn up to enable it to carry on indefinitely upon a basis of expenditure that is far beyond our present means? It has no ground whatever for expecting that next year's revenue will be even nearly so good as that of this year. Certainly, next year's income tax receipts, which will bo based on this year's income, will be very much lower than this year's collections, which will be based on last year's income. Therearc in this community persons who still will not realize how much poorer as a nation we are to-day than we were two or three years ago, when the prices of the commodities that we produce in largequantities for export were so much higher than they are now. But, surely the combined intelligence of Ministers is sufficient to enable them to realize that fact. It must be obvious to any one who thinks at all, that Australia's national wealth is almost entirely, or at any rate very largely, dependent upon the values placed by the world upon the huge exportable surplus of our staple products, and that any fall in world prices which affects those commodities, affects us as a nation. There has been a tremendous fall in the world's prices for almost all commodities, manufactured goods or raw materials, and the people of all countries are feeling the effects of this decline in values. We in Australia are suffering to a greater extent than are the people elsewhere, for the simple reason that values for the particular commodities which we produce for export have fallen further than those of other commodities. The prices for manufactured goods have come down somewhat ;. but to nothing like the extent of the fall in prices of raw materials. Thus our primary producers have been hit harder perhaps than other sections of the community. It is only when we examine in some detail the current prices for the commodities which Australia produces for export that we realize fully how serious' has been the diminution in  out  nationalincome, as compared with our positiononly two or three years ago. As is well known to all, our principal export commodity is wool. For about six years prior to 1929 our average wool cheque was in the neighbourhood of £70,000,000. This year it will be about £30,000,000. In other words, as regards wool alone, the loss in our national income will be approximately £40,000,000. Wheat ranks next in value among our principal export commodities. It is difficult, at the moment. to assess the average price which will be received for our exports of wheat this year ; but I believe that we shall have to be content with at least 2s. per bushel less than we have enjoyed in recent years. If, as seems likely, our exportable surplus this year should be .150,000,000 bushels, a reduction in price of 2s. per bushel will mean a further drop in income of £15,000,000. Another important export commodity is dairy produce. Butter today is selling at 6d. per lb. less than at the corresponding period of last year. If our exportable surplus this year should be in the neighbourhood of 54,000 tons - I do not consider this an over-estimate, because our exports have been as high as 65,000 tons and the average is' about 40,000 tons - a decline of 6d. per lb. will represent a further loss of £3,000,000. Fruit and meat prices also have fallen lately. So also have world's values for metals of all descriptions. The Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh</inline> for 1926-27 shows that our export of metals, the product of mines and quarries in Australia, in that year were £20,000,000. That figure has been cut at least in half this year, because spelter has fallen from £25 per ton to £14 per ton, and lead, copper and tin have also declined seriously. Except for comparatively insignificant items our exportable products are almost wholly made up of wool, wheat, dairy produce, meat, fruits, and metals, and it is safe to assume, from the figures which I have quoted, that our national income this year from the pastoral, agricultural, dairying, meat, fruit and metal industries will decline by between £60,000,000 and £70,000,000'. Probably the figure will be £70,000,000. In 1927-28, we received from the sale of these products £132,000,000, so the decline in value represents a reduction in our national income of about 50 per cent, for the same volume of goods. </para>
                <para>We have to ask ourselves if this is merely a passing phase in our trade position, or if it is likely that the markets for these commodities will so suddenly recover that we shall be  justified  in maintaining governmental expenditure at the same rate as hitherto. I think that prices for these commodities must recover somewhat, for the  simple  reason that present values are so far below the cost of production that unless some upward tendency occurs soon large numbers of producers and manufacturers in all countries will be driven out of business. But he would be a very sanguine man - indeed he would be a super-optimist - who predicted a full recovery in the value of these products to the levels of the last few years. I think that possibly prices will recover to the extent of two- thirds the rates ruling in recent years. If my assumption is correct, it is obvious that the prices for all manufactured goods, and the cost of services generally, must be forced down to the new level of two-thirds the average prices for our staple exports during the last two or three years. If this is done, we shall be able to continue to produce for export; if it is not done, our primary producers will be unable to carry on. </para>
                <para>Unfortunately, this Government is taking no steps whatever to assist in bringing about, at the earliest possible moment, a proper relationship between the prices of manufactured goods and the cost of services, and the prices of primary products. On the contrary, its action lately in imposing high tariffs and embargoes has had the effect .of retarding any tendency to a proper adjustment in the relationship of commodity prices and cost of services. Indeed, the present Government seems to be anxious, not merely to keep the prices for all manufactured goods and the cost of services at the old level, but, if possible, to increase them. A question was asked in this House this afternoon about the cost of fencing wire, a commodity largely used by our primary producers. It had relation to a report in the press only the other day that the manufacturers of fencing wire and wire netting were increasing their prices practically to the extent of the duty imposed on fencing wire in lieu of the bounty. To encourage the manufacture in Australia of requisites essential to primary producers, former governments legislated for the payment of bounties in preference to the imposition of customs duties, thus ensuring that price levels should approximate freetrade import rates. This policy was to the advantage of primary producers, who have to sell their commodities in open competition in the world's markets. But this Government recently made a drastic a Iteration. It withdrew the bounty payments and imposed, instead, customs duties, with the inevitable result that pricesof fencing wire, galvanized iron, &amp;c, are now being increased to the limit permitted by the tariff. It is clear to all that this Government does not really appreciate its obligation to our primary producers, who, to-day, are practically without a living wage, owing to the serious decline in world's prices for their wool, wheat, and other exportable products. Formerly the people as a whole through the Government, bore some portion of the burden of carrying on these secondary industries on an artificial basis. Now it appears that the primary producer and the users of these commodities will have to bear the whole of it. It should be the duty of this Parliament so to modify the tariff as to make it possible for costs of production in secondary industries to be brought to a more reasonable price relation to the value of our export staple products. The recent increases in customs duties, and the . imposition of super taxes, have been retarding the natural fall in price levels. </para>
                <para>We have heard a good deal lately about the need for equality of sacrifice. I agree that this is very desirable. Already the primary producers, as I have shown, have suffered heavily owing to the tremendous drop in the world's prices for their exportable surplus products, and I suggest that some sacrifice should now be expected of those who cater for the needs of our farmers. I have lately had brought under ' my notice some extraordinary examples of hardship, and 1 shall cite one or two instances to bring home to honorable members the true position of our primary producers. Recently, when I was touring through a wheat-growing district in New South Wales, I met a number of returned soldier wheat-growers. I asked one of them what his own crop was like, and, in reply, he said that if rain had come three weeks or a month earlier he would have had a magnificent crop, but, as things were, he would find it hard to carry on. He explained that a day or two prior to my visit an officer of the Rural Industries Board - the body which, in New South Wales, finances returned soldiers in farming operations - had inspected his farm for the purpose of estimating the value of his crop. This officer told him that, owing to adverse weather conditions, he could expect no return from one-half of his cultivation, and a bag per acre from the other half. </para>

                        <para>- The Murruinbidgee area. The representative of the Rural Industries Board told this young man that, judging from the appearance of his crop, if rain had come a month earlier he would have had twelve bags to the acre. This returned soldier, I may add, was not grumbling at his ill fortune. He merely stated the facts, and was accepting the blow with remarkable fortitude. Another instance that came under ray notice was the plight of two young men, who had invested £16,000, representing the whole of their capital, in the purchase of a small station property two years ago believing that wool-growing would continue to be profitable. As the full purchase price was £43,000, they arranged a mortgage for the balance, and also borrowed sufficient to stock the property. They had obtained two seasons' wool clips; but the price obtained was so low that the other day these young men interviewed the man from, whom they had borrowed the money and advised him to take over the property, as they could not possibly meet their interest liabilities this year. Although these young men had lost the whole of their capital, they were not complaining; but, like the returned soldier wheat-grower, they accepted the inevitable with praiseworthy courage and philosophy. I now invite honorable members to consider the sacrifices that have been and are being made by thousands of primary producers such as these young men to whom I have alluded, and compare their position with that of the public servants of New South Wales, some of whom are complaining bitterly about a cut of8 per cent. in their salaries. It is amazing, to my mind, that this Government is not taking some action to ensure equality of sacrifice so far as that is possible on the part of every person in the community. The effect of the increased duties, super taxes, and embargoes which have been placed upon imported goods has been to retard the natural fall in price of manufactured articles, a fall which would be desirable for many reasons, and would bring them more into conformity with the prices of our exportable products. We were told some time ago that the embargoes and increased duties had been imposed with the object of improving the trade balance; that that policy was not governed by ordinary economic considerations, but represented special action taken by the Government to meet a particular emergency. Some of us asserted" at that time that the very high rate of exchange, together with our poverty as purchasers, would be quite sufficient to restrict imports without the imposition of super taxes and embargoes. That has been proved. Only the other day I saw some authoritative statistics which showed that the decline in our imports has taken place in almost exactly the same proportion in those goods which come into the country duty free, as in those upon which increased, tariff duties have been imposed. </para>

                <para>The only successful method of increasing the volume and value of our exports - and I take it that all honorable members feel that the best means of getting out of our financial difficulty is to increase our export production - is to bring about lower production costs. That cannot be achieved with the present tariff millstone about our necks. Some of the flat rates of duty which have been recently imposed for protective purposes are, compared with the ordinary ad valorem duties, absolutely absurd in the light of the  present  fall in the value of the goods. Flat rates, which possibly represented 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, previously, now represent as much as 100 per cent. Our first duty as a parliament is to remove crushing customs duties from the essential machinery of production. I should like to impress on the Government the absolute impossibility of encouraging exports under the existing tariff policy. Some people believe that our trade balance and overseas credit can be best improved by greater production for export. I am one of those who believe that. There are others who seem to cling to the belief that the only way to improve our trade balance is to restrict imports by raising the tariff, thus increasing the cost of production. The restriction of imports by means of an ever-increasing tariff has the effect of putting a brake on export by adding to the cost of production. To ask men to increase production for export in order to improve the exchange position, and at the same time increasing their costs by the imposition of prohibitive tariffs - to ask them to open up new markets while prejudicing those markets against them by embargoes and an absurd tariff policy - is like requiring a horse to pull a load up a steep hill, and at the same time putting on the brake in order to keep the vehicle from slipping back. </para>
                <para>If we maintain the prices of manufactured articles in this country at a higher level than prevails anywhere else in. the world, it must have the effect eventually of debasing the standard of living in Australia. Some persons argue the opposite, but my contention is that if high prices be maintained many articles which ought to be in the homes of the poor people, as well as in those of the well-to-do, will be quite out of the reach of the great mass of the people. Therefore, the standard of comfort must be lower than it ought, to be. I believe that only in a policy of sane tariff reform leading to lower costs does there lie any hope for the future. If such a policy be followed, we may expect to have our people re-employed at the best wages that Australia can provide for them, taking into account the amount of our national income. We must remember that it is impossible to take a quart out of a pint pot, though some persons evidently seem anxious to make the a  attempt </para>
                <para>Meanwhile the immediate task before Parliament is to balance the budget as was promised by the Prime Minister in July, and in accordance with the undertaking entered into by him with the Premiers of the States in August last. This revised budget falls very far short of achieving that desirable end. Those honorable members who are concerned about the future of their country are profoundly disappointed with the Government's financial proposals. To budget deliberately for a deficit of anything from £1,000,000 to £S,000,000 merely because the Government is afraid to make those economies  which it knows should be made is not the way to restore our national credit. Such action must injure our credit, which is low enough as it is. What is the position in New Zealand? We have heard in the past a great deal about our enormous national debt, and that Australia is carrying a tremendous load of debt per head of population - State and Commonwealth. It is indeed a very big debt, but the fact remains that the national debt of New Zealand is greater per head than the national debt of Australia - State and Commonwealth combined. Yet New Zealand's credit is so good that her 5 per cent, bonds are worth on the London market £102 10s. as compared with £75 for Australian bonds. The credit of South Africa also is thoroughly sound, and her 5 per cent, bonds are worth £100 15s. </para>
                <para>Our credit would not have fallen so low if the Government had had the courage to face the situation as it should have done. I can speak for the members of my own party, and, I think, for every honorable member on this side of the House, when I say that had the Government brought down proposals to economise sufficiently to balance the budget it would have had the unqualified support of every member on this side of the House. The Government should have taken steps . to honour the two pledges to which I have referred. Those promises were made not by us but by the Government, yet we would be prepared to support the Government in any measures of economy designed to carry them out. Evidently, the Government is prepared to break its own word in this matter, because it lacks the courage to do what it knows ought to be done. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. , </para>

                    <para>. - I should have thought that in a debate of this kind when, one might say, the fate of the country is hanging in the balance, at least some honorable members on the Government side of the House would have risen in their places to defend the Government's financial proposals. I should have thought that there would, perhaps, be some honorable members on the opposite side who would have ranged themselves behind the pledges given by the Prime Minister in July last, and the undertaking . entered into by him in August with the Premiers of the various States. I had looked for some pronouncement from them which would have had the effect of maintaining and supporting our national credit, without which we can achieve nothing in the present crisis. Evidently, however, the statement of the Acting Treasurer is to go unsupported, and no reply is to be made to the devastating criticism levelled against the budget by the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon. In the course of a clear, forceful and analytical speech, the Leader of the Opposition exposed the hollow hypocrisy of the Government's proposals, and pointed out how far those proposals fell short of what our national honour demanded should be done. </para>

Everyone now admits its seriousness. If the Government had brought down proposals in accordance with the terms of the Melbourne agreement - that agreement which was signed by the Prime Minister himself after he had conferred with his cabinet - we on this side of the House would have done our utmost to assist it. While I am prepared, even now, to support the Government in any reasonable proposals, I shall not remain silent when I see it perpetrating cruel injustices on sections of my fellow citizens. I blame the Government for not having the courage to cope with the situation in its early stages. The gravest doubts were expressed as to the wisdom of the departure of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> for England at such a critical period. However, the right honorable gentleman signed an undertaking that certain action should be taken by the Government, and nothing can convince me that  ii was not the bounden duty of the Government to place those proposals before this House promptly. Instead, it vacillated and allowed the position to become more acute. It was only after the result of the New South Wales elections had been announced and the problem had become alarmingly dangerous and difficult, that Parliament was called together. As far back as last August, Cabinet agreed that certain action should be taken, but it was as late as the 3rd October last, before the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Penton)</inline> stated -  </para>

                    <para>The Cabinet lias met and discussed the whole financial position. Proposals to balance the budget, submitted by the sub-committee of the Cabinet, were discussed and were approved substantially as presented. It was agreed that the expenditure must be reduced at the rate of approximately £4,000,000 a year. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">He asserted that the party would meet on Monday, the 27th October, and that Parliament would be called together on Thursday, the 30th October. That announcement is definite. Cabinet agreed to reduce the budget by £4,000,000 per annum. Now, after all that delay, the Government comes down with a proposed reduction which is, comparatively, a mere bagatelle. </para><para>It is apparent from the financial statement of the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that the honorable gentleman did his utmost to pursuade  the Government to agree to a more satisfactory and effective arrangement. A close examination of his speech makes it obvious that, while it embodies the Acting Treasurer's desires to a certain point, the pruning knife has been used severely, and party interpolations are numerous. I give the Acting Treasurer all credit for his endeavour to give effect to the honorable intentions of his leader, and realize that his endeavours have been checked by the' party. Certainly, the proposals advanced fall deplorably short of what is necessary. </para><para>Three different opinions are advanced by different sections in this chamber. There are those who believe that the position can be righted only by strict economy, the payment of our debts, and a reduction in the cost of production. Another section apparently wants us co pay our way, but at the same time desires to maintain our fictitious rates of  wages  and standard of living, without advancing any definite plans to enable that to be done. Like all weak people, adherents of that section are floundering in the morass of political expediency and moral cowardice. In that category I place the Government. Then there is a third section, composed of members who are prepared to repudiate the nation's debts rather than reduce wages or extend hours of labour,, believing that therein lies their easiest political path. I believe, definitely, that the salvation of Australia lies only in the adoption of the first method. By resorting to the inflation of currency, under the guise of " stabilization," " extension of credit," or any other fanciful name, we should merely impose upon our people hardships similar to those placed on their workers by the central powers of Europe. And the result would be the same. Despite the poverty and misery inflicted upon those unfortunate, people, their go- vernments eventually have had to return to the only sane course, that which we on this side advocated at the last election, and advocate now, the first of the three proposals that I have enunciated. Only by such methods can we conform to honorable principles, and lift Australia out of the slough of financial despondency into which it has temporarily fallen. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Actually, it would not lower real wages. It is possible to increase the currency and give our workers wages nominally twice as high as those at present paid, but these would not purchase half as much as do existing wages. I do desire, not the reduction of real wages, but a readjustment of the position to provide that everybody shall make an equal sacrifice in the effort to stabilize the country. The second method to which I have referred is a weak and cowardly way of dealing with the difficulty, while the third course is utterly dishonest, and unworthy of a. responsible government. It is just as dishonest for a nation to refuse to pay its just debts as it is for an individual to do so. Any nation that is prepared to resort to subterfuge in an endeavour to evade its liabilities, by issuing valueless paper money, and similar efforts to undermine the national stability, must inevitably reap the financial whirlwind that has been the reward of other nations which have adopted such methods. </para>

                </continue><para>This Government has failed utterly to effect the economies which it promised in August last, when it entered into an agreement with the States. It then made a distinct compact with the Labour Premiers of Victoria and South Australia, and the National Premiers of the other States. All were to live within their revenues and endeavour to balance their budgets. To give effect to that undertaking it was necessary to act in a manner which is disagreeable to any politician. No cabinet, either National or Labour, likes to reduce the wages of its civil servants, or to impose grinding taxation upon the people. However, the Premiers returned to their respective States perfectly trustful of the good faith of the Commonwealth. They honoured their undertakings, and performed their disagreeable tasks. </para><interjection>

The net result of all the Government's economies has been a reduction in expenditure of a paltry £430,000 in a total expenditure of £65,587,770.

                        <para>- In my opinion it is so. If the Government had come forward boldly and proposed a straightout reduction of members'" salaries to £500, or if it had even proposed a straightout reduction by 10 per cent, something could have been said for the proposal, but to effect a reduction by means of taxation of the kind suggested is petty and mean. "No doubt, the first opportunity will be taken to restore the remuneration of members to £1,000. Honorable members opposite will greedily revert to that figure on the first favorable occasion. I repeat that such conduct brings upon membership of this Parliament public opprobrium. </para>

                </continue><para>It is proposed to reduce the salaries of certain public servants, but no salaries affected by the Government's proposal are to bc reduced below £725. The Leader of the Opposition has already dealt clearly and penetratingly with this proposal, and has shown the sham and hollowness of it. Out of 40,000. Commonwealth public servants, only 440, including members of Parliament, are to be taxed. Nothing more grotesque could be imagined than this proposal for meeting the difficult financial situation which faces the Government. I am confident that, with few exceptions, all the members of the Commonwealth Public Service would be willing to submit to a graduated reduction of their salaries iu these difficult times. They feel, as a matter of fact, that they are being put in a false position by the Government's proposal to tax only the higher salaries, and they would be quite willing to agree to reductions similar to those which are being imposed upon State public servants. If the Government would introduce a properly graduated tax or salary reduction to apply to the Public Service generally, it would be able to save, not a mere £60,000, but probably £1,000,000 out of the £11,000,000 paid annually to the Public Service. The present proposal must inevitably bring the Government into contumely. </para><interjection>

All beseems to have accomplished is to have gained the sympathyof the people of England because of the actions of his colleagues in his absence. The Government's attempts at economy are a byword. It has hot rnade an honest attempt to reduce expenditure : it lias  not  been  untrammelled  by political considerations, otherwise ir could have saved at least £4,000,000. </para><para>A study of the Government's taxation proposals suggests that it has sought the most cruel form of taxation to impose on the workers of Australia. In one year it expects to take £44,000,000 out of the pockets of a little over 6,000,000 people by means of customs duties. It has also imposed a tax on tea. I can imagine with what joy the announcement of this tax waa received by many persons in the community. I fancy that I can hear the applause of the workers in Brunswick and other industrial centres of the Commonwealth, when Labour members tell their constituents that, in addition to taxing their beer and tobacco, the Government lias imposed a tax of 4d. or 6d. per lb. on the family tea. The sales tax has also been increased as a means of getting the country out of its financial difficulties. The presence in the chamber of the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> reminds me of a speech he made in the recent election campaign in New South Wales, in which he told the electors that the Federal Government would have the courage to increase the sales tax. He did not tell them that that tax was directed at those at the base of the pyramid - the workers - while the more wealthy sections of the community, at the apex of the pyramid, would be unaffected by it. Nor did he tell the electors that the Government which had the courage to increase the sales tax was not game to reduce the allowances of members of Parliament. A few weeks ago the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> speaking on the solidarity of the Labour caucus, said that nothing in the civilized world is equal to this expression of human endeavour which is so solid and united. Yet within a week that magnificent structure which he called upon every one to admire, was tottering on its foundations. We hear of divisions with twenty ayes and sixteen noes. The whole of this morning was spent by the caucus in watering down a previous motion to make it so innocuous that no one can understand it. The Government's taxation proposals will bit the worker hardest of all, and will prevent the downward trend in the cost of living. The taxation imposed by this </para><para class="block">Government  is so heavy that I do not know how the workers outside those in the sheltered industries will be able to carry on. One of the undertakings given by the Commonwealth Government at the Melbourne conference was that the Commonwealth would not further encroach on. the field of taxation which rightly belonged to the States. Thu Acting Treasurer's <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> financial statement included this paragraph - </para><quote>
                    <para>Tin; new income tax proposals relate principally to income from property. The object aimed at is an increase in property taxation, which, with increases by the States, will result in property bearing a fair burden in the plati of budget re-adjustment. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">Clearly, this amended budget is an infraction of the Melbourne undertaking; it proposes a shattering inroad on the States' domain of taxation. The honorable gentleman further stated that the new proposals " are designed so as to spread the additional burdens equitably over the whole community without unduly  entering  the fields of taxation on which the States rely ". Are we to infer that in addition to the imposts which this Government now  threatens,  the States also are to increase their income taxes? If that happens, the country will be in a. desperate state. Already the Government has found that the last increases of duties on beer and spirits have reduced instead of increasing the revenue, and they cannot proceed further in that  field  without risking an undue sacrifice of income. That is true also of tobacco and other heavily taxed commodities. The limit of taxation has been reached, and it is time that the Government realized that Australia cannot be taxed into prosperity. I have never heard of a more unfair proposal than that relating to the tax on income from property. The Government proposes to raise an additional £1,500 000 from income tax, the bulk of which will come from the most deserving class in the community - the thrifty people of small incomes. The exemption of income from property is to be reduced from £3 CO to £100, and will disappear entirely  when  the taxable income reaches £200. Cri such income, the Government proposes to levy a further tax of <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent. Thi.? means that the small property-owner, who by industry, rigid thrift, and stern selfdenial, has saved a few thousand pounds, w hile his neighbour has been punting his money away on the racecourse and wasting it on pianolas and motor cars, is, in his old age, to be taxed into penury. The Acting Treasurer hypocritically </para><para>All fixed income from property, including interest, is in a relatively better position today than last yearbecause of reduced commodity prices. In these circumstances, income from property may fairly be requiredto provide more taxation. 1s that not true also of public servants in receipt of salaries of less than £725 per annum, and of unionists in sheltered industries whose wages are at the peak, while their fellow unionists are struggling for a crust? The Government's proposal will mean that a widow, who has an income of £200 from bonds and property, will be required to pay as muchincome tax as a man in receipt of a salary of £750. </para><interjection>

                </interjection><para>Mr. ARCHDALE PARKHILL. - It is not, and the Labour party should not stand for such inequality. A person with an annual income of £300 from property will pay £29 8s. 4d., whilst a man with a salary of £1,000 a year will pay only £34 10s. 3d. Such inequalities cannot be justified. Many people with a small income from investments have little or no margin above the amount sufficient to maintain them; they are too proud to lean on the State, but because they have won a bare competence an additional 12s. 6d. per week is to be extorted from them. What encouragement is there for people to provide for their old age instead of relying on pensions and other forms of eleemosynary aid ? It is little wonder that the number of applicants for the old age pension is increasing and that its annual cost to the country is mounting steadily. I protest emphatically against this injustice to a most deserving class. People have been advised to inculcate into the minds of their families the principles of thrift and independence. The Commonwealth Bank employs a most talented woman, Miss Janet Mitchell, to lecture on thrift and encourage people to make provision for their old age. Its banking chambers are placarded "Buy a bond; look after your old age". When people act on that precept insteadof leaning on the Government, they are threatened with punitive taxation. The thrifty folk, who mostly comprise the middle classes, are the best assets to the nation. The wealthy people can look after their own interests; I hold no brief for them, although I believe they are entitled to justice, and 1 shall see that they get it. I have no concern for the waster who will not work, otherwise than finding him work to do, but I am concerned with the thrifty class who are being deliberately plundered by the present Government. This penal taxation is wrong. Over 80 per cent. of the workers are dependent upon private employers. How is employment to expand under constantly increasing taxation ? If by taxation the Government takes all profits out of industry, how are the unemployed to be absorbed? This taxation system is economically unsound and unstatesmanlike, and it arises from the failure of the Government to shoulder the responsibility of reducing the cost of administration. If it had had the courage to reduce expenditure to the point of hurting, the finances would be on a better basis. But with the exception of a few unprotected non-unionists in the Defence Department, nobody is seriously affected or worried by the Government's economy proposals. The truth is that no real economy is being practised. As recently as the 30th October the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun-</inline> reported that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> had said, in the course of a  radio-telephone conversation with the Acting Prime Minister, that the financial position in London was most difficult, and stressed the necessity for adhering to the programme laid down at the Melbourne conference. Because the Government has lacked the courage to do that, and because of its general incapacity to stand up to its job, the Commonwealth is in a serious financial depression, and there is little hope of financial and economic salvation from the present Administration. </para><para class="italic">

                    <para>.- One readily recognizes that the session that has been summoned on this occasion has to deal with about the most important economic problem Australia has yet faced; and I should have imagined that the Opposition, which has  a  history to answer for in connexion with this problem, would rather have faced the future than . have concentrated as it were the whole of its criticism upon what it alleges to he the sins of omission of the present Government during the last few months.I doubt if political audacity has even been greater than in the case of men, who, in a period of unprecedented difficulty and acute depression - when, as they say, the national income has fallen by about £150,000,000, when the prices of our principal staples have been almost cut in half and when the revenues of the Government have been depleted and inevitable expenditure increased - have the hardihood to expect an achievement which they themselves failed to accomplish during years of comparative industrial opulence. They failed to balance their budgets when prices were high, when the national income was buoyant, when the industries of . the country were comparatively prosperous and when the great majority of the people were employed. If they have a policy it surely involves putting the past behind them and, instead of holding, inquests on what has been done by others, to look to the future to discover, if possible, means by which the present position may be rectified. We could then engage as a sort of economic council in a dispassionate examination of the question. But the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> this afternoon, far from suggesting anything towards elucidating the problem or discovering solutions for it, was rather directed towards converting the community towards the political standard which he himself holds up. It was a speech delivered, as I beard it, with a view to vote-winning rather than to problem-solving. </para>

                <para>There can be no question that the whole of the utterances of representative leaders of the party opposite during the last, few weeks have been directed very largely towards endeavouring to throw the whole onus of the present situation on the present Government and its supporters, rather thanto presenting the facts in their entirety so. that the public might realize clearly that this problem is not innate to Australia, but is one that has arisen because, shall I say, of the financial bank ruptcy of civilization. There is not a country in the world irrespective of whether it can or cannot for the moment obtain budget equilibrium that is not faced with economic difficulties almost identical with those confronting the people of Australia. </para>

                <para>Mr.CURTIN.- It is. Whether a country has one policy or another, in the major sense the mass of its people are suffering because of the impossibility of marketing their products profitably. That applies to the United States of America equally with Great Britain, and to Germany equally with Belgium, and it applies to Australia. Our difficulties are due not to any physical impairment of our productive apparatus; they have not arisen because of any slothfulness on the part of our people. Indeed, almost parodoxically it may be said that at no other time in the history of this continent has the production of the soil been so bountiful as it is at the present moment; yet it remains a tragic commentary upon the situation that this abundance of nature which has been fructified by man's industry and genius has contributed nothing towards the solution of our difficulties. </para>

                <para>Mr.CURTIN.- That is a rather cheap kind of sneer, because if honorable  members challenge me on the point, I shall cite chapter and verse for the extraordinary increases in revenue which the previous Government extracted from the people of this country; I shall point out that, whether through indirect or direct taxation, our predecessors inherited a certain revenue, andall they did each year was to innate it and meet every problem either by not paying their way or by extracting more revenue from the people and industries of this continent. Honorable members need not challenge me on the point; the testimony is there for whoever likes to look at it. The last two budgets presented by the Nationalist Government showed deficits, so that the dishonour, which it is said by the Opposition to attach to this party because of its inability to meet the expenditure out of revenue, is one that attaches to themselves. If to fail to pay one's way each year is a cardinal offence against national honour the Labour party is not the initiators of this chapter of obloquy in the national history. It has been written by others in ci rcumstances less justifiable than the present. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition in his amendment suggests that all would be right if we were to adopt and carry into legislative, effect the programme considered by the Premiers in August, last at a conference at which. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Nieuieyer was present. I have some figures showing the result of the first four months, operations of the States and the Commonwealth, and the deficits of the Commonwealth and the States at the end of October. If it be a tribute to certain Premiers that they have agreed on paper to the establishment of budgetary equilibrium for their States we are entitled to ask how far the performance squares with the declaration of intent. At the end of the first four months' operations of the present financial year the States showed the following deficits: - Western Australia, £748,000; Victoria, £3,781,384; New South Wales, £5,306,280; Tasmania, £210,474; South Australia, £1,495,293; Queensland, £674,248. These States which, according to the Leader of the Opposition, definitely undertook to balance their budgets, these States, which are setting, so we are told, an example that the Federal Government should follow - which are doing the unpleasant things referred to by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archdale Parkhill)</inline> and whose conduct is said to be something that shines out as a bright light in contradistinction to the manner in which the Commonwealth Government is behaving - have as a result of the first four months' operations of the current financial year shown an aggregate deficit of £12.21 5,679. </para>

                <para>Mr.CURTIN.- It. is £5,900,000 on four months' operations. I ask honorable members to put the questionfairly to themselves - in what respect is the August agreement, which apparently has become a sort, of Ten Commandments for the Governments of Australia, being observed by the States? They are in the cleft, stick of financial, embarrassment just the same as the Commonwealth. They find that, however well intentioned may have been their promises, every step they take along the road of the Niemeyer plan makes it increasingly difficult for them to realize their financial expectations. Every reduction in wages, every rationing in employment, every diminution in the purchasing power of the community, reacts upon the taxpaying capacity, and as a result the revenues which have been forecastby the Treasurers, Commonwealth or State, have not been, and will not be, realized. All the talk that there was a sort of sacred covenant, entered into in Melbourne last August, and which this Government is the one ignoble administration in Australia to dishonor, falls absolutely to the ground in the face of the reality. The reality is that, whateverbe their, intentions or their readiness to subscribe to the conception of budgetary adjustment, the facts have not permitted the Treasurers' budgets to be adjusted. While it may be argued in a most sophistical way that the first two orthree months of the financial year are always the worst, that the income tax assessments have not been issued, and that there is a piling up of arrears from the previous year as a result of certain bookkeeping arrangements, the first three months of this year in comparison with  the first three months of any previous year prove to be by far the worst from the stand-point of budget equation.; and I say, quite frankly, that I see no expectation of the finances of- the Commonwealth or the States being adjusted on an even keel in the next twelve months. </para>
                <para>The problem that confronts us has taken years to grow. From 1914 Australian governmental finance has been complicated and embarrassed by. the tremendous piling up of interest charges. Of the taxation estimated to be collected this year by the Federal and State Governments, 62 per cent. will be paid in interest and sinking fund charges. Out of every pound which the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and the States collect in rates and fares, 7s. is paid in interest and sinking fund charges. While this terrific incursion into the ordinary revenue of the nation" is made for the purpose of satisfying the claims of bondholders, how can it be expected that any industrial enterprise will pay? And if industrial enterprises cannot pay - and what is true of the railways is true of almost every other industrial and productive enterprise in the nation - how in the name of common sense is it to be expected that the nation, which is merely a reflection in a corporate sense of the individual life of the people, can have its finances adjusted upon an even keel? </para>
                <para>It is true that honorable members opposite have a policy. That policy nakedly and unashamedly stated by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> in so far as it affects the public servants, is that he would reduce their salaries by a graduated cut. He would reduce every one. That remedy, although not likely to contribute towards the rejuvenation of Australia's economic life, might certainly contribute towards a bookkeeping adjustment of national finances, and might permit of 70 per cent. instead of a 62 per cent. share to bond-holders. I do not say that the great financial interests of Australia would not cheerfully endorse and even welcome such a policy. But I put this question to this House and to the country : Are all the problems of nations to be solved by the operation of a policy of depressing . the wages of those who are the poorest of this and every other community. </para>
                <para>We were told in the course of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> that there are those in this community who, apparently, meeting in a corner of this building, are recreant, not only to their trusteeship as representatives of the people, but also to any conception of national decency, that they would repudiate the obligations of this country in a variety of ways, and that because of their overt acts which, apparently, commenced only this week, it has become impossible to rectify Australia's overseas financial position. The truth of this matter goes back far beyond any particular meeting held in Canberra this week. The attack upon Australian securities commenced a year ago. The onslaught upon the credit of this country did not originate with any decisions that may or may not have been made in the Labour caucus, and, after all, international finance is concerned, not with opinions, but with facts. With respect to opinions, I suppose that few persons have any great admiration for the political stability of the South American republics. Their policies apparently would not be endorsed by the right-thinking, and, shall we say, influential, statesmen of Europe, but that does not prevent South America from being a fruitful field of investment for international capital. It does not prevent the Argentine railways from being built out of funds secured in Europe and for the most part floated on the London stock market. Whatever may be the opinions of Englishmen regarding the politics of the South American Republics, the fact remains that so long as those countries are a profitable field of investment, money is poured into them from all over the world. </para>

                        <para>- There are conservative governments everywhere. One of the most conservative is the present Federal Government. In any event the problems of this country are definitely related to the world problem, which, in essence, is that productive power on the part of the peoples of the world has greatly outstripped the means of exchange; in other words, the facilities available for the exchange of goods and services are inadequate when measured by the tremendous mass of goods and services that have to be exchanged. I need not cite evidence in support of that contention. I simply remind this House that in 1914 when the great war commenced there was withdrawn from the fields of production in Great Britain and other countries not thousands but millions of men who had previously been engaged in the performance of the industrial services of civilization. These men went forth to war. They were engaged in 101 forms of activity, which, from the standpoint of production, could be said to be entirely useless. These men were consumers instead of producers of goods. They left behind them, as it were, a residuum of labourers who, by reason of the stimulus given to production by the necessities of war, were able so to augment the productive efficiency of mankind . as to make food, clothing and other commodities available to civilization, if not upon the same standard as before the war, at least upon a living standard. In addition all the requirements of war were provided by this diminished army of labourers. When the war ended and this enormous army of men attempted to - return to the fields and to the workshops, they found that they had to a large extent been supplanted by junior labour and young women who had been trained in industrial vocations. Their services were not required and there was no place for them as labourers. Then the doctrine was sounded, and its echoes reverberated through this chamber this afternoon that the remedy for unemployment was that everybody should take less, that we should take a retrograde step and bring about a lower standard by asking the workers to work longer hours for less pay. </para>

Furthermore, were it not for the fact that these loans were regularly available to meet Australia's overseas obligations, this financial crisis which now faces Australia would have developed years before. It has emerged for three reasons. It is not unassociated with the political changes that have taken place in Australia.

                        <para>- Even to keep silent for ten minutes is apparently too great a task for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This policy, as I understand it.. involves, first, a deflation of all incomes in Australia, except those derived from investments in government stocks. Secondly, it means that because of the fall in prices, and the consequential fall in the national revenue, an increasing proportion of the national revenue must be diverted towards meeting the charges incidental to the national debt. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, decidedly. We should honour every obligation. We should honour our obligation to every man and woman in this country, who by virtue of his or her citizenship is entitled to a reasonable subsistence. My reply to the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> is that if necessity compels a contraction of the public revenues of this country; if national conditions make it impossible to satisfy all the claims that can properly be lodged against the nation, should those of bondholders be treated on a different basis from those of invalid, old-age, and soldier pensioners, and men and women entitled to just wages? Do I understand the honorable member to say that it is right to reduce by statute the claims  of  invalid, old-age, and soldier's pensions and those who have the right to wages? </para>

                        <para>- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> this afternoon endeavoured to show that, but for the policy of this party, the magic wand of Nationalism would be waved in the city of London, and that our overseas obligations would be funded. He said, in effect, that so long as there are Labour Governments in Australia, Australian securities in London will be imperilled and subject to attack, and that the only way to keep them at par on the London market is to return him.and his colleagues to the ministerial benches. One would imagine that the political opinions of the Australian people are important factors in determining the flow of capital either to or from Australia. I venture to assert that there are two reasons why Australian securities have been attacked overseas. The first is that a diagnosis of the last seven years of Australian economic history must suggest to the intelligent observer that the country was undeniably drifting in respect to its economic position. In support of that contention I shall cite a few facts. First, let us bear in mind that for' about six years wo had an excess of imports over exports to the extent of over £70,000,000.  Secondly, all  our Governments, State and  Federal,  were showing deficits, and in addition we were living upon funds borrowed overseas amounting annually to £30,000,000. Then, too, it was patent to any one who analysed our economic life that our system of transportation, in which was invested a large portion of the loans floated by the States, was becoming unprofitable. Therefore, any keen penetration from outside into the fabric of Australian economic life would at once have shown that our position was gradually reaching a state of crisis. Let me summarize, first from the stand-point of what is termed budget equilibrium. During the time that honorable members opposite were in charge of the affairs of Australia, our exports wore inferior to our imports to the extent of £70,000,000, and in addition, we borrowed annually for five years £30,000,000, or in the aggregate, £150,000,000. The fiscal budgeting of this nation, therefore, disclosed a deficiency of £220.000,000. </para>

                        <para>- That is beside the point. The honorable gentleman says that the attack upon Australian securities is due to the political views of the party that now holds the reins of office.I say that it is the natural outcome of the fiscal history of this Commonwealth during- the years- that honorable gentlemen opposite were in power. It is due to facts, not to opinions. It is true that Australia's credit was being attacked. But the cause of that attack was that our credit was being impaired, both internally and externally;, externally because we were gradually getting further into debt to the rest of the world, and internally because of the influence of new forms of transportation and the enormous overhead cost of.our railways. Our railways were not paying, and they had invested in them a large part of the loans that were floated by the States. In addition, the States were showing, deficits. With the exception- of one government, all the States, as well as the federation, showed deficits in 1928 and 1929. Is; it any marvel that, on the facts of the situation, the London money market came to the conclusion that Australian stocks were not' so reliable an investment as they had been in years gone by, and that the credit of Australia was not so good? If honorable members opposite wish to . be furnished with details,. I can give them chapter and verse. </para>

                <para>I am amazed at the logical professes of a mind which imagines that the world comes to aconelusion with respect to the financial condition, of agreat country as the result of opinions expressed at one or two meetings within the space of a fortnight. The financial difficulties of this nation, the loss of confidence overseas, and the accentuation of the problem of public finance in Australia, are inseparably associated with what happened during the period that the Government which honorable members opposite supported was in power, and are the natural and logical outcome of the improvident policy which their Treasurer carried into effect. Argue as they will, those are the facts of the situation. I appeal to the testimony of reality. I ask, is it true that in a period of six years Australia went behind fiscally to the tune of £70,000,000? Is it true that it borrowed, £30,000,000 a. year?' </para>

The problems with which Australia is. faced- todaytheunemployment of 200,000 men, hightaxation, the attack upon Australian: securities, and the fall in our credit level - are how attributed to the vacillation of the Ministers who- at present sit upon the treasury bench; but last year and the year before they were, not attributed" to the Ministers who then held office.. According to the previous Government, the States were then- responsible ; but according to honorable members, opposite, the States are not responsible to-day. That kind of clap-trap would be an insult even to the members of the Australian Women's National League. </para>

                <para>I have here an interesting editorial note iu <inline font-style="italic">The FinancialReview of Reviews and. Investment Survey,</inline> of September, 1930. It deals with certain stocks, which I assume include Australian stocks. The opinion of the editor; is given in- the following terms :  -   . . For many months past they have found it profitable to " bear " almostevery popular security. It is not generally realized what an effect these " bear raids " have upon the market. Theoretically, if, a stock is sound,  a  few points depreciation ought to bring investors into the market,, but the contrary isactually the case.. Holders are frightened when they sec prices falling, and sell, so that when there has been a long period of falling markets the " bear, raids " have- a sort of snowball effect. The "bears?' select certain popular stocks to attack: they sell short of a large quantity, the price is at once marked down, and,seeing this, the- investing public sell also, thusenabl- ing the "'bears "' to cover their bargains  ata profit.  And so it goes on. </para>
                <para class="block">I venture the opinion that the now speculative aspects which have' marked the exchanges of London and' New.Yorkhave had a. considerable influence in this onslaught upon the- value of Australian securities. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, I wish to say- a word or two inregard to the futureFirst, I would ask. this Parliament to consider the undesir ability of allowing' the banks: to peg. therate- of exchange at whatever figure- they care to choose.. To begin with,, the- pegging, of exchange by banks in Australia has not been, done in the intends of Australia-, But has. been resorted to simply as a measure of protection, by each of the banks in order to prevent competition in regaird to their transactions,, whether' they be telegraphic or- other' transactions-., ' To avertcompetition, among themselves*, and to: make more emphatic the tremendous power which they have exercised upon the life of this continent, they have arbitrarily pegged the rate of exchange at a figure that does not square with the ordinary operations of supply and demand. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has had nothing whatever to do with it. As a result of legislation passed by the previous Government, this Government has no power over the monetary policy of Australia, and cannot interfere with its banking policy. I believe that, instead of contemplating a budget for one year, it is imperative that the Parliaments of the States and of the Commonwealth should contemplate . a much longer period, in order to adjust the finances of the nation in the executive sense. An attempt ought to be made to survey the position over a period of three, if not of five years. I remind honorable members that the present situation in Australia has been germinating for more than a decade, and that it has emerged very largely as the result of what has taken place in connexion with the charges that have been made; for the flotation of loans and the enormous demand upon our revenues for the purpose of paying interest. Therefore, it cannot be definitely coped with or checked in one year. Any attempt to cope with it in that period would be bound to fail, irrespective of the complexion of the government in power. Honorable members opposite, ifthey were to attain to office, would not be able to balance the budget this year. The Government that they supported has the ignoble record of deficits -iii years of prosperity. How in the name of goodness could they accomplish in this year of depression what they failed to accomplish in years of prosperity ? </para>

I further remind this Parliament that one of the contributing factors in the economic embarrassment of the Commonwealth has been the deli-' berate contraction of the note issue by the Commonwealth Bank Board. Further, the . apparently concerted . endeavouron the part of the financial institutions and the large investing industrial elements to deflate wages and commodity prices in Australia has caused prices to fall so rapidly that it has been impassible for industries to check the tremendous . downward momentum. We cannot hope in a few months, or even a couple of years, to retrieve completely the position. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archdale Parkhill)</inline> will restrain himself and not pose in this House as the sole fountain of wisdom, I shall endeavour to reply to the honorable member for Fawkner. Apparently the honorable member for Warringahdoes not understand the exact nature of the problems confronting this country. I admit the fallibility of the human mind. I regret my own personal limitations, and I grieve that . I am unable to resolve the financial . difficulties confronting my country. In reply to the honorable member for Fawkner, I may say that for many years the amount of Commonwealth notes customarily in circulation was £4 10s. in the hands of the public and £10 in the custody of the banks. An examination of the present position shows that the notes actually issued have been reduced in the last five years. When I spoke of the restoration of the note issue to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> requirements of the people, I had in mind the fact that if the issue were of normal dimensions it would be possible for insurance companies and trading banks to give much needed assistance . and relief to many clients who, although in possession of unquestioned security, are, at the moment, unable to obtain finance to carry on their undertakings. I believe that large numbers of farmers and graziers are to-day in trouble owing to the difficulty of obtaining that accommodation which is vital to the successful harvesting of their grain, or the realization of their wool clips. I am convinced that if these people could get the requisite accommodation from the banks, they would be able to carry on successfully. Believing this course to be essential in order that the industries of the nation may be carried on, I submit that the policy I have outlined should receive earnest consideration at the hands of honorable members. I conclude with this observation: If, next week or next month, Australia became involved in a great war, those controlling our various banks and financial institutions would not talk about Australia's impaired credit, which, we are given to understand, makes it now -so difficult to finance the wool clip and grain crops, but, without any apparent difficulty they would be able to finance the frightful tragedy of an international war with all that celerity which, in the history of a nation, marks the black magic of money power policy. </para>

                <para>Mr.R.  GREEN  (Richmond)  [9.5].-  I listened with a great deal of interest to the remarks of the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> and I must confess that it was only towards the end of his speech that I received any enlightment about his proposals. For the most part the honorable member indulged in generalities. Ho avoided details, because obviously he had no solution to offer for our financial difficulties other than the repudiation of Australia's national obligations. On that particular aspect of the matter the honorable member cleverly skated over thin and dangerous ice. He talked about the claims of Australian bondholders, and the only inference to be drawn from his remarks was that a solemn compact entered into by the Commonwealth Government should be repudiated if to honour it should be inconvenient. I was especially careful to note the honorable member's statement upon this particular point. He declared that the claims of the bondholders were not as paramount as the claims of those engaged in industry. Analysed, that statement means that, in the honorable member's view at all events, the interests of bondholders are as nothing compared with the claim of the wage-earners. </para>

                    <para>- The Commonwealth Government voluntarily offered certain security in return for subscriptions to its various loan issues. That security is the honour and integrity of the Australian people. We cannot now deliberately violate a contract of that nature. The honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> this afternoon quoted certain extracts from the prospectuses of two loans issued in London, and one issued in Australia as evidence of the nature of this financial contract. If now we dishonour our obligations, the Westminister Bank, which is a large creditor of the Commonwealth, could not step in and. take charge of our railways or our customs administration. As a sovereign people we should not tolerate any such action. No one can deny that the Commonwealth Government has made binding contracts with its bondholders, and as honorable people we must stand up to them. </para>

                        <para>- Towards the end of his speech the honorable member for Fremantle stated that in the last seven years the Commonwealth debt had been increased by £220,000,000. He would have the people believe that this was the  result of the financial policy of the Bruce Page administration. I remind the honorable gentleman that of the sum mentioned, £207,000,000 represented debts incurred by the Commonwealth on behalf of the States, and that the increase in the Common wealth public debt during the term mentioned was slightly under  £13,000,000.  Many of the State Governments, on whose behalf the Commonwealth raised £207,000,000, were of the same political complexion as the honorable member himself, so his reference to the " ignoble record " of the preceding Nationalist governments is beside the point. Already, in four months of the present financial year the Govern.ment, of which bo is a supporter, has been responsible for a deficit greater than the accumulated deficits of the various Nationalist governments during the preceding seven years. </para>

The Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> admitted the other day that if trade conditions improved, the deficit this year might be anything from £S,000,000 to £10,000,000, but that if trade did not revive, it might be £15,000,000. As to the deficits disclosed in the administration of the various States, I need only remind honorable members that enormous losses on the working of State railways are responsible for their present difficulties, and, to some extent, at all events, Commonwealth legislation is responsible. We have in Australia developed the unfortunate practice of governing, not by Parliament, but by cabinet. Cabinet performs executive acts, the result of which is to impose taxation on the people. We are familiar with the imposition of tariff duties by moa us of schedules prepared and tabled by the Government. Customs duties are pimply a form of taxation. Since the present Government has been in office it lias introduced many tariff schedules, not one item of which has yet been discussed by Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- One schedule, introduced by the Acting Prime Minister, had to he altered next day, and was altered again a few days later. These frequent alterations threw the business community into such a state of confusion that it did not know what to do. That is .why business men are going bankrupt. Many of the troubles confronting commercial men at the present time may be traced to the ineptitude of the Cabinet. This practice of imposing tariff duties without consulting Parliament cuts across' a long accepted principle of British political justice, which lays it down that there shall be no taxation without representation. The elected representatives of the people in this House have had no voice whatsoever in the imposition of these amended duties. Recently, this pernicious practice was carried a step further. While Parliament was not sitting, the Cabinet, by an executive act, actually put into the hands of a private company, power to impose taxation on the Australian people. This was done by imposing an embargo upon the importation of galvanized iron, leaving the firm of John Lysaght Limited, the sole manufacturers of such iron in Australia, a free hand to exploit the Australian consumers as it thinks fit. The guarantees given by the representatives of that company are not worth a twopenny dump. 1 am thankful that the bill designed to give effect to this arrangement has yet to pass another place. There, I trust, it will be dealt with as it deserves. I am sure that the people of Australia are opposed to the action of the Government in thus attempting to take the power to impose taxation out of the hands of Parliament. </para>

                <para>In my opinion much more effective work would be done if we could meet here as a united Parliament to discuss the measures necessary to rehabilitate the finances of the country. Unfortunately, under the system of party politics, there are some members of this House who are prepared to allow the support of their party to get the better of their duty to the country. It is also true that established parliamentary procedure stands in the way of a free discussion of the Estimates on a non-party basis. During a national emergency such as this, Parliament should be free to consider the budget on its merits, and to make what alterations it thinks fit. Under the present system, however, the Estimates are prepared by cabinet, . and introduced to the House as . a printed document which cannot be varied by Parliament. A. member may register disapproval only by moving that areduction . of £1 be made in a vote . of perhaps £10,000,000, and if that motion be . agreed to it is regarded as a vote of no confidence in the Government. The result is that Cabinet 'brings forward the Estimates, and Parliament has to swallow them willy-nilly. I suggest that the revised Estimates should be brought before the House for discussion; that they should be considered by honorable members on . their merits, and that desirable alterations should be accepted by -the Government. </para>
                <para>According to the financial statement before us, it is proposed that certain savings shall be effected. Among the expenditure proposals on page 8 of the Acting Treasurer's statement are savings on estimates amounting to £1,230,000, of which £500,000 is to be saved in the Postal Department. -Other economics amount to £375,000 to be saved on miscellaneous works, services, &amp;c. The House has been given no indication as to how 'these savings are to be effected. The first we learn of them is when the statement is laid before us, and now no variation can be made. It is quite likely that after the matter has been -discussed a majority -of honorable members might be in favour of further reductions. Nothing can be done in that way, however. Cabinet has made up its mind. If the Government will agree to listen to suggestions for economy from Parliament, I for one undertake to seek no party advantage from it, nor will I join in any movement that may be construed as a motion of censure. My sole object is to do my best as an elected representative to restore Australia to the position she should . never 'have lost, </para>

                <para>The Government deny having repudiated' the nation's obligations. I shall give a few instances of repudiation^ over which honorable members opposite may ponder at leisure. Recently, a conference was held- in Sydney. Et consisted of  M'r. Graves, President,  of the New South. "Wales Branch of the- Australian Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bird,</inline> Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Said'y,</inline> Vice  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin-,</inline> Organizing Secretary, representing the inner group of that organization. The Sydney Trades and Labour Council was represented by Messrs. Garden, Hooke, King, and "Voigt. They, of' course, are outside the Labour movement !' S'till1, they conferred' with the other gentlemen, and certain resolutions were carried. One was that our war debts should be cancelled, and another that a five year moratorium should bc declared with respect to interest payable on oversea Government roans*. To-night the honorable member for- Fremantle quoted1 extracts, divorced from their, context, in an endeavour to&gt; prove that certain, eminent people were- in f favour  of repudiation,, and: specifically in favour of the cancellation of our waa? debts. He endeavoured, to make- them  appear to  say things that he: himself was not  prepared to  say, or- was ashamed to say:. Recently the Acting  Prime  Minister found it necessary to explain by whom, our war debts were chiefly contributed. Three-quarter,s of them- were subscribed in. Australia. 1 believe that about £81&gt;,0.Q0,000- is owing overseas;, and more, than three times that amount' in Australia, the principal subscribers being our savings banks, insurance companies and' friendly societies. About £92,000,000 was subscribed by our  sayings  banks, whose funds represent the savings of thrifty people; as a rule those representing; the least financial section of the community: If we cancelled  our  war debts we should repudiate that£92,000,000, part of the accumulated savings of some 4,000^00 thrifty people.. The funds of life insurance companies also represent the  savings  of the- thrifty.. Many, such people take out industrial policies and pay 6d. or ls. a week on the lives of their- children in order to have something set aside for- a rainy day. Possibly the Acting Prime Minister will tell me off-hand how much 0111 life insurance companies contributed te our. war debts. I think he said, that the amount was £65,000,000.  Cancellat.ion  of our war debts would, bring  privation  to many, particularly in cases where the bread- winner died, and1 the insurance  upon  which his. wife and-  kiddies  depended was dissipated, by the repudiation, policy of the Government. Yet the Labour party says, " Cancel!  our  waa1 debts !' " Another source of contribution- to those debts are' the funds- of friendly societies - I think to the extent of  £13,000,000.  Such bodies- cater- not for the well-to-do in the community, but foc thrifty workers! who desire to obtain  certain social  service-.. It is- upon such folk that  repudiation  would react.. And. the Labour party .says, " Cancel, our war debts " ! Many people give- a  cursory glance  at the newspapers  and  think;, "-We- have no particular interest in wa-r- loans.. We have put nothing into- them ". But indirectly they are interested!;  through  the  savings  banks, life insurance- companies,, and! friendly socle, ties. </para>
                <para>I shall instance yet another form of repudiation on the- part of honorable  members.  opposite! The honorable memben foc Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons-)'</inline> promised the. farmers that if he and- his. colleague!: were elected, primary producers would be paid 6s. or 6s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat, within twelve months. What has he done about it? Why, repudiated his promise! When the Wheat Marketing Bill, which proposed a guarantee to primary producers of 4s. a bushel for their wheat, was brought down, the honorable member did not even try to split the difference and have the guarantee fixed at f&gt;s. a bushel. He remained dumb, and repudiated his promise, and that has been the attitude of the Labour party throughout the piece. It has made promise after promise, knowing definitely that it could not fulfil them. When the time came it repudiated its promises. On the 7th May last the Prime Minister promised that returned soldiers would have, not only preference of employment, but preference when it came to dismissals. On the 5th November the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> asked the Postmaster-General how many employees had been dismissed from the Postmaster-General's Department. It was then disclosed that the number was 2,292. Of that number 1,429 were returned soldiers, 1,144 of whom had been in the department for two years and over. The definite promise made by the Prime Minister was repudiated. A similar state of affairs applies to the Department of Public Works. Since the 30th June last, 775 employees have been dismissed from that department, 332 of whom were returned men. temporary employees. That is the way in which the Government keeps its promises. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> I have to direct attention to still another act of repudiation. I refer to the repudiation of the decisions of the Premiers' Conference held in Melbourne last August, and to which the Prime Minister was a party. The resolution carried at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party a few days ago showed that a majority of the party is in favour of repudiating the definite promises made by the Prime Minister. Where is this repudiation to end ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to discuss the proposal of the Government to increase the taxation of income from property except to say that it is a direct blow at the thrifty classes in the community who try to make provision for their old age. There are many people in our midst who have saved money by taking out life insurance policies, or who have received small legacies, the proceeds of which they have invested in property in the belief that the return would keep them in their old age. But this Government proposes that such people who have an income of £200 a year from these sources shall be taxed to the extent of over £20  a year. In other words these people, who are receiving less than the basic wage, will be viciously taxed. 1 understand that a person with an income of £300 a year from property will have to pay more than £50 a year taxation. Such persons will, therefore, pay more income taxation than persons in receipt of £1,000 a year from personal exertion, although their income may be the fruits of the savings of a lifetime. </para>

                <para>The iniquitous nature of this proposed taxation should be brought under the notice of the general community. The Government is seeking to tax the most deserving class in the community, namely, the thrifty middle class - people who are neither, actually poor nor actually welltodo, but who possess only a hare competence with which to maintain themselves. Income from superannuation funds is not regarded as income from personal exertion, so that persons who live on income from superannuation will also bc very heavily taxed. It appears to me that the Government is so much against reducing its general expenditure that it is prepared to tax any one and every one without regard for justice. </para>
                <para>Reference was made this afternoon, to the proposed tax on certain civil servants. It is deplorable that only 1 per cent, of the Civil Service should be called upon to pay this special taxation. Only 441 officers out of more than 44,000 will be taxed. </para>
                <para>I could go on with this sordid story for a long while, but I have said enough to show how inept the present Government is to deal with the existing financial position. I suggest once again that, seeing that the Government is not prepared to resign and let' <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> new Government attempt to straighten out the position, it  should  make it possible for the collective brains of this Parliament to be used to formulate ways and means of  correcting the financial position, which certainly should not be allowed to drift as it is drifting at present. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to inform honorable members that the Commonwealth Government is issuing immediately a conversion and redemption loan. The main purpose of this loan is to provide for the conversion of the 6 per cent. Commonwealth loan which falls due on 15th December. At the same time, cash subscriptions are being invited to pay off those holders in the maturing loan who are unable to convert, and also to provide for shortages that have occurred in the conversion of certain State securities. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The loan has been sanctioned by the Australian Loan Council, and the terms which have been approved are in accordance with recommendations that have been made by the Commonwealth Bank. Investors are being given the option of three currencies, namely: - A two years' currency carrying interest at 6 per cent, per annum, a ten years currency at 5f per cent., and a twenty years' currency at <inline font-style="italic">ti</inline> per cent. These terms will apply both to conversions and cash subscriptions, and have been designed to meet the convenience of all investors. </para>
                <para>As I have already stated, the major portion of this operation deals with the Commonwealth loan repayable on 15th December. Originally the December loan totalled £60,000,000, but the conversion, operation of March last and redemptions from sinking fund and other moneys have reduced the outstanding indebtedness to approximately £20,000,000. As £2,000,000 of sinking fund moneys will be available to pay off holders who are not in a position to convert, the amount to be covered on the 15th December is £18,000,000. In addition, it is necessary to provide for a shortage of £600,000 on a Northern Territory loan which recently matured, and for £9,400,000 of State securities maturing in the near future. </para>
                <para>In present circumstances, when there is much unemployment and business conditions are difficult, higher rates of interest than those offered would not be fair to the taxpayer or helpful to the revival of trade and employment. In fixing the terms, the Loan Council has tried to hold the scales evenly. </para>

                    <para>'.r- I congratulate the Government and the Acting Treasurer on having at last announced, the terms of this conversionloan; but I regret that, such a short time is being given for the conversionExperience has shown- that much more than the four  or  five weeks that still remain before the 15th December is necessary to, make a loan, of this magnitude successful.. However, the terms that are being offered should appeal to investors throughout the Commonwealth, particularly the option to accept a term oro twenty years, at 5£ per cent. The present position, of Australian Government stocks in. Australia, London and New York, is no- proper indication of the&gt; soundness, of the' Commonwealth. It is&lt; absurd" that oust position in.  the  loan market should, be so- much worse- than that of New Zealand. Our bad .position, is largely, due to so many irresponsible persons having made statements which have injured Australia's credit.. There- have been, fo« instance^ suggestions: of repudiation which, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin')has</inline> had  to  deny on many occasions. Those suggestions have- come only from organizations associated with the Labourparty. No  such  suggestion should ever have been made in connexion with any Australian loan. I. am also glad to seethat the suggestion recently- made, that contributions towards this loan should be compulsory, has- been abandoned. The proposal  to  inflate  the  currency, which is now being raised', will, I hope, receivea' summary dismissal at the hands of the Government. I suggest' that the best way to make this loan- a. success is" for theleaders of the Labour party to put it beyond' question that they will not tolerate- any suggestion which tends todepreciate  Australia's  credit; that they will make if clear that no one- of any significance or position in Australia with do- anything, either directly or indirectly., to. evade the. complete fulfilment of Australia! obligations.. </para>
