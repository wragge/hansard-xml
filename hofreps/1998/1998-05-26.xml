It is conscientiously held. It does not dispute the views that are held to the contrary by many other Australians.

To achieve Spanish citizenship and therefore, of course, to be able to live there indefinitely, you have to remain, I am advised by my department, in Spain for 10 years. So the original passport, which would have expired in 1999, was not adequate to 
 meet the time span, the point being that, having been issued with a new passport, it was theoretically possible that Mr Skase could have remained in Spain on that passport for long enough to qualify for Spanish citizenship.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There may have been a number of other reasons why that passport was replaced, but what is interesting and, I know, will interest the House is the material relevant to the issuing of that passport in July 1993.

That alert said that, if the embassy in Madrid or indeed any other embassy around the world were to have an application for a passport from Mr Skase, that application should be referred to Canberra, where it would be given consideration.

The government knows that, in these uncertain times, the greatest security for young people comes from having a quality education. That is why the government has been at particular pains to ensure that literacy standards in this country are raised and that it has achieved Australia's first national literacy standard and a national literacy plan.</para></talk.start><para>That is why we pursued school based apprenticeships because the previous government neglected the 70 per cent of young people who were not going straight from school to university. That is why we have encouraged schools to consider acting as employment agencies for their school leavers—a hugely popular policy which now has been adopted by over half the high schools in Australia. Of course, this government strongly supports school choice for low income families.</para><para>It is quite clear at the present time that all these policies are under threat. They are under threat from the Labor Party. The Labor Party is threatening these policies and these achievements because it wants to put education policy in this country in the hands of the teacher unions. The Leader of the Opposition over the weekend went along to the Australian Education Union conference in Canberra and outlined the Labor Party's policies. But the main policy was this: he was going to set 
 up a review of the entire Australian education system. His policy for education is a committee. It is a review. When will this review be? It will be after the election. So we will not hear any more detail about the Labor Party's education policies.</para><para>Why was this so warmly applauded by the members of the Australian Education Union at the weekend conference? It was because they know who is going to be on this committee. They know who is going to be setting the policy directions for the Labor Party when it decides to formulate its education policy.</para><para>Even the media could see that this was the platform for an ideologically driven sectional policy by the Labor Party. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> was not fooled by the speech. In an editorial this morning headed `No policy', it concluded by saying:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">. . . it is clear that what is driving Labor's policy is a sensitivity to the demands of the various teachers' federations around Australia. What these federations want is not necessarily what education funding in Australia really requires. Mr Beazley has given his game away, in fact, with the promise of a "ground-up review of the entire Australian education system". This review creates a subsidised vehicle for the federations to drive their agendas forward.</inline></para><para>What are these agendas? We know that the agendas of the Australian Education Union, the agendas of the Labor Party, are to oppose higher literacy standards. They are to oppose proper reporting to parents. They are to oppose helping school leavers get jobs. They oppose the right of parents to choose their own school. They oppose an apprenticeship system which is not dominated by the trade unions. The result is a set of policies which, once again, would viciously abandon the most disadvantaged students in Australia's schools. They would abandon the policies that this government has put in place to give educational equity to disadvantaged students and help low income parents choose the schools that they believe would be appropriate for their young people.</para><para>Parents of Australia should not make a mistake. The education policies that are driving quality in this country are at risk from the policies of the Australian Labor Party because it is a relentlessly sectional party. All 
 it has to say is what the trade unions behind it tell it to say, whether it is to undermine Australian trade, whether it is to undermine literacy standards, whether it is to do away with school choice. There is nothing offered by the party and the weak Leader of the Opposition than the set of policies which are dictated to him by the trade unions. The only security parents in this country have that their children will receive a decent education with high literacy standards, proper reporting and school choice is the policies of this government.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation</title><page.no>3683</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3683</page.no><name role="metadata">Macklin, Jenny, MP</name><name role="display">Ms MACKLIN</name><name.id>PG6</name.id><electorate>Jagajaga</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Prime Minister.

 this about Labor's trade efforts: `Everyone is down there in Foreign Affairs and Trade doing the multilaterals; no-one is doing anything about the bilaterals.'

Australia at this time is a fiscal economic oasis in this part of the world. We have a budget surplus; you provided a $10½ billion budget deficit. We have a budget surplus that is helping our exporters. We have a budget surplus which is helping to confer safety, security and stability, as the Prime Minister has pointed out.</para><para>We are a fiscal economic oasis, but we must safeguard our trading position. It is true that there is no such thing as an international level playing field, and it is also true that, arising out of some of the more recent developments in Asia, there are efforts by nations to cheat with regard to their trade circumstance, legally or otherwise. I highlight that, and I will continue to highlight that.</para><para>I want to make the point, very bluntly, Mr Speaker, that the playing field is likely to become more lopsided, but we will do all we can to sensibly safeguard the situation of our exporters. So I say again that the government is proud to have created a budget surplus which makes this economy a fiscal economic oasis. We have turned around your $10½ billion deficit. You would have been a disaster for our exporters.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>One Nation Party</title><page.no>3693</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3693</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Which are increasing at a much more rapid rate than—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Leader of the Opposition will address his question.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that you are going to engage in a bit of base broadening. Base broadening is a euphemism for saying that you are going to increase the level of indirect taxation. You cannot broaden the base without collecting more tax, and that is exactly what you have suggested.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mr Speaker, the member for Menzies asks me about the disincentive for work effects of the existing taxation system. I remind the member for Menzies that in 1954 the average wage earner paid 17½ per cent tax on additional earnings. By 1998-99, a taxpayer on average earnings will move from the 34 per cent to the 43 per cent tax bracket. What that means is that, for every extra dollar you earn at the average wage level, you will pay 43c of that extra dollar in taxation. That is the system the Australian Labor Party wants to maintain.</para><para>That means that if an Australian worker earns more than $728 a week—and there are many Australian workers who earn that—they will pay tax at a marginal rate of 43 per cent. And, what is more, if you happen to earn $950 a week, you will pay marginal rates of tax at the top rate of tax.</para><para>The way the present system is going, by the year 2000 more than one-third of all Australian taxpayers will be earning more than $728 a week and will, therefore, without reform, face a marginal rate of tax which is greater than 40 per cent. So, by the year 2000, unless we reform the system, you will have one-third of all Australian taxpayers paying at the margin more than a 40 per cent rate of tax. That is yet another example of the impact on 
 incentives to work of the present Australian taxation system.</para><para>There is little doubt—as a result of the exchanges in this parliament of the last two days—that, just as the Labor Party is chained to the Maritime Union of Australia, it is also chained to the existing taxation system; just as the Australian Labor Party is chained to a system that produces a lopsided inequitable application of indirect tax, it is also chained to a system that brutally penalises Australian exporters. By contrast, the coalition is committed to reforming the Australian taxation system, to providing Australia with a system that supports Australian exporters, providing the Australian worker with a system that provides an incentive to work and, above all, provides to all Australians a system that is based on equity and fairness which will help contribute to the security, the stability and the safety of the Australian economy.</para><para>Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>3694</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>3694</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Please proceed.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>—I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>  editorial which, coincidentally, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) referred to.

 1967 Commonwealth referendum on Aborigines is on display outside the theatrette, where a number of ceremonies are taking place today.

It is clearly beyond the realms of any possibility that 21 bills can be debated in 22 or 23 hours, depending on what is residual from Thursday.</para></talk.start><para>I suggest to the minister here, as I have over the phone, that he needs to do a fair bit of culling.

Notwithstanding that in some instance these policies were well motivated they nevertheless had the effect of separating children from their parents and deprived them of their right to be reared within their own families, denying them a knowledge of their culture and traditions.</para><para>For that, we Members of this Parliament apologise and express the deepest regret for the pain and suffering caused to our fellow Aboriginal citizens. We apologise for the mistakes of the past, believing such an apology is the first step to effective reconciliation.</para><para>We also place on record our indebtedness to Sir Ronald Wilson and the members of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission whose painstaking work in their report brought this evidence before the Parliament and the Australian people, and in so doing provided this nation with the opportunity of rectifying past wrongs and building a positive relationship amongst all Australian citizens.</para><para>As the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) indicated, the government will move an amendment later to that motion, and the way in which it moves that amendment will supplant the motion. I think that is unfortunate. If it were to move as an amendment an addendum to the motion, even though it is full of self-congratulation, which we would not necessarily consider justified, we would accept it and we would have been able to have as an addendum to this motion a unanimous resolution from this House. It is a pity that that will not occur.</para><para>The motion that we have proposed has been carefully crafted. It has been carefully crafted to take into account the sorts of concerns that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has portrayed—concerns, of course, which in terms of their legal content and argument we do not accept and which are not consistent with advice that we had at the time when these were matters of consideration before us. 
 Certainly they are legal considerations which have not concerned the conservative premiers of most of the states of this country who have allowed motions of substance to go forward in relation to an apology and atonement for past wrongs done to the Aboriginal people which were exposed in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report.</para><para>Nevertheless, we removed from our motion anything that could be inferred as accepting a sense of legal responsibility that might in some way cause occasion for government lawyers to be concerned when these matters go to court. We also removed from our motion an obligation on all members of parliament, and the parliament as a whole, to offer an apology. We made a sincere effort to put a motion in the context that I would have thought was the minimum acceptable position for the government or anyone else. As I said, we are even prepared to accept the government's self-congratulatory amendment as an addendum to the proposition that we have put forward in our efforts to ensure that something comes out of this House that actually reflects the level of concern which I know members on both sides of this House feel. It would have been of a piece, I would say, Mr Speaker, with the excellent work that you yourself have done over the course of this week to ensure that appropriate opportunities are provided both to recognise the importance of reconciliation and to allow within the precincts of this parliament various forums in which Sorry Day can be appropriately reflected upon by both members of parliament and the public generally. It is a shame that your good effort and our, I might say, liberality have not been recognised in the final instance by the government in that our motion and the government's as an addendum will not now be the motions that are ultimately passed by this parliament.</para><para>Because there has been a degree of criticism of this and a degree of concern in the community, I note the anxiousness of those who have involved themselves in the Sorry Day process to put forward the basis on which they are approaching this issue in the community as not being about individual guilt 
 or the apportionment of blame. Whatever might have been in that report, there is an anxiousness in their community to move the issue on from the point reached when the report was first put in place.</para><para>They are anxious to have us move forward together as a nation, starting from an honest and open appraisal of our history. Any honest and accurate history of relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians reveals events, attitudes, actions and policies that should be the cause of shared regret, shared sorrow and a common purpose in seeing that such things are not perpetuated or repeated. That same history, with its consistent thread of dispossession, destruction of indigenous culture and heritage, and the deliberate fracture of indigenous families, should inform and illuminate our understanding of present day despair and social dysfunction in our indigenous communities.</para><para>We cannot frame better policies if we fail to address the underlying fallacies and prejudices of past policies, whether or not anyone in this chamber—and virtually no-one is—is responsible for any of them. It is a cop-out to say that we cannot or should not evaluate our past policies or actions according to contemporary values and attitudes. The fact is that virtually every evil of public policy and administrative action directed towards indigenous Australians was the subject of informed and widespread contemporary criticism.</para><para>The Roth Royal Commission in Western Australia in 1905 provided one of the first systematic critiques and was followed by, among others, the Finnerty report of 1908 and the 1935 Moseley report. Those reports challenged the sorts of policies that produced ultimately the report which we refer to in the motion. The cautionary point for every legislature today is that every aspect of past policies for which we now express regret was framed in the context of contemporary debate that clearly showed that it was widely criticised at the time. Perhaps those legislators were content to march forward safely with majority public opinion rather than accept informed but less popular advice.</para><para>It is broadly accepted that the practice of removing indigenous children from their families continued until recent times—recent enough to encompass the early careers in public life of some who are still in this place. For many people this can only be dealt with with any degree of comfort by consigning mistakes to some ill-defined past.</para><para>One guarantee that mistakes will be repeated is to accept comforting myths. In 1949, we ratified UN conventions that dealt precisely with the forcible transfer of children from one group to another and dealt precisely with imposing measures intended to prevent births within a group. So these policies were continued for a lengthy period of time against a background of that convention which Australia was actively engaged in designing but which, nevertheless, governments of the day chose to ignore them. Public policy across the nation proceeded either in ignorance or defiance of that convention for the best part of a generation after its ratification.</para><para>It is equally dangerous policy for policy makers to comfort themselves with the myth that, even when a policy was not done for the good of separated children, the net effect was itself good. If we go beyond incidental anecdotes to scientific research on this question, the myth is very quickly disposed of. Recent studies show that a comparison of educational attainment, income level and employment status between indigenous Australians separated from their families and those who were not demonstrates consistently better outcomes for those who stayed with their families. This is scientific research, not anecdotal evidence.</para><para>Sadly, the statistics go in the other direction when we look at the negative outcomes. One of the findings of the inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody—a finding that was a key motivation for the stolen children report—was that those who had been separated from their families were overrepresented amongst deaths in custody. It is not surprising that individuals denied parental and family love and support, education in their first language and who were separated from their own culture would suffer social and psychological problems in later life. </para><para>The fact that many of them also suffered systematic physical, mental and sexual abuse was a dominant influence in their personal development, their ability to form relationships and their capacity to function in a society often hostile or indifferent to them. That is another point I would make about that excellent report that Sir Ronald Wilson brought down and which our motion acknowledges.</para><para>Unquestionably, in the Australian community there are many families who looked after Aboriginal children in an absolutely impeccable fashion. But that report also demonstrated that there are many instances, either in relation directly to families or more generally in relation to institutions, where what was experienced by Aboriginal children was criminal—criminal in the context of the times, not criminal by some form of hindsight. It has never been a matter supported by the law in this country that you should be permitted to rape or enslave people. That has never been sanctioned by Australian law at any point of time in our history, yet repeated instances of that are pointed to in that Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report.</para><para>It has never been a matter sanctioned by the law that a position of authority should be used to permit sexual or other forms of abuse—never has that been sanctioned by the law in this nation at any point of time in our history—yet the report is replete with instances of where that occurred. Of course, in that regard, as we have in melancholy fashion occasion to know, not only Aboriginal children but other children in the care of the state or other institutions have experienced a similar method of treatment. That is similarly illegal and their experiences are now the subject of inquiry, compensation and a whole range of other activities in terms of counselling to deal with the problems that they have confronted.</para><para>But the difference between the Aboriginal community and the other sections of the community that have experienced this is that, in the case of the Aboriginal community, there was a pattern of government decision which produced the set of circumstances in a way that uniquely applied to the race. So 
 what may have been in other areas of the community haphazard instances of abuse in the case of the Aboriginal community started out from a fundamental point that a policy needed to be pursued towards the Aboriginal community in a manner which would place them at a degree of risk.</para><para>On this, our first Sorry Day, those who cannot bring themselves to apologise for past wrongs should at least be able to express sorrow and empathy with such widely documented personal and family tragedy. I have given up trying to get an apology out of the Prime Minister on these matters. It is not possible to get it. In one sense, of course, if you do not actually mean an apology, it is not worth making it. At the end of the day, if you do not actually mean it—and that does not just apply to the Prime Minister, it applies to anyone else—it is not worth making.</para><para>We all have to live in this community. We all have to live with the consequences of actions. We all want a united community. At least there is room in the hearts of all of us to express sorrow to and empathise with those who have experienced the experiences of those Aboriginal families who were separated in the way in which that report deals with.</para><para>Policy makers who fear history, who are unable to honestly evaluate what went wrong and why it went wrong, I am afraid to say, are doomed to repeat it. One commentator said today that the expenditure measures the Prime Minister is about to make are better and more useful than any apology. I beg to differ.</para><para>While any clawback of the massive cuts the government has visited upon programs for indigenous Australians is welcome, it is a mistake to identify the problems of indigenous communities as being primarily or exclusively defined in terms of material poverty. Policies that fail to appreciate and address the personal and social dysfunction that has flowed from past and present injustices are policies that will not succeed. Just as policy makers of other generations were wrong in their paternalistic conviction that things needed to be done to or for indigenous Australians for their own good, so we will fail today if our policies are ill-informed and 
 enacted for rather than with indigenous Australians.</para><para>In our sorrow today for indigenous Australians, let us also mourn our common loss. Let us acknowledge that we are all the poorer for the generations of neglect and denial—the denial of opportunities that has robbed us of more Michael Dodsons, more Cathy Freemans, more Lois O'Donoghues, more Harold Blairs—and I could go on with a list of distinguished Australians.</para><para>Ignorance blinded us until only recently to the magnificence and richness of indigenous art, dance, song and stories, and prejudice determined that desecration and suppression rather than celebration were the hallmarks of many responses to so much that is rich, strong and spiritually uplifting. It is in the interests of reconciliation, a more mature national identity and sound public policies that members of this parliament open their eyes, their ears and their hearts. The motion that we have moved gives them an opportunity to open their eyes, their ears and their hearts.</para><para>I have, on several occasions—once in this place—apologised for the Labor Party's role in this sorry tale. I offer that apology again here today. But I acknowledge that it is now incumbent upon the Labor Party, at the state and federal levels, when we were responsible for those activities, to now also bear the responsibility to see that the consequences of them are cured. Important though these questions are, the curing of that goes well beyond the material dealing with the problem, the issues of expenditure. They go to the attitude that is created in the community. Are we going to be a community that exploits the opportunity for division, exploits the opportunity for difference, or are we going to be a community that uses the value of unity?</para><para>We may judge ourselves one way, but others will judge us a different way. We may judge past policies as something that we cannot come to grips with or not be obliged to come to grips with. Others will judge us differently. Others are capable of being inspired by us or making us a cause. If we do not comprehend in the process that the deculturalisation of a large number of members of our Aboriginal community and the 
 acceptance of that was what underpinned the wrong, if we do not understand that, we cannot really come to grips with why native title is so important to the Aboriginal community. </para><para>If we cannot understand that a sense of loss of culture, a sense of loss of personal sovereignty, fundamentally underlies much of the dysfunction that exists in large elements of the Aboriginal community, we cannot understand the necessity for policies which apply a cultural underpinning to the life that is led by the Aboriginal community. It will make us indifferent to the outcomes in so many critical areas of public policy and will doom us to repeat the errors of the past.</para><para>I do not want to canvass here the grounds that have underpinned the debate between us on both sides of the House of that Wik legislation. I do not want to canvass the reasons why there needs to be incorporated in any solution to it a right to negotiate. We are going to have plenty of opportunity to do that, unfortunately, in the course of the next few months. But my concern is that there is a thorough comprehension in the parliament and in the community of what underpins a person's sense of cultural confidence or what underpins, in particular, the Aboriginal community's sense of cultural confidence.</para><para>We will never be able to overcome that family dysfunction, we will never be able to overcome that Aboriginal dysfunction, unless there is recognised by the laws of this nation a complete and comprehensive appreciation of the culture and the nature of the indigenous people who are here before us and have so recently had the rights that are attached to that recognised by the highest court in our land.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CH4</name.id><name role="metadata">HOLDING</name><name role="display">Mr Holding</name></talker><para>—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>3705</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Warwick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WARWICK SMITH</name><name.id>GJ4</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "this House:</para><para>(1)	 recognises the need for the legislative and other powers of the Commonwealth to be used to address the profound economic and social disadvantage continuing to be suffered by

I might say that they were expressed eloquently.</para><para>I have to say that I find myself in an interesting position today. The usual representative for these matters is not here and this is the first occasion that I have had to speak on Aboriginal affairs in this place for nearly 10 years. I was at one stage the shadow minister for this area and listening to this debate made me cast my mind back. This is a day which does lead to personal reflection on these issues, so I will take this opportunity presented to me to express some personal views, which I think is appropriate in this particular debate.</para><para>When I was the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs in the late 1980s, we had a major debate in this country about the establishment of the ATSIC legislation. The debates then, as they are now, were partisan in part but there was, as I think there is now, a fundamental commitment to wanting to address in a very practical way the needs of indigenous Australians. That is the intent of the motion that we have moved today as a substitution. Our motion looks at the practical ways in which we can assist indigenous Australians.</para><para>The issues that I faced then were always a matter of budget, as they are now, but it was always an issue of how you got the money to 
 the people who needed it most. That indeed was a challenge for the last government, as it is for this government. Whilst I believe that, broadly, in this place and in the community we share very similar sentiments about the need to address disadvantages—which has been demonstrated by both sides of politics through many reports—there was a specific report that highlighted this issue and led to the motion by the Leader of the Opposition today. That was Sir Ronald Wilson's report, <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline>. I did not have the opportunity to bring my own copy of this report, which I had annotated, into the chamber today.</para><para>Being the minister in this government responsible for families and also children—and that covers all families and all children—when I received this report I was struck by its front page and the extract which had particular meaning and resonance to me. The very first quotation—and I am going to read it to the House, and it is lengthy—relates to an area which, by coincidence, is in my electorate. I know the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) will appreciate this point, as will the member for Braddon (Mr Miles). The area is Cape Barren Island.</para><para>The state of Tasmania has a significant history in relation to Aboriginal issues, and I think it would be universally agreed that most of it is an appalling one. The <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report starts with a quotation from a submission made by one of eight siblings who were removed from their families and fostered separately. It is a particularly poignant quotation and reads as follows:</para><para>So the next thing I remember was that they took us from there and we went to the hospital and I kept asking—because the children were screaming and the little brothers and sisters were just babies of course, and I couldn't move, they were all around me, around my neck and legs, yelling and screaming. I was all upset and I didn't know what to do and I didn't know where we were going. I just thought: well, they're police, they must know what they're doing. I suppose I've got to go with them, they're taking me to see Mum. You know this is what I honestly thought. They kept us in hospital for three days and I kept asking, `When are we going to see Mum?' And no-one told us at this time. And I think on the third or fourth day they piled us in the car and I said, `Where are we 
 going?' And they said, `We are going to see your mother'. But then we turned left to go to the airport and I got a bit panicky about where we were going . . . They got hold of me, you know what I mean, and I got a little baby in my arms and they put us on the plane. And they still told us we were going to see Mum. So I thought she must be wherever they're taking us.</para><para>Of course, that was not the case. When I read the elements of the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline>  report, I reflected on the deaths in custody reports that I read as shadow minister, and the Leader of the Opposition referred to them. Honourable members would remember that, when those reports came out, there were sequential reports and small volumes. I read many of those at the time and was struck also by the fact that, when you had a separation early in the life of the child, the increase in the incidence of difficulties faced later—whether it be by way of incarceration or self-mutilation, and many of the reports were graphic and certainly extremely disturbing—was clearly apparent.</para><para>What I want to do is paint the picture. I do not think there is a person in Australia who would not regret what has happened in this country in the past. Indeed, we saw that as a nation we ignored the 1949 convention for over a generation. But what we are discussing today is what we do about these issues in a practical sense. So I would hope that the parliament and the nation are not going to divide on semantic arguments but accept the spirit of what is being said here today. The view that I want to articulate is that our future actions must be illuminated by the history that we know. If we can all take account of that history and look positively for practical ways to assist indigenous Australians, I think that indigenous Australians and all of us, both now and in the future, will be better for that endeavour.</para><para>The National Sorry Day was a recommendation from the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report. The day has been privately organised, and we say thank you to those who have been involved. It is not a government initiative, and participation is a matter for individuals. There is no doubt, however, that some people are uncomfortable with the concept of a sorry day or have trouble relating to it. It would be a 
 pity if people were turned away from Reconciliation Week because of that. Reconciliation Week is very strongly supported by the government.</para><para>Both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and my colleague Dr Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs—and, I might say, a very compassionate and understanding individual who is universally acclaimed for the work he is doing in this area of difficult public policy—have expressed their personal regret over the treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the past. Indeed, I have done so, and do so again today. If other Australians want to express their regrets for those actions by signing sorry books, then that is clearly a matter for those individuals.</para><para>As I say, we want to take practical steps. When I was the shadow minister in the late 1980s, we sought ways to take practical steps. We still seek ways to take practical steps, and each Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs will take steps to ensure that there are practical outcomes. The response by the government to the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report was to make very substantial funds available to help those who have been affected to trace their families. If, the centrepiece of being is an attachment to family, as I think it is, and if you have been taken from your family—like that young child from Cape Barren Island in the middle of Bass Strait, as isolated an area as any in our nation—and you believe you want assistance to trace your family, then we as a nation should provide it, and we have done so. We will provide counselling, as we are doing at the present time, for those who need support. That is a practical step. It is a sensible step and one on which the government enjoys congratulations from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.</para><para> We have also wanted to substantially focus on the issue of health. I know that, as health minister, my colleague Dr Wooldridge, who succeeded me as shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, established an indigenous health unit in his department when he had the opportunity on coming to government. I know that the former minister for health, who was 
 here a moment ago, would echo the need for that. We want the unit to focus on the need to improve health outcomes in Aboriginal communities. We have provided an extra $73 million over the next three years.</para><para>Dr Herron has taken some innovative steps. Something we have not done before is engage the Army to assist in remote areas to improve such basic things as water. These are the things that I think we need to recognise as having to be done. In fact, they are being done. We want to tackle those key issues. They are not matters that you need to keep talking about; they are matters that require action. Too often in the past we have talked too much and we have not done enough. So I come back to my fundamental point: in our future and current actions we need to be illuminated by the history that we now know that has been brought to our attention by the deaths in custody report and the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report.</para><para>On the issue of reconciliation, I believe the government has clearly demonstrated that it strongly supports Reconciliation Week and the process of reconciliation. Indeed, the announcement by the Speaker, before the commencement of this debate, is to be commended. We believe that there are basically three essential matters that need to considered. There needs to be a mutual acceptance of the importance of working together and ensuring that our differences do not prevent us from sharing equality and a common future. I think we can all agree with that.</para><para>Second, there needs to be an honest and realistic acknowledgment of the injustices of the past. I am sure each of us can provide anecdotal examples from our own reading, from our own representations from constituents, and from other knowledge, of how we can address those injustices of the past. Indeed, the churches, who played a very central role, have recognised that they have a key moral role to play in dealing with the future needs of indigenous Australians.</para><para>Third, there needs to be a shared commitment to overcoming indigenous disadvantage and providing equality of opportunity for all Australians. They are the three points that must lead us forward in the reconciliation 
 debate. They must lead to justice and equity for all indigenous Australians, wherever they might be. As I travelled the length and breadth of Australia in the late 1980s, I certainly found that I was personally enriched by viewing the diversity of culture that exists from the Torres Strait to Elcho Island, Western Australia, South Australia, and my own state of Tasmania.</para><para>I am proud to say that this government has taken some practical steps. And that is what we seek to illustrate today by way of this amendment. We recognise the centrality of land to Aboriginal culture, and we are dealing with those issues. We have a special unit for health. We are dealing with the need for employment opportunities. We are dealing with the problem of disproportionate incarceration, particularly of young Aboriginal males in custody. All of these issues can be seen to have taken a marked move forward. I would hope that all in this chamber would recognise those moves for what they are. It is progress. It is what is needed for indigenous Australians. If we can unite on one thing today, we should unite on a view of the need to illuminate policies for now and for the future by what we know of the past. Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past. I am personally sorry for what has happened, but we as a nation must go forward. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>3708</page.no><name role="metadata">Holding, Clyde, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOLDING</name><name.id>CH4</name.id><electorate>Melbourne Ports</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table and who has just finished an important speech on behalf of the government, finished on the basis of saying that he was sorry for what occurred.

I accept and believe that many of the members of the government would have no problem about expressing their sense of sorrow.</para></talk.start><para> I take it one stage further, Minister. I would say on this issue that if we as a parliament are going to say anything of importance 
 to our indigenous people, we should say it with one voice. There is nothing in the government's amendment which does not live comfortably with what has been put by the Leader of the Opposition. I believe it is in the interests of our indigenous people and it is in the interests of this parliament to speak clearly on this issue with a united voice, and we start by saying sorry.</para><para> We often forget that when the First Fleet arrived in Australia every tree, every rock and every piece of bush was owned. It was part of an ongoing civilisation, a culture with a set of spiritual beliefs which were related to the land. If one makes a world comparison, one can say that those who settled this country were probably less brutal than those in other parts of the world in dealing with our indigenous people. But what we are dealing with here is a set of government decisions which not only got it wrong but also, in getting it wrong, has affected people who are still living in our community in a very real way.</para><para> Let me quote from one Aboriginal mother from the evidence she gave to the commission as a result of being stolen. We continually hear in the parliament the emphasis that we as a parliament and the government as a government put on family values. What occurred in this case was that the concept of family was totally destroyed. I ask the mothers in this parliament how they would have felt if a police van arrived and their children were being taken on a picnic, or with any excuse, without the force of the law, taken illegally and were not to be seen again.</para><para> That is what happened time and time again. How do we redress this wrong, because what is the effect? Let us look at just one piece of evidence given by an Aboriginal woman to the commission. She said:</para><para>That's another thing that we find hard is giving our children love. Because we never had it. So we don't know how to tell our kids that we love them. All we do is protect them. I can't even cuddle my kids `cause I never ever got cuddled. The only time was when I was getting raped and that's not what you'd call a cuddle, is it?</para><para>Do we just say, `We're going to fix that up. We're going to throw lots of money at it'? Compare the position that has been taken in 
 this House today by the government with that which has been taken by the churches.</para><para>Many of the churches were deeply involved in the administration of this policy and many of them were involved in the abuse of Aboriginal people. Do the bishops and the leaders of the churches walk away and say, `Oh, well, we've got to get some money and fix this up'? They do not. That should be the first thing they understand. For those people who are of a religious belief in this parliament, part of the great Christian tradition of at least one major church is that before you can get forgiven you have to confess your wrongs. These were not the wrongs of this government. They were not the wrongs of our government, but we got it wrong. Aboriginal citizens right throughout Australia are living with this on a daily basis. It is not so hard. An apology is not so hard.</para><para> I was confronted with that in a reconciliation meeting in my own electorate. As a result of reading this report, I realised that when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs one of the things I had not done as effectively as I would have wanted was that I did not give enough funding to an organisation called Link Up. If I had the knowledge that is contained in this report, I would have seen that they got a lot more money. I felt the need to publicly, in my own electorate, in the presence of Aboriginal people, get up and say, `Look, I apologise. I'm sorry.' If I knew then as minister what I know now, I would have directed a lot more resources to this group.</para><para>What was the response of the Aboriginal spokesman that followed me? Was it to say, `Hah, hah, see, you got it wrong'?  No, he got up and said to us, `We thank you for the apology but we also thank you for all the things that you got right.'</para><para>I would like the minister to think about that. We are in the situation where there are divisions within the Liberal Party on this issue. The state Liberal governments have had no difficulty in coming forward with apologies. What problem bedevils the Prime Minister?  I suspect that, if we were crossing the chamber and he accidentally bumped into me, he would have no problem in saying 
 sorry. What is the hang-up  when you know that there are Aboriginal people living now who are totally dislocated in terms of their family and who continue to suffer, and when we as a parliament cannot bring ourselves to say, `We regret that these things have occurred and we are sorry they ever happened'? The minister virtually said he is sorry. He does not have a problem. So where is the problem?  Is it with the Prime Minister?  If it is, let him tell us why it is so.</para><para>We have had a fairly divisive and exciting day in this chamber today. But this is one issue where we as members of parliament can speak with one voice. We should begin by saying, `We are sorry for a policy which denied Aboriginal citizens their human rights, which dislocated families and which was based on current racist concepts at the time.' The theory was very simple—everybody knew it—Aboriginal people were going to die out. If they are going to die out, what do you do? You grab the kids and you make them into little white people.</para><para>I have a friend in the Northern Territory, a distinguished Aboriginal artist, who is of light skin. He can tell you in detail how, when the police van came round, his mother kept a tin of nugget that she would bring out and put on his face. He was then thrown under a pile of blankets and told not to move.</para><para> I have never met an Aboriginal person who has not made an effort to find their family. I know of a distinguished Aboriginal woman who has achieved great academic distinction, and she tried to find her family. But what happens to an Aboriginal woman when her kids are taken from her?  What would happen to any of the women in this parliament if their kids were taken from them never to be seen again? When this Aboriginal woman met her mother, her mother had become a hopeless alcoholic. How do you rejoin the bonds that have been snapped and broken?</para><para>How do we as members of the parliament—we have got kids of our own—not embrace the standards that have been taken by Christian and other religious leaders?  We begin by saying, `Look, we are sorry it happened. We profoundly regret it,' and then we get on with it. Unless the government can give us some 
 explanation of that—I do not believe individual government members and I do not believe this minister have any great difficulty with our motion—let us for once in the lifetime of this government get it right; let us add your amendment to our motion.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7T4</name.id><name role="metadata">CROSIO</name><name role="display">Mrs Crosio</name></talker><para>—As an addendum.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Holding, Clyde, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOLDING</name></talker><para>—As an addendum. Let us speak to our indigenous people on the basis that this parliament is united in providing not only money but also a view of them—their culture and their spiritual beliefs—that reinforces the family values which are so often talked about in this place. 	 What does it cost?  It does not cost the government anything, and it will bring some credit to the government in an election year.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But, more importantly, it will bring some credit to this parliament when we as a continuum government start by saying to our indigenous Australians, `We profoundly regret what happened.' This government has no problem because it was not involved. Our government has had no problem. But what we are saying is that, when a government gets it wrong in the history and in the continuum of government processes, it is up to us as members of the national parliament to give a lead by saying, `We are sorry that this ever occurred. It shouldn't have. We're going to get it right.' We start by saying, `Sorry, it shouldn't have happened,' and then we move on. The process has then begun of bringing our indigenous people more firmly into the bonds of our broader community so that their contribution to the future of this country will be secure.</para><para>Make no mistake about it, the indigenous people's relationship with their land, their spiritual beliefs and the way they relate to each other provide very important aspects of our multicultural society. If we want to talk about a multicultural society—and we always do—let us now start focusing on the rights of our indigenous Australian people and on bringing them through these processes. We do that by saying, `We are sorry. We are going to fix it up.' It is not a question of throwing money at the indigenous people. Any minister for Aboriginal affairs will tell you of the complexities of this portfolio. I have defended 
 this minister on more than one occasion, because any minister has to be given a go. But the time has come when this parliament should speak with one voice and when we should unite around both these proposals rather than, in an election year, turn this aspect of the matter into yet another divisive political debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>3710</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RUDDOCK</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Immigration and Multicultural Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First, in a personal sense, may I say that of course I very much regret what has occurred. The nature of this debate, essentially, has been constrained, and this is welcome in an area of great difficulty and complexity. The history of this country led to a situation in which our first migrants—or original inhabitants—were left very marginalised in a community that expected an assimilationist approach. It was an approach that has occasioned a great deal of difficulty.</para></talk.start><para>The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), in his comments, wanted to make it appear as if this was a profoundly different issue to children being removed from parents. I do not wish to make it a debating point, save to say that I think there are, in our history, numbers of situations in which, for cultural reasons and for other reasons, children have been removed from parents and placed in institutional care. As a society, we still have to grapple with many of those questions. There are organisations in my own state that are particularly anxious about the situation of young people who have been placed in institutional care and subjected to abuse. There is very much an awareness of these issues emerging today.</para><para>Equally, in the portfolio area for which I have responsibility, we fund an organisation that deals with young people who were removed from family situations. Many of these young people believed they were orphans but, as we now find out, this may not have been the case. Well-meaning organisations supported these actions, believing they were providing appropriate care and support. These young people were given admission under migration programs supported by governments over a long period of time. We look back on this and we say that if we were to judge it by today's standards and what we 
 now know, we would have treated it very differently.</para><para>The outcome of policies and programs that were pursued by our forebears has had quite a significant impact upon this nation but a far greater impact upon the people concerned and their descendants. It is well known that Aboriginals suffer very significant disadvantage within our community. That is the reason why we have so many programs that are trying to address what we recognise as that significant disadvantage. These programs are not new. Programs have been developed for as long as I have been in public life. I served on Aboriginal affairs committees where we agonised about the way in which those programs would be implemented and the extent to which they would be successful. We saw a number of approaches which people suggested at different times would have an impact. I can remember moving to the situation of giving Aboriginals the right of self-determination and self-management in the way moneys were spent on their behalf. That has developed to its greatest extent now, where most of the moneys are handed over to the Aboriginal managed and controlled organisation, ATSIC.</para><para>We have seen an emphasis upon land rights—first recognised in the Northern Territory—in legislation put through by the Liberal government of the 1970s under Malcolm Fraser. There was an expectation that with land rights the situation would change remarkably. Now we see the emphasis is on apology and reconciliation. People generously want to support an approach which involves reconciliation. The government also puts a great deal of emphasis upon it. It does so in the context of mutual acceptance of the importance of working together to ensure that differences do not prevent us from sharing equally in a common future for this nation.</para><para>There needs to be an honest and realistic acknowledgment of injustices of the past. There needs to be a shared commitment to overcoming indigenous disadvantage and providing equality of opportunity for all Australians. It is that socioeconomic disadvantage suffered by our indigenous Australians 
 that the government believes is its key priority. We target expenditure to identified areas of greatest need—health, housing, education and employment. If you go through each of these areas you can see—coming from very difficult and very significant disadvantage—that there have been, over time, some changes.</para><para>I sometimes feel emboldened by the extent to which Aboriginals are so much more articulate today in putting their views about what should happen. I can remember earlier points in time when I felt that Aboriginals were, in a real sense, sometimes deprived of the capacity, courage, or perseverance to argue in their own cause. I now sometimes feel I will not say embarrassed but almost as one feels when somebody has abused one with a very strong and convincing argument. I feel very taken aback at the extent to which Aboriginals can now articulate their case and what they are seeking. I think the reason for this has a lot to do with what we have been able to achieve in education.</para><para>It is important, in the context of the motion and the amendment that we are putting today, to recognise that Commonwealth funding for indigenous-specific programs has not only continued to increase but also now represents something of the order of $1.9 billion.</para><para>When we look at ATSIC, we see an increase in 1997-98 of some $60 million over four years, with its level of funding guaranteed in all of that time. In the health area, we have seen in this year's budget something like $168 million is to be allocated to indigenous specific health programs. That represents a real increase of 37 per cent since 1995-96. Extra funding was provided in the 1996-97 budget over three years for the establishment of 35 new or expanded health services, with priority for remote and rural areas. In this budget, an additional $73 million over the next four years has been allocated to improve indigenous primary health care.</para><para>In the housing area, in this budget $387 million will be spent on indigenous specific housing and infrastructure programs. In November 1996 the government announced an initiative involving the army providing urgently needed housing and infrastructure 
 developments, including water and sewerage systems, in seven remote indigenous communities. Of course, that is also helping to ensure that skills in construction and ongoing maintenance are transferred to the communities involved. Interestingly, I gather those communities involved have been very responsive to those initiatives with our armed forces.</para><para>In the area of education, funding for indigenous education programs will be $333 million this year. I was astounded to learn that today there are some 7,461 indigenous students in higher education. In 1998-99, $21.8 million will be provided under indigenous support funding programs to provide academic preparation, counselling and study centres within our universities. This recognises that sometimes, without lowering standards, there needs to be the capacity to help young people through their courses of study with peer support and special counselling. My own daughter is at the Australian National University. For a time she tutored students in courses of study that she was undertaking or had previously undertaken.</para><para>I know that most of our universities are now providing those special arrangements to help Aboriginals through our educational system. That will lead to a very significant change in the future. When I think back to the time I was at university, you could perhaps count on two hands the number of students who would come through with university degrees. We have relied very heavily upon some of those people, such as Charles Perkins and so on, who obtained a university degree many years ago. But they were singular examples. Today, we have 7,461 potential Aboriginal graduates.</para><para>In the area of employment and economic development, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, which facilitates and promotes joint venture arrangements between industry, the Commercial Development Corporation and indigenous people, is to be allocated an additional $10 million to top up its capital base. The government's other indigenous specific programs include new indigenous business incentive programs which provide seed funding, training and other support for 
 newly established businesses for indigenous Australians. Of the order of $33 million will be provided for these in 1998-99.</para><para>One area about which I have always been impressed—I think it was, probably, if you wanted to use the term, the first work for the dole arrangement in Australia—is the community development employment program. With indigenous people there is an unemployment rate that is four times that of the general population, but this scheme enables our indigenous people to forgo rights to unemployment benefits and undertake work on community projects which will benefit them.</para><para>Those community projects have been protected from any form of expenditure reduction. In fact, they were expanded to a total funding, in 1998-99, of $402 million for 33,083 participants. That scheme is one which I know gives Aboriginals an opportunity to be involved in maintaining their homes, the environment in which they are living and their communities, and it provides them with self-esteem. Rather than getting what I think was often colloquially referred to as `sit down' money, they are able to say, `I have worked for these particular funds that I am being paid.'</para><para>We have put these arrangements in place in the context of ensuring that Aboriginal programs will be free from criticism. In the past, one has been prepared, perhaps, to forgo the opportunity to effectively audit and ensure that accountability arrangements are in place. One way of ensuring that these programs are well supported is to ensure that the community recognises that they are accountable and, especially, worked.</para><para>My colleague the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) fully supported the Commonwealth initiatives when he outlined them in relation to the response to the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline> report.

I believe he should have. This debate is very important. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs said, it does not have to be acrimonious; nevertheless, it is an important debate—important enough, I would have thought, for the Prime Minister to have participated. I feel very sad that he has chosen not to do so.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Minister for Family Services said the debate is about semantics, but it is not. The motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition strikes at the very core of this issue. In his motion, the Leader of the Opposition said that an apology is the first step to effective reconciliation. That is the crux of this debate. That is not semantics; that is something which I believe is supportable.</para><para>The government ministers who spoke said that Reconciliation Week is supported by the government—`strongly supported', the Minister for Family Services said—but by its actions here today it has demonstrated otherwise. I was also disappointed by the Prime Minister's answer in question time on this issue where he indicated, yet again, his intention not to apologise. I take the Leader of the Opposition's point that it is now too late for an apology—it would be hollow and meaningless. I think it is pointless to continue to expect or to ask that the Prime Minister should apologise on behalf of the government, this parliament or the people of Australia. That opportunity has been lost. The Prime Minister had an opportunity to provide leader 
 ship in giving an explanation of this issue to Australians, many of whom do not understand why they should apologise.</para><para>I have had calls to my office today from well-meaning people who are confused about this issue—why should they say sorry? They have to understand and they have to be convinced. They would be convinced if there had been bipartisan support in this parliament for that proposition. It would have been a great day for us in this parliament. It would have been a defining moment, not only in the history of this parliament but in the history of this nation. We had the opportunity—we still have the opportunity in a sense, although it will not happen—for a bipartisan approach. If we had taken that opportunity, we could then have put this behind us and moved on towards the year 2001 when we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of our nationhood, with reconciliation advanced rather than retarded by the events of today.</para><para>In the year 2001, if we have not achieved reconciliation, then our celebrations, as I said yesterday, will be hollow, meaningless and hypocritical. An opportunity has passed us today and, as I said at the outset, it makes me very sad that that is the case.</para><para>The government tactics in this matter really confuse and worry me. The fact is that because this motion by the Leader of the Opposition is supportable, and knowing that many of my former colleagues would, I suspect, want to support it were they given the opportunity to do so, this should be a conscience vote. If ever there were a matter that has come before this parliament that is a matter of deep conscience, this is such a matter. People on both sides of this House will want to apologise.</para><para>For some reason, the government, in its tactical considerations, is going to deny members a conscience vote. They will be forced to vote against this motion. In doing so, many of them will also be forced, unfortunately, to vote against their conscience. I do not say that lightly because I know they all have a conscience and many would want to say today, in the context of this debate, `I am sorry.' Yet we have an attempt by the government to supplant the Leader of the Opposit 
 ion's very well designed motion with a meaningless self-congratulatory amendment.</para><para>I will not support that amendment. It is supportable, but why should I? It is so hollow and meaningless. In fact, it is not a true amendment at all. It does not do anything to amend the opposition leader's motion. It is a totally different proposition altogether. It occurred to me, in terms of the standing orders, that it should not even have been accepted as an amendment, but I did not see much point in pursuing that particular issue.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>—You were very wise.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FT4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bradford, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRADFORD</name></talker><para>—Perhaps. I am not always so, but thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The amendment makes the point that it is all about money. This is where the government has this issue so wrong. Twice in the amendment we are called to note that the government is spending almost $1.9 billion on indigenous specific programs. We are reminded that the government is spending $63 million as a result of the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home</inline>  report. In other words, we can spend our way out of this issue; we can solve this problem by spending more money. I would have thought the history of our handling of Aboriginal affairs in this place would have demonstrated time and again that throwing money at this problem will not solve it, as necessary as it is to improve the degree of disadvantage which our indigenous people suffer vis-a-vis all of us in this place who have had privileged upbringings.</para></talk.start></continue><para>No amount of money, not billions of dollars, will substitute for the one word that we could have unanimously uttered in this place today, and that word is `sorry'. If we had taken that opportunity, as a nation I think we would have achieved an enormous amount. As a parliament, we could have been proud of that achievement and the bipartisanship and leadership that would have been shown in doing that would have made us very proud to call ourselves Australians.</para><para>Instead of that, I find myself, as I said at the outset, grieved and saddened by the approach that the government has taken on this issue. What is the problem? We have not heard from the ministers who have spoken 
 what the problem is with saying sorry. Is it a legal problem? When the issue first came up, the proposition was put to us that somehow this would create a legal problem for the government. That now seems to have gone by the board and that argument is no longer put. If there was a legal argument, the Minister for Family Services is a lawyer and he did not put it. If there is a legal problem with saying sorry, then argue that way, but there is not. The reason for not saying sorry is a political one, and that is why it hurts.</para><para>I think I understand the reason, having thought like that until maybe 12 or 18 months ago when I finally came to grips with the matter by spending time with some of my Aboriginal brothers and sisters and I came to understand what this was all about. There are a lot of people out there who do not understand, and the government seem to have the message that if they say sorry they will upset a lot of people, but that is where the issue of leadership comes in. Once we understand how important this issue is, how important this apology is to the process of reconciliation, that is when leadership comes in—to bring people with you on this issue. You cannot do anything else on this issue other than provide leadership and help people understand why it is important. And that, unfortunately, is what has been lacking.</para><para>It was ironical that my friend the Minister for Family Services was called upon to speak in the debate on this motion, because the forced removal of children from their parents which we are talking about today has destroyed, and continues to destroy, thousands of Aboriginal families. The Minister for Family Services did not mention that.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, as I said, it is too late for the Prime Minister to apologise. Reconciliation, despite the government's embracing of it—and I believe that is genuine—will not be possible without an apology, and now, unfortunately, I believe that it will not be possible for a coalition government to deliver to this nation by the year 2001 the degree of reconciliation that we will need to have by then if we are to celebrate genuinely the 100th anniversary of our nationhood. Unfortunately, I think that the government now has 
 little credibility on this issue of reconciliation. It pains me to say that because I know it hurts a number of my former colleagues who I know very well and who I know today would be feeling very deeply on this issue and would be wanting to have the opportunity to say sorry. I do not entirely understand why the government has chosen the tactics, with its amendment, that it has.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, we need to move on. We could have put this matter behind us. Today was the opportunity to say sorry, to move on, to start looking forward, and to put all of this behind us, but we have missed that opportunity. As I said earlier, if the opportunity had been taken, there could have been a bipartisan approach. We have let Australia down. I think we have let ourselves as a parliament down by the way in which we have approached this issue.</para><para>Finally, I do not intend to support the government's amendment to the motion. It is not unsupportable. It is self-congratulatory; it is largely factual. But on principle I will not support it because it is not in the spirit of what we are talking about. The opposition leader's motion is in the spirit of what this day is all about and what this week is all about. I will happily support that.</para><para>The sad thing is that I do not think many of the government members coming into the chamber will even know what they are voting against. Perhaps it would be timely to remind them of what the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition actually states, because many of them will come in here and not realise that they are being forced, by virtue of the government's tactic on this matter, to vote against what I think is a perfectly reasonable proposition. I think the support of it would have furthered us as a nation, as individuals and as a parliament.</para><para>	 Question put:</para><para>	 That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Mr Warwick Smith's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><para>The House divided.	</para></division.header><para>(Mr Deputy Speaker—Mr G.B.

The tabling of this report is a historic occasion for the committee which has a unique role in oversighting the process of budgetary appropriation for the Australian National Audit Office. This measure is in itself a significant guarantee of the independence of the Auditor-General from executive government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In its report No. 346, <inline font-style="italic">Guarding the independence of the Auditor-General</inline>, tabled in October 1996, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that it be given a statutory power to consider and report on draft budget estimates of the audit office as part of the then Auditor-General Bill. The committee argued that the proper resourcing of the Auditor-General and the ANAO was `integral to the functional independence of the Auditor-General'. It also argued that it was the `role of Parliament and not the Executive to take responsibility for ensuring that audit functions are adequately resourced'.</para><para>Although under section 56 of the constitution it is indisputable that the office of the Auditor-General cannot be legally or finan 
 cially independent from the executive in any absolute sense, it has been possible to insulate the Auditor-General's financing from executive influence to ensure that the audit office cannot be starved of funds.</para><para>A process has been put in place whereby the draft budget estimates are considered by the JCPAA before the budget is handed down and the committee's report provided to the minister for finance to be tabled as soon as practical after the budget. This process allows the resourcing of audit functions to be made transparent to the parliament so that the executive is held to account for the level of resources appropriated to allow the Auditor-General to fulfil the statutory functions of his office.</para><para>With respect to the budget estimates for the 1998-99 financial year, the committee accepts that the budget appropriation figure of $53.703 million, as finally adjusted, is sufficient for the ANAO to carry out its functions. The committee acknowledges the response of the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), who commented on the cooperative manner in which this unprecedented process of parliamentary scrutiny was implemented by the JCPAA and the Australian National Audit Office.

The interviewer, Mr Laws, said:</para><para>So what you are saying . . . is if you had a choice between breaking election promises and running a budget deficit, what would you choose?</para><para>Howard: Well, we won't break . . . we would always give preference to keep our promises.</para><para>Laws: So even if it means running a deficit?</para><para>Howard: Well, if it means that we have to delay achieving the underlying surplus, because we've always said it will, that is the answer.</para><para>While increasingly more weasel words were inserted into his statements before his first 
 budget, he did say again before that first budget:</para><para>We don't intend to hurt people who need help. Anything we do . . . will fully honour the commitments we made to individuals in relation to pensions and the level of unemployment and sole parent benefits—things of that character.</para><para>So he shifted ground a bit, but still there with a promise. Of course, he broke that promise, and many others, in the first budget, and again in the second and again in the third, all the while claiming that it was due to unforeseen budgetary problems—the ones that would not bother him, he said to John Laws. It is the oldest trick in the book. During the election debate in February 1996, the Prime Minister solemnly intoned:</para><para>. . . every single dollar of the promises that I made to the Australian people are going to be kept.</para><para>Who is not to be trusted? As well as being grammatically incorrect, this assurance was also wrong. Howard short-changed the Australian people to the tune of $17 billion worth of broken promises over four years.</para><para>This budget gives us an opportunity to measure the Howard government's performance against the promises they made to the electorate before the last election. Since their betrayal has been so comprehensive, I do not have time in the 15 minutes available to me to cover all the territory, so I will focus on a few areas which are critical to the wellbeing of all Australians and to the future of our nation, in particular health care, child care and employment, education and training.</para><para>One of the clearest promises made by the coalition before the last election—and I had cause to notice it—was that they would not change Medicare. They were insistent they would retain it in the form that it was developed and implemented by Labor. They would not revert to the Fightback formula, with which we had become familiar. In February, the coalition health policy launch contained the assurance:</para><para>We will maintain Medicare in its entirety.</para><para>That is a very simple promise, very clear and unequivocal. Further, they said:</para><para>None of the health policy initiatives will entail cuts to funding for public hospitals. 
</para><para>That is very clear again. These were very important promises to the Australian people, since it is almost certain that one of their reasons for rejecting the conservatives in 1993 was the fact that the conservatives were going to wind back Medicare and the public hospital sector. Howard was very keen indeed to distance himself from his predecessor, Dr John Hewson.</para><para>Once in government, however, the Liberals' longstanding antipathy to Medicare became very obvious. It was quickly in evidence and has been consolidated in a series of moves which undermine Medicare's integrity, contrary to the promises that they made. For instance, in 1996, $800 million was cut from public hospitals by a combination of cuts to financial assistance grants to the states and direct cuts justified on the spurious grounds of cost shifting. They actually penalised the states who had done the least, not the most.</para><para>The Commonwealth dental program, worth $400 million, was simply abolished. Pharmaceutical co-payments for pensioners and families reduced government funding by $732 million and transferred the costs directly to the users. A further billion dollars was saved from freezing the GP rebate and restricting provider numbers and other measures. So health was hit hard.</para><para>This was a full frontal attack on the cornerstones of the Medicare compact with the Australian people—a direct breach of all their promises, especially since a good portion of these funds went to their spectacularly unsuccessful attempt to prop up the private health funds. As Kennett remarked in his typically pungent fashion, this was `money down the drain'.</para><para>The use of money from the public hospitals to pay for failed private health insurance rebates was also a clear breach of another policy in their 1996 statement, which stated:</para><para>. . . the private health insurance incentives will not be funded from the public hospital system or the health grants to the states.</para><para>Yet that is what they did. I can only presume that the `not' was a typographical error. It is clear that they always intended this switch, as they did in Fightback.</para><para>This was a cynical attempt to undermine our faith in the capacity of Medicare to provide a reliable and quality health care system for Australia. What we have is longer and longer waiting lists, industrial disruption, increased costs and, as a result, greater anxiety about standards. All of this takes a toll on the people of Australia.</para><para>Our hospitals and their dedicated staff are now working under clearly intolerable pressures and it is starting to show. For instance, in my own state of WA, nurses have for the first time in the history of that state gone on strike. Their pay and conditions have deteriorated dramatically under the conservative Court government. These cuts have compromised it further and they are not prepared, incidentally, to stand by and watch hospital standards compromised further. Noteworthy is the AWA—the so-called new award—being offered to the new graduates. It contains some very unpalatable elements including, for instance, an allowance for a 7½-hour break between shifts. They are supposed to leave the hospital at 10 o'clock at night, drive home—however long that takes—have a sleep and a meal and get back within 7½ hours. Not surprisingly, they are rejecting that so-called offer.</para><para>As if this was not a sufficient indication of the government's desire to corrode the key elements of Medicare, in 1997 a further $673 million was removed from the pharmaceuticals budget. Plans were also launched for the closure of Medicare offices—there have been 43 so far, mainly in Labor constituencies—restricting access to full payment services. The substitutes are definitely second-rate. This action was from the same government, incidentally, which promised at the last election to open new offices in practically every marginal seat in the country. I followed them around as they announced that. Instead, they are closing them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>MG4</name.id><name role="metadata">LEE</name><name role="display">Mr Lee</name></talker><para>—Even Chisholm.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XS4</name.id><name role="metadata">Lawrence, Carmen, MP</name><name role="display">Dr LAWRENCE</name></talker><para>—The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has moved from there so he does not have to cop the consequences.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is astounding that there is no remedy at all in this budget for the No. 1 problem in 
 this country—that is, health. The crisis in our public hospital system deserves priority attention from this government; instead, the government has compounded the problem created by conservative state governments systematically ripping funds out of hospitals over the last five years by not only slashing its own funding but also now offering totally inadequate funds under the next round of Medicare agreements.</para><para>Despite every major commentator agreeing that more is needed, there is not one extra dollar on the negotiating table. It is the same offer which resulted in the walk-out of the Premiers when it was last discussed. While Borbidge has either sold out or been bought off for the Queensland election—it is not clear yet which of those is true—the other states have held firm. They need to, and they know they need to.</para><para>The Howard government's claims that this is a generous offer involving significant extra funding have been dynamited too by the former leader Dr John Hewson. Again, yesterday, he made it clear that this offer is no such thing—certainly not generous. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, Dr Hewson wrote:</para><para>The Commonwealth claims a 15 per cent increase, but the States have to adjust for demographic factors—</para><para>in other words, more people—</para><para>the ageing of the population and the requirements of service delivery—the 15 per cent becomes 1 per cent, insufficient to deliver what patients now demand. The impasse means poorer quality health services and longer queues at hospitals. How long do the queues have to get before the Commonwealth and the States talk again, let alone actually solve the funding-service delivery imbalance?</para><para>That is a question we have been asking, too. Dr Hewson goes on to observe in the same article:</para><para>The States attitudes have hardened as they've recognised how easily the Commonwealth has moved back into budget surplus on the back of growth taxes that have delivered them substantial real revenue gains. Much of the limited expenditure restraint has been by cutting payments to the States or by the States' fiscal contribution.</para><para>And they know what is going on.</para><para>Furthermore, the so-called new money in the package for mental health and palliative 
 care is simply a continuation of existing services. It is not new at all. The Commonwealth's offer would, according to the states, result in more than one million extra patients on the waiting lists. There are already some pretty appalling examples and I will just give two from my own electorate.</para><para>There is one lady living in my electorate who has been waiting since 7 April last year for an eye operation at Royal Perth Hospital. There is only one specialist in the state who can perform this operation. This woman is unemployed and is forced to wear an eye patch. One of the reasons she continues to be unemployed is that she finds it difficult to apply for jobs. She is sensitive with the eye patch. It causes her stress and is very upsetting. In another case, there is another older woman who has ongoing problems with her knees and has had numerous operations. She has been waiting, too, for over 12 months for the final operation. She waits in pain. She is unable at this stage to find out when that operation will take place and, as a result, is experiencing mobility problems, affecting her ability to care for her household. They are sadly not unique stories. They could be repeated all around this country.</para><para>At the same time as we have seen these waiting lists grow, we have seen that the government have been prepared to pour funds into their ill-conceived and now failed rebate scheme for private health insurance. Even though not all of it has been taken up—some $300 million, I understand—none has been returned to the public hospital system, from which it was pilfered in the first place. I would have to say that any halfway numerate health economist could have warned them—and many did—that the introduction of rebates into an open-ended private health insurance market would simply result in higher costs, and it did. There was a windfall for all the suppliers of services and nothing for the consumers.</para><para>Some states are now threatening to abandon one of the central tenets of Medicare—the free hospital treatment—and start charging for services. This would take us back to the disastrous days of the failed Fraser policies, which appeared to change almost weekly and 
 which Dr Wooldridge, the minister responsible, described at the time as being wrong and as alienating even their best supporters. Following the Prime Minister's clear intervention in health policy, we now face the prospect of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) re-engineering the health system, as he put it. Make no mistake about it, the Treasurer has designs on Medicare.</para><para>As journalist Karen Middleton pointed out last week, the Prime Minister has never wavered in his belief that the key elements of Fightback were the way to go. We have seen the IR changes, the reintroduction of a GST, the increased Medicare levy for high income earners, the rebate for those with private health insurance, and now the Treasurer has clearly enunciated threats to GP visits and hospital costs, a change which the Prime Minister has refused to rule out in question time. Fightback is back in all its threatening and funereal garb.</para><para>I want to briefly mention a couple of other areas where we have seen similar betrayals of the promises of the Howard government. One of them is child care. We were told before the last election that this government would `maintain the non-means testing of the child-care rebate'. They junked that promise in the first budget. They also reassured worried families that `the coalition has no plans whatever to change the operational subsidy to the community based long day care sector'. Perhaps they did not have plans then, but they soon implemented them with a vengeance. They completely cut the subsidies, raising average child-care costs from between $14 and $20 a week, forcing many families out of child care. Overall, in the last two budgets this government has cut $800 million from child care. So harsh have been the cuts that many families have had to withdraw their children from care and use unsatisfactory alternatives or, in the case of many women, leave the work force altogether or cut their hours. The result is a significant underspend—revealed in this year's budget—of $117 million for child-care assistance. This is projected to grow to $300 million—so many families are pulling out. Families simply 
 cannot afford the care now. In fact, they cannot afford this government.</para><para>There are other choice examples, in this budget and the ones before it, of blatant broken promises presented without any apology at all to the Australian people. I will quote a couple in conclusion:</para><para>We will maintain the level of funding of operating grants to the universities and there will be no cuts in university places.</para><para>We are going to maintain the expenditure on labour market programs in real terms.</para><para>What really happened? University operating grants were cut by $623.5 million over four years and enrolments have declined.	  Labor market programs were cut by $1.8 billion, and the once free public employment service was dismantled. I end where I began. Who is it that can be trusted? Certainly not this Prime Minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>3723</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BOB BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—After eight years of continual budget deficits, we now have what we have all waited for: a balanced budget. The former Labor government made a lot of promises. They talked the talk, but clearly they did not walk the walk. They created high expectations, and they delivered the highs: high unemployment, high interest rates, high inflation and high debt.</para></talk.start><para>Colleagues, let us take but a moment to visit some of the record of debt of the Labor government: in 1991-92, $11.4 billion; in 1992-93, $17 billion; in 1993-94, $17 billion; in 1994-95, $13 billion; in 1995-96, $10.3 billion. As we average Australians would know, you cannot live beyond your means. Yet, under Labor, we lived well beyond our means—we mortgaged off our children's future to overseas borrowings.</para><para>In fact, if you do some simple mathematics, the last year of Labor's $10.3 billion debt equated to nearly 50c for every hour of every day of every week for one year for every man woman and child in Australia, or the debt grew at over $326 for every second of every day for that whole year.</para><para>And yet these were the halcyon days of bringing home the bacon and a great set of numbers. And the self-gratifying platitudes 
 went on and on. The Labor Party does not know the difference between fact and fiction, addition and subtraction,  deficit and surplus. And yet these were the very same people who promised l-a-w, law, tax cuts and not only failed to deliver on the much promised cuts but, immediately after the 1993 election, raised wholesale sales tax by two per cent. And yet they still could not produce the balanced budget.</para><para>Not only have we managed to bring the budget back into surplus; we are the only government ever to do so without raising taxes. Over the term of this government there has been no increase in income tax, no increase in company tax, no increase in wholesale sales tax, and no increase in fuel tax. In 1998 we are back on track, back in the black. This is where we are going and this is where we will stay: safe, secure and  stable.</para><para>As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) stated back in 1996, we did not create the problems that this nation faced, but we accepted the responsibility to fix the problem. I believe that we are well on the way to doing just that. When I came to this parliament I said in my maiden speech that I wanted to be a part of the team that turned the ship around to steer a course towards the nation's salvation.</para><para>When I read in the budget papers that this government will increase the money for the national illicit drug strategy from $87.5 million over three years to $215 million over five years I could see that in relation to the debilitating drug problem in this country we are starting to head along the right course. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) hand-picked  Major Brian Watters of the Salvation Army in March 98 to be Chairman of the National Council on Drugs, I knew that the ship was in good hands.</para><para>It is an understatement to say that drugs are a major problem, a major social and human problem. Over 2,000 people a day seek out specialist help to overcome an addiction so great that these affected people will say or do anything for just another hit. We only need to look at the reaction from addicts when the lifesaving Narcan is administered to save their life and they come off their high. Recently, I was moved by a letter by a mother of a young 
 addict—a letter full of anguish, a letter from a broken-hearted family. I will take a moment to read this letter from Mrs S:</para><para>Sir,</para><para>Three months ago, being Miss H's Mother I could not in all honesty have written this letter untill now. </para><para>To start from the beginning, Miss H met a man called Mr G., well known to the courts. She was only 14 years old he being 9 years older. Miss H became infatuated with him and was soon led into the drug world.</para><para>Her father and I tried to stop this relationship even at times in desperation nearly going outside the law; our whole lives were built around getting rid of this man, as it was evident that he could see a pot of gold, if only he could rid himself of her parents.</para><para>We soon had to learn the way of the streets because in those days there was no help or advise for the parents of a drug addictive child—and believe me we tried, knocking and begging on many doors. On many occasions I would learn the whereabouts of where he had enticed her to, I would wait around corners and back streets untill the opportunity arose to snatch her from the lifeless state she was in, and try with no knowledge of how to rehabilitate her, just a mothers love to hold her through the long days and nights and try to bring her back to some form of dignity. I would begin to see a break through but once again using e.g. his mother, his sister his many friends by devious means, even to stalking her when she was doing community service at Booragal home for the aged, he would get her back.</para><para>Lynne Blunt, supervisor of the home saw this and threatened him with the police, trying to remove him. The staff and all in charge thought a great deal of [my daughter] and will only be too pleased to verify what I have said.</para><para>[My daughter] did, however, pull herself together and obtained a position at the [local] Chemist, the Chemist knowing her past history, but willing to give her another chance.</para><para>[This man] sent his sister in every day unsettling her and stating if [my daughter] didn't come back to him he would commit suicide. With so many interruptions the Chemist had to let her go. Saying to [her father] what a terrible shame she was my best girl. He would also verify to that.</para><para>We then felt if we sold our Home in the inner city and built on our property in the country at Paterson we would distance [her] from him.</para><para>Little did we know this was soon to become the start of her recovery. 
</para><para>On the 15th November 1997 on a Sunday afternoon there was a phone call from [my daughter] for help. I quote her words exactly. Please Help Me Mum. Can I come home? [Mr G.] is out of my life forever, it is all over, I need my families help.</para><para>So we began a period of 10 days and nights of suffering by us all of bringing her out of the withdrawal and dependency of these drugs in her system. The only thing going for us was the seclusion to let her release the Demons from her body, this is the only way I can describe the horror of what we had to see [our daughter] go through and achieve. All we kept saying as we held her closely was how proud we were of her accepting this pain, it took untold strength to do what she did to come out the other end with no professional help, only her Mother, Father and Brother.</para><para>Our next step as we saw it was to get professional help. We knew of Teen Challenges up heavels for eg. All staff had to be sacked and that was no longer an option for us. [My daughter] suggested Kirkwood House Rehab at Morrisset but [my husband] and I didn't see any real dedication to these troubled people. We then rang William Booth Institute at Surrey Hills, they spoke to her at great length. The up-shot was she told to bring her bags along to Sydney with possibility of admittance.</para><para>[My daughter] was admitted. Her father and I were so very proud, because only we knew the power of strength it took for her to have reached this point.</para><para>They are assessed for a week and then moved on to Selah Farm at Berkeley Vale—</para><para>which is in the seat of the member for Dobell (Mr Lee)—</para><para>to commence what is called the twelve steps of the Bridge Programme, still under the guidance of the Salvation Army.</para><para>[My daughter] was doing so very well, I knew this because I rang 3 and 4 times a week and was told, she is working the Programme well. Her letters showed such promise of maturity especially when she said, I love you all so very much, but I also love myself and want my life back. Being that she is such a kind girl outside of addiction, she befriended a girl whose (Mother was dying and Father was in gail,) and also asked me to send cards and letters which I did, plus asking my friend to also write to Moya as a Mother figure.</para><para>Her Mother did die, and when allowed out for the funeral she obtained drugs and brought them in to Selah, gave them to [my daughter] and others. An older woman of 42 yrs who used, decided with [my daughter] they would tell Captain Ashford what they had done.</para><para>The ruling being that once used, you have to leave the Programme for 21 days. Moya and the 
 other older women left, but Captain Ashford rang us and told us what had happened and said I wish to keep [my daughter] here till you can come for her as she is a very beautiful girl worth Saving.</para><para>My reaction was anger but Captain Ashford tried to point out to me that this set back makes for a greater recovery, and it was also said When we were still very angry and thought she should have been stronger and refused, we were pulled up rather harshly. The comment was, she was'nt expecting the temptation of the drugs being placed in front of her in the Sanctury of the Rehab.</para><para> So we began another long journey of 21 days and nights of helping to keep her clean to once again have another chance. On advice we had two urine tests per week, which we did and have from the doctor proof of this being clean even the day she was allowed back in.</para><para>As we drove home with her that day the awful fear of how it was going to be humanly possible for us to face up to the next 21 days.</para><para>However, our fears were unfounded because she took leadership of us all even to her brother, saying I will make it back to Selah and so she did with flying colours, using what she had learnt from the Bridge Programme and went one day at a time.</para><para>Looking back the three weeks were a great help to her as many questions were asked and answered for eg. Why did I need to use? This seemed to be the stumbling block for her to move on to the next step of the 12 steps.</para><para>She made it back to William Booth to start the program again. We were especially heartened by the reception she got, Councillor Anne Saying, [Miss H] do you realize what you have been able to achieve in those 3 weeks without any help from Rehab? That was very remarkable.</para><para>In closing my feelings are as a family devoted to Saving her from the drug infested world. We have made a start.</para><para>I visited this family on the property to see what I could do. The daughter, Miss H, poured out her story. Even for the most hardened person in this chamber, it was a sad, soul destroying story. The events post the latest rehab program was that Miss H lasted only seven days before she needed a fix. The addiction is so strong and the internal pressure so great that perhaps you and I cannot understand.</para><para>Miss H has now been convicted of robbery in company and is serving three months of periodic detention. Eighty per cent of property crime is attributed to drugs crime. Make no mistake about it: I have no sympathy for the 
 crime that she and her boyfriend committed. They deserve the full punishment of the law. I have no tolerance for the use of drugs. Zero tolerance for me is the only answer, but we need an answer to this problem.</para><para>I asked Miss H to put into words what she wanted and what she saw as the solution. She wrote a letter to the Prime Minister. She said:</para><para>My name is [Miss H], I am a heroin addict.</para><para>I would like to take you for a walk, a walk into the life of an addict, sharing my experiences so you the leader of our country can help my generation from self-destruction, pain and anguish.</para><para>My drug use has robbed me of my youth, self esteem, morals and spirituality and has brought me before the courts countless times. A world of emotional torment.</para><para>It first started when I met a man 9 years my senior who introduced me to drugs. As the need became so great he then could manipulate me into crime. At the age of 15 it seemed a game eg: How far I could push Authority figures?</para><para>I come from such a good and loving family who have spent the last 7 years devoted only to me.</para><para>My parents and brother had their lives torn apart in every way possible, shame, hurt and tormented with the whole drug scene. Crying out for help but no-one was qualified enough to advise them.</para><para>My thoughts on a couple of issues are:</para><para>The drug use is to escape reality.</para><para>The methadone programme is a waste of tax payers money. Those on the programme will tell you that. I've never used the methadone programme on the advice of methadone users. It simply does not work.</para><para>The Israeli programme, Mr Prime Minister, is why I am writing to you, to beg you to find a way to assist me to join this programme. I have heard nothing but good clean reports on this programme. As my parents have spent thousands, for eg: relocating the family home out of the city and into the country just one of their attempts to save me. This was the most costly. To quote their sayings "The well has run dry."</para><para>Please sir help me and my family.</para><para>Thank you for listening to me.</para><para>As a footnote she wrote the following:</para><para>* Drugs are running riot in Newcastle</para><para>* Pawn Brokers are fences for drug addicts to take stolen goods to convert to cash.</para><para>I will continue these comments later in an adjournment debate.

But its significance should not be underestimated. It does tell us a great deal about the kind of government we now have and it does tell us a lot about what kind of Australia we would have if this government were allowed to continue in office.</para></talk.start><para>The budget this year confirms and consolidates the budget strategy of the first two years of the coalition government. It shows a government which is brutal in its disregard for the unemployed and for those doing it hardest in our community. It shows a government which is contemptuous in its undermining and threatening of the interests of ordinary Australian families. It shows a government obsessive in its pursuit of small government objectives. It shows a government which is quite wrong-headed in its economic management.</para><para>In achieving the surplus which is now predicted for this year, it does so not as it could and should have done on the back of jobs and growth but rather on the backs of the unemployed, of battling Australians and of ordinary Australian families. The issue is not—with respect to the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin)—back in black, back on track, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) would have us believe; the issue is: back in black but on whose back? It is the back of ordinary Australians that this budget has been perched on—it and its predecessors.</para><para>Moreover, the government is wrong-headed in its economic management in purporting to be doing this above all in the interests of improving national savings—a crucial thing to achieve if we are going to make a structural assault on the current account deficit. But, in fact, the government strategy here is acting against private savings. I will come back to that issue.</para><para>Finally, the budget is the product of a government which is inherently dishonest in its approach to the management of this nation. Many of the predictions in the budget are shonky in character in a way that one can only assume is deliberate. That shonkiness 
 shows up in the key forecasts on growth, on jobs and on the current account. There is another kind of shonkiness involved in this document insofar as it is incomplete and misleading to the extent that it does not contain within its four corners the revenue measures that, we hope, are shortly going to be announced—the government's tax package—nor does it contain the election bribery expenditure measures which are no doubt part of the government's repertoire for the future.</para><para>It is not the practice to oppose appropriation bills introduced by the government of the day. No opposition does that, and we certainly will not be changing the practice. It is, however, appropriate in all the circumstances of this budget to move a second reading amendment to make clear the nature of the concern that ought to be felt about this budget and the whole budget strategy of which it is simply the third part. Accordingly, I move:</para><para>That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para><para>"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that the Budget:</para><para>(1)	 does nothing to redress the pain caused to ordinary Australian families, and those doing it hardest in our community, by the impact of successive Budget cuts on health, education, job programs, aged care, child care and many other government programs and services;</para><para>(2)	 by seeking to achieve surplus on the basis of savage Budget cuts, rather than on growth and job creation, does nothing to give hope to the unemployed and underemployed;</para><para>(3)	 confirms that the Opposition's alternative Budget strategy, as originally announced in 1996, would have returned the Budget to surplus in 1998-99—on the basis of putting growth and jobs first, with much more moderate outlays reductions;</para><para>(4)	 lacks credibility in its growth, employment and current account deficit forecasts;</para><para>(5)	 confirms that Australia has a private rather than public saving problem—and the stupidity of the Coalition's promise-breaking decision in 1997 to abandon Labor's superannuation co-contribution; and</para><para>(6)	 is incomplete and misleading in its projections of future revenue and outlays, in that it makes no provision for election-driven new expenditures and the Government's GST and other tax proposals".  
</para><para>The pain that is contained in this budget and which is the subject of the first paragraph of the amendment has been amply documented by others in this debate. I will not go into this issue in any detail, but one gets a sense of the order of magnitude of the pain involved by simply looking at the size of the dollar assault in particular areas of government services. Taking into account what has been spent as well as what has been cut, we see that the net assault on outlays in education over the last three years has been $3 billion; on health, it has been $1½ billion; and, on job programs, it has been another $1½ billion. There has been $800 million taken from child care and $400 million in net terms taken from aged care, along with hundreds of millions of dollars in other programs across the whole spectrum of government activity. Then, of course, there has been a reduction of 79,200 in the number of people employed by the Commonwealth public sector.</para><para> Behind all those large figures are a multitude of individual hurts. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said in his own budget reply last week:</para><para>. . . built on a million small deficits in the lives of ordinary people. . . . The hundred unspoken small goodbyes of ordinary people to their ordinary lives.</para><para>That is the real story of this budget and its predecessors—those deficits—the pain that has been caused to so many people.</para><para>I will give just one illustration of what is happening in practice as a result of this government's cancellation of the Commonwealth dental program to save $100 million a year. I refer to the implications of this for people in the Springvale Community Health Service in my own electorate. The waiting list in April 1996 was 3,680 people, and there was a reasonable expectation that people could be seen immediately in the case of emergencies or if there were the need for urgent treatment and would be seen within at least 12 months when non-urgent treatment was required.</para><para>By April 1997—after the program had been abandoned, when the system of co-payments was introduced as a further disincentive to use of what remaining chairs were still being funded by state programs—the waiting list 
 was 5,812. It had blown out almost to double. In April this year, when I checked the figures just last month, the waiting list was 7,151—representing a two year and two months waiting period—blowing out by more than double what the situation was two years ago. The further reality lying behind that is that there are a great many people on the waiting list and when they are contacted each month and offered the opportunity to access the dental service only 20 per cent of them are now taking up the offer, the reason being, in the judgment of the staff at Springvale, that so many people are not now able even to pay the flat rate minimum $20 that is being demanded as a co-payment. So this is the kind of pain that is involved in this particular measure, and it is just one example of a whole spectrum of pain and problems of this kind that are being generated. The question is: was it all necessary? Did we have to have—because of the state of the economy, the state of national finances—the assault of the kind that has been represented by this series of budgets? The short answer is no. The first point to make is that the condition of Austral</para><para>ian public finance was, in fact, nothing like that which is being described by the government. We had not only among the very lowest combinations of taxing and spending in the entire OECD—with only two countries lower than us on the government spending scale and only three below us on the taxing scale—but Australia was also, at the time that this government took office, right down at the bottom end of the spectrum when it came to public debt and budget deficits—the cutting edge of this government's complaint about the condition of our national finances when they came into office. Only a couple of countries had a better record than Australia—out of the entire OECD grouping of the major industrialised countries of the world. That is best demonstrated graphically by two sets of tables which spell out, as no volume of words could, just where Australia sits on these revenue and expenditure comparison tables and public debt and public deficit comparison tables. I seek leave to incorporate those tables in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The tables read as follows—</inline></para><para><graphic href="R260598G01.jpg"></graphic></para><para><graphic href="R260598G02.jpg"></graphic></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Gareth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GARETH EVANS</name></talker><para>—I am indebted to those concerned. These graphs bear close study, in particular the extent to which we squarely came within—before the government even began to embark on its present assault on this community's people—the Maastricht criteria of good economic housekeeping which have become part of the international economic vocabulary because they are the criteria which have been the required hurdle to be jumped by countries seeking initial entrance into the European monetary union. Australia, in terms of our respectability standard by reference to those criteria, was way under the bars in each case.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The rest of the story—about the lack of necessity for what has actually happened—needs to be told and told again. It was perfectly possible to get this country back into surplus this financial year, 1998-99, without anything like the pain that has been caused by this succession of budgets. The government went down a course of full-scale assaults on outlays programs in the way that I have described. It did so in the context of talking down the nation's finances: saying we were in a dreadful condition when we weren't, but in a way which led to a dramatic deterioration in both business and, even more importantly, consumer confidence. Spending fell away. Growth fell away. Our performance over the last two years has been one of much less fast growth than in the previous two years—the last two years of Labor government—a much slower rate of job creation and, with it, a need to embark upon further deficit slashing in order to accommodate the further blow-outs that would otherwise have occurred in that deteriorating confidence environment.</para><para>The ALP, by contrast, announced back in 1996—and I put it squarely on the record on this occasion in this debate in that year—that there was another way, another way to return to surplus within that time frame which would involve a deliberate decision to stimulate growth and jobs or at least maintain the rate and level of activity which prevailed when we were in government, and to have a much more modest—in that context—program of deficit reduction, building up from $1 billion off in the first year to a second billion dollars 
 in the second year and to a third billion dollars in year three.</para><para>What is fascinating about the budget papers this year is that they demonstrate, as no amount of argument from me could, the accuracy of that prediction. Very briefly, the story is this. The government are budgeting this year for a surplus of $2.7 billion. They are getting there by the impact in 1998-99 of $5.4 billion worth of net cuts. That is the effect, in 1998-99, of budget decisions that were made successively over the last three years—1996, 1997 and 1998. If you subtract that $5.4 billion worth of pain from the $2.7 billion surplus which is budgeted for, it will be obvious that you are left with a figure of minus $2.7 billion which is, equally obviously, the no policy change result that would have been the case if the government had not gone down this pain-inflicting path.</para><para>In other words, if Labor had still been in office, if there had been no policy changes since the last Labor budget, we would have been facing a deficit this year of minus $2.7 billion on the government's own figuring. That deficit could, of course—and this is a straight arithmetic conclusion—have been covered by a modest deficit reduction program of $3 billion worth of cuts taking effect this year. I am leaving out of the equation the growth dividend that would in turn have flowed from a less vigorous assault on the national economy which would have allowed the economy to grow faster, jobs to grow faster, more people to pay tax—more revenue and less social security outlays being required as a result. If you take the growth dividend into the equation as well, you are left with the conclusion that we would amply have been able to obtain exactly the same order of magnitude of surplus this year as the government has done, but done so with infinitely less pain to ordinary Australians.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Gareth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GARETH EVANS</name></talker><para>—Labor's credentials to deliver the kind of outcome I was referring to before the dinner break are amply demonstrated by our track record. We inherited in 1983 a budget deficit worth some $25 billion in today's monetary terms and were 
 able, by dint of assiduous, disciplined economic management—but built on the back of jobs and growth rather than savage budget cuts—to translate that into a series of surpluses within four years.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In our last term in office we demonstrated our capacity to grow the economy at a very fast rate, both comparatively speaking internationally and in terms of Australia's previous experience, certainly a full percentage point faster than the coalition have been able to manage in their first two years in office—4.3 in our case compared with 3.2 in theirs. We were also able to generate average employment growth each year of around 2.7 per cent compared with the present 1.6 or worse, which translated into massive job creation and a significant reduction in the unemployment rate which would have produced, we genuinely believe—and the figures demonstrate it—an unemployment rate of about five per cent by the turn of the century with us sitting on about six per cent now and 150,000 more people back in work.</para><para>What story does this budget tell us about Australia's economic future? A lot of that depends on the credibility of the assumptions that lie behind the forward projections in the budget papers. Growth was projected to come back from 3¾ to three per cent this year but that, in turn, was built on a rather optimistic assumption about AMP shareholders kicking up their heels with the windfall gains that would flow from demutualisation—an assumption that may not prove to be justified. It was also based on an assumption about a fairly rapid return to normality of the situation in Asia, with the worst of the Asian economic crisis being well and truly over by the end of the forthcoming financial year—an assumption which has been roundly criticised by a great many commentators who say it is overly optimistic.</para><para>Similarly, employment growth, which lies behind the predicted unemployment rate of 7 per cent—bad though that is—at the end of next year is predicted to increase from 1¼ to 1¾ per cent, but that is at a time when GDP growth is going backwards, as is private consumption and business investment. Frankly, that is not a credible combination of 
 assumptions, unless you assume that productivity is rapidly falling, but the budget papers give no support for any such conclusion.</para><para>Similarly, with the current account deficit, which is an important constraint upon any government, it should be less of a constraint if we were doing something credible about private savings but the government, having broken its promise to implement Labor's superannuation co-contribution in the last budget, has created an environment where there is no hope for any major structural change in the foreseeable future so far as private savings performance is concerned, and that does throw an additional burden on the public sector when it comes to generating savings that are necessary to deal with a serious current account blow-out.</para><para>The situation is gloomy enough with the budget papers predicting a 5¼ per cent deficit average over the year, but even that estimate is perceived by many commentators to be an unduly optimistic one, not least in the light of the Reserve Bank making it clear that it believes the current account deficit will reach six per cent of GDP within a very few months.</para><para>The budget is silent, as our second reading amendment adverts to, when it comes to documenting the likely scale of the election expenditure bribes which will no doubt be part of the government's outlays repertoire in the foreseeable future. Nor, of course, does it say anything about tax proposals and GST in particular, all of which will have a significant impact on the balance of revenue and outlays in the period ahead.</para><para>The assertions which lie behind the Telstra dividend flow in the future are, again, in our judgment, not likely to be realised, with the very real prospect of any saving on public debt interest flowing from the sale of Telstra being well and truly outweighed by the loss of dividends that would otherwise be flowing from Telstra in the period ahead, representing a short-term gain to the community in terms of money available for recurrent expenditure but a very serious long-term loss.</para><para>All of these things are cause for concern, both in the way the government has acted in the past and in the way that this budget, the 
 reasoning behind it and the measures behind it, tell it will operate in the future. It is not a budget for this or any other government to be proud of. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>—Is the amendment seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMULLAN</name><name role="display">Mr McMullan</name></talker><para>—I second the amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3733</page.no><name role="metadata">Kelly, Jackie, MP</name><name role="display">Miss JACKIE KELLY</name><name.id>GK6</name.id><electorate>Lindsay</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise with great delight tonight to support <inline ref="r531">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1998-99</inline> . For me, it is the cherry on top of a very successful first term of a government that is here for the long-term, bringing stability of government. We will see ourselves emerging through the crises in our region with a stronger domestic economy and with competition through South America, South Africa and the Middle East. We will diversify into a range of markets across the world and take our place, once again, in the top 10 nations of the world, which is where Australia should be. I entered politics to see our great nation in that position.</para></talk.start><para>In my time representing Lindsay, short though it has been, we have seen a number of tremendous improvements delivered by this government. We have seen unemployment rates dropping to 7.1 per cent, well below the national average. We have commenced the operation of a backyard cafe for youth in our area, to provide a supervised area in which to hang, under a blanket umbrella of Fusion, which gives them some really good values to guide them through difficult times in their lives. We have seen the successful restart of the Penrith Kitchen, which is a place where people who are hungry can get a meal at lunchtime five days a week, with no questions asked. That is a valuable service which has been lacking in western Sydney.</para><para>We have seen the Claremont Meadows Primary School finally up and operational—$3.3 million went to that school. I remember the former member for Badgerys Creek, Anne Cohen, campaigning long and hard to see that achieved. Finally, the fruits of her labour came through with this government. We saw Glenmore Park High School given $5.5 million to start operations there. The Nepean District Christian School was given assistance with extensions to their school and we saw 
 the dumping of the new schools policy, which was roundly applauded by a lot of the independent schools in my area where low income earners send their children.</para><para>Youth unemployment is trending down. We have seen the lowest interest rates since man walked on the moon. We have seen the lowest inflation since the 1970s and the lowest unemployment for nearly eight years. We have seen government debt reduced by $31 billion—from a debt of $96 billion. We have done all this with three budgets, and this is the key thing for my constituents. We have managed to achieve all of this surplus, with safety and security from the Asian crisis, with no increase in income tax, no increase in company tax, no increase in wholesale sales tax and no increase in petrol tax. I am very proud of my government for achieving that.</para><para>An obvious comparison is the state government in New South Wales where Bob Carr is continually increasing petrol tax, land tax and pokies tax. He is having to tax the people of New South Wales more and more because he cannot stay within his budget. He cannot spend only what he is currently taking in. He always overspends and consequently has to sell assets in order to cover his deficits, or he raises taxes. People in my area have been hit very hard by that. The average resident in Lindsay would spend $36 each week for a tank of fuel. Averaged out across 50,000 residents, that is $5 per tank, $250,000 per week or $12 million per year. We have seen none of those taxes spent on the roads in western Sydney. Clearly, that state policy needs to be looked at. We will be looking to Bob Carr to give us our fair share of that money.</para><para>We have seen increased funding to hospitals in New South Wales, yet they want more. The state government has been unable to reduce hospital waiting lists, as they promised, and they come back and say that it is a federal government problem. We have given them money, we have given them the means to do it, but still western Sydney gets half the dollars per capita that inner city residents get.</para><para>Further evidence of Bob Carr's Sydneyccentricity is the fact that he is seeking $200 million to tear down an apparently ugly 
 building near the Opera House which has been nicknamed `the toaster'; whereas in western Sydney he will not spend $200 million to raise the dam wall and reduce the danger of flooding. Instead, we are sent glossy little brochures telling us how to live in a flood plain. It is not the type of treatment that people in western Sydney deserve. It is not the type of treatment that the federal Liberal government has given them during our term in office. I certainly would like to see that changed around on a state basis as well.</para><para>Lindsay predominantly has families which are raising young children, sending them off to school and paying a mortgage. For example, a family with one breadwinner earning $40,000 a year and with two children one of whom is under five will be advantaged by about $900 a year in the Howard government's family tax initiative. If they have private health insurance, they will be eligible for a maximum private health insurance rebate of $450 a year. They will be able to take advantage of the savings rebate of $450 a year. They will be able to receive the rebate for spouse superannuation contributions of up to a maximum of $540 a year. In addition to that, if they have a mortgage of $100,000, the reductions in interest rates which the government has brought about will mean a saving of about $3,800 a year. All of that totals $6,140 a year for the average family in Lindsay.</para><para>We are better off because of the efforts of this government. As has been pointed out by the Prime Minister on numerous occasions, and by our Treasurer (Mr Costello), the people of Lindsay are up to $6,000 better of because the policies of this government have focused on mainstream issues and not been diverted by one-issue wonders and throwing money away chasing votes. We have stuck to mainstream issues. We have delivered on unemployment, health, education and on issues of concern to people in my electorate. No matter what their union membership, ethnicity or sex, we have delivered for the people of Lindsay.</para><para>We have seen the opposition try to make a big thing of child care in my area—a very 
 important issue. There are 27 private child-care providers in Lindsay who have been unaffected by the cuts to the operational subsidy—in effect, an unfair subsidy given to council centres which enabled them to compete against the private centres on an unlevel playing field.</para><para>The private sector is up and running, and is very viable right across Australia. Seventy per cent of parents using long day care centres are utilising private centres. So it has been successful right across Australia, and it will be so in Lindsay—only we need a bit of foresight, a bit of consultation and a bit of application from Penrith City Council to see that these transitions are made and that, with regard to the money going back into parents' pockets, they have a greater choice as to where and how they spend it.</para><para>There are now 83,000 more child-care places available across Australia, and they are not just in long day care centres. We have got occasional care, ASHC and family day care centres. In fact, a family eligible for the maximum rate of child-care assistance would receive $107.50 a week for a child in a full-time place in a long day care centre. This represents $5,600 a year, or $12,300 a year for two children. That is the amount of child-care assistance that this government is giving families that seek child-care assistance. So it is available, and I think the misinformation scare campaign run by the opposition is indicative of their attitude right across the board when they do not have a policy or a platform. It is simply a case of `back to the future—2 March 1996'.</para><para>We have seen a backtracking on policy that does not take Australia forward; it shows absolutely no vision for this nation. We have delivered on a vision as to where we want to be. In one term, we have put Australia back on track, back in the black, to where we want to be. We are heading for a great new era of dynamic domestic growth, an era of competition not just in Asia but throughout all the emerging markets in our region. We are seeing this done with no increases in tax, and with being able to stay within our expenditure.</para><para>This bill is further evidence of the government's commitment to the people of Australia, a commitment to make this a great nation and to take us out of the very dark era of 13 years of Labor, when we had `a recession we had to have', and when we had small business being told, `This is as good as it gets.' It is now pretty, pretty good, and it is going to get better. I commend the bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>3735</page.no><name role="metadata">Hatton, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HATTON</name><name.id>LN6</name.id><electorate>Blaxland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—</para></talk.start><para>We are the hollow men</para><para>We are the stuffed men</para><para>Leaning together</para><para>Headpiece filled with straw.

Eliot's poem <inline font-style="italic">The Hollow Men</inline> , written in 1925, the first section of which I just quoted, would amply stand as a symbol for this coalition government, for this budget which they have just brought down and for the two budgets preceding it.</para><para>This is a budget of hollow men, of stuffed men, those who whisper dryly to the electorate at large. They have not delivered substance, they have not delivered certitude. They have not delivered, certainly, security, stability or safety for this community in which we are living. The budget we see before us tonight is the end product of the two prior budgets. 	One of the other `s' words that the coalition government has used, the surplus `s' word, is based upon the cuts that were made in the 1996 budget and the 1997 budget. We see here in this current budget the end product of those cuts. We see also a situation 
 where the fundamental philosophies of this government have come into play.</para><para>I note that in the <inline font-style="italic">Budget overview and economic outlook</inline> produced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Treasury in relation to this budget, they make this point: the government had promised and delivered on a return to surplus in its first parliamentary term. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the long history of this Commonwealth, coalition governments have delivered surplus budgets just once—in 1998-99. They have never previously delivered a surplus budget. During our term in office, Labor in fact delivered four surplus budgets. In all of the accounting that the Treasurer does, in all of the comparisons, he leaves that fact out—that there were four Labor surpluses and this government has achieved merely one. 	He likes to present his situation—having achieved a surplus based on pain and racking the entire electorate for the last two years over their three budgets—as a great achievement and neglects to represent truthfully what the situation was with our prior surpluses, which were delivered in a much more socially responsible manner.</para><para>This government projects that there will be further surpluses over the period 2001-2002. But all of the budget figurings that have been put forward, the central ones that we are dealing with in these budget papers, are open to severe question. They are not merely open to severe question with regard to what was previously described by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) as the firestorm that was awaiting us from the situation in Asia, but they are reflected in whether that growth rate that has been predicted—a growth in real GDP of three per cent—is sustainable, given that the major impacts on Australia and on Australia's trade position have not yet been fully felt. Those major impacts will come later this year, running into next year.</para><para>This budget is also predicated on a presupposition that the government will reduce unemployment in this next period. Given the problems in the Asian economy and elsewhere, both the projected growth rate and the employment projections have been questioned by economists from one end of the land to the other. They have also been directly questioned 
 by members of the Labor Party, by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), because these figures are rubbery, these figures are fudged and this surplus is fudged.</para><para>One of the major elements which has been entirely left out but which is at the core of this budget is the expectation that many tens of billions of dollars will be raised by the sale of the last two-thirds of Telstra—a figure of about $45 billion. Those figures need to be taken into account when you are looking at the base of this budget. There is nothing certain about that sale because the legislation has not gone through here. There is nothing certain about the sale because it is also predicated on the re-election of a coalition government. That will come to the test in the next couple of months.</para><para>But if we look a bit closer at the budget figures in these papers before us, there are increases in estimated revenue. PAYE taxpayers will pay an additional $5.18 billion to the Taxation Office—that is an increase of 8.4 per cent. There is an increase in indirect taxes of an additional $1.2 billion—or 3.8 per cent. Today in question time, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made a great deal of Labor's taxation policy and the taxation system that, he said, Labor was wedded to in its period in office and prior to that. The taxation policy that existed during the Labor period in office is the same taxation policy, with some modifications, that this government has operated for its first two years in office.</para><para>This government reveals in these papers that it will take an extra $5.18 billion, or an 8.4 per cent increase, from pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. It states directly that it will increase indirect taxation by 3.8 per cent—raising additional revenues of $1.2 billion. Is the Prime Minister really saying that the current taxation system is invalid? That taxation system has a long heritage and he is now so intent on criticising it. Is he saying that in this last financial year and the one before that—in the two years in which he has been in office—all the moneys raised by this government, both directly and indirectly, were invalidly raised and effectively should be 
 given back to the people because the taxation system is not as he wants it? I would guess not, but you would not know from the Prime Minister's demeanour at question time in regard to this issue.</para><para>His whole depiction of our taxation system, which is the other large element that has been left out of most of the budget papers because his package is to come later, is of an unsustainable taxation system. He makes the key point that something needs to be done about bracket creep. Time and time again during Labor's period in office, the bracket creep was adjusted. If Labor comes back to government, we will do exactly the same thing again. This is a system that has worked well over the period of this Commonwealth, and it has worked well because people have moderated and adjusted it according to the circumstances of the time.</para><para>If one casts one's mind back to the Treasurer's performance on budget night, to that broken-backed speech using the extended metaphors of the road and the journey which he launched in this place, my impression was that, if you listen very closely to what he said, if you listen closely to what this government has done over the two previous budgets, this falls very clearly into focus as a pre-election budget.</para><para>The Treasurer wrote the speech himself in that broken-backed and cliched manner. But what was he attempting to do? He was attempting to dress up the measures that are involved in these budget packages by using boosterism. The key element of boosterism that one needs to look at—its basic fault—was probably best analysed by Vance Packard when he did a study of advertising generally and advertising in Australia. His key subtext was that, if you look at the advertisers and the manner in which they operate, they are trumpeters of nothingness. They trumpet very loudly, but what they trumpet has not much worth or substance. So when the Treasurer trumpets his great triumphs over the past two years or more and in the three budgets that he has brought down, they are built on the back of what was done by previous governments—previous Labor governments.</para><para>He has built on the back of those. He effectively has built on the backs of giants and taken pygmy steps forward. But the boosterism and the trumpeting are there very loudly because he wants to disguise the fact that these three budgets have heavily cut into the services available to the Australian people. He wants to disguise the fact that over his three budgets—and if he gets another chance, in the next one to come—he has saved amounts of money, including that $400 million which was there in the forward estimates to be used by the Commonwealth government to enable older people to have their dental problems fixed and which was cut out in the 1996 budget. The Treasurer saved those amounts of money in the forward estimates and he obliterated that program that was allowed for in Labor's forward estimates.</para><para>This is a Treasurer who would seek not only to cut services directly but also to cut as widely and as deeply as possible. That has not happened much in this budget because it happened in the previous two. The $2.7 billion surplus that he has trumpeted to the nation is built upon the savage cuts that were there in the 1996 budget.</para><para>This is a Treasurer, and also a government, who would wish to eat the future. Tim Flannery's book <inline font-style="italic">The Future-Eaters</inline> gives us a picture of Australia as it used to be and what the effect of overexploitation was, where Australia's megafauna was killed off, eaten out and exploited. What we face very shortly—and it is told in this budget story—is that Australia's current megafauna, the biggest business that we have in this country, Telstra, has already been one-third whipped away into private hands and this government would seek to undergird what it is doing by selling away into private hands and to private benefit the key industry and key monopoly that this government and the Australian people at large own.</para><para>So the government wishes to do two things which will form part of the basis of this: to impose a GST and to flog off the greatest monopoly that we still have in this country. This is a pre-election budget to walk softly, softly to that election. It is an attempt to moderate the savagery and viciousness of the 
 cuts that were made, particularly in 1996, to buy off the elderly, particularly those retired people who are, at least in part, financing their circumstances, and it is an attempt to curry and win favour with them by giving them some small baubles.</para><para>For this country, this land and all those people who have been deprived and cut down by what this Treasurer and this Prime Minister have done, the prospects are bleak. The prospects are not good because the ability to survive, prosper and deal with challenges that are there have been dramatically decreased over the past three budgets.

This is the party that sold the Commonwealth Bank; this is the party that sold that great icon of Australia, Qantas. I have a little story about that. A constituent rang up the other day and asked my office manager which aircraft I flew on. She said, `She is flying on Ansett today.' The woman said, `Well, that's terrible; she should fly on Qantas—the people's airline.' It fell to my office manager to tell my constituent that, unfortunately, it was the Labor Party that sold off the people's airline. So, please, let us not hear any more about the sale of Telstra or have these crocodile tears, because the member for Blaxland knows that they will sell Telstra as soon as they get into government. Or is that another one of those promises like the tax cuts, the l-a-w that the previous holder of the seat of Blaxland promised the Australian people?</para><para>I pick up on the failure of the member for Blaxland to actually recognise what this budget has done for Australia and what the situation would have been in Australia if the Labor Party was still in government. The Labor Party consistently ran up deficits. They left Australia with a $96 billion deficit. They got away with it in 1996 but since then we have had the Asian crisis. What would have happened to Australia in the wake of the Asian crisis if the Labor government were still in office with their big spending habits? Would Australia be as secure and as stable today as it is were we to have had another Labor budget, another three Labor budgets? The shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), knows that that is not the case.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMULLAN</name><name role="display">Mr McMullan</name></talker><para>—Ha, ha, ha!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CU4</name.id><name role="metadata">Gallus, Christine, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs GALLUS</name></talker><para>—We have some laughter from the member for Canberra.

If the shadow minister at the table does not find that impressive, how do you think we would have fared in the Asian crisis were it otherwise? I move on to Commonwealth net interest payments.

On the inflation rate, under this government we have brought the Treasury underlying rate down from 3.3 per cent to 1.5 per cent. This has enabled this government to have the lowest interest rates—certainly in my memory. The banks' housing rate has gone from 10.5 per cent down to 6.7 per cent. The prime rate for business has gone from 10.75 per cent down to 8.45 per cent. These are the important fundamentals that have kept Australia on a steady course through what could otherwise have been an extraordinarily difficult time for us.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the paper today we saw a warning of what might yet happen in New Zealand—and the New Zealand dollar has devalued further than the Australian dollar to this date and the warning is that it could go into a much greater decline, and in fact maybe even a free-fall. We are not seeing those concerns about Australia. We are not seeing them because this Treasurer (Mr Costello) and this government have brought Australia into a solid, stable position for the future where we can withstand the sorts of shocks that we have had from South-East Asia in the last year and which we will continue to have as the aftershocks go into 1999 and beyond.</para><para>I realise that time is limited tonight, but I would like to mention some of the specific positive parts of this budget, moving away from the overall strong position this budget has placed us in here in Australia which is the rock on which we will build for future generations. Within the budget we also looked at some of the more specific problems of smaller groups in Australia, and in particular I would like to mention what we have done in the budget for the elderly.</para><para>The elderly are a particular interest to me because I have a very `old' electorate in terms of the age of the people in my electorate. At one stage I think I did have the `oldest' aged electorate in Australia. I am not sure if I still hold that prize but certainly it is one of the oldest. So what we did in the budget for older Australians is of particular interest to me. Prior to the budget, two of the most frequent calls that I had to my office concerned, firstly, ex-servicemen who did not have access to the gold card but who felt that in their old age, because they had served Australia, perhaps they deserved such a card; and, secondly, from self-funded retirees.</para><para>At this stage I would like to pay tribute to the self-funded retirees of Australia. These are people who have put funds away for their old age. They have worked, they have saved and they have said, `We will fund our own retirement. We will not go to the government and ask it to fund our retirement, we will fund our own.' In doing so they have helped all Australians, but some of them have suffered. They have suffered because they find that, even though they have an income that is the same as or slightly above that of a pensioner, they do not have access to the cheaper pharmaceuticals that the pensioners have. This has cost them dearly and they have felt worse off.</para><para>In this budget we recognised this, and for the first time self-funded retirees at a certain income level have been given the Commonwealth seniors card. That has been extended to a very generous rate—$67,000 for a couple and $40,000 for a single, I believe. That is something that I personally applaud on behalf of the senior people in my electorate.</para><para>In conclusion, may I mention the $280 million staying at home package to help elderly Australians stay in their homes, stay out of nursing homes and get the sort of care they need. Finally, I mention the free flu vaccine for people over 65 which will start in 1999. I commend an excellent budget to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3739</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MOSSFIELD</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). In doing 
 so, can I say that the extent to which the three Howard-Costello budgets have hurt battling Australians can be seen by comparing the raw figures from each of the three budgets.</para></talk.start><para>When you do that, you find that, in health, you have a net loss of $1.62 billion. In education, you have a net loss of $2.99 billion. In aged and community care, you have a net loss of $399 million. In spite of the remarks by the previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), I do not think the aged care community has done very well at all out of the three Howard-Costello budgets. In child care, there is a net loss of $798 million. In employment programs, there is a net loss of $1.49 billion. Over these three budgets, over $7 billion has been cut from these programs. No wonder battling Australians are hurting.</para><para>Even the business community in western Sydney was disappointed that the 1998 federal budget did not provide the finance to complete the western Sydney orbital road system. Indeed, this was a major issue in my electorate, one that got most of the coverage in the local press. I have spoken previously in this parliament about the need to complete this road network to ensure the full development of cross-regional links between employment zones and regional centres in western Sydney. There is now an urgent need to complete this road network to allow full development of industry in western Sydney and to ensure that this region benefits economically both during and after the Olympic Games.</para><para>The existing road network out from Sydney's CBD is radial and lacks direct cross-regional links between employment zones and regional centres. High levels of congestion are increasingly being experienced on the existing freight corridors serving greater western Sydney, including the M4, the M5 and the Cumberland Highway. The capacity of the M4 has already been reached, with 4,200 vehicles at peak hour traffic times. This congestion is threatening the competitiveness of industry and commerce located in greater western Sydney due to insufficient freight movements and longer transport travelling times.</para><para>If real industrial and commercial development is to be achieved, attention needs to be paid to the movement of freight both within greater western Sydney and to the major terminals at Port Botany and Kingsford Smith Airport and to the rail terminals at Chullora and Enfield. The federal Labor government recognised the western Sydney orbital between the M2 at Seven Hills and the M5 at Preston as part of the future national highway link through Sydney. As such, its funding is the responsibility of the federal government. The western Sydney orbital is estimated to cost $800 million to build to national highway standards with a divided carriageway and graded separated intersections over its 43-kilometre length.</para><para>The previous federal government, in its May 1995 budget, committed $260 million to commence the construction of the first stage of the orbital between Preston and Cecil Park. Construction was to start in 1996. Additionally, in August 1995, the then federal Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), committed $220 million for the second stage of the orbital between Cecil Park and the M4 at Eastern Creek. Construction was to start in 1998. This federal government has reneged on these commitments.</para><para>In November 1996, the then federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), announced that the federal government had set aside only $109 million over five years towards restructuring works comprising environmental assessment, land acquisition and other planning activities. Based on advice from the federal minister at the time, the New South Wales government has included $7 million in the New South Wales budget for the proposed orbital in 1997-98. However, the federal government has yet to announce its funding allocation for this project.</para><para>The capacity and efficiency of the existing transport network to service commercial vehicles and freight movements affect the completion of the economic development of a region. Greater western Sydney has a population of 1.6 million. It has a gross national product of $35 million and produces 
 10 per cent of New South Wales's agricultural output, yet it has not one freeway standard cross-regional road.</para><para>Road transport is a major contributor to the distribution industry. New and expanding industries are increasingly seeking proximity to major road networks to reduce transport costs. Development in technology also leads to companies locating near industries and local markets rather than close to their own headquarters. There is also a need to take into account the likely trends in freight demand based on future industrial growth, changes in freight activity, such as just-in-time centralised distribution, cross-docking, outsourcing of transport and distribution processes, smart warehousing and electronic freighting.</para><para>The region's business community has identified the completion of what is termed the arterial road grid, consisting of the existing M4, the Cumberland Highway, both Windsor Road and Old Windsor Road, the M2 under construction and the western Sydney orbital, as essential to western Sydney's economic development. Funding for the upgrading of the Cumberland Highway announced in this budget was welcomed, but more needs to be done.</para><para>I now move on to another area of the budget. Within its budget papers, the coalition government has detailed its exposure to bank borrowing to finance its planned waterfront redundancies. We know, according to the newspaper this morning, that there is some doubt about whether those redundancies will proceed or whether the government will honour its commitment. But, essentially, the government has established its own company, to be called the Maritime Industry Finance Company, MIFCo, which will establish, under Commonwealth guarantee, a loan facility of up to $250 million. These loans are to be repaid by the levies on stevedoring companies of $12 per container and $6 per vehicle. These arrangements allow the minister to authorise payments that are directly or indirectly connected with the reform and restructuring of the stevedoring industry.</para><para>MIFCo establishes a slush fund to allow the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) to dictate terms to the 
 stevedoring industry, including the employment of non-union labour. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business says the potential benefits of waterfront reform are of vital significance to our national interest. I would ask him for some efficient modelling on this point. Seeing we are talking about efficiency, let him show the Australian public how efficient government ministerial decision making is. If he cannot do this, we should sack all the frontbench.</para><para>Can the minister tell this House, for every job lost on the waterfront and the loss of the economic multiplier of a waterfront wage, where the new jobs will be created? Will they be on the basis of one for one, or on the basis of one part-time or one casual job for each two jobs lost on the waterfront? Will the real result just be increased unemployment?</para><para>The minister refers to the position when his government came into office in 1996. Let us look at what had been achieved on the waterfront up to that point. Between 1989 and 1992, under the Labor Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, container rates increased by almost 50 per cent. Ship turnaround times almost halved. Fifty-seven per cent of the waterfront work force took voluntary redundancy. Does the government acknowledge this important fact? It does not. Labor introduced enterprise bargaining which, together with new investment, has contributed further significant gains to productivity in the past couple of years. Because these improvements were negotiated without forced sackings and blazing headlines, the general public may not be aware of the extent of these productivity improvements, but the government most certainly is aware and its silence is to be condemned.</para><para>Another point to be remembered in this issue is that the government was clearly involved in the planning and implementation of the sacking of Patrick's unionised work force. We do not have to go any further to drive this point home than to recall—as you will recall yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Forrest—that on midnight of 7 April Patrick's operations, with paramilitary precision, moved in with security guards hidden by balaclavas and accompanied by guard dogs. They closed 
 Patrick's ports all over the country and sacked and removed the company's unionised work force. The next day, as you and I will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, at 9.31 a.m.—nine hours and 31 minutes later—the minister was moving the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998  and he was being patted warmly on the back by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) for his efforts.</para><para>This swift action was in clear contrast to the government's refusal to assist other workers who had been retrenched for a range of economic and industrial issues. In some cases, these were very similar to the way the Patrick's work force were sacked. The Cobar miners found that they were employed by an insolvent subsidiary of a wealthy multinational and would not get their entitlements. Where was Minister Reith on this issue? Deathly silent. The Tasmanian employees of food company Simplant discovered that they had been transferred without warning into the employ of one of the world's largest hire companies, Manpower. Where was Minister Reith on this issue? Deathly silent. Another case was the Gilbertson abattoir workers at Grafton, who lost $3 million in entitlements after they were transferred from the parent company to a stripped down subsidiary which went broke. Where was Minister Reith on this issue? Deathly silent. The Woodlawn mine, not far from Canberra, is another example of workers being caused massive distress and a loss of income and entitlements. Where was Minister Reith on this issue? Deathly silent.</para><para>Another spin-off of the legislation that this parliament needed to consider—and, indeed, the public will consider at the next election—was the intention to use public money to promote political agendas. The government did not have it in its heart to assist the Cobar, Woodlawn or Grafton retrenched workers. The government removed $500 million from aged care and $800 million from child care in its first two budgets. It did, however, feel for the battling consultants, particularly those with Liberal Party connections. The government was prepared to spend $1.3 million of taxpayers' money to pay 11 consultants for one single project to destroy the MUA.</para><para>The question is now being asked by the Australian work force, as it was in an excellent article by Lester Loble in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 27 April. Are we seeing on the Australian waterfront today this country's version of the American industrial relations system that Ronald Reagan introduced in 1982 when he fired striking air traffic controllers? I will quote from this excellent article:</para><para>Reagan sent a signal to American companies that they could follow suit and they did—replacing unionised workers with lower paid employees once virtually unheard of, has remained popular since Reagan's initial sacking.</para><para>The article continues:</para><para>Like Chris Corrigan, American companies also declare bankruptcy to avoid existing union contracts and forced workers in the queue with other creditors. On top of losing their jobs employees often get only a minimal redundancy package.</para><para>Even their earned superannuation benefits have been slashed in some cases. After reorganisation the company can pick up where it left off, but with a new work force.</para><para>These are only a few quotes from an excellent article which shows the path we are following under this government's deliberate move to make job insecurity the cornerstone of its industrial policy.</para><para>But even prior to the waterfront, there were many policies of this government that were leading to job insecurity for ordinary Australians, and I will mention some of them. We had retrenchments in the Public Service which, according to the Prime Minister prior to the election, were to number only 2,500 but finished at 77,400—74,900 more than made in a core promise to get public service votes. We had growth in part-time and casual work at the expense of full-time work, with the erosion of award conditions and workers sitting by the phone waiting for the call to perform four hours work. We had the privatisation of the CES and the creation of Employment National and a raft of private employment agencies whose role will be to make a quick buck out of the unemployed.</para><para>There is the situation of a long-term unemployed husband whose wife is working. He gets no assistance from Employment National and is told, as one of my own constituents 
 was told, to join the queue until they had dealt with the money making customers. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you would not support that sort of practice, yet this is what ordinary Australians are facing because of this government's three budgets.</para><para>I will conclude on this point. I think it was the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) who said in his speech on the budget last night that one of his constituents was moved to tears by this budget. I can say that many of my constituents of Greenway were also moved to tears, but they were not tears of joy; they were tears of pain. An example is the lady from Kings Langley, a suburb in my electorate, who rang me because she could not get her child into a local community health service for much needed speech therapy because they had closed their books because of a shortage of funds. The lady's comment was that it is not much good having a surplus if you cannot get adequate health care for your family.</para><para>I will leave the last word on this budget to a Mr Bill Johnston from Centacare's Social Policy Research Unit, who said:</para><para>It would seem that in a short space of time we have become a divided nation in wealth, in insecurity of employment, in human cohesion, with an underlying values vacuum in public life.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3743</page.no><name role="metadata">Katter, Bob, Jnr, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KATTER</name><name.id>HX4</name.id><electorate>Kennedy</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The previous speaker, the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), had some good points to make, but the note on which he finished was most extraordinary, because the architect of all of those things was his great leader, Mr Keating. Enterprise bargaining was introduced by Mr Keating—and I must say that I thought at first that it would be very good. But it seems to me that it has to moved to become a mechanism by which our wage structures will be driven down to the lowest common international denominator in South America or parts of Africa. But that was introduced not by this side of the House but by the ALP side of the House. And it is something that the electorate will remember forever.</para></talk.start><para>The second point he made in conclusion was the MUA and the introduction of scab labour. I am sorry, the precedent was created 
 by your great and glorious leader, only the ex-head of the ACTU, Mr Hawke, and his lieutenant, Mr Keating. They fast-tracked foreign scabs into this country to break the pilots strike. So do not let anyone from the ALP ever have the hide to stand up in this place and condemn us as a coalition for policies which were first introduced by the ALP, the supposed representatives of the employee class in Australia.</para><para>There are two imperatives that should be looked at continually in this budget, one of which is unemployment. I think that, before the last election, Minister Kemp quoted the real unemployment figures at around 19 per cent. Dr Quiggin, the only economist ever to receive the Academy Of Science prize for Australia, also quoted the figure as being at around 18 or 19 per cent. The chairman of the economics caucus of the ALP, Mr Langmore—and he was sacked for this by Mr Keating—also quoted the real unemployment figures as being at around 19 per cent.</para><para>But if you have a careful look at the OECD reports on Australia, I think you would agree that the real figure is around 19 per cent. While it has shifted downward somewhat under the current government, there is no doubt that the figure is still pretty close to 19 per cent. So when you have a real unemployment figure of around 19 per cent, you have  the most serious of problems.</para><para>If you have a current account deficit of around $20 billion a year and you reflect upon the fact—and it is a fact I often hear in this place—that the entire accumulated debt of this country up to 1983 had amounted to only $22 billion and we have been running over that, on average, for the last four years, then you have a very serious problem indeed. In fact, the current account deficits of some countries that are now supposedly in trouble are comparable if not inferior to that of Australia.</para><para>Bankruptcies for the last half year, for which I have figures for September and December quarters of last year, were probably the highest in Australian history, with the exception, I think, of 1991-92. They were certainly among the worst in Australian history. Bankruptcies have been on the rise 
 again, but I do not blame in any way the current government. There is no doubt that these things are an overhang from the last government.</para><para>But the fact is that bankruptcies are at historically high levels. If you have unemployment hovering in real terms at around 19 per cent, if you have an absolutely critical current account deficit, and if you have on top of that a situation where bankruptcies—the business class, if you like, as opposed to the employee class—are running at historically worst records in Australian history, then you have a very serious situation indeed.</para><para>There is one statistic on which we are very much out of kilter with the rest of the world. I refer the House to page 114 of Budget Paper No. 1. It is the general government net debt ratio to GDP. While the United States figure is around 45 per cent, the European Union is around 58 per cent and the OECD is around 43 per cent, Australia is way down on a minuscule 17 per cent. So we can afford—and this to many people will be heresy—some more government debt. We are a million miles behind the comparable debt levels of the OECD, the European Union, the United States and Japan. If we are a mile behind, that gives us some latitude in being able to borrow.</para><para>But our side of politics is constantly terrified of government borrowing because of what the last government did. They borrowed that money. The best example by far in Australian history is the Whitlam government. They borrowed massive amounts. They rolled up budget deficits which were unheard of in Australian history. In 2½ years, they doubled spending by the Australian government. What they spent that money on was socially highly desirable objectives. They spent it on free universities, doubling the pensions and numerous other items of that nature. So one cannot question the social desirability. Whether the country could afford such socially desirable objectives was an entirely different matter. And, of course, it could not. It went into destruction mode. In one quarter, inflation went to an annual rate of 26 per cent. Everything in this country collapsed. There is 
 hardly a graph that you can look at that did not recover after the Whitlam years.</para><para> The second thing that characterised Mr Whitlam was a 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cut in Australia. The people that took the biggest knock were the Australian workers. They were the people that took the brunt of those 25 per cent tariff cuts which saw cheap imports flood into this country and wipe out the manufacturing sector. Here was a man well before his time. Here was an economic rationalist before the term was even conceived. But if he was an economic rationalist, then most certainly the father and the locomotive of that particular philosophy—and, I would say, of that pernicious set of policies—was none other than Mr Keating, the man who took Labor to the worst defeat in Australian history.</para><para> If our side of the House were to pursue the course and the policies of that period, we could look forward to the same annihilation at the polls. There is a situation in this country where hardly any worker has a secure job. There is hardly a business in this country that has a secure future attached to it. This is not the doing of this government, but this government does have the power to turn this around. It does have some borrowing available to it. If it chooses to borrow that money, then we must hope and pray that it is not spent upon self-indulgence, it is not spent upon social goals which may be very highly desirable; it must be spent on the driving locomotive of the economy, which is farming and manufacturing.</para><para> As Alan Jones said recently on his television program—I rang him up and went to the trouble of thanking him, and I must say that he also told me that one ex-ALP minister had also rung that morning to congratulate him—there is something seriously wrong in a country where the only two sectors that cannot secure finance are manufacturing and farming. The great Dr Schacht—probably one of the leading economists in this century's history—took Germany out of the period, amongst many other achievements, where they needed wheelbarrows of money to get on a bus. He was sacked by that dreadful man, Mr Adolf Hitler. But before Dr Schacht was 
 sacked by that monster he took control of the German economy, and there was not a single cent that was allowed to go into speculation or predatory practices.</para><para>It is a great joy to have in the House the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly). In her first speech she referred to the fact that money had to be taken away from people and big corporations indulging in predatory practices. There are great monsters out there such as Woolworths and Coles. It seems to me that these people will never rest until every single small business in this country has ceased to exist and is owned or controlled or operated by them.</para><para> Money is taken away for predatory practices, and there are numerous scenarios: I will build a bigger shopping centre than you have and yours will be empty and mine will be full; I will build a taller high-rise than you and then yours will be empty and mine will be full; or I will buy this beautiful home and I will pay a hell of a lot of money and we will sell real estate, as the rich people in Australia do, backwards and forwards to each other knowing that the real estate values will continue to climb. That is where Australia's finance is going. It is almost exclusively directed into those areas and was directed into those areas for almost 13 solid years under Mr Keating.</para><para> We as a government must turn that around. That finance must be redirected into the areas of manufacturing and farming, into the areas of development. I used the German model. I could also refer to the New Deal economists in the United States as another wonderful model. When that was done in Germany, unemployment dropped from six million down to 400,000. Industrial production doubled and agricultural production increased by 60 per cent in the space of four short years. Alan Jones had it dead right. There are two sectors of this economy which cannot access finance: manufacturing and farming. Believe me, I am in a position to speak with very great authority on those areas.</para><para> If the member for Dawson were to have the Urana dam built in her area, if the Hells Gate dam were to be built in my area and the Ravenshoe dam outside of Cairns, we are 
 talking about $1,500 million a year in income for this country from two relatively small projects. When I say `relatively small', I mean $1,000 million in a budget of $136,000 million. If I am a businessman and someone comes up to me and says, `Would you please give me $1,000 million and I will give you a return of $500 million a year on that investment, with total absolute security,' then I would not let them out the door.</para><para>Yet that is what we in North Queensland are saying to this government. We are saying, `Just give us that $1,000 million. We will repay it to you within three years and you will also get $500 million a year in tax revenue forever, because the $1,500 million that will be made each and every year out of those farms and their export earnings for this country will have a tax yield upon of it $500 million. But because we will turn land worth $50 a hectare into land worth $5,000 a hectare, we can simply sell that land and pay you back for giving us that money.'</para><para> In conclusion, there is one wonderful thing in this budget and one wonderful thing about the policies of the current Australian government—that is, the fact that, unlike the last government, when the dollar falls, they do not hit the panic button and race out there to try to artificially prop it up. The argument used by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that this has protected us against some of the problems that have occurred north of us is very right.</para><para>I must also add that a lower dollar compensates us somewhat for the removal of our tariffs, makes us internationally competitive, gives us some protection against imports and also enables the interest rates to be very low. That is a wonderful thing for Australia. The last government continuously had this absolute commitment to a high dollar for reasons that I do not know. That has been damaging to the economy in itself. Interest rates that soared above 20 per cent were devastating to the economy of Australia. Those things have stopped in this country. For that, people from the electorate of Kennedy must be very truly and sincerely grateful.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3745</page.no><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name><name.id>BV5</name.id><electorate>Lyons</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) finds strength in the National Socialists of

That in itself can be commendable, but it hides a picture of misery depicted in the country areas of Australia and particularly in Tasmania. Somewhere along the line we have forgotten there are people tied up in all the statistics and budget numbers. These are the people who have tightened their belts and skimped on their purchases in the forlorn hope that, if they battle through, things might get better. They are being promised that, if we sort out the tax situation, everything will be well and they will be back in clover. We now have a great foreign debt, which is quite unacceptable.</para></talk.start></continue><para>While we talk about fiscal consolidation, retirement of debt and budget surpluses, people are asking: what does all that mean to them; why do they have to go through pain; and is pain essential to their living conditions?  This is especially so because this government has put some funds back into this budget, having stripped it away in the last two. But it has also wasted a lot, such as the $1.7 billion rescue package for private health insurance which has now had the effect of dropping private health cover to its lowest level—probably historically—at 31.1 per cent of the population.</para><para>On top of all this, there is the selling of Telstra and the proposed introduction of the GST which will just add costs to ordinary people. The battlers of this country will have 
 less money to spend on the essentials. Why?  What is the government trying to prove—that Australia can become a Third World nation, being plundered for its raw materials and its labour being used as slaves?</para><para>Tasmanians have had enough. They have a state government that is only interested in protecting its skin. Federal Liberal government members are blindly agreeing to cut the heart out of Tasmania and reduce us down even further. The community is saying, `Can't they see what is actually happening to our communities?'</para><para>Mr Howard will come down to Tasmania in the next few weeks and announce some big projects for Tasmania under the Federation Fund. He will make a big splash on the television for a night when he comes down to announce those Federation Fund projects. But we really want to know when is he going to come down and announce some funds for our health system so that our health system can operate in a decent way?  When is he going to announce the funds to assist our schools to be upgraded?  When is he going to announce the funds to build and improve the nursing homes in Tasmania?  When is he going to find some jobs for our young people who are leaving the state in droves?  These are the questions that need answering.</para><para> It is all very well to have an occasional cake, but we really need bread and butter on a regular basis to sustain ourselves. Our country has grown up believing in mateship and cooperation—when someone is down, you give them a helping hand—but this government does not appear to remember that. It is more `the survival of the fittest' and `user pays'.</para><para>This train of thought leads me to what we are doing in this country with the liberalisation of trade. We are being told that we must bring down the barriers, reduce our tariffs and remove our subsidies on our industries—in this way we will have the ability to gain by having free trade in other areas. This could be so, but the only problem is that we need to see what is being gained, and that includes some of our producers.</para><para>Let us look at what is happening to the salmon industry in Tasmania—something very 
 dear to my heart. The World Trade Organisation is insisting that we let in uncooked fish from other parts of the world. If they agree to that in the next round of hearings, then we may well let into the country the fish diseases that come with that fish. How does that help our industry to survive and to grow?  How do we gain by having neighbours such as New Zealand send fish to us?  It might make for a few more varieties of salmon meat on the supermarket shelves, but is our market that good for them? I would have thought it would make far more common sense for us to join together to develop markets in other parts of the world. What is going to be gained here?  I believe that is just another problem that we will have to solve in the long term.</para><para> Then let us have a look at the pork industry. I am sure you have a few pork growers in your area, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. In Tasmania we have farmers closing their farms because of the huge amounts of subsidised pork coming into the country. I do not know how many pork farmers there are in the Northern Territory—probably not very many.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5M6</name.id><name role="metadata">DONDAS</name><name role="display">Mr Dondas</name></talker><para>—Not too many.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name></talker><para>—And there would not be too much grain up there, either, to feed them.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5M6</name.id><name role="metadata">DONDAS</name><name role="display">Mr Dondas</name></talker><para>—We have the grain.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Adams, Dick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ADAMS</name></talker><para>—But subsidised pork is coming into this country. The government, through AQIS, is looking at allowing more to enter from the US and Europe. In the US, they grow it on such a large scale that if it comes here it will certainly swamp our markets and drop the prices to a level where our producers cannot possibly compete. We want to know how this is helping the economy at the moment. Our farmers are trying to compete but they are really running up a hill backwards and blindfolded, and they cannot achieve anything in this marketing situation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>At the same time, there are developments impacting on other areas of rural produce. It does not make sense for us to try to be better than the rest of the world when the playing field is not level. We really do have to make sure it is level for us to compete on an equal basis. Competition policy only works when there really is true equity in the activity as so 
 many other factors come into play—such as environment, climatic conditions, fiscal policies, trade barriers at different stages of removal—that to have Australia trying to be in the front line is somewhat foolhardy. This is particularly so for our primary producers, of whom I have many in my electorate.</para><para>Last week I talked to a pork producer who had moved to the state several years ago. He said he was selling up and moving on, that although he was producing the best pork meat that he had ever produced he could not make a go of it under the present situation with the price he was receiving for his product. That is one individual and his capital leaving our state. He said it was a shame that, although Tasmania's product was of great quality and flavour, it could not develop its market niche because the competition was just too great and the market was being flooded by cheaper and, sometimes, very inferior products. It is no good talking about exports without at least being able to develop our domestic market so that a producer can get established and have some income coming in.</para><para>So what has Tasmania gained from the influx of more pork? It does not seem to have made much difference to pork prices—perhaps they are marginally lower—but if it costs jobs then in the end Tasmania will be the loser. And without jobs, how are people going to buy the pork in the first place? I think this has probably been one of the issues for regional Australia—bigger populations can carry some of these massive changes that have taken place in industries, they can adapt and take other things up, but in lesser populated areas it is very difficult to find something to fill the gaps when you lose either government services or a part of an industry.</para><para>What is happening, and it is happening to so many of our industries, is that there seems to be a stripping of our assets and our ability to compete. No wonder our state budget looks a sorry mess. No wonder the marketplace cannot pick up the gaps when government—at all levels—is selling off some of our traditional activities. The market cannot move as there is no ability for anyone to make any money, so there cannot be any growth activities at all.</para><para>Economically, we have very little room to move in Tasmania, and unless we receive our deserved part of the economic pie we cannot help guide or facilitate new industries while keeping our community services in healthy order. It is not as though Tasmania has no exports. We do. One of the healthiest industries in our state is our fast catamarans. These are being sold all over the world. Because they are successful, the company is able to train many Tasmanian youngsters as part of its staff development program; but the company may not stay in Tasmania if there are no incentives for it to be there.</para><para>Tasmania also has good exports in forestry products, minerals, fine foods, wool products and many other goods. It can compete quite well with these at the moment. But they are not in the business of providing roads, schools, health systems et cetera—that is government's business. We need these healthy industries to generate sufficient funds to look after the other aspects—to create jobs and stimulate the economy.</para><para>Tasmanians are trying to do all this while being handicapped by an unfair distribution of taxes. There are alternatives and there are ways of doing things better. The sooner we can get on and help these regional people in Tasmania the better it will be and the better I will like it in the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3748</page.no><name role="metadata">Dondas, Nick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DONDAS</name><name.id>5M6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note that I am following the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who was speaking about the southernmost part of Australia. I am going to speak tonight about the northernmost part of Australia. And whilst he was speaking about doom and gloom for Tasmania, I can only speak about hope and glory in the Northern Territory. For the Northern Territory, this 1998-99 budget has everything that territorians could expect and I am very disappointed that the honourable member for Lyons can only think about this budget as being something that is not going to help his state of Tasmania.</para></talk.start><para>The honourable member, who is leaving the chamber, did not speak about the budget once. He did not speak about appropriation bills Nos 1 or 2. He covered many other issues in the 18½ minutes or so in which he 
 spoke. I inform him that, in the Northern Territory, $133 million was allocated in the 1998-99 budget for defence and that is a very important part of the territory's economy. Over the last three or four years, even under the Labor government, a policy was put in place that defence funding in the northern part of Australia be maintained.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, you are a member of the same committee that I am a member of and I say to you that I am very pleased that the coalition government is maintaining a thrust for spending and the development of defence facilities in the Northern Territory. This allocation of $133 million will basically give us $65.5 million for the joint army development facility, stage 2, at an overall cost of $268 million; $2.2 million for the joint development facility, stage 1; $20 million for post-structure review development; $10 million for infrastructure works at Bradshaw station; and $500,000 for the north Australia naval infrastructure, stage 1. At RAAF base, Tindal, major works include the fourth stage of base development with $14 million allocated this financial year as part of an estimated total cost of $31 million.</para><para>I could go on about the funding levels for the Northern Territory provided by the coalition government. However, the important point to make is that defence spending will be maintained for this financial year. I am quite sure it will be maintained in the next financial year, because that is part of the government's policy.</para><para>The honourable member for Lyons denigrated his state of Tasmania. Tasmania is a wonderful state and has wonderful opportunities. What the honourable member did not say was that its downturn started when the former premier, young Michael Field, went on the wrong track. He was there for a number of years but he did not develop the state's interests, economy and enthusiasm to maintain a high level of commitment from the citizens of Tasmania. What has happened is that, because there has been a downturn in the economy, people have moved offshore and have returned to the mainland. Tasmania, for its population of 450,000-odd, receives from 
 the Commonwealth per capita funding at a level which is slightly better than the Northern Territory receives. The Northern Territory has, per capita, exports worth probably 1½ times those of Tasmania. I may be corrected on that; it is just an assumption I have.</para><para>In the budget something like $53 million has been made available for roads in the Northern Territory. I understand, from reading the budget papers, that the $53 million is for the upgrading of the Victoria Highway, the Barkly Highway and the Stuart Highway. When we think of the many hundreds of millions that the Commonwealth spends on roads, $53 million may not seem like a lot of money but, in the Northern Territory, it is. It provides the impetus for the upgrading of those roads which, in turn, gives the tourists that drive from Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Queensland the confidence in knowing that at least the territory's roads are being maintained at a national standard.</para><para>I am very happy, obviously, that the Commonwealth government has seen fit to make those funds available. Whilst $53 million may not sound a lot of money in terms of the national budget, it is very important. It certainly helps tourism development in the Northern Territory. The territory has the economy in terms of mining, tourism and exports. It also has a very small manufacturing base. Most members of this parliament would be aware that the Northern Territory has a very good record in exporting live cattle to our Asian neighbours—the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and other Malaysian areas. However, with the downturn in the economic base of our Asian region, cattle exports have slowed down a little, and that is to be expected.</para><para>There may be some debate going on between the Minister for Health in the Northern Territory and the federal Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and some slight disagreement over funding, but I have been advised by the health minister in the Commonwealth government that, in next year's funding, the Northern Territory can expect an increase of 3.8 per cent to its base funding. Whilst there may be some disagree 
 ment between the two ministers, I would support my federal colleague who advises me that the 3.8 per cent is the level of increase in funding that the Northern Territory government can expect.</para><para>Inflation is a very important factor not just for the Australian community but for the Northern Territory community, because we live in isolation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have visited the Northern Territory on many occasions and you know that the tyranny of distance certainly does have an impact on the cost of living in the territory. I refer to freight and other costs associated with its isolation. The direction of the coalition government in maintaining low inflation rates can only be of benefit to the future of the Northern Territory.</para><para>We know that we have had the lowest inflation since 1970. Another very important factor to add to inflation is the lowest housing interest rates for the last two decades or more. In building and housing construction in the Northern Territory, there is always that 10 per cent factor. In outer regions of Australia, it costs more to produce and construct residential dwellings. The low interest rates that the coalition government has been able to maintain have become a very important factor.</para><para>If we look at the economy of the Northern Territory for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 financial years, we see that it is probably outstripping most of the economies in the other Australian states. Growth in the Northern Territory is very high; unemployment is very low. Unemployment in Australia has dropped under the coalition government to just under eight per cent for the first time in eight years, but unemployment rates in the Northern Territory have been below six per cent for the last three years. In other words, we can basically say that the economy of the Northern Territory has been very well blessed by the coalition for the last two financial years. It has given us the opportunity to provide infrastructure and confidence to people in the Northern Territory.</para><para>Unfortunately, because there is a long list of speakers on the government side tonight, we have agreed to limit our time in the debate on  Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1998-99 . All I can say in conclusion is that this is a very 
 good budget for the Northern Territory. I believe it is a very good budget for Australia. We heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) say in question time today—and you and every other member of this place must accept the fact—that it is the first time in our parliamentary history that a government has not increased taxes in any area during its first term. In the 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 budgets, the coalition government has not increased taxes. The people of the Northern Territory are very interested in what the coalition's direction in tax reform is going to be before the next election. But the important thing is that, for the last 2½ years, or for nearly three budgets, this coalition government has not increased taxes.</para><para>In contrast, when the Australian Labor Party came to government it did everything it could to increase taxes which created an impost on our general community in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>3750</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Graeme, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMPBELL</name><name.id>CF4</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is interesting that the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) chided the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) for not talking about <inline ref="r531">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1998-99</inline>  and <inline ref="r533">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1998-99</inline> .

To grant it statehood would have been an absolutely bizarre decision. This budget was, I believe, a clever budget. It brought back the allegiance of the self-funded retirees, and they were certainly in need of being looked after. The damage it did in other areas was very well hidden. However, it was intellectually bereft. It did not do anything towards addressing the crucial problems in Australia of unemployment or the current account deficit.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When the present government was in opposition, it put great store by the current account deficit and said how important it was that we brought this under control—and it is important. Now that they are in government and the current account deficit continues to rise, it is no longer a matter of great importance. The current account deficit will inevitably go on rising until we get back to a manufacturing base in Australia because 87½ per cent of our current account deficit is as a result of the importation of manufactured goods. Without a return to manufacturing, there is no future for South Australia, Tasmania or Victoria. Victoria is finding that casino-led recoveries do not last forever.</para><para>The current account deficit has to be addressed and we need industry to do that. This requires an industry policy. But what do we get? Instead we get this policy of rational economics. The great tragedy here is that this is a policy endorsed by both sides of this parliament. Once Paul Keating swallowed it, it was not hard to get the Liberal Party to swallow it. It looks, sounds and, to some extent, feels like neo-classical economics. It sounds and looks like competition. It has nothing to do with competition because it is the policy for big business.</para><para>Rational economics is not an economic theory; it is a political ideology. It is the ideology of big business, making American big business control world trade when it comes to the baggage of the level playing field. Those are not my words; they are the words of the late Bob Santamaria, and he was absolutely right. It is a political ideology. First, it was swallowed hook, line and sinker by Keating, a man who did this country more damage than most people realise. Then it was followed equally ardently by the Liberal Party.</para><para>Even Hilmer, in his very foolish report, talked about the level playing field where small business must compete with big business. There is only one end to that, that is, the end of small business. Once small business has gone, there will be no competition, no checks or balances on big business. When governments allow 24-hour trading, they squeeze out small business. As the Chairman 
 of Woolworths said, `We are going to increase our turnover by 12½ per cent. We are going to get this off small business. Let's face it; they have to sleep some time.' Once big business has that, they will not want 24-hour trading. They will cut trading hours back because they will have a monopoly. It is a proven fact world over that big business colludes; it does not compete.</para><para>What are we faced with? As a result of this rational economic policy, the latest crisis in the rural sector is in the pork industry. How can this be? It is quite simple, Mr Deputy Speaker: ABARE, a government entity, told pig growers that there was going to be a very big increased demand for pork and they should increase production. Of course, it did not eventuate.</para><para>They then said, `To counter this, we're going to allow in imported pork from Canada.' The truth is that this pork is not coming from Canada; it is coming from farms in the United States—basically, ConAgra farms. It has been shipped across the border to ConAgra processing plants and shipped out here to ConAgra agents. Yet the government—and the previous government would have been no different—is prepared to support multinational interests against the interests of our farmers. Our pig farmers are going to the wall because they followed the dictates of government in the first place and they have got the double whammy of ABARE saying to the government, `Pig imports will amount to no more than 3,900 tonnes.' Mr Deputy Speaker, there were 12,000 tonnes in the first year.</para><para>We could get some semblance of order, some semblance of a level playing field, if we were to say to the Canadians, `Okay, you've got to bring in the whole pig.' But then we would run into a problem because we would be told, `Oh, we can't bring in the whole pig; it's got to be boned out because we're frightened of disease in the bone.' If there is disease in the bone, how do we know it has not got to the meat during processing?</para><para>I think we are being far too casual with our quarantine laws. This is an island and it has protection because it is an island. We should be treasuring that. We should not be watering 
 it down at the behest of some economic rationalist theory. If you concede that point, we should still say to the Canadians, `You must bring in the entire pig, or portions of the entire pig boned out.' This would make their exports much less competitive because they could probably get much more in Canada for the loin meat than they could get here. But here, where leg meat is the prime cut, they are destroying our markets very rapidly.</para><para>It is a real problem. I suggest that because the government has had such a large hand in causing the problem, it should be offering the industry some sort of assistance—either a buy-back program, a pig slaughter program, or putting in place long-term finance so that pig farmers can restructure. It is quite clear that in the eastern states in particular we need to reduce pork meat production, but that is going to take time. You do not just throw your farmers to the wolves.</para><para>Recently, I attended a meeting at which Senator Crane told the gathering of pig farmers, `You've got to think of the beef industry; we want to sell more beef.' The truth is that the Canadians have cut our beef quota—a quota which we have only ever met once—after we had agreed to bring in their pork. Anyone who believes that anyone buys from Australia because they like us is simply naive. The Canadians buy our beef because they cannot get it better or cheaper anywhere else. That is the only reason why anyone ever buys from us.</para><para>A lot of this talk about the importance of GATT is greatly overrated. Remember, the French signed GATT at the same time that we did. Within weeks of signing GATT, they were banning the importation of Norwegian fish on health grounds. I am sure there was nothing wrong with the Norwegian fish, but the Norwegians were lucky—they had an opportunistic, high catch of fish. The French were determined that their farmers were not going to be destroyed by this quirk of nature. So they kept that ban on until things got back to an equilibrium and then they said, `We've reviewed the situation and it's okay now.' There was never any hygiene problem, but the French were determined to look after the interests of their farmers. I only wish govern 
 ments in Australia were prepared to do the same—but, of course, they are not, neither the Labor Party nor the Liberal Party.</para><para>There are other manifestations, such as orange juice. It is quite clear that we have to import half of our orange juice requirements; we simply do not have enough. But we were subjected to dumping from Brazil. It was not Brazilian farmers bringing in orange juice concentrate; it was American agribusiness. They were bringing it in at very low prices. They did not need to do so because they had half the market. But they thought, `We'll bring it in, we'll kill the Australian industry.' They knew that once those trees were pulled out, they would never be planted again.</para><para>What did the NFF—the National Farmers Federation—say? More correctly, it should be called the `no family farmers'. They said to the government, `Yes, rational economic policy decrees that you do this. There are winners and losers. Kill the orange tree growers; tell them to pull out their trees and plant vines.' It is not so long ago that we were telling them to pull out the vines and plant orange trees; now we are telling them to do the reverse. There is no logic, no long- term thinking there.</para><para>The truth is that when you kill off these other agricultural industries, you do not help the beef producers, the wool producers and the wheat producers in my electorate one iota. In fact, you impede them because you destroy the overall aggregate agricultural vote. It is not in their interests at all. We saw the performance of the NFF in respect of the wharves in Australia. This is a thing that I find very galling, because we have it put up to us: `This is the problem we have to fix.' They are not the big problem in Australia. We do too much of that in this parliament.</para><para>We are bringing a bill into this parliament shortly to deny prisoners the vote. Does anyone think this has any material effect on Australia at all—whether or not prisoners vote? Already, prisoners in gaol for more than five years cannot vote. What does taking the vote off them achieve? Why does this parliament waste time on this sort of nonsense? It 
 happens all the time: we fiddle at the edges; we do not address the real needs of this country.</para><para>I want to talk about taxation. The government says it wants a wide-ranging debate on taxation. The government wants nothing of the sort; the government wants a GST. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have both said they want a wide-ranging debate, and they set up a committee to receive submissions on taxation. The Treasurer, despite telling this House to the contrary, has told that committee they are not to accept any submissions at all on debit tax. The Prime Minister was asked about the debit tax on radio the other day and he said, `It's no good, it was tried in Sri Lanka and it didn't work.' I thought that was interesting because I had not heard about it. It is used in Australia; it is used by our state governments and it works very effectively. I got on to the library and I asked them to check it. They said they could find no record of it, so I rang the Sri Lankan High Commission. They said, `No, we've never had a debit tax at all. We think the Prime Minister was confusing it with the aggregate tax we have on production—a turnover tax.'</para><para>A turnover tax is much more akin to a GST than it is to a debit tax, so it is quite clear that the Prime Minister does not understand the concept. The debit tax is quite simple; it postulates this: if you taxed every bank withdrawal at the rate of one-third of a cent in the dollar, you would raise enough money to replace income tax entirely. I said to the Treasurer, `Let's have Treasury look at this; let's have Treasury produce a paper and let them refute this.' I saw a paper recently which said, `Oh, this would be no good, multinationals would avoid it.' Mr Deputy Speaker, multinationals do not pay tax now, but this is a tax that they would not be able to avoid, and they would have very little incentive to avoid it because their money in the bank—which would be tax free—would be worth much more than the tax itself. But it would mean that they would start to pay taxes.</para><para>Of course we have to broaden the tax base. There are lots of ways you can do that with 
 out a GST. You can get more people working—that will broaden the tax base. You can get the large foreign companies to pay tax—that will broaden the tax base. There are two things the government can do straightaway. We have seen the hyperbole that goes on this place—and it happens on both sides. There is no doubt that when the Fraser government was defeated, Mr Howard, as Treasurer, left a very large deficit which was filled by a basic increase in terms of trade and some very careful husbanding on the outlay side by Senator Peter Walsh.</para><para>Undoubtedly, this government also was left with a deficit. How did it fix its deficit? Quite clearly it was done with bracket creep. That is how the deficit was fixed—the inflationary effect of taxation pushed people into higher tax brackets. That, I suspect, is one of the reasons that no government has ever really been keen to address the taxation system—bracket creep is such a little luxury for them. We believe the debit tax should be discussed, and it should be on the table for open discussion. If it can be refuted, all well and good. I am happy to stop supporting it if I am convinced that it simply will not work.</para><para>Of course, the debit tax does have enemies. The tax avoidance industry in this country is worth some $4½ billion a year. They obviously do not like it because they can see their livelihood disappearing. They would have to go and do something constructive. To their credit, I know a lot of accountants who would rather be doing constructive things, but that is one problem. There would not be the need for the very large taxation bureaucracy. We could redirect them to do other things. I do not believe in mass sackings of public servants—I do not see any great point in it—but they could be directed to more fruitful areas. The governments would not particularly like it because the ability to give largesse would be gone. They would not be able to give you tax cuts, because there would not be any to give.</para><para>The economy and society would be much better off. Imagine how you could contain wages if taxes on a worker's wages constituted one-third of a cent in the dollar. Under a debit tax, the worker would not pay his tax. 
 The tax would be paid by the employer and the worker would pay it when he took his wages out of the bank. This tax is simplicity itself. It works for the states, albeit in a fashion which makes it regressive because they put a top limit on it, but I believe it is a tax that is neat and sophisticated.</para><para>It also keeps control on government because every day, if necessary, the banks would collect the tax on behalf of the government. Simply by pressing a button, they could tell you to the cent how much money government has collected. Every month we could have the figures on how much money government is getting in taxation. People would be made aware of the level of taxation and, because all the other taxes could be eliminated, it would be very visible. This tax is so simple I believe it deserves to be considered.</para><para>There is no doubt that this tax would benefit the manufacturing and rural sectors. The debit tax is simple and the cost of collection is very, very small—it falls on the banks. The GST is a value added tax. It is quite clearly a VAT, not a goods and services tax. It is a value added tax. The complications of collecting that are enormous and the cost of that will fall on small business.</para><para>In the few minutes left to me, I want to say something on industry policy. We hear from the other side inane chants: `You can't pick winners.' Industry policy is not about picking winners. I believe that you can pick winners, but you do not have to. What you have to do is pick general directions, and there are two directions which you should look at: those things in Australia where we have a strategic need, and those things where we have a natural advantage. They are the things we should concentrate on. That is not to say there will not be other areas, given the expertise and the initiative of individual people, but the things that the government should concentrate on are those areas where we have a strategic need or where we have a natural advantage.</para><para>Industry policy is not something in isolation. It is the arrangement of circumstances to provide the best opportunities for chosen industries to develop, to thrive and to continue. It is not just directions for manufacturing in isolation. It has to be integrated with 
 the influences as diverse as industrial relations, immigration policy, social welfare policy, taxation, environmental policy, research and development policy, foreign aid, government purchasing policy and, above all, government's attitude to its own people and country.</para><para>I hear people talking about industry and saying, `We've got to have tariffs.' I do not resile from tariffs—there is a case for them; in many cases, a very justifiable case—but there are lots of other things governments can do. In any economy—be it Josef Stalin's Russia or Ronald Reagan's United States—the biggest single customer is the government. If the government does not buy Australian, if the government does not support the Made in Australia program, it is very hard to mount a convincing program to get other people to do it. Just rearranging government purchasing would make a big impact on the viability of Australian manufacturing industry, but this will not be done under the policy of economic rationalism because this policy is not an economic policy, it is a political ideology, and it is the ideology of big business.</para><para>In conclusion, I want to say something about tourism, because I have a view that the Australia I want for my children is a country with a high standard of living and a high income. For that, we need high levels of education and high levels of training, and we have been going backwards in those areas. Paul Keating, probably more than anyone else, deskilled this country. You simply cannot get skilled tradesmen any more because we stopped training them. This country, which used to produce arguably the best metal tradesmen in the world, now produces drink waiters. While I am sure they are very good drink waiters, there is a limit to how many drink waiters we need.</para><para>Tourism is low paid jobs, part-time jobs and jobs for women and kids. Across this nation you have the blue-collar worker out of work and his wife out working part-time—and then you wonder why his kids are out of control! The cost of that is never taken into consideration by the rational economists of this world. I agree—I certainly would not let these people do my family shopping.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>3754</page.no><name role="metadata">Prosser, Geoff, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PROSSER</name><name.id>RI4</name.id><electorate>Forrest</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 12 May the Treasurer (Mr Costello) delivered an enviable federal budget. Australia's economy is predicted to grow by three per cent in 1999, among the highest in the OECD nations. Interest rates and inflation are at their lowest levels in decades, there are more Australians in work than ever before, and we have delivered a $2.7 billion budget surplus without increasing taxes.</para></talk.start><para>In Labor's last budget they told us they were going to deliver a budget surplus. I have the budget statements from 1995-96 which were circulated by the Hon. Ralph Willis MP and the then finance minister, Kim Beazley. Let us refer to their budget document and see what they said. In the summary of budget aggregates, in the balances predicted, there is a budget surplus of $718 million. Of course, that was their promise. It was a long way from the truth. Kim Beazley as finance minister left us with a budget deficit of $10.3 billion, a Commonwealth government debt of some $95 billion, high interest rates and high inflation. Labor achieved this economic mismanagement by borrowing money to cover five consecutive budget deficits, seemingly unperturbed about the debt they were passing on to our children.</para><para>I do not want to go on about the $10.3 billion Beazley black hole, because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) let the cat out of the bag. He finally confessed when answering questions with regard to Labor's $10 billion deficit. Mr Evans was interviewed on the <inline font-style="italic">Face to Face</inline> program, and the presenter said, `Yes, but you also left us with a $10 billion deficit.' Mr Evans said:</para><para>Yeah, but it was a deficit that could have and would have been corrected.</para><para>I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that was dead right. But it took the Liberal and National coalition government to correct that budget deficit. Labor would never have done it. After five consecutive budget deficits, the interest on Labor's Commonwealth debt was staggering. In fact, in its last budget, Labor spent over $10 billion on interest payments alone. Again, do not just take my word. Refer to Kim Beazley's 1995-96 budget. On page 
 3.24 `Budget outlays by function', section 14(a) `Public debt interest', the figure on interest repayments alone is $10.076 billion—more than they spent on defence, as much as they spent on education and more than half the amount spent on health. There is not a penny to repay debt, just enough to fix up the interest repayments. We were not paying off the principal; we were just paying off the interest.</para><para>We are not putting Australia's future on the bankcard—we are not about that—we are getting the Australian economy back in the black. Our government has slashed Commonwealth debt. When Labor left office, Australia's debt to GDP ratio was around 20 per cent. It now stands at 11.2 per cent and is forecast to fall to 1.4 per cent by the year 2001-02. This will reduce Australia's debt ratio as a percentage of GDP to its lowest level in two decades. Lower debt means lower interest payments. By the end of 1998-99, we will have reduced Commonwealth debt by some $31 billion—that is, $31,000 million—reducing our interest payments and the burden of debt on future generations. Repaying this debt will enable taxes to be spent on building a brighter future instead of servicing past debts. Our plan is to reduce government debt from $95 billion when Labor left office to some $9.6 billion by the year 2001-02. To put it another way, 90 per cent of Commonwealth government debt will be wiped out, saving about $8½ billion by my calculations in annual interest repayments.</para><para>During our term in government, interest rates have been drastically reduced. A decade ago, Labor was crippling small business with interest rates of 20 per cent plus, and many small businesses were paying 24 per cent and 25 per cent on their borrowings. Today, rates have come down to as low as 7.7 per cent for many small businesses—the lowest interest rates for small business since the 1960s.</para><para>When we came to office, housing mortgage interest rates were 10.5 per cent—they went as high as 17 per cent under Labor; that is what they did to the housing mortgage interest rate area—and now they are down to around 6.5 per cent, saving the average Australian home buyer around $3,800 a year. 
 The measure of housing affordability, the Housing Industry Association index, has improved by some 24 per cent during our term of government alone. Our government has made the great Australian dream even more achievable.</para><para>Our government has locked in low inflation and low interest rates and is helping small business by creating a climate for job creation. There are now more Australians in work than ever before. This low inflation, low interest rate environment has also benefited home buyers and people who have saved for their retirement.</para><para>This government has delivered a social dividend for seniors in accordance with our commitment. We have expanded the income test threshold for the Commonwealth seniors card, allowing an additional 220,000 self-funded retirees to receive benefits. In addition, self-funded retirees will now be eligible for the same tax rebates as pensioners, allowing a qualifying single self-funded retiree to earn up to $12,163 without paying tax.</para><para>For pensioners, our government has honoured our commitment to maintain the average pension benchmark at at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings and has protected it through legislation. Maintaining the pension to this benchmark instead of the consumer price index ensures that pensioners will not be disadvantaged.</para><para>I am aware of the number of carers in your electorate alone, Mr Deputy Speaker, and this government recognises the valuable role that carers play in our society. Our staying at home package enables elderly Australians to enjoy the benefits of being cared for in their own homes. This $280 million package will see the number of people receiving assistance to stay in their homes doubled to 22,000. Fifteen carer respite centres will be established and the eligibility for domiciliary nursing care benefits will also be expanded.</para><para>In recognition of the sacrifices made by our veterans, we have made the gold card for health available to an additional 50,000 qualifying Australian World War II veterans. This measure, costing around $500 million over four years, provides veterans with free medical treatment as private patients, choice 
 of doctor and a range of other services free of charge.</para><para>What sets us apart from the Labor Party is that it is a party of debt and deficit. In short, members of the Labor Party are incompetent economic managers. This government has turned the Australian economy around without increasing taxes. We have reduced government expenditure from 27 per cent of GDP when we took office to 24 per cent by this year. By the year 2001-02, government expenditure will be reduced to 22 per cent of GDP—the lowest level in 20 years. We have kept inflation and interest rates down, increased employment and we are prepared to look at other constraints on the Australian people and the economy—issues demanded by the community and business like tax reform.</para><para>Despite Labor's $10.3 billion black hole and the effects of the Asian crisis we have stayed on target and met our goals. We have done this without increasing taxes and without running up Australia's debt; we have passed on social dividends and we have delivered a $2.7 billion budget surplus—and that is just the beginning. This is a responsible budget. We are back in the black, we are back on track.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3756</page.no><name role="metadata">Sawford, Rod, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SAWFORD</name><name.id>3J4</name.id><electorate>Port Adelaide</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When the Treasurer (Mr Costello) delivered the budget speech the other night, and in television interviews afterwards, he sought to make a virtue out of having a surplus on the budget bottom line. Where did that surplus come from? That is the real question. It came straight from the pockets of millions of decent, hardworking Australians.</para></talk.start><para>The budget was in surplus because the government has, in three budgets over two years, abdicated its responsibility to provide adequate services in a range of areas including health, education, child care, aged care, job creation and social welfare. The withdrawal of funding is where the surplus came from—it is as simple as that. Millions of Australians who watched the budget delivery on television understood that, and they could not see the virtue in it.</para><para>Take, for example, Mr Lance Morcom of Birkenhead, a constituent in my electorate. He 
 wrote to me immediately after the delivery of the budget, and I will quote from Mr Morcom's letter. He said:</para><para>I put forward the following the analogy with which, as a family head, you will be familiar. If your household budget is blowing out, it is very easy to adjust by simply taking the following steps:</para><para>(1)	 Slash your wife's housekeeping allowance by 70%;</para><para>(2)	 Don't feed your children;</para><para>(3)	 Don't provide them with an education; and</para><para>(4)	 Don't provide them with any health care.</para><para>Very soon your budget is back under control but the family you have on your hands are all sick, both physically and mentally.</para><para>Lance Morcom is spot on—getting a surplus in the household budget is easy if you have no qualms about inflicting pain and deprivation on your family. It is exactly the same with the national budget—a surplus is easily achieved provided the government has no qualms about inflicting pain and deprivation on decent, honest and hardworking Australian families.</para><para>In the name of creating a budgetary surplus, the government has cut its pound of flesh from over the hearts of the aged, the sick and the jobless, and the withdrawal of government services is causing the greatest hardship to those most in need. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) put it well the other night in his budget reply speech when he said that the Costello surplus is made up of `a million small deficits in the lives of ordinary people'. In short, it comes out of their pockets and into the Treasurer's. As Lance Morcom said, it is easy to get a surplus provided the breadwinner has no qualms about inflicting pain and deprivation on a family.</para><para>To make matters worse, the government has sacked the breadwinner as well—80,000 Public Service jobs have gone; 80,000 pay packets have been taken from workers' pockets. In my home state of South Australia, the situation is all the more desperate because the Brown and Olsen governments have also sacked tens of thousands of South Australian public sector workers. It is therefore not surprising that the South Australian economy has stalled. Confidence has left the state, 
 along with so many of our young people, and the jobless queues remain depressingly long.</para><para>In my electorate of Port Adelaide, the situation has been made worse by the failure of the budget to make a decision on the construction of the additional two Collins submarines. This is a very important industry for the local economy. It was won by a South Australian Labor government when there was a federal Labor government in Canberra. Who knows what the future is under the coalition governments which are currently in South Australia and in Canberra?</para><para>The delay has caused concern to the workers, their families, other businesses in the local area and to related industries which rely on the Submarine Corporation for their livelihood. This problem has been compounded by the government's failure to award to South Australia even one dollar of funding under the roads of national importance program, a failure that will cause further delay in the construction of the much needed river crossing in Port Adelaide.</para><para>That delay means that heavy industrial traffic will continue to rumble through the streets of Port Adelaide, inefficiently delivering a dividend in transport, hampering local efforts to breathe life back into the heart of the port and its suburbs, and not completing what would be one of the best transport hubs in the world. For the record, South Australia is the only state to miss out on funding in that program. On both these matters, it is clear that Premier Olsen and federal Liberal members have failed to convince their federal colleagues of the importance of these projects for South Australia.</para><para>With national unemployment set to rise again, according to budget forecasts, this is the time to remember the candid comment early in this parliamentary term of the then employment minister, Senator Vanstone, that the government would not deserve to be re-elected if it could not get the jobless rate down. Well the jobless are still looking for work, and the outlook is not getting any brighter. Youth unemployment has risen dramatically during the term of this government, and the situation for the over-45s is becoming increasingly tenuous.</para><para>How does the government treat the unemployed? It basically treats them with contempt. It has closed down all the CES offices so that the jobless may now have to pay a private agency to help them find work. It has revived the `dole bludger' tag to add insult to injury.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BT4</name.id><name role="metadata">KEMP</name><name role="display">Dr Kemp</name></talker><para>—What rubbish!

No answer. We are very quiet on that one, are we? The government has decreed that the unemployed must accept a job offer, irrespective of where the job is located, or face losing the unemployment benefit. Young people who are hit by this measure will be forced to move away from their families. If a person finds a job in an area of lower employment but later becomes unemployed, the unemployment benefit will not be payable for 26 weeks.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Those who are on a pension and studying part time will no longer get the full rate of the pensioner education supplement. The $30 a week cut will especially hit sole parents who are trying to improve their chances of getting a job. Also, $10 million in social security benefits is being taken away from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sole parents.</para><para>Over the last three budgets, the government has made serious cuts to social security support for those most in need and for those who are most vulnerable. With despair all around, you would think that the government would take the opportunity in the budget to put some money and some care back into the community, to provide some opportunities for employment—that word `opportunity'—and opportunities for education, or perhaps to provide some easing of the hospital waiting lists, or a legion of measures that would offer some hope to the millions of Australians harmed by its funding cuts. But, of course, that was the furthest thing from its mind.</para><para>The government was determined to build a surplus, and to build it for one purpose only: to pave the way for a goods and services tax. This is the tax that Mr Howard said we would never ever have. That was his specific promise to the electorate, that the coalition would 
 never ever introduce a GST. Yet, just two years later, he says the coalition will introduce a GST, if re-elected. Who ever said this Prime Minister was honest?</para><para>It is beyond dispute that the people who are most disadvantaged by a GST are those on fixed incomes, like pensioners and other beneficiaries. The aged, in particular, will be hard hit by a GST. The Howard government's new nursing home fees already bleed the aged of up to $27,000 a year. They must now also face the prospect of a GST increasing those fees by a further 10, 12, 15 per cent—who knows what it will be. It is no wonder that this budget was so roundly condemned by Aged Care Australia, the peak body looking after the interests of the frail aged.</para><para>Others to be severely disadvantaged will be those living on incomes from fixed investments like superannuation. Self-funded retirees got a few sweeteners in the budget, but I wonder how they will feel when the value of their nest eggs are devalued overnight by a GST of 10, 12 or 15 per cent, or whatever the rate will be, and this is despite having paid tax on the income when it was earned in the first place.</para><para>It is obvious that the government will put the so-called sweeteners into the package but, after the sweetness has gone, the tax will remain. Such sweeteners can never adequately compensate people for having to pay a tax on everything they purchase in the future. The deficiencies of the tax package will become especially noticeable when the rate at which the GST is applied is increased in the future. An increase is very probable—in fact, very likely. In 23 of the 26 countries with a GST, the rate has been increased by as much as 15 per cent.</para><para>Households on average or below average incomes will also be subject to disadvantage under a GST. Any number of reputable studies of the GST overseas clearly show that lower income households pay a greater share of their income in the tax than higher income households. Low income households spend most of their income on the basic necessities of life—food, rent, power, clothes and transport—all of which will be subject to the new GST. The GST also puts a considerable onus 
 on small business proprietors. They will become the unpaid tax collectors, at an unrebated cost to each of about $7,000 per annum.</para><para>The other side of the coin, of course, is that the GST amounts to a tax cut for big business and for wealthy individuals and households. Is this the reason why so many of the coalition's traditional supporters are pressing for the introduction of a GST? It is clear now that tax is going to be a core issue at the next federal election, and we know that because the Treasurer put it there in this budget. The phrase `goods and services tax' might not feature in the document, but the rest of the arithmetic in it proves its existence. In this way, the GST is like the black holes in the universe. The bottom line in the debate about the GST is that the greatest burden falls on those least able to pay. Coincidently, they are the same ones who have been most hurt by the government's funding cuts of the past two years.</para><para>In particular, the GST will do nothing to create economic growth and jobs. There is no correlation anywhere in the world between the form of tax applicable and economic performance, as any examination of the European tax structures and economic indices clearly demonstrate. For example, in regard to private savings, Belgium has the highest household savings rate, and its neighbour, the Netherlands, the lowest. But guess which one has the GST. They both have it. The Treasurer, in his budget speech, talked about the importance of private savings to this nation's economy, but this is evidence that the government's focus on tax reform has nothing to do with economic considerations and everything to do with political gains.</para><para>Further, other things more critical to economic performance than the tax structure are also being ignored. Perhaps the member who is following me in this debate might want to talk about the current account deficit, for example. I recall the current Treasurer before the last election harping on about the current account deficit and foreign debt. Do you remember that truck? But, in government, debt does not seem to matter to him anymore. 
 It is not that the problem has been fixed—in fact, it is worse than it has ever been.</para><para>The current account deficit has doubled in the past two years to $31 billion, and Australia's national debt is now $26 billion more than at the time of the last election. One of the reasons why it has not been fixed is that the government has paid so little attention to industry policy, which is where more jobs must be found. It is not that the government does not recognise this fact. It promised 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing by the year 2000, but that target already is more than 100,000 jobs behind schedule because insufficient attention has been paid to getting the settings right for business and for a productive manufacturing industry.</para><para>Evidence of this is that demand for research and development funding has plummeted and investment growth and export growth are both predicted to fall. The textile, clothing and footwear industries assistance package promised by the Prime Minister has not eventuated and this is putting thousands of jobs in this country at risk.</para><para>In this climate, national debt is continuing to rise, further dampening economic growth and jobs growth. Yet the government seems to take little heed of this serious situation, preferring to run its three-prong ideological agenda of tax, race and union bashing. That agenda involves imposing a GST to favour their corporate mates at the big end of town, stirring up race tension by the disgraceful amendments to the Native Title Act and causing chaos on the waterfront by conspiring to illegally remove working people from their rightful place of work simply because they were members of a union. Talk about a manufactured dispute.</para><para>This is the agenda the government intends to go to the election on. It is an ideological agenda which can only cause further dislocation, insecurity and strife for the average, decent, hardworking household. What this government needs to do is to cease its ideologically driven agenda and get on with governing in the interest of all Australians.

It has sought to divide the nation with its predatory race-based legislation and its shameful and illegal attack on waterfront workers.</para><para>To sum up, Lance Morcom, my constituent from Birkenhead, got it right. The government has achieved its surplus on the backs of ordinary working Australians and the coalition has withdrawn financial assistance from those in our community who are most in need and called that windfall its budgetary surplus. On budget night, the Treasurer went looking for praise, but it was a cheap, harsh, sleight of hand which did not fool Lance Morcom and did not fool the majority of the electors in my electorate. I expect it will not fool many other Australians either.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3760</page.no><name role="metadata">Andrew, Neil, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREW</name><name.id>HE4</name.id><electorate>Wakefield</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I welcome the opportunity to follow my colleague the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) in the appropriation debate.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SAWFORD</name><name role="display">Mr Sawford</name></talker><para>—Again.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Andrew, Neil, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREW</name></talker><para>—Yes, again.

Never. We said we would get on with servicing the debt and we did. In fact, within one term, within two budgets, we have paid off that ALP debt. When it came to the current account, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) quite rightly said that, if you are dealing with a current account with an international debt that is running in excess of $200 billion, it will not disappear 
 overnight. But what the member for Port Adelaide quite mischievously has failed to tell the House and failed to tell the people of this nation is that, in just two years, not only has this government paid off the debt we inherited from his team; in addition to that, we have placed this nation in a better position to service the current account than it has ever been before.</para><para>When we came into government, our capacity to pay off the debt was soaking up something like 20 per cent of our gross domestic product. Tonight, it is soaking up something like 14 per cent because we have set all of the indicators in place so that we are in a better position, we are generating more, we have a greater gross domestic product and we are better able to pay off the debt and meet that current account obligation. If we stay on course, as we intend to do, in spite of the Asian crisis, that figure will fall by the turn of the century to 12 per cent—something you ought to applaud, not criticise. If, as we intend to do, we sell off the residual amount of Telstra, that debt will fall to one per cent—the sort of figures not seen since the member for Port Adelaide was a boy in nappies. But have we had one measure of commendation from those opposite? No, of course not.

Tonight I re-emphasise that the government's debacle on the waterfront has been engineered and orchestrated from this building. The international scandal of Dubai, the international scandal of confrontation and dissension on the waterfront, was similarly engineered from this building. It was all done in association with ministers' offices in this building.</para></talk.start><para>But what is so anti-Australian and what is so malevolent has been the support given to Mr Chris Corrigan's actions in contriving the bankruptcy of his own companies so as to enable him to avoid his companies' obligations towards his own companies' employees. His actions have been applauded, aided and abetted by this government. The proposal to provide financial support for enforced redundancy payments to sacked employees was rushed through the cabinet in this building—without written submission but by verbal submission—months before the events of 7 April 1998.</para><para>But for Mr Corrigan the process of bankrupting one's own companies to avoid liabilities to creditors, including employees' entitlements, was not new. He had earlier form. In June 1994, as chair of Australian Stevedores Ltd, he put forward a similar proposal in respect of the company's Darling Harbour operations. What he proposed on that occasion was to strip the assets out of the Darling Harbour activity, including any provisions that could be removed into another company, let the losses mount up to the value of the residual assets, and then bankrupt the activity so that there were no funds to meet any creditors, including workers' entitlements, using the corporate veil to isolate such liabilities to the bankrupt activity. Fortunately, that proposal that he advanced was rejected by the other shareholders of the company, but it went on to create a deadlock among the shareholders of the company.</para><para>Earlier than that, we can look to the report of the inquiry into Elder Smith Goldsborough Mort Ltd and Petroleum Distributors Pty Ltd that was conducted from January 1981 to 25 May 1981 by J.W. von Doussa, Q.C., the inspector. I quote from paragraph 6.35:</para><para>The evidence of Corrigan about his communications with IEL if correct, discloses a conflict of interest and a disregard for confidential information to an extent that I consider to be improbable.</para><para>The report goes on to say:</para><para>. . . it seems that there was at no time any contractual relationship between Elders GM and BT (leaving aside the underwriting agreement made on 30th March 1981). 
</para><para>Further on—and I am just taking selected parts because of time—the report says at 6.37:</para><para>I consider the evidence shows that the story that IEL was BT's—</para><para>that is, BT Australia's—</para><para>principal has been concocted after the event.</para><para>It concludes at the end of that paragraph:</para><para>In my opinion, the credit memorandum which the BT witnesses say was executed shortly after the date which it bears is also a sham.</para><para>Honourable members can look further into that case and see more detail of that report at the time. But this government's debacle on the waterfront has cost this nation hundreds of millions of dollars—all based on the pretext of improving productivity.</para><para>I have said on a number of occasions in this place and in the Main Committee that waterfront costs are a small proportion of the total costs of getting product to market. That is the major reason why shippers do not take much notice. But the Productivity Commission report on page 34 itself says:</para><para>Waterfront charges make up a small proportion of importer's and exporter's freight bills . . . Usually they are less than half of land-side charges and less than a quarter of the blue water freight charge.</para><para>With respect to country dry cargo, the lift-on charges are 0.5 per cent of the total transport charge. In the case of city reefer charges, the lift-on charge or stevedoring charge for containers is 0.4 per cent of the total transport charges. These are readings from the government's own report about which they have bragged so much. But it exposes this whole charade, it exposes this disaster, as the contrivance it has been on the part of the government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tourism</title><page.no>3761</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>3761</page.no><name role="metadata">Baldwin, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BOB BALDWIN</name><name.id>LL6</name.id><electorate>Paterson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 18 May, federal sport and tourism minister, the Hon.

 the infrastructure funding towards building up the region as a legitimate stopover for international visitors and improving our growing reputation as a haven for quality and affordable eco-tourism pursuits.</para><para>For instance, the $100,000 to the Nelson Bay Dolphin Interpretative Centre expands the federal government's support of the soon to be constructed visitor information and tourist centre to a figure now of $300,000.

Tourism in the Hunter is not only well on the way to becoming one of our region's largest industry sectors; in terms of employment, one in nine of all new jobs created in our region now come directly under the tourism umbrella.</para><para>It was with great pleasure that I joined the minister and Great Lakes Mayor, John Chadban, in officially opening the long-awaited Bulahdelah Tourism and Visitors Information Centre.

 four weeks ago I moved a motion which was supported by the FEC meeting to bring ahead the preselection for the seat of Dickson. It is important to bear that in mind, given what the boffins are now saying.

But, in my naivety, I did not think that that would happen.</para><para> But it did happen in the case of a letter I sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I want to read that letter because this is my letter of resignation. It states:</para><para>As of today I hereby resign my membership of the Parliamentary Liberal Party.

My experience of the party system has led me to the irresistible conclusion that it is impossible to properly represent the interests of my constituents as a member of the parliamentary party.</para><para>Just as with native title, child support and now a proposed GST, my input as a representative of the constituents of Dickson is ignored as decisions have already been made. You expect me to jump and rubber stamp them as directed. It is intolerable. This is in the context of having lost confidence in you as leader of the parliamentary party.

I moved in this House from that position over there last week an amendment to government legislation. How could that demonstrate more conviction to what I believed in? That was my reason.

 from.

After all of these antics I would like to get back to talking about some serious issues in my electorate. The Seventh Day Adventist Church in Warburton has established the Sanitarium Weetbix factory, Signs Publishing Company, an aged care facility, a hospital, a school, a church and has provided accommodation to numerous families. This has represented not just a huge financial investment, but an enormous social and spiritual commitment to Warburton. Importantly, it has provided secure employment to hundreds of local people. The church has in fact become synonymous with the name Warburton.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Just over 12 months ago, Sanitarium, one of the companies owned by the church, made a commercial decision to close its Weetbix factory and ended not just a 75-year history, but also the working careers of over 80 employees. The effect on the town of Warburton of that decision, while still being felt by the community, was not as devastating as many feared because locals were determined 
 that the town would survive by promoting its natural assets.</para><para>Just as this small town was beginning to pick itself up, it was dealt another body blow. The church announced that it proposed to sell both the hospital and the health care centre, putting the jobs of 140 people immediately at risk, but also putting a huge question mark over the future viability of the town. Many locals contacted me from various different sections of the community. Many were distraught at the news. I actually said that they had two choices. They could simply wait and see what happened and who bought the facilities; or they could, as a community, pull together and convince the church that at the very least they should allow the recent restructuring of the hospital time to take effect and, preferably, to convince the owners that it was not in the best interests of either the church or the local community to sell the complex. We chose the latter course of action.</para><para>Together with Steve Brown, a local businessman, Gary Hendrick and Monica Keane from the Upper Yarra business association, I organised a public meeting at the hospital. I must also give credit to Bob Manners, the CEO of the hospital, and his staff for the tremendous support they gave us and for allowing us to hold the meeting at the hospital. I encouraged those present at the meeting by telling them that, if the community were to save the hospital, then the community had to pull together and work in partnership. It gives me enormous pride and pleasure to be able to tell this House that out of that meeting came support from SDA, non-church members, management and staff of the hospital and health care centre, business people, community groups and the local media—people from all walks of life and all political persuasions.</para><para>From that fantastic support base we formed a strategy committee consisting of Steve Brown, Gary Hendrick, June Ivey, Jan Cameron, Monica Keane, Keith Johanson, Maurie McQuade, Graham Sweet and yours truly. We organised a petition and within one week we managed to collect just over 2,000 signatures. My office faxed those to a conference that was being held on Friday, Saturday 
 and Sunday of last weekend. Pastor Bob Manners, in his capacity as CEO of the hospital, actually asked the conference to withdraw the facilities from sale. And I am pleased to report that, as a result of our action and the pressure that we managed to bring to bear, the church leaders have actually withdrawn those properties from sale.</para><para>I want to place on record my thanks to all of those members of the community who acted so spontaneously. I know that the commitment they brought to this issue and the pressure they applied to the hospital leaders is going to stand the community in good stead. I intend working with those community members and, in turn, bringing pressure to bear on government to provide public beds to assist in the future viability of that hospital.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—Order!

The Linkages Stream program funds small-scale short duration activities that aim to promote economic cooperation between ASEAN and Australia by establishing cooperative and joint activities involving the private, research, academic and government sectors in ASEAN and Australia. Linkages Stream activities contribute towards enhanced trade and investment links between ASEAN and Australia as well as contribute to sustainable development and economic growth in ASEAN.</para><para>AusAID contributions for activities range from a minimum of $A25,000 and will generally not exceed $A250,000. Funds for successful proposals will be provided up to a maximum of 60% of total eligible project costs and will be provided in arrears.</para><para>(ii) The approved proposal involved the following three main objectives: 
</para><para>To develop commercial opportunities between Small Medium Enterprises (SME) in Australia and in regional areas in ASEAN through an exchange of missions by business people with targeted business interests with particular regard to training and technology transfer opportunities;</para><para>To assess and report on commercial prospects for Australian SME in the regional areas nominated (cities in Indonesia and Vietnam) to form the basis for development of a regional SME business linkages strategy with these areas; and</para><para>To strengthen and expand the trade facilitation network between State and regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Australia and counterpart business associations in ASEAN through mutually beneficial commercial exchange.</para><para>(b) AusAID agreed to fund the proposal to the value of $174,042 (60% of agreed `eligible activity costs'). The project is scheduled for completion 31 May 1998. AusAID signed an agreement under the AAECP Linkages Stream program in July 1997 with the Victorian Employer's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VECCI).

for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>Telstra and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) have advised the following:</para><para>The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (the SOLAS Convention) requires that member countries provide communication services for vessels which operate under that Convention. In broad terms, such vessels are those in excess of 300 Gross Registered Tons.</para><para>In fulfilling Australia's obligations under the SOLAS Convention, AMSA provides a network of six Coast Radio Stations for safety and distress communications with vessels at sea. These stations are located at Melbourne, Perth, Darwin, Townsville, Brisbane and Sydney and are managed and operated by Telstra under contractual arrangements with AMSA. A station at Hobart, which previously had been part of the Coast Radio, Station network, was closed in 1992. Telstra has also provided additional maritime communications services, in its own right, separately from its contract with AMSA.</para><para>Under the provisions of the SOLAS Convention, traditional methods of maritime communications are being replaced through the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). The GMDSS is required to be fully implemented by 1999. Until that time, the network of Coast Radio Stations may be suitable to the needs of State/Territory-registered vessels including yachts and fishing vessels, providing they are equipped with suitable radio equipment.</para><para>State/Territory-registered vessels fall outside the scope of the SOLAS Convention and responsibility for providing their communications service falls to State and Territory governments. This long-standing arrangement was confirmed by Commonwealth and State/Territory Ministers for Transport at the Australian Transport Advisory Council in 1992 when it was accepted by the Council that: 
</para><para>(a) the Australian Coast Radio Network is established primarily for SOLAS vessels, (b) if non-SOLAS vessels wish to use the network, they must fit all Medium Frequency and High Frequency radiotelephone distress channels (from 2 to l 6 MHz) to guarantee reliable access; and (c) if State governments are not satisfied with the service provided by the network they are free to establish their own maritime communications infrastructure.</para><para>Vessels operating in Tasmanian waters are able to communicate effectively with the network of Coast Radio Stations, providing they are fitted with appropriate radio equipment. Such equipment may be in excess of that required by State government regulations.</para><para>A key element of the design in the Coast Radio Network is that any station in the network, not necessarily that which is geographically closest, can respond to an emergency call. Calls from ships located in Tasmanian waters will not necessarily be responded to by the station at Melbourne but can be received and acted upon by any one of the stations in the network, provided that an appropriate frequency has been selected.</para><para>AMSA and Telstra are confident that the network of Coast Radio Stations continues to provide an efficient and effective service to vessels in Tasmanian waters, provided those vessels are fitted with the appropriate equipment.</para><para>AMSA has advised that through the National Maritime Safety Committee, State and Territory governments are considering the communication needs of non-SOLAS vessels, following the completion of the GMDSS in 1999.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Robinson, Mr Floyd</title><page.no>3814</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2735)</subtitle><id.no>2735</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3814</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Graeme, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Campbell</name><name.id>CF4</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 10 March 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Western Times</inline>  of 18 December 1997 that Mr Floyd Robinson was fined for possession and supply of a dangerous drug, drink driving and other driving offences.</para><para>(2) Is it a fact that a car owned by the Department of Finance and Administration and leased to Mr Robinson's father, a deputy chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, was used as a base to sell drugs; if so, what action has he or his Department taken.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3814</page.no><name role="metadata">Williams, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Williams</name><name.id>7V5</name.id><electorate>Tangney</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Attorney-General</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) and (2) Any action in this matter is for the consideration of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</para></talk.start><para>(1) As at 31 March 1998, approximately 24,000 of the 35,000 public payphones operated by Telstra have been converted to joint smart card/coin usage, with over 30,000 expected to be converted by mid-1998.</para><para>(2) Except for a small number of special-purpose payphones designed to meet the requirements of special groups, for example corrective institutions and some secondary and tertiary institutions, and specifically manufactured without a coin slot, all of the new payphones will accept every Australian coin and all have a coin return mechanism.</para><para>However, payphones are subject to vandalism which can render them inoperable for coin operation. Once the coin mechanism is vandalised, the new payphones will normally operate using a Smart Card. If the new payphone detects that both the coin and card mechanisms are damaged, the payphone places itself in the "Free Local Call" 
 mode. Telstra's new payphones automatically report themselves out of order, enabling Telstra to readily respond to faults. In some high vandalism prone areas, Telstra has converted new phones, on a temporary basis, to card-only operation to ensure that there is a functional payphone available. In these cases, the coin chute is blocked off, ensuring coins cannot be inserted.</para><para>(3) See answer to (2) above. Other cashless calling options available to users of public payphones include Telstra's Homelink Service, the Phoneaway prepaid calling card, Freecall 1800 calls and Automatic and Operated Assisted Reverse Charge calls.</para><para>(4) The "000" emergency service is available without the use of cards or coin.</para><para>In the event of "emergency" situations which do not involve police, fire or ambulance the options set out in (3) above are available.</para><para>(5) Except for a small number of payphones modified for special "card only" purposes (and manufactured without a coin slot), all new payphones are intended to accept every Australian coin. When new payphones are temporarily modified to avoid vandalism as mentioned in (3) above, Telstra blocks off the coin entry slot. Telstra is in the process of producing a sticker to place on the payphone advising that coins are not accepted.</para><para>(6) No. If damage to the coin mechanism has been detected, the electronic screen lights up when the handset is lifted and clearly displays the message "INSERT CARD" in bold 20 point type. Because the screen is normally dark, the user's attention is immediately drawn to the lit message. Depending on where the coin blockage has occurred, the display may permanently display the message "LIMITED SERVICE—CARD ONLY".</para><para>(7) Monies cleared by Telstra service personnel are returned to the phone's coin box and not accounted for independently of the normal payphone coin receipts. However, customers who have lost money can call Telstra's Customer Service Department on 132200 and have the money refunded, either as a credit on a nominated telephone account, or returned in coins.</para><para>(8) General payphone receipts are used primarily to fund the installation, operation and maintenance of the payphone network.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family Court: Newcastle, New South Wales</title><page.no>3827</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2867)</subtitle><id.no>2867</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3827</page.no><name role="metadata">Morris, Allan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Allan Morris</name><name.id>FI4</name.id><electorate>Newcastle</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 6 April 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Following the retirement of Justice Renaud from the Family Court at Newcastle, will a new judge be appointed; if so when.

Appointments are made after a process of broad consultation to ensure that the best possible candidates are identified.</para><para>(2) The net Running Costs appropriation for the Family Court in the 1997/98 Budget was $106,535,000. In the 1998/99 Budget it is $107,229,000. The Court has indicated that the financial and human resources available to the Newcastle Registry will therefore be held to at least their current levels.</para><para>(3) Parliament has made the Family Court a self-administering agency where decisions about the management of its administrative, including financial affairs rest with the Court.

I am advised that the Member did express concerns about the operation of the Cairns MRC to my Department's North Queensland Regional Manager when he made a courtesy visit to the Member shortly after taking up his appointment in the region.</para><para>(3) Cairns Centacare has not been selected to take over migrant services in Cairns.</para><para>I announced on 25 March 1998 that the Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme worker-based grant, which I awarded to the Cairns MRC on 28 August 1997, would henceforth be managed under the auspices of Centacare Cairns. This grant is covered by a Service Agreement. Centacare was judged to be an appropriate organisation to manage additional resources, at least in the interim, because it has a proven record of service delivery.</para><para>The work program objectives of the Cairns MRC CSS Scheme worker-based grant were to enable the employment of a full-time worker for a period of twelve months to assist new arrivals and improve outreach to people from non-English speaking countries in rural and remote areas. These objectives closely approximate key settlement service objectives contained in the Cairns MRC work program that had been supported by my Department's core funding. Continuation of the CMRC CSS Scheme grant by Centacare will therefore allow for the partial addressing of key settlement needs of migrants and refugees identified in the Cairns MRC core-funded work program, until alternative fuller service arrangements arising from a regional needs assessment are in place.</para><para>(4) My Department's agreement with Cairns Centacare in relation to the CSS Scheme grant 
 transferred from the Cairns MRC is referred to in (3) above. Cairns Centacare is also currently funded by my Department under a Service Agreement for a CSS Scheme worker which I awarded to the organisation on 28 August 1997 to assist newly arrived humanitarian entrants and migrants get access to services.</para><para>My Department funded the Cairns MRC under two different programs. Under the Migrant Resource Centre Program, it received funding for two core staff, rent and a contribution towards operating costs. MRC funding was provided under a Service Agreement between the Commonwealth and the MRC. This funding will not be reallocated until I have considered the results of the current regional needs assessment.</para><para>As referred to in (3), my Department had also provided funding to the Cairns MRC under the CSS Scheme.</para><para>(5) The MRC Program funding to the Cairns MRC had been provided under a Service Agreement which, in the normal course of events, would have expired on 30 June 1998.</para><para>When I announced on 25 March 1998 the termination of core funding to the Cairns MRC and the transfer MRC's CSS Scheme funding to Cairns Centacare, all CSS Scheme funding was to terminate on 30 September 1998. On 31 March 1998 I announced that organisations that had CSS Scheme worker-based grants would be offered a 12-month extension of those grants until 30 September 1999. This offer has been made to Cairns Centacare in relation to the CSS Scheme grant I awarded it last year. The future of the CSS Scheme grant transferred from Cairns MRC will be considered as part of the regional needs assessment.</para><para>(6) For the 12 months to 30 September 1998, my Department is providing $48,358 to Cairns Centacare for a Level 2 CSS Scheme worker.</para><para>The total amount of funding allocated to the Cairns MRC for the 12 months to 30 September 1998 was $162,396, which included $44,604 for a Level 1 CSS Scheme worker.

Rather, wool is generally transported in bales by road from farms to a wool store. After sale, wool destined for export is transported to a facility where it is dumped (compressed), then loaded into a container and transported to a shipping terminal. Road transport would be used for short distance movements but rail is likely to carry any containers transhipped to an interstate port.</para><para>As far as the BTE is aware, greasy wool is generally exported as dumped bales in 6 metre (20 foot) containers, although 12 metre (40 foot) boxes are sometimes used when shipping lines offer lower, back-loading rates for them out of Australia. The larger 12 metre boxes are also used sometimes for exports of scoured wool and wool tops.</para><para>A further complication in estimating costs is that some wool is transported to interstate ports for export. This can happen if wool growers consign their clip to an interstate city for auction (say from northern NSW to Brisbane), or if wool buyers consign their containers to an interstate port. Export statistics suggest that only a minor percentage of  
 the wool produced in NSW, Vic and WA is transhipped to another state for export but further research would be required to produce accurate estimates. ABARE [Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics] data (table attached) show average freight costs per kilogram paid in each state to transport wool from farm gate to store where the transport was arranged by the wool broker. The ABARE survey did not cover movements of wool where the transport was arranged by the farmer.</para><para>As far as the BTE is aware, there are no generally published statistics available on post auction transport costs for wool, that is from the store to the port. According to ABARE, they are generally paid by buyers."</para><para>It is therefore not possible to respond directly to the Honourable Member's question in the terms it was put. However, given advice from Wool Dumpers Australia Pty Ltd that the average 20 foot container transports 21,000kg of wool, the average freight bill for farms selling wool to a broker (which covers freight up to the time of auction) can notionally be equated to a cost per 20 foot container.</para><para>The notional ABARE per container costs are approximately $395 for NSW, $181 for Victoria and $170 for WA.</para><para></para><para>WOOL FREIGHT AND WOOL SOLD—PRIVATE AND AUCTION SALES 1996-97</para><para>Average per farm</para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>New South Wales</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Victoria</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Queensland</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Western
