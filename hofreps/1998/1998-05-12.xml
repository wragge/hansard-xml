They were Midshipman Megan Pelly, aged 22, Petty Officer Shaun Smith, aged 29, Leading Seaman Bradley Meek, aged 25, and Able Seaman Phillip John Carroll, aged 23. Five more naval personnel were seriously injured in the accident, and this particularly tragic event I know touched all members of parliament and the entire nation, because here were four young people embarking upon promising careers in the Royal Australian Navy. In the case of Petty Officer Smith, Leading Seaman 
 Meek and Able Seaman Carroll, they were all planning their marriages later this year. Midshipman Pelly, who I understand is the first woman to have lost her life in the service of the Royal Australian Navy, was on her first day at sea on <inline font-style="italic">Westralia</inline> .</para></talk.start></continue><para>I know that I speak on behalf of the entire nation in extending sympathy to the family and other loved ones of those who lost their lives. A very moving memorial service was held at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stirling</inline> in Western Australia last Friday. That service was attended by His Excellency, the Governor-General, me, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), the Premier of Western Australia and other representatives of the community and representatives of the Royal Australian Navy.</para><para>The government is doing everything possible to extend comfort and support to the injured, their families and the friends of those who died. I think all of us are particularly affected when young peopleâand they seem always, because of the nature of their pursuit and the risks they take, to be very youngâlose their lives in the service of their country. What happened on the <inline font-style="italic">Westralia</inline> last week was a reminder to all Australians of the risks and the perils that are involved even in peace time in serving in the armed forces of Australia. </para><para>An inquiry has been convened to investigate the accident. The defence minister has given clear instructions, and that is already being demonstrated by the structure of the inquiry that it will be fully open to the public and that it will, on this occasion, include civilian experts so that later down the track there can be no concerns legitimately expressed about the amplitude of the inquiry, its openness to the public or the seriousness of those conducting the inquiry and their determination to find out precisely what caused the accident.</para><para>I had the opportunity of speaking to the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Westralia</inline> and expressing my personal respect for the role that he played and the very difficult situation in which he had found himself. From a personal point of view, the service was particularly moving. It was a reminder to me of the great sense of family within the Royal Australian Navy in times of great adversity. I am delighted that it was possible in such tragic circumstances for there to be such a representative group of the Australian community to pay their respects to those who lost their lives and to offer our sympathy, love and support for those who are left deeply bereaved by this tragic accident.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2974</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThank you for your indulgence, Mr Speaker. I join with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and agree with them wholeheartedly. I share all the sentiments that he expressed. Can I also acknowledge the presence for the first time in your newly reformulated gallery of Admiral Don Chalmers, the Chief of the Navy. As the Prime Minister said, I was given the opportunity to attend the service, and I was also permitted the day before by the Minister  for Defence (Mr McLachlan) to go to Garden Island HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stirling</inline>  and receive a briefing. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Stirling</inline>  is in my constituency, and the dead and many of the bereaved are constituents of mine.</para></talk.start><para>Could I, along with the Prime Minister, acknowledge the service of the four who died: Midshipman Megan Pelly, Petty Officer Shaun Damien Smith, Leading Seaman Bradley John Meek and Able Seaman Phillip John Carroll. With the Prime Minister and the 
 other ministers, I had an opportunity to meet with their sad and distraught families on the day of the service. It was a deeply affecting, disturbing occasion. To share with them in their sorrow was a privilege; a real privilege to share with people who have sacrificed so much for the nation.</para><para>I also want to acknowledge the great character shown by the captain of the ship, Commander Stuart Dietrich, in the decisions he had to take in extreme circumstances and to extend a word of kind regard to the crew overall. It was a very close run thing indeed. By rights, by any reasonable anticipation, the <inline font-style="italic">Westralia</inline> would no longer be on our order of battle, but the bravery of the crewâwhich I hope will come out in the inquiryâwas absolutely exemplary and was within the finest naval traditions.</para><para>Having had an opportunity to look at the <inline font-style="italic">Westralia</inline>, its engine room is like a cathedral. It is not a normal warship which is an enclosed affair, basically, for damage limitation purposes. It is fundamentally a civilian ship where no such considerations apply, which makes firefighting almost impossible within it. You could stand at the upper entrance looking down to the engine room, and above everything was singed, distorted, twisted, burned. Then you realise that the firefighting crews, many of whom went in five or six times, were fighting the fire from about 60 feet below you. There were acts of extraordinary heroism entailed in this exercise.</para><para>Fortunatelyâsometimes there are fortunate accidents as well as unfortunate onesâapparently the crew had trained for precisely this eventuality one week before it occurred and there was, therefore, a level of preparedness that may not normally have been aboard the ship, which meant that they had a thoroughgoing understanding of what it was they needed to do.</para><para>I congratulate the minister on organising a very substantial inquiryâboth in the appointment of civilians to the inquiry, and the openness of it. I think it is absolutely critical for not just the confidence of the public but the confidence of the defence forces that this inquiry is conducted in that way. I think also it is enormously importantâand I note some 
 of the comments made in public by some of those conducting the inquiryâthat they want to look at not just the issues that caused the problems and come with recommendations on how to deal with them but to give a complete picture of the events of that day, including those acts of heroism. I think, if the inquiry does that, then it will be a very good thing for our nation indeed for us to learn anew what I think we all as Australians appreciateâand that is the very great skill and the willingness to sacrifice, on our behalf, of the people who are in our defence forces.</para><para>Can I extend my deepest sympathy to the families whom I met and those I did not; my deepest sympathy to the mates of the dead on the base. I have had a number of occasions to address crews who have been through not dissimilar things to this, unfortunately. I know the effect that it has on them, the fact that it draws them together in the way the Prime Minister said. But also, of course, it is enormously impactful on their sense of security and their personal happiness. We ought to be, and I am sure we are all, mindful of that fact.</para><para>I welcome the Prime Minister's assurance that everything will be done for the families of the crew who died and for those members of the crew who were injured and others who may experience a degree of personal difficulty from the service aboard the ship that day. The fight to save the ship was in the very best traditions of the Royal Australian Navyâthe very best traditionsâand I express my admiration to the members of the crew and to the captain of the ship for the way in which they conducted that and looked after their mates.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âAs a mark of respect to those deceased sailors, I invite all honourable members to rise in their places.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Honourable members having stood in their placesâ</inline></para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âI thank the House.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CONDOLENCES</title><type>Condolences</type><page.no>2975</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Vigor, David Bernard</title><page.no>2975</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2975</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI inform the House of the death on Thursday, 9 April 1998, of David Bernard Vigor, a former senator who represented the state of South Australia from 1984

It took you ages to respond to tests after they had actually taken place, let alone pre-emptive warnings. It was only as a 
 result of comments that had been made by others on our side of politics that Gareth Evans was finally chased out to say something about French nuclear tests.

Moreover, let me remind the Leader of the Oppositionâwho, of course, has not only now been exposed as having deceived the Australian people before the last election, but he has now been exposed as having deceived the Australian people after the electionâwe are indebted on this side of the House, as we so often are, for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</para></talk.start><para>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is really a class act when it comes to helping the government. That Channel 7 program on Sunday was a real tour de force by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He was asked about the deficit of $10Â½ billion that his government had left behind, that is, the Keating/Beazley inheritance; the inheritance that the Leader of the Opposition did not tell us about, refused to tell us about, before the last election. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did was to expose not only the deceit of the Leader of the Opposition before the March 1996 election but also the deceit of the Leader of the Opposition since.</para><para>The reality is that we did inherit a deficit of $10Â½ billion. We inherited an accumulated 
 net federal government debt of between $95 billion and $100 billion. Not only did we inherit that, but we have had over the last two and a quarter years to struggle with all the obstruction in the world from the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in relation to the attempts that we have undertaken to get the economic accounts of this nation in order.</para><para>I am very proud to say on behalf of the government that the full measure of the success that we have achieved over the last two and a quarter years will be revealed tonight when the Treasurer brings down his budget. I am very proud to say that the economy of Australia is the strongest it has been for a quarter of a century. We have the lowest interest rates for more than 30 years; we have the lowest small business rates for 33 years; we have the lowest unemployment rate for the last eight years; and we have, in fact, the lowest unemployment rate since the recession that the former Prime Minister said was the recession we had to have. We have, in fact, one the of highest business investment levels in Australia's history. It is forecast that the Australian economy will grow faster than the economies of the G7 or G8 nations.</para><para>In other words, Mr Speaker, I think my government has done a remarkable job in turning around the Australian economy. We have had no help from the Australian Labor Party. We have had obstruction, obfuscation, delay, sabotage and guerilla tactics towards the attempts of my government to turn it around. I think the Australian people understand two things: they understand the mess that Labor left and they understand the magnificently applied job that we have brought to cleaning up that mess.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Workplace Relations Act: Conspiracies</title><page.no>2976</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2976</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat comes from a bloke who misled on the $25 billion budget deficit before we came in.

At long last the Labor Party have pleaded guilty to leaving the Australian public with a $10Â½ 
 billion deficit. At long last the truth has emerged. Last Sunday we all listened with great interest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline>  program. I am sure that all who have read the report of that particular interview in Monday's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  newspaper will have indelibly impressed upon their minds the headline that emerged, and that headline said, `Labor left nation in debt: Evans'.</para></talk.start><para>At long last, as I have said, the truth is out. Of course, that follows some 2Â½ years of the sham perpetrated by the Leader of the Opposition, a sham which was to deny that there was any deficit left by Labor. That self-denial that went on for 2Â½ years has been exposed with a degree of truth by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. That was always a fact: the first budget of the coalition government revealed that there was a deficit of $10Â½ billion. Another fact is: that first budget revealed that, in their last five years of government, Labor, through their debt and deficit policies, ratcheted up some $70 billion worth of debt.  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition tried on Sunday to say, `We could have corrected the problem. Yes, there was $10Â½ billion worth of deficit left for the Australian people when we finished in office but we could have corrected the problem.'</para><para>In recent months we have seen various spokespeople for the opposition running round the countryside. We have had the spokesman on business talking about reintroducing R&amp;D spending. We have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition talking about introducing additional funding for EMDG and DIFF. We have had Ms Kernot, of course, looking after the baby boomers. And we have had the Leader of the Opposition saying, `Take no notice of all of that; the only thing that we are committed to are what shadow cabinet approves.' And the only thing that the shadow cabinet has approved is some support for nursing homes.</para><para>Here they go: they had all of those years and in their last five years they ran up $70 billion worth of debt. Now they say, `We could have fixed it.' Promises are being made to any audience they come in front of. They are trying to appease them with promises and 
 at the same time we are hearing this line, `Don't take any notice of these promises because unless shadow cabinet approves them they do not mean anything.' Who would believe the Labor Party on fiscal responsibility? How could any Australian believe the Australian Labor Party?</para><para>In stark contrast to what Labor did, particularly in their last five years, the first 2Â¼ years of a coalition government have seen one sound fundamental principle endorsed in the first two budgets. That sound fundamental principle was that we would not live beyond our means. We would not spend what we did not have. We accepted the debt that we inherited and we worked to get rid of the deficit. Through those sound fiscal policies we have achieved muchâwe have seen some four per cent reduction in home mortgage rates, low inflation locked in and some 280,000 additional jobs created in this country. This is contrasted with an opposition that will say anything to the audience that is in front of it. We have seen an opposition that was profligate in its spending and that simply lived off the debt and deficit drip. In stark contrast we have a government that has acted fiscally responsibly. And tonight we get the third instalment, the third budget, and this budget brings Australia back into the black. It sets up the base for future sustainable economic growth in this countryâsomething Labor could never achieve.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfront</title><page.no>2979</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2979</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to the Prime Minister.

Its effect has, to some extent, been considerably ameliorated by the strategy this government has pursued with regard to trade: firstly, diversification beyond Asia and, secondly, putting real effort into the bilaterals. As a consequence, for the first nine months of this financial year, our overall export performance is up more than $8 billionâmore than 10 per centâcompared to the nine months of the previous financial year.

In fact, in the figures for March, there was a welcome upward flip: Korea exports up 30 per cent; Malaysia and the Philippines up 40 per cent; and Singapore jumped up 45 per cent in February and 26 per cent in March.</para><para>Against the odds, but because of and helped by the strategy pursued by this government,

This is the first of two reports. The second report was on work arrangements in container stevedoring. These two reports together make the most convincing, irrefutable, absolutely complete case setting out the need for reform of the Australian waterfront. You could not get a more convincing, more independent, more clearly articulated case as to why Australia needs to fix up the waterfront.</para></talk.start></continue><para>These people have not even read it, by their own interjections. They probably read that 
 MUA report which said, `There's nothing to worry about. We're nearly as good as the rest of the world.' It was based on the Drury report. They got some academic in Canberra to extrapolate the work done by a reputable crowd in London. He did it for his own purposes and released it out here. Why did they release it here? They knew the Productivity Commission report was coming so they thought they had better get their own case out onto the public record.</para><para>In fact, there was a very interesting piece in Lloyd's List a couple of days later which actually had some quotes by the research people at Drury's. They said about the Hamilton report, `Well, the basis of it might be valid. Then again it might not be.' There is only one valid independent study on the public record, and that is the Productivity Commission report.

It says:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Container stevedoring in Australia is characterised by a system of complex, inflexible and prescriptive work arrangements which constrain workplace performance.</para><para>It went on to give a very good example of the cost of unreliability of shipping schedules. It says:</para><para>The cost of poor waterfront reliability on shipping schedules is illustrated by the experience of one container ship operator in the study.</para><para>This is a group which has got seven ships going back and forward between Australia and the west coast of the US. They said that, because of the lack of reliability in the Australian ports, they have to have another ship on the service so that they can maintain a reasonable schedule. So, instead of having six ships, they have got seven. Of course, who pays for it? It is all those thousands of Australian businesses that rely on having a service to the west coast to make their businesses tick and to provide jobs. They say that just for this one shipping line alone the cost for them on an annual basis is $7 million a 
 year. They say in respect of that whole Australia-US west coast trade that they estimate that the extra cost in shipping alone because of the lack of reliability is $US20 million every year, which we are paying for and which the Labor Party is not prepared to lift a finger to do anything about.</para><para>The other thing is that they talk about the work practices and the `double header'. I have done a lot of radio recently, but I must say that one of the more entertaining moments on Melbourne radio the other day was when a wharfie rang up and said, `I'm sick of you talking about a crane driver earning $90,000 a year for sitting on a crane 14 hours a week. I'm sick of you, Mr Reith, talking about rorts.' His name was Barry and he was from Sunshine. Barry from Sunshine, wherever you are, never again hesitate to ring because it was great to talk to you. I said to Barry, `Well, Barry, you're sick of hearing about the rorts. Tell me this, Barry: have you ever heard of such a thing as a double header?' He said, `Yeah, double headers. We have double headers.' I said, `What rate of pay do you get on a double header on the second shift, Barry?' He said, `Oh, we get paid double time and a half.' I said, `Gee, that's not bad, Barry. Barry, when you've finished the job on the second shift, do you get to go home and still get paid for the whole shift?' He said, `Yeah, that's right.' I said, `Barry, have you ever heard of such a thing called `nick off'?' He said, `Listen, don't you talk about rorts. It's been like this since 1960.'</para><para>That is what Barry said.

As the Productivity Commission report shows, they are paid that money for a paid working week of 45 hours, on average, and get from $62,000 to $101,000. But, as the Productivity Commission report also says, of that 45 hours 
 a lot of it is idle time, so many of them are doing less than 40 hours for $62,000 to $101,000 a year. It is the ultimate rort, supported by the Labor Party at the expense of the rest of the Australian community.

We set out at the beginning of this to achieve one goal and one goal alone; that is, to serve the national interest by reforming the Australian waterfront. That has been our single irrevocable aim throughout the whole of this issue.

What the Australian public need to be reminded of is that in 1995âthis goes to the very heart of this issueâan agreement was made between the Maritime Union of Australia and the Patrick company.

These are men and women whose incomes are often only $15,000 or $20,000 a year. These are men and women who have fought the seasons, they have fought the adversity of perverse world markets.

The government unreservedly condemns India's action of detonating three nuclear tests, and we have taken immediate and decisive action to make our views clear to the Indian government. India has flagrantly defied the international community's strong support for nuclear non-proliferation and opposition to nuclear testing. India's action does have serious implications for global and, of course, regional security. The Australian government urges India's neighbours to exercise restraint in the face of this provocation. I have called in the Indian High Commissioner today and I have conveyed the Australian government's condemnation in the strongest possible terms. I also made it clear to the Indian High Commissioner that we would expect India to desist from any further tests of any kind and that we would wish to see India immediately move to sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. This same message has been conveyed by our High Commissioner in New Delhi to the Indian authorities.</para></talk.start><para>I am also recalling the Australian High Commissioner from New Delhi to Australia for consultations and I expect him back here in the next 48 hours or so. He will leave New Delhi as soon as it is practicable. Further steps will be decided on in the light of those consultations and, of course, also in the light of consultations with our regional friends and neighbours as well as countries such as the 
 United States which share the great concerns that we have about what India has just done.</para><para>I would like to make one other comment as well about representations we have made to India not over just the last few months but over a large number of years about the issue of nuclear testing and the development of a nuclear capability. We have of course throughout our term in governmentâand I think to be fair the previous government probably did throughout its whole term in government as wellâmade it perfectly clear to the Indian government or succession of Indian governments that we wanted India to join with the world and sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</para><para>There are now 186 countries which have signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and there are only five that have notâand India is one of those five. I urge the Indian government to do the responsible thing and to sign that treaty. Our viewsâand, to be fair, the views of the previous Australian governmentâhave always been made clear to the Indian government on that matter. We also have made it perfectly clear to the Indian government on many occasions that we wish them to sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and have expressed our grave concern that they have not signed that treaty.</para><para>Most recently, following a long succession of representations to successive Indian governments on this broader issue of nuclear questions, our High Commissioner in New Delhi on 22 April conveyed Australia's strong opposition to nuclear testing to India's Defence Minister Fernandes and the following day to the Indian Prime Minister's principal secretary.</para><para>So let me say in conclusion in relation to the Indian testing program that we want India to understand three things: first, to understand the strength of Australia's feelings about this issue; secondly, to make sure that India does not persist with this policy of detonating nuclear devices; and, thirdly and importantly, to send a strong message to other countries which might be considering entering the nuclear weapons age. Let me say in that context that not only have we, through my department, spoken to the Pakistani High 
 Commissioner but our High Commissioner in Islamabad will also be speaking with the Pakistani government, explaining to them that it would not be to their advantage, to the advantage of the international community or to the advantage of the security of our region as a whole if Pakistan were to respond to India's decision to conduct nuclear tests by doing the same thing. Pakistan should set an example in the cause of nuclear non-proliferation by not going down the path that India has very mistakenly followed.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfront</title><page.no>2990</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2990</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business.

In respect of the administrators, I think the Labor Party and the MUA are placed in an exquisitely difficult position. I say that for this reason: normally in these protracted disputes what happens is the union keeps hammering away at the employer until eventually the employer sort of succumbs under the financial pressure, but in this particular situation in fact it is completely the other way around because what you actually have in place is labour hire contracts for the provision of labour for the stevedoring operations based on a commercial assessment of the needs of the stevedoring operations company.

What he has said is that he required these companies to meet certain performance benchmarks and the more industrial action they took the less able they were to meet the performance benchmarks which were required of them under the contract. So what he was doing was topping up those companies to keep them afloat, but eventually the harder the unions hit the stevedoring operations company the more he had to put in by way of subsidy to keep them going, until eventually he said, `Well, given the inefficiencies in your operation, we are no longer prepared to subsidise the inefficiencies in those operations.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>What the administrators find is that, once the matter got before the Federal Court, the union said, `We appreciate the insolvency of those companies soâto a laymanâbasically we are prepared to work for nothing to keep them afloat.' In legal terms, they gave an indemnity against the personal liability of the administrators just to keep the companies afloat.</para><para>The administrators have these labour hire companies with these contracts. They are looking under the Corporations Law, as required by the High Court, to keep the companies going into the future. In layman's terms, it is basically their obligation, as they have explained it to me, to get these companies up on a sound financial basis. They are looking at how they can be rearranged to meet that simple commercial goal.</para><para>As they look at those labour supply contracts and how they could configure the work force to meet those contracts, they are asking themselves, `What do we need to keep these companies on a financial basis?' They have said to us that, to get them on to a financial basis, there will obviously be redundancies. They were also looking at the fact that other people were coming to them and saying, `We can provide exactly the same service for 30 per cent less than those labour contracts currently provide by way of a revenue stream.'</para><para>The requirement on the labour hire companies and their administrators is to look at the means by which they can set these companies up on a commercial basis. The difficulty for the MUA is that their public position is that there is no way known that they can provide labour in those labour hire companies which will allow those companies to operate efficiently in the future. The MUA is saying, `Oh, no. We cannot possibly do it on that existing cost basis.' The reason for that is the inefficiencies, the rorts and the overmanning. It is a neat comparison to make between the national need for an improved waterfront and the micro-need for those companies to put themselves on a financial basis.</para><para>The administrators have said to me that, on the current basis, the companies are not in funds and therefore they would go into liquidation, the 1,400 would lose their jobs and they would not get a cent. There would be no funds available to them. That is one possibility. The second possibility isârecognising that there are redundanciesâthat they need Commonwealth funds to be able to meet their obligations. Our funds have always been available on the basis of genuine restructuring, and that is simply what we have said 
 to them. It is a matter for them how they organise the labour to meet the contractual obligations required under those contracts.

I am giving the House a proper explanation of the Commonwealth's position in this matter, which is actually spelt out in the letter which we made public yesterday. What that does is allow these labour hire companies to enter into arrangements so that they can satisfy the requirements of the labour supply contracts. We have said, therefore, that whether people are members of a union or not is ultimately a matter for them. It is true that we sayânot in the letter, but it is clear from our public positionâthat we are opposed to anybody using their position to enforce, on an ongoing basis, a monopoly and requiring people to be members of the MUA. Of  course that is our position. That is always our position. That is the great political divide.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If you were the government, you would be saying to the administrators, `Set these companies up however you like but only on the basis that they are members of the MUA'âa clear breach of the Workplace Relations Act.

 pulsory unionism on the Australian waterfront.</para><para>This is a very interesting position. It is a requirement on the administrators to act in accordance with the Corporations Law.

If they reform, everybody is fully paid out their entitlementsâ100c in the dollarâyou get an efficient waterfront, people can be proud of the work they do as wharfies and, of course, it is good for the country. The real test now for you guys is: are you prepared now to publicly support the right of the administrators put in place, given the authority of Mr Justice North and the imprimatur of the High Court, to put these companies back on to a sound footing?

This is a visionary program designed to encourage young Australians to get to know the Asia-Pacific region better and to encourage people in the Asia-Pacific region to meet with, deal with, and themselves understand better, young people in this country. This is about engagement with our region at the people to people level. This is about bringing young people into the region from this country, helping them to understand it, helping them to build links and helping to create a pathway for Australia's future.</para><para>Formally, this will be announced in the budget. But as the member has pointed out, the Prime Minister made an announcement on 5 May about the youth ambassadors program. It includes funding of $10 million over two years, and that will provide places for 500 young Australians. These young people, under the age of 30, will have the opportunity to take up placements in areas such as government, business, and educational and community organisations around the region. Young nurses, engineers, plumbers, farmers, environmentalists, and so on, will be able to represent Australia abroadâand I know that 
 they will do so proudly and in a truly constructive way.</para><para>I regard this initiative as a particularly visionary initiative by this government. It is about doing things for this country's futureânot about the sort of grubby politicking that we are getting from the other side; not about the sort of irrelevancy of phone calls made from one person to another, and this sort of trivia. This is about doing things for the country's future. This is about us taking Australia forward in the Asia-Pacific region.</para><para>Whatever the Labor Party may sayâwhich on this topic, of course, is precisely zeroâinstitutions like Monash University are getting involved and supporting this project.

 illegal.' That will be the take-out from this particular sorry episode in Australian industrial relations history.</para><para>This censure motion is relevant of course on a number of grounds. We have all seen, and the public has had an opportunity to inspect, the public record now in relation to what has been done by this government in cahoots with the owners of Patricks to illegally deprive workers of their right to work. We have all seen that and, whatever the Prime Minister might say, there are ten judges who have come to a conclusion that there is a case to answer as far as these matters are concerned. We have all seen that.</para><para>One thing that all Australians including this opposition firmly believe in is the requirement for reform and competition on the waterfront. What the government is now trying to do is to wrap around itself a position that every Australian agrees withâincluding those on this side of the Houseâas an excuse to cover what has been one of the most manifestly incompetent and malevolent episodes in Australian industrial relations and political history.</para><para>What the public will not forgive the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) for is not so much his objectives; they will not forgive him for his incompetence and his unwillingness to acknowledge and understand that the course of action he chose to support was an illegal course of action. The Australian people above all expect their government to be a government of competence and a government of laws. That is what they expect of themâa government of competence and a government of laws.</para><para>This is not the first occasion on which we have had to call into question the competence of this government. We have had plenty of opportunities in that regard; 15 changes in nursing home policy, one disaster after another on employment policy and one bungle after another in public administration.</para><para>But this is the first time that the incompetence has been combined with illegality. It takes a position of true genius from a government with 75 to 80 per cent support in the public for waterfront reform to convert that 
 into 60 per cent opposition with it methodology. That is an act of true political genius by the Prime Minister and his Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business.</para><para>Only fumble farm over there could produce an outcome like that. Instead of using the fact that there is strong public sentiment for waterfront reform, the minister and this government chose to take a course of illegality. Why did they do it? They chose to do it because some time around about last March a number of people put up their hands in the business community and elsewhere and said, `What are you doing? You are an incompetent, weak government and as an incompetent and weak government we expect you to develop a degree of competence and get about waterfront reform. Get off your bike and get into it.' That is what they said.</para><para>What happened after that point of time was flat panic as far as this government was concerned. There was no investigation of what ought to be done sensibly to bring about change. Everybody on the waterfront was prepared to negotiate change. Everybody on the waterfront has been prepared to negotiate change repeatedly over the course of the last nine years or so. Everybody on the waterfront has been there for it. Only these incompetents can turn that willingness on the waterfront and that public sentiment behind it into a concern in the entire community about whether or not their jobs and their job security might not come under attack from 1970s style bottom of the harbour arrangements being officially approved by the government. What the government has touted in its own Workplace Relations Act as a right to work and a right to be in employment is, if you choose to be a member of a union, a right that does not exist against a government that no longer is in touch with its own laws. Only this incompetent minister could produce that outcome and only that Prime Minister, who spends more time chatting on radio stations and examining opinion polls than he does in administering this country, could let him get away with itâfundamental, utter incompetence.</para><para>Part of the mantra that they used to talk themselves into this mad, insane obsession 
 they have with the MUA is that somehow they confronted a situation where there had been no change and they needed to take this from the ground up and alter it. I ask the Australian public and the House this question: looking at Minister Reith's record and this government's record over the course of the last six months, do you think that they would have been capable of taking down the stevedoring work force, by consensus, from 10,000 to 3,700? Do you think they would have been capable of improving container rates by 75 per cent?</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Reith interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>âThese are BTCE figures, old sonânot ours. Do you think that this government could have reduced to one-fifth the cost of movement of bulk cargo across the waterfront and establish world's best practice on what is in fact about two-thirds by volume of our exports? Do you think they could have done that? Do you think they could have established company employment out of a situation which existed for 60 to 70 years as pooled employment? Do you think they could have established  company employment on the waterfront? No. I do not think that anybody in all honesty could look at the character opposite and say that he would have been capable of delivering that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What is he actually asking for in terms of improvements in container rates? He is asking for a 25 per cent improvement in container ratesâagainst all that. That is the gravamen of his positionâa 25 per cent improvement in container rates, on his own figures. Against everything that was achieved by the previous government since 1989 he asks for a bagatelle and he makes a meal of it. And he stands up in this place and quotes container rates achieved by the non-union work force on the waterfrontâbut Patricks was sending congratulatory letters out to its work force during the course of the last 18 months for doing five and six containers an hour better than those particular propositions. That is what he has managed to achieve. He has managed to achieve a sort of `value subtractal' in relation to the work force on the waterfront.</para><para>He has to live with this: in his own polling something like 10 per cent of the Australian 
 people believe him. He has almost broken the Abe Lincoln barrier; he has almost got himself down to beat the Abe Lincoln barrier, which is, `You can fool some of the people all of the time; all of the people some of the time; but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.' He has actually got to the point, the Abe Lincoln record, that as far as the public is concerned nobody believes him any of the time. He has compromised his government's position as a result of that. His malevolence and his competence and his complete inability to fathom what his obligations are in waterfront reform have got him to the sorry state that he is in now, where 75 to 80 per cent of the Australian people want waterfront reform and 60 per cent of the Australian people oppose the way in which the government has gone about it.

So this man who has managed to produce a situation where the public puts a question mark over waterfront reform is the character who still has to carry the argument. And what is his motive? Is his motive waterfront reform? No, and he has said it here again today. His motive is the destruction of the MUA. This is not a legal objective, this is not a democratic objective and it is not an industrially necessary objective. It is none of those things. Every single port in the United States, in Japan, in Singapore and in Europe with which the minister likes to compare Australia's situation has one thing in common with Australian ports and that is this: every single port has a single union of which all stevedores are membersâevery one of them. The public knows that the destruction of the MUA is not the sine qua non of waterfront reform; it is the political objective of the Liberal Party. And it is no wonder that the Australian public by a substantial margin do not support $250 million of their hard-earned cash going into the backing up of the political objectives of the Liberal 
 Party. They do not support that. And they also probably do not know that they should.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When we put our reforms in placeâand it was not $400 million worth of public funds that was spent; it was closer to $130 million to achieve all those reforms that I talked about a bit earlier onâwe arrived at that position on the basis, signed up to by the companies and the unions, that any further redundancies would be met from the situation that persisted after those reforms of company employment by the companies themselves. Why can it not be achieved in the case of Patrick's? Because this governmentâand this is one of the reasons why it should be censuredâhave said to Patrick's that as far as they are concerned they can restructure themselves in identikit sort of bottom-of-the-harbour type arrangements in order to remove their assets from their stevedoring companies.</para><para>There is no question at all about Patrick's being able to afford those redundancy payments if the totality of the company is considered. They can amply afford those redundancies if the totality of the companies involved is considered. But a legal piece of sharp practice which has been tumbled by the Federal Court and the High Court has placed at jeopardy $250 million worth of taxpayers' funds. I will quote Justice North, upheld six to one by the High Court, including appointees of the current government, on this subject:</para><para>There is also evidence that the Patrick owners and other companies in the Patrick group, together with others, agreed on these unlawful acts as part of an overall plan to replace the workforce with non-Union labour. This means that there is an arguable case that the Patrick owners and Patrick employers have engaged in an unlawful conspiracy.</para><para>Further on, the High Court judgment says that all parties to a conspiracy are liable as concurrent tortfeasors, and it is only necessary for one of the conspirators to have performed the act for an action to lie against all. If damages are recovered, each is liable for the whole amount. It is time, old son, for you to tell the Australian people whether they or you are going to pay for your personal area of liability. Are the Australian people going to have to pay for your personal incompetence? I think there will be one or two people over the next 
 few months who will be very interested in an answer to that question.</para><para>He talks about me evading questions on the waterfrontâlisten to his entire performance in question time today! Not one answer on any of the pointed matters put to him, all of which a parliament would be entitled to, all of which an independent inquiry would tease out, as far as the involvement of his government is concerned. Don't you remember him here, just before Easter, standing up and slapping everybody on the back for the wonderful thing he had doneâillegally sacking the work forceâwhich has caused the Federal Court and the High Court, conservative gentlemen and lady as far as legal matters are concerned to a person, to come down on top of him 10 to one, like a ton of bricks, to say that out there is a prima facie case for conspiracy which he has given the tick to in the course of the last six months?</para><para>Every time he has got up he has washed his hands: `I know nothing.' He produces a detailed bill on what we ought to do a day later but he did not know what was going on the day before; he just conjured that out of the atmosphere. He gets on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> and says, `We did not know anything about the suggestion to sack the whole work force. I have learnt about that in the last 24 hours.' Then people come out and present evidence that he has been involved in discussions of that matter for a good six months prior to that dateâone piece of evidence produced after another.</para><para>His totally mendacious performance is matched only by the incompetence and malevolence of his performance. The Australian people have tumbled him on this matter and he is now damaged goods, and is damaging the reputation of this government as a result of his incompetence. Nothing is more despicable in this debate than the way in which they exaggerate the outcomes of what they want to achieve in order to protect themselves from examination of their incompetence. Nothing is more demeaning of people who are supposed to be adults than taking that child-like approach to their own defence. Nothing is more insulting to those of us who are professional politicians, who have 
 been ministers for 13 years, than to watch one of their colleagues perform in the pathetic, mendacious and incompetent fashion that this minister has performed in.</para><para>Those of us who have actually made a few hard yards when it comes to a bit of microeconomic reform around here see the Australian public turned off its conviction that things ought to change not because reform is not achieved but because the terms and conditions under which they are employed are threatened, as indeed they are by what this government has chosen to do. That is a serious worry to ordinary Australians and it is a further serious worry that when somebody is faced with being illegally sacked they are then confronted by government approved guard dogs on the waterfront snapping and biting at them.</para><para>If you are talking about symbols of this period of time stamped on anybody in Australian politics as far as this whole exercise is concerned, guard dogs snapping on the waterfront is certainly going to be one of the symbols. You talk about things featuring in election advertising. You don't think that might not feature in the course of the next little while? We have got the rottweilers up there and the ad says: `Your entitlement to annual leave: snap. Your entitlement to a lunch hour: snap. Your entitlement to sick pay: snap. Your entitlement to long service leave: snap.' You do not think that might not make a bit of an advertisement about your behaviour in the course of the next election campaign if it is advertisements that you want to talk about, Minister? You are symbolised by the balaclava.</para><para>The other thing he does is exaggerate. What can be more important than exaggerating the effect of waterfront reform! Let us understand what he is struggling for: an improvement in stevedoring costs. Let us take farmers and the movement of fine wool. Let us take fine wool shifted by containers at today's price of 650c a kilogram. Stevedoring costs for fine wool are 1c a kilogram. Australian GDP is over $550 billion. If you accept the Productivity Commission statement as to what it costs us a year in efficiencies on the waterfront, it is $1 billion out of that $550 billionâ$1 billion 
 that it should not cost us if the position they put is indeed the case.</para><para>Compare that with another of your areas of responsibility, minister, about which we hear nothing: that of occupational health and safetyâthe cost to the GDP, $20 billion. That is 20 times the cost of what is supposed to happen as far as improvement of the waterfront is concerned. But do we hear anything from you on that? Not a word. Every action that you take as a minister for industrial relations, not just on this matter but on others, has been inimical to the interests of decent workplace occupational health and safety as you threaten the job conditions of every Australian worker by the illegal acts that you are prepared to sign up to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UNKNOWN</name.id><name role="metadata">An honourable member</name><name role="display">An honourable member</name></talker><para>âWho is next?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name></talker><para>â`Who is next?' said a colleague behind me.

It is indicative of the attitude of the Labor Party that they would present this censure motion today. Censure motions are supposed to raise matters of grave national importance. Instead, what the Labor Party have done is to reveal their partisan position in support of the MUA against the national interest. What the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) did not do was to acknowledge the problems faced by our country as a result of the inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront.</para></talk.start><para>I think people internationally are certainly looking at this dispute, but what they are wanting to know is whether Australia in the next century is going to have an efficient waterfront which will allow us to compete with the rest of the world. In the <inline font-style="italic">London Economist</inline>, for example, they said that the dispute in Australia reminded them of the agro-ridden Britain of the 1970s, and they are right to make that comment because the attitudes expressed today by the Leader of the Opposition, which are so evident in the conduct of the MUA, are really the attitudes of the 1970s in the UK and they are the left-over, remnant attitudes of a hardcore within the Australian trade union movement going back to the 1940s and 1950s. That is the truth of it. The world wants to know whether Australia is going to finally grasp this significant issue and make a difference so that our farmers, our exporters and our importers really are going to be able to compete against the rest of the world.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh, but the costs are only a few cents per pound of wool or whatever might be exported.' That really does reveal just a complete lack of understanding of the real problems here. Australia has something like $120 billion worth of goods going out by sea. A huge percentage of Australia's imports and exports go across the Australian waterfront.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">TANNER</name><name role="display">Mr Tanner</name></talker><para>âIn bulk.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr REITH</name></talker><para>âYes, a lot of it is bulk. In value terms, approximately 70 per cent of imports and 78 per cent of exports were transported by sea in 1995-96. They shipped approximately $120 billion worth of cargo in 1995-96, $62 billion of which was containerisedâ$62 billion worth of goods. It is in the container terminals where we have appallingly low levels of productivityâwhere Australia's reputation for reliability has been marred for years by high levels of industrial action, a lack of reliability and workplace practices which make us a laughing-stock. That is the issue. You are obviously entitled to raise any related matter but, in the end, the issue is whether or not Australia is going to go into the next century with a system that works. That is the issue. You say that the marginal 
 cost is therefore irrelevant. That is not the case.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">TANNER</name><name role="display">Mr Tanner</name></talker><para>âHe didn't say that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Reith, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr REITH</name></talker><para>âHe did say that, and I heard him say it. Take Jack Schmidt, for example, who runs the Riverland stockfeed business. He made the point that, as the feed leaves his farm gates, it is a competitive product. It is a quality product and can beat the best in the world. They produce that product. It goes out through the port of Melbourne in containers. It goes to, of all places, the dairy industry in Japan. They compete against the Americans who also have a reasonable product, and it is very important that they can compete with them in every aspect of the growing, the harvesting and the delivery of their product. As he said, when it comes to those delivery costs, including the stevedoring, they are at a cost disadvantage to the Americans.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is not just a few cents off per kilo or whatever the price measurement is; this can mean the difference between whether you are in business or not. This is not just a cent here or there; this can be a vital question of whether or not you get the contract in the first place. If Australia's reputation is that we are not a reliable supplier, then you miss out on the lot. That is why cost is important. Price is important, but so is our reputation for reliability.</para><para>I thought the figures that I read out during question time were very revealing when it comes to the impact of a less than reliable system. This is the impact calculated by the Productivity Commission on the shipping costs between Australia and the west coast of the US. What they say is that one of these companies runs seven ships whereas, if we had a more reliable system, they would need only six. So the extra ship is put on because of the lack of reliability in Australia. It costs that shipping line $US7 million per year, and who pays for that? We do. We all pay for it. That is lost export income and lost opportunities, and it makes us less competitive in those markets.</para><para>When we go back to the workplace practices, we can see how it is that	those workplace practices give Australia a reputation for being somewhat less than reliable. The level 
 of industrial disputes on the Australian waterfront is, by average, nine times the national average. That is the official figure from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The figure does not include every stoppage. In fact, the stoppages which are for an hour, two hours or four hours are just as damaging as an even longer stoppage because again there is a knock-down effect. The ships come out here and they go from port to port. Of course, if they are four hours or two hours late in each and every port, that all adds up to our reputation for being unreliable.</para><para>These guys take industrial action at the drop of a hat. In the case against Patricks, there has been something like 40 days plus of industrial action against them since near the end of January and early April. Only about nine of those days actually went into the official statistics. That gives a feel for the extent and constancy of industrial action. The wharfies take industrial action for just about any possible reason. During the first part of this year they took industrial action for a $4,500 a year wage increase. They are already on an average wage of between $62,000 and $101,000. They were taking industrial action to get a $4,500 increase and so as to be able to get all the rorts, inefficiencies and overmanning loaded into the base. That was the motive for the industrial action.</para><para>But not just for wage claims do wharfies take industrial action; they take industrial action for the most extreme reasons. For example, last year in Port Botany there was an argument over the billiard table. They threatened to close down Sydney because they wanted the billiard table re-covered. In Port Botany last year there was a pallet of toilets to be loaded. They took industrial action because they wanted embarrassment money. This is typical of this union.</para><para>They went back at Darling Harbour a week or so ago. They took industrial action on the day they went back. Do you know what one of their complaints was? Their complaint was that they did not want to wear safety vests because they had been worn by people who were not members of the MUA. They said to management, `We expect all the vests to be collected, put in plastic bags and burnt be 
 cause they were worn by people other than members of the MUA.' They demanded that the cranes be cleaned because scab labour had been driving the cranes. That is typical of the behaviour of these people which, in the end, gives Australia this shocking reputation for unreliability. As these shipping company figures show, it all adds up. The people who are disadvantaged are literally the thousands of Australian businesses, big and small, that rely on having an efficient waterfront into the future.</para><para>It is not just unreliability; it is lack of productivity. When it comes to productivity the figures coming out of the Productivity Commission report demonstrate that Australia is a long way behind an average world figure. The best in Australia is not as good as the  worst in New Zealand. That tells you in a simple way where we are at. There was a very good <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes</inline> programâI think it must have been last yearâwhere they put a camera on a ship that went from Auckland to Melbourne to Sydney. In Auckland they were doing 24 lifts an hour, when they got to Melbourne they were doing eight and by the time they got to Sydney they were doing 14. Could we do better? The lady whose story is in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> tells us that we can do better. She worked for the farmers and, as she said, they were doing 23 lifts an hour. As to the average in Sydney, there have been times this year in Sydney when those wharfies were running at 10 crane lifts an hour. Here is a young woman, the first ever to drive a container crane in Sydney. She is fully trained and she was doing double the rate they were doing in her first week on the Australian waterfront.</para><para>In terms of the productivity rates, the five-port average in Australia is 18.5. In Auckland it is 25. In places like Manila, Laem Chabang or Mozambique they do better than we doâthey do 25 to 30. As I said to John Coombs, why can't Australian wharfies do a decent day's work for a decent day's pay like wharfies anywhere else? Think of the average Australian small business person. They would give their right arms to have a job for $90,000 a year and 14 hours a week. What is the average Aussie farmer on? They are on an 
 average sort of income of $11,000 or $15,000. They really put in a decent week's work for that sort of money. What a comparison it makes. It is not a fair system that allows these people to rort the system to the disadvantage of all other Australians. That is all we are saying.</para><para>This has been an interesting dispute because of many aspects, but at the political and at the policy level it really has flushed out the Labor Party's position. Mr Beazley has had an opportunity to declare where he stands on some of these fundamental principles. We say it is a fundamental principle that, if you want to be in a union, then you should be allowed to be so. Similarly, if you do not want to be in a union, then you do not have to be. I cannot say it more simply than that. I cannot say it more plainly than that. That is the government's position. In fact, most AustraliansâI say three-quartersâthink that is a fair position. Yet, when it comes to the waterfront, Mr Beazley and the Labor Party adopt a different view.</para><para>When he was challenged on radio the other day, Mr Beazley ended up endorsing this position, namely, that the MUA is entitled to have a monopoly. The Labor Party's position is that it is okay and fair enough for people like John Coombs to be able to enforce compulsory union membership on the Australian waterfront. Why do they do that? I will tell you why they do that. It is because it allows the MUA, which has a significant influence within the Labor Party and the ACTU, to hang on to their stranglehold. They use that stranglehold: they use it for their own political purposes and to maintain rorts, inefficiencies and overmanning at the expense of every other Australian, and that is why we object to it. We think that, by all means, if you want to be in a union, that is fine, but compulsory unionism is not fine, a monopoly is not fine. We have been publicly opposed to and advocating that change for as long as I can remember and for as long as I have been in Australian politics. We will go on so arguing because it is in the national interest that we have real competition.</para><para>The second policy position which the Labor Party has publicly advocated is the abolition 
 of the Trade Practices Act provisions which place a ban on secondary boycotts. This is very important. I call these the Cheryl clauses because Cheryl, the star recruit of the Labor Party, voted for them in the Senate. These clauses in the Trade Practices Act prohibit people taking industrial action against their employer for a reason other than terms and conditions. In other words, you are not allowed to financially cripple your employer because you want to take industrial action for some reason other than the terms and conditions of your employment.</para><para>You are not allowed as a unionâfor example, the MUAâto take secondary boycott action on the Australian waterfront because you want to take action in respect of some other business off the waterfront. You are just simply not allowed to do it. You are not allowed to do it for the very good policy reason that you are not entitled to financially damage your employer.</para><para>We give people the right to strike; we think that is fair enough. It has to be constrained, it has to be reasonable, there have to be some rules about it; but if workers collectively want to take industrial action then they are entitled to do so. But you are not entitled to take secondary boycott action.</para><para>The Labor Party's policy today is to repeal those provisions. The one union in this country that will use that to the disadvantage of every other Australian is the MUA. It says much about the Labor Party. They are in here today with their shallow nonsense censure motion, when in fact their policy position is against the national interest; it is opposed to genuine reform and, therefore, reveals them for what they are, bound hand and foot to the MUA. We just reject this censure motion. We treat it with the contempt it deserves. The policy position by the Labor Party deserves contempt. The challenge for them now is: are they going to support the administrators, who now have the authority given to them by the courts, are they going to support reform or are they going to sit back and support the MUA and push those companies into liquidation?

not just in the dock in parliament, not just in the dock of public opinion; he is in a real dock. He is in the dock in court. He is a defendant in an unlawful conspiracy action and all that he can do, in response to this action, is plead the fifth. Again, today in question time and, again, in his contribution just then, he has had the gall to suggest that we might answer some questions. He has not answered any; not one single question has been answered.</para></talk.start><para>Let me remind the defendant of what is on the charge sheet, let me remind the defendant what he is facing. In March 1997 his own department sends him a minute suggesting that maybe they should consider  sacking the entire work force of the stevedoring companies in a way that there should be no appeal. On 30 July 1997 Stephen Webster starts as a consultant to the government. On the same day he contacts Michael Wells and says, `I want you to contact Chris Corrigan; he's got a job for you.' Wells subsequently does that and Corrigan starts the process with him of organising the recruiting of serving Australian soldiers to go and be trained in Dubai to replace an existing work force of people who are not on strike, who are not breaking the law, who are acting in accordance with their agreements and the award at that time.</para><para>Subsequently, there are phone calls between Wells and Webster, and then Webster says, `Okay, no more calls. I'm satisfied that things are going according to plan, it's all all right, no more calls.' Webster has given us several versions of what happened. Initially, he denies that he calls, now he accepts that there might have been some calls. But this consultant on $1,000 a day, what was he doing at the time? He was organising chauffeurs for people. The government was actually out there organising chauffeurs for businessmenâor so we are led to believe.</para><para>Then we get to the start of the process of asset stripping. We suddenly get Chris Corrigan rearranging and reconfiguring all these companies so that the employment of labour is separated from the ownership and the assets of the company. In December, the Dubai mercenaries fly out two days after 
 Peter Reith's own staffer and departmental officials meet with Patrick's and discuss how to sack an entire work force and what procedures to go through and, only a couple of days before, the government writes to Corrigan saying, `Don't worry, we will fund redundancies.'</para><para>In January, after the Dubai exercise has gone by the board, at least for the time being, the NFF Webb Dock operation starts up. Again, Peter Reith and John Howard do not know anything about this, but they endorse it. It is fine, it is all competition on the waterfront. The culmination of this sequence of events, this unlawful conspiracyâthis conspiracy that has been found to be prima facie unlawful by 10 judges to one in the Federal and High Courtâreaches its culmination in April when there are mass sackings, the dogs are brought in and the goons in balaclavas are brought in to take people away from their lawful jobs on the waterfront.</para><para>Subsequently, much to the chagrin of Mr Reith, the High Court and the Federal Court have found that there is a prima facie case of unlawful conspiracy. Their only answer to this charge is, `We're in favour of waterfront reform.' We had another 15 minutes of it from the minister today. `My only answer: waterfront reform.' Does this mean that anything that he is prepared to do, however unlawful, is justified? Answer, `No.' The Labor Party supports waterfront reform but we also support acting in accordance with the law; and that, manifestly, is what this minister and this government are not doing.</para><para>The real story underneath the facts that are emerging is this: the minister has approached the stevedoring companies and suggested, `How about sacking your entire work force?' He has appointed Stephen Webster as his go-between, as the coordinator of this exercise, and he has set up a deniability wall. He has said, `Look, I don't really need to know the details of what you're doing, because we might get into a bit of difficulty about this, so don't tell me the details but here's the basic strategy.' He has had other consultancies for people to lay the groundwork for the whole exercise. They have said to him, `Here is what the opinion polling says.' Mark Textor 
 has done his consultancy. Jonathan Gaul says, `Here's the media strategy, here's what you need to do. Just vilify these people, abuse them, tell everybody they're bludgers and rorters.' We heard more of it today, more nonsense. He does not respond when you point out that some of what he is saying is totally untrue and the rest of it is grossly distorted. No response, just more nonsense. There is the strategy.</para><para>You have Peter Reith, the minister, as the propagandist, and you have Chris Corrigan, the company, assisted by Stephen Webster, the consultant, as the people who do the dirty work. They are the people who actually orchestrate the corporate restructure, who orchestrate the soldiers off to Dubai, who orchestrate the mass sackings of the wharfies. The minister is able to stand up and say, `I didn't know anything about any of this. I have never heard of Dubai. I do not know anything about it.' Nobody believes him. He keeps repeating his mantra and nobody believes him.</para><para>Now it has all gone wrong. The Oliver North of Australia is in a bit of trouble. Peter Kilfoyle and Michael Wells are singing like birds. Stephen Webster is contemplating his future. John Howard is wriggling. He is evasive and refusing to answer questions. He just says, `This is all a joke. It's all boring all this sort of stuff.' Peter Costello is doing cute pictures for the magazines in his jeans. The trendy young Treasurer is there, he is very elegant. He is there preening himself and saying, `Look, I don't want to have anything to do with Pauline Hanson.'</para><para>So it is all going wrong for the minister and on top of that he now faces the threat of being personally liable for damagesâand he wouldn't answer that question, would he? He did not tell us today whether he has been slinking around the corridors to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), talking about indemnities. He would not respond to that question, would he? But at least we have to give him some credit for persistenceâmaybe not intelligence, but persistence. The High Court and the Federal Court found that prima facie he has acted unlawfully in breach of his own actâin breach of provisions that require 
 non-discrimination with respect to union membership. Yet what is he doing now? He is telling the administrator of the Patrick companies, `We will only give you money for redundancies if you guarantee that you are employing non-union members.' He does not appear to have learnt his lesson.</para><para>Oliver North was not that bright but he got caught only once: he did the wrong thing only once. Yet with this Oliver North no sooner is he out of court, having been found prima facie to have acted unlawfully, and he is doing it again. He is there saying, `We want what we call waterfront reform and the only way that we are going to go about it is to force de-unionisation'âbecause that is effectively what it amounts to.</para><para>In all of this he is still backing Chris Corrigan. He and the Prime Minister are still supporting Chris Corrigan. Today the Prime Minister was asked, `What have you got to say about a few of the things that Corrigan has been involved in?' He has admitted lying. He has called himself a desperate man. He said to the Industrial Relations Commission on 8 February, `I don't know anything about the financing of Dubai. I didn't do that.' Yet there is a letter of 8 Mayâsigned by Corriganâto the lawyers acting for Fynwest Pty Ltd that states:</para><para>Your clients have consistently failed to provide regular accounting and bank reconciliation details in respect of the loan provided by Patrick to Fynwest Pty Ltd.</para><para>The bank records that are attached to Michael Wells's affidavit make it abundantly clear. If you look through themâthey are from the Commonwealth Bank and are the usual sort of recordsâyou will see there is a reference, for example, to `9 January 1988: $140,000' from Patrick Stevedoring. Yet this man, whom the Prime Minister continues to support to the hilt, told the Industrial Relations Commission one month later that he had nothing to do with the financing of Dubai.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">An honourable member interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YU5</name.id><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TANNER</name></talker><para>âHe might possibly have forgotten but I think that is probably an unlikely scenario given the issues that were at stake. John Howard has wrapped his arms around Chris Corrigan and said, `If you're 
 going down, then I'm going down with you.' Has he held any inquiry? Has he condemned any of the actions that Corrigan has admitted to? Has he even distanced himself from some of the features of the dispute like the dogs, the batons and the security guards in balaclavas? No, all he has done is to say this is a jokeâany complaints and any concerns are a joke; it is all boringâand his own Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone)âthe person who is in charge of the Federal Police, the person who is supposed to administer the law with respect to matters such as perjury or giving unlawful evidenceâsays that Chris Corrigan should be nominated for Australian of the Year. There is something very strange going on here when the Minister for Justice is administering justice in this way. I wonder what she will say about Christopher Skase after that performance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We need to ask ourselves why all this is happening.

He is absolutely correct, but I think that particular dispute pales into insignificance in the Liberal Party pantheon of hatred when you look at `Pig Iron' Bob, because they were humiliated by the maritime union at Port Kembla, which said to them, `Japan is going to be at war with Australia within a couple of years; we should not be sending the raw materials for weapons to them,' and Bob Menzies said, `No, that is all right. We think they are nice people.' Of course, he was proved wrong.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair</inline> John Howard was asked why all the people in the smaller ports, who had not been on strike for years because there were no issues in dispute, had been sacked. His response: they were all members of the same union.</para><para>What does that tell you? That is the reason why they were dismissed, and that is why the Federal Court has found that the government and Chris Corrigan and the NFF are prima 
 facie in breach of Peter Reith's own act, because these people have been dismissed for one reason only: they are members of the maritime union. This has been compounded by Peter Reith's recent actions: not only have they done that but he is still in there boxingâpunch drunk, albeit, but still in there boxingâand saying to the administrators after he has lost in court, `Only give the redundancy money to these people if they are employing non-union labour.'</para><para>This whole exercise is not about waterfront reform and there is a very simple test, a very simple way of illustrating that, because waterfront reform is about a lot more than just workplace practices, a lot more than union membership and a lot more than labour. What have they done about new entrants and more competition on the waterfront? Nothing. What have they done about improving road and rail links to the ports and improving information technology links? The answer is nothing. What have they done about reducing port charges, something that our government was very successful on? Absolutely nothing.</para><para>What have they done about anti-competitive practices like the agreement that was allegedly there between the Port of Melbourne Authority and the two stevedoring companies not to have a third entrant? Again, absolutely nothing because they are interested in only one form of competition. Give them credit, because there is actually one type of competition they are keen on: competition between workers; individual workers standing up to say, `I'll do the job for $8 an hour, sir,' and another worker saying, `No, I'll do it for $7 an hour, sir.' That is the competition that they want. That is what `monopolies on labour' is code for. That is what that whole story is about. They want competition between workers: they want to go back to the old bull system; they want to go back to the hungry mile when workers had to compete with each other for a decent wage. Of course, when they are in a position of having to do that, they have got no hope, no serious bargaining powerâthat is what the government wants.</para><para>If ever there was a political scandal that needed a judicial inquiry this is it. We have a minister who has been found by a court and 
 subsequently by appeal courts to have been prima facie involved in a conspiracy to breach his own legislation. We have a Prime Minister supporting to the hilt a confessed liar who has admitted to acting illegally and who is accused of giving false evidence to the Industrial Relations Commission on oath.</para><para>We have a government refusing consistently to release key documents which are crucial evidence of this pattern of conspiracy. We have 2,000 workers, 1,400 of them permanent full-time workers, sacked in circumstances that I do not need to remind you of, and still under threat of not having jobs. And we have  a new low in corporate immorality and corporate skulduggery set by Chris Corrigan, with the active connivance and involvement of this government. Bottom of the harbour John Howard of 1982 in tax avoidance is now bottom of the harbour John Howard of 1998 in corporate law and industrial relations. There is a link, because it is precisely the same techniques that have been used and it is precisely the same pattern. What you do is separate the bits that you want to keep that do not involve any liabilities, where the assets are, from the liabilities and out they go. That is precisely the technique that is being used.</para><para>The Prime Minister cannot wriggle out of this one. He cannot just stand back and say, `Look, those ministerial guidelines that I had do not really mean very much anymore.' He cannot do a Senator Parer and redefine the notion of conflict of interest to a point where it actually ceases to exist. He does not have the ability to back away from this one. He must act. He must call an immediate independent judicial inquiry to go through all of the issues and to get to all of the evidence which has bit by bit been coming out in spite of all of the efforts to cover up by the government, to ensure that his government is acting honestly, legally and openly after what has been a pattern of two years of lies, deceit and conspiracy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>3006</page.no><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name><name.id>6K6</name.id><electorate>Forde</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) on this grandstanding motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley).

In a perfect world those two aims would not be mutually exclusive.

It is impossible. The Australian public know that. They can see very clearly that the MUA has had it too good for too long at the expense of thousands of Australian jobs over the years. They know that waterfront reform is crucial if we are to truly become a competitive nation in our region. The sad part about Labor's approach is that deep down the opposition leader and 
 all those opposite know that waterfront reform is crucial, but the point is that they know they cannot deliver it because they are beholden to the MUA and the union movement.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor opposition say, `We want waterfront reform,' but they failed to do anything substantial in the 13 years they were in government, except to spend $420 million of taxpayers' money. They say they want waterfront reform, but they are not prepared to actually take the tough decisions necessary to ensure lasting reform. That is a pretty comforting position, isn't it? Similarly, they say they want tax reform, but they do not have the guts to make any substantial changes to the current system. Those opposite are great advocates for tinkering around the edges, aren't they? They are great at crying, `We want, we want,' but we only have to take a look at their record in office to see that they are just no good at delivering.</para><para>The government, on the other hand, has been decisive, has been strong and has been determined in our push for waterfront reform. I would like to point out that the events of recent months do not represent the government's approach to reform. The Labor Party like to think they do because they think they can gain political mileage out of the difficulties created by the union picket lines and threats. But the fact is that the events of recent months are a direct result of the MUA's bloody-minded approach to maintaining their privileged monopoly and are a direct consequence of their senseless campaign to put their own employer out of business. Surely the past union leaders sitting opposite could have advised them better than that. When they could not produce productivity, the Australian public put them out of a job.</para><para>Those opposite conveniently forget that the government's approach to waterfront reform has been one of negotiation and discussions for over a year. We have been prepared to talk with the MUA but we have not been prepared to compromise on what is in the national interest. We have set in place seven crucial benchmarks to be met. Most importantly, we have set in place legislative arrangements to contain industrial action. Ironically, that was only possible with the help of Jennie George's 
 great mate and Labor's so-called star recruit, Cheryl Kernot. The point is that over the past two years we have discussed, met all parties, listened to everyone involved, but we have not been prepared to act contrary to the national interest. We have not been prepared to compromise on what is best for Australia. And why  should we compromise Australian jobs and Australia's international competitiveness because a handful of men want to protect their privileged positions?</para><para>The recent pickets by the MUA have succeeded in highlighting and magnifying the difficulties so many farmers and business people face in having to get their produce and their goods through the waterfront. The uncertainty of the last few months is merely a reflection on what these people go through year in and year out; reliability is the biggest problem that we have. Strikes, go-slows, stop-work meetings and containers piling up on our wharves are par for the course.</para><para>The recent action has magnified things though; it has touched many people in my electorate of Forde. There have been many examples. Some 7,000 people in Forde are employed in manufacturing and local business owners have told me that they are concerned that crucial exports will be lost as a result of uncertainties on the wharves.</para><para>A local backhoe operator has been unable to earn a living for nearly a month now because a crucial part he needed to repair his backhoe has been held up on the wharves. Many local produce and beef farmers in Boonah and Beaudesert have had to endure drought over the past few years and survive on a fraction of what the wharfies earnâthey now worry about getting their produce overseas. One local engineer who won a tender for excavation of a building site has been waiting on a vital piece of equipment which was not allowed off the dock by the MUA; he fears losing his contract. These are just a few examples of how the wharves are crucial and how the MUA, fully supported by Labor, is putting jobs at risk by refusing to be part of this reform process.</para><para>And there was the owner of a transport company who called me in tears. He explained how five of his trucks had been 
 damaged by picketers while trying to get their containers off the wharves in Brisbane. He and his drivers are just ordinary blokes trying to earn a living and having to endure the treatment that the sacked wharfies dished out to them. I can assure you that the wharfies won no friends there.</para><para>But, obviously, Labor consider their interests as second to that of the MUA. Just like the farmers do not matter, the small business people do not matterâall that matters is that the union bosses keep their stranglehold on power. That is why it amazes me that Labor have the gall to come in here and talk about the government's approach to waterfront reform. Their approach is to back the MUA. Let us look for a minute at the MUA's approach. The local transport company owner who had five of his trucks damaged by picketers is just one example. I am stunned that Kim Beazley has the gall to say he thinks that unions have conducted themselves pretty well. It is a real commentary on the nature of these people if he thinks that destroying property, spitting at people, hurling abuse at workers, making death threats and the like are examples of restraint on their part. I would hate to see what would have happened if they expressed their true selves.</para><para>We all saw footage of unionists with planks of wood going up to a truck approaching the picket line and wilfully damaging it. One could only imagine what they would have done to the driver if he had stepped outside of the cab. And of course there was the disgraceful use of children on the picket lines; that was simply inexcusable. The father had the opportunity to remove those children, but he did not seem to be concerned about their welfare when it came to yelling at police.</para><para>Closer to home, I had the opportunity to observe first-hand the thuggery of Labor's mates in the MUA when the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business visited my electorate last month. The minister was a guest speaker at the regional small business awards ceremony hosted by the Beenleigh Chamber of Commerce. It is an important annual event for locals and it was attended by over 500 small business people and their staff. This year these people, who 
 are hardworking, decent Queenslanders, had to run a gauntlet of abuse from unionistsâbussed in from Brisbane, I might add. They had to dodge eggs and many had their cars rocked and damaged. The local young children who were invited to sing and dance at the awards were also sworn at and their bus was pelted with eggs. These kids were as young as 12; they were naturally very scared. And Kim Beazley says that the unionists have handled themselves well.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>âThe Leader of the Opposition says.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Elson, Kay, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELSON</name></talker><para>âSorry, the Leader of the Opposition says that the unionists have handled themselves well. I can tell the opposition leader that on that evening there were several people there who identified themselves as long-time Labor supporters who came up to me and said, `Never again.' They said they will never support Labor while Labor supports violent, disgusting action like that. In fact, they were so outraged by the protesters behaviour that they have offered to hand out how-to-vote cards for me on election day, and I appreciate those offers.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have no doubt whatsoever that the majority of Australians condemn the MUA's approach to reform; they recognise how crucial waterfront reform is and they are disappointed, though not surprised, that Labor are putting their mates before the national interestâthat has always been their way though. That is why the MUA have been able to keep their stranglehold and their monopoly; that is why this country is so far behind our competitors when it comes to waterfront productivity and practice.</para><para>You had 13 years to do something about it, so do not come into this place and say you want reform then condemn the only government with enough guts to actually stand up to the MUA and work to achieve real reform. The government's approach on this issue is what is needed; your approach is to cave in to union demands. The Australian public and certainly the people of Forde know that we cannot continue to give in to the MUA. For Australia's sake, we have got to fix the wharves and that is precisely what this government is doing. I join with Peter Reith 
 and reject wholeheartedly the opposition's motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>3009</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Graeme, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMPBELL</name><name.id>CF4</name.id><electorate>Kalgoorlie</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI feel it necessary to speak in this debate because I do not think either side really comprehends the nature of the problem. The Labor Party wonder where it all started.  I can tell them: it started when Paul Keating embraced rational economicsâwhich is not an economic theory; it of course is an ideology. It is the ideology of big businessâmainly American big businessâto control world trade. Once the Labor Party endorsed that, then there was no hope; obviously the Liberals were going to endorse it because it looks and tastes like neo-classical economics. Of course it is not because big business colludes; it does not compete.</para></talk.start><para>When we heard the last speaker, the member for Forde (Mrs Elson), talking about the national interest, it really was absurd. I am concerned about the national interest. It was in the national interest that the government's 10-point Wik plan got to the Senate; weak and wishy-washy as it is, it was important it got through because it contains one important clause. It is quite clear the government could have got it through had they accepted the vote of Senator Colston. But, for some reason or other, this was not acceptable, a matter of principleâthe Parer principle I think it is probably called. But the fact is that, had they done that, we could have got that through. The government did not do it because they wanted a double dissolution election and now of course they are not so sure.</para><para>Kalgoorlieâthe centre of Australia's second biggest export industryâis grinding to a halt because of the government's action. Is that in the national interest?	The truth is that the waterfront is not Australia's big problem. It never was and it is an absurdity to suggest that it was. Off the top of my head, I would say that the increase in litigation in this country is costing a magnitude more than the wharf is, and that is being endorsed by people in this parliament. There are many things that need attending to before the wharf, but that is not to say that there are not problems with the wharf. </para><para>I was on a committee that looked at waterfront reform, and we found that the real problem is between the wharf and the warehouse. It is interesting to note that nothing has been done about our report. We noticed in the very congested port of Sydney, for instance, that the wharf worked 24 hours a day and the trucks worked 10. They stacked the containers up on the wharf, and Murphy's Law dictated that the first truck in the morning wanted the container on the bottom. You would see empty trucks going down to pick up containers and going away empty. It was a nonsense, and nothing has been done about that.</para><para>I know a little bit about the wharf because I have had to deal with the wharf and, in my youth, I had some altercations with the waterfront myself. Overwhelmingly, the rate of pay is 15 bucks an hour. At the port of Dampier it is $15 an hour and, if you do not get overtime in the Pilbara, you simply cannot exist. In Derby there are no waterfront workers because it is an automatic portâthe ship is loaded automaticallyâbut there the seamen, and it is the same union, take a tug 22 nautical miles out to sea and load on to other ships. It is a very neat operation. They are paid a daily rateâthey signed a workplace agreementâof $180, not big bickies by anyone's standard. I looked at their time sheets and noticed that some of them had been working 22Â½ hours a day, which is clearly outside any occupational health and safety standards. The mining company involved, Western Metals, is a very good company and they quickly got onto it and insisted that their operator fix this, and it has been fixed. These people are now back to working 12 hours a day at $18 an hourânot the big money that the minister is talking about. The figures the minister talks about are based on massive overtime. We talk about double-headers, but whose prerogative is that? If a company cannot arrange its work force to get over that, surely they must be the problem.</para><para>I was in Perth the other day promoting a new Australian grader which is so far ahead of anything in the world in terms of productivity and cost that it should be in every local government and every government depart 
 ment. I can assure some of the ministers here that they will be hearing about it. One of the people there had in his time been the CEO of the Port of Fremantle, and he was reminiscing about how they fought long and hard to get one union on the waterfront. He said it was a nightmare dealing with eight unions, and when they all consolidated into the MUA this was seen by the Liberal Party of the time as a great advance. He said, `No sooner had we done that than the government gave me 10 bureaucrats to negotiate with. So I got rid of eight unions and suddenly found myself with 10 government departments to negotiate with.' His figures were probably exaggerated, but the point he made was that he now had to arrange his working day to fit the travel arrangements and workings of a whole host of government ministers.</para><para>Most of Australia's product goes out as bulk commodities. We are the best bulk commodity shippers in the world. We are talking here about the liner tradeâcontainersâand it is mostly imports. It is my fervent wish that the wharf not be so confoundedly efficient because, with the policies of both the Labor and the Liberal parties destroying the manufacturing industry in this country, the waterfront is just about the last line of defence we have and, sadly, they have let us down.</para><para>We hear about the farmers. I represent a lot of primary industry. The farmers have no real interest in waterfront reform; they are overwhelmingly bulk shippers and they have fairly good arrangements in this regard. The National Farmers Federation does not represent farmers. It is hard to say what it does represent. If it represents anybody at all, it probably represents peak councils in Australia which, in turn, are very unrepresentative. I think it also has a large component of agribusiness, but it certainly does not represent the family farm. Indeed, NFF stands for `No Family Farms' because its policies will see the advent of big business.</para><para>The NFF recommended to this government that they allow in Brazilian orange juice concentrate. Its idea was that there would be winners and losers but that this would benefit the wheat, wool and beef producers. I repre 
 sent those people and I know that the demise of orange growers is not going to benefit my constituency one little bit. As one wheat grower said to me, `Where are we going to send our second-grade wheat when the NFF kills the pig industry through support of pork imports?' The NFF has consistently  attacked smaller domestic farming operations in pursuit of what it sees as the bigger picture. The truth is that as you diminish the whole rural constituency you diminish the power of the rural vote, and that is not in the interest of any farmer.</para><para>It is true that there were a few farmers who went down to the waterfront. Sadly, just like the unions, there are some very stupid people involved. I represent a lot of farmers and they have seen through this and resent very strongly the suggestion that farmers are backing the NFF or that the NFF represents them. When I was at the PNG conference recently, overwhelmingly people were saying to me, `We want no part of this,' because they knew it was not in their interest.</para><para>What has this government done? Look at the speed with which this government rushed off to war against Iran and immediately put at risk a $1.2 billion trade surplus with that part of the world. That trade surplus was overwhelmingly in agricultural produce, yet this government was prepared to put that at risk. I asked John Howard directly whether he was prepared to compensate farmers, and the answer was no. It was highly predictable that American longshoremen would act against Australian agricultural produce. Do you think that American farmers are going to say, `Oh, no, we believe in free trade'? They are going to endorse the actions of those longshoremen because it is in their interest to do so, and anyone who thinks otherwise is talking nonsense.</para><para>Let us get down to it. We are told there are great reforms to be had on the waterfront. I am told by Patrick's that the cost of moving a container across the Australian waterfront is about $200. It is obviously cheaper in other places, but in some places in Europe it is also significantly dearer. But that is a figure. Now $200 as a value of the contents of that container is not very much, but it is worth hav 
 ing. If you were to get a 50 per cent improvementâwhich I think is probably impractical for a whole host of other reasonsâdo you really think the customer will get that $100? Of course he will not. It will go into the pocket of the stevedores because the stevedores have the monopoly. That must be realised. The MUA at least had to share the monopoly. If you take them away, the stevedores will have the monopoly entirely on their own.</para><para>This whole thing is an absolute nonsense. It is not in the national interest. It is one of these issues which the government picked because they saw it as a soft underbelly. They thought they could get public support, but the Australian public are more intelligent than that. Today they are better educated, and they knew, they sensedâeither intellectually or ideologicallyâthat the government were lying. The government were not being honest in this transaction.</para><para>If you really want to improve the efficiency of Australian ports, you would close down a large number of the ports in Australia. This would certainly increase efficiency. But which state is going to volunteer to lose its ports? I suggest that none of them will. And why should they? You will improve the efficiencies of the ports, but you will increase the costs to the state. Nobody ever saved money by taking stuff off ships and putting it on rail. Certainly you would get stuff across the wharf quicker, but the result to those states which had forgone their ports would be a higher cost. It is a geographical fact that in Australia we have all these ports, and as a consequence they are not going to get the efficiencies.</para><para>I have stood on the dock at Singapore and watched them unloading. A panamax loaded to the gunwales with 30,000 tonnes of containers would come in and unload bang, bang, bang, one after the other. It was very efficient. When they come to Australia they use small boats. If you get down to the wharf in Fremantle, as I have, you can see them having to lift a container because it is going to Launceston, take off the one underneath because that is for Fremantle and put the one for Launceston back on. When it gets to Adelaide there is the same procedure. That is 
 one container movement. So you are never going to get those efficiencies.</para><para>At the end of the day, it is not a big problem in Australia. What the government has done, in trying to make this an issue, is that it has made it a political issue, an ideological issue. What it has done is divided Australia and played into the hands of one of the great problems besetting this country: that is, the growing dichotomy between rural Australia and urban Australia. Here we have a nation where the major cultures are growing apart because of lack of understanding, and it is being exacerbated by this government. It is playing right into that. That is surely not in the national interest.</para><para>We have seen the nation divided against itself this way. We are seeing it constantly as a result of policies which flow directly from the policy of rational economics endorsed by Paul Keating, the great architect, the great prophet of this nonsense policy. If the Labor Party goes down this road, what hope does this nation have? That brings me to my concluding remarks. The reality in Australia today is that there is very little difference between Labor and Liberal.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8I4</name.id><name role="metadata">MARTIN</name><name role="display">Mr Martin</name></talker><para>âHow can you say that after this?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>CF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Graeme, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>âBecause the policies you pursue are only a matter of proportion. When the government point out what happened to the airline pilots, they have an uncomfortable truth about them. There is no doubt about that. Workplace agreements were brought in by the Keating government, and this is only an extension. It was bound to happen. When you look at the native title debate, the government are putting forward a wishy-washy bill. The Labor Party, in their absolute hypocrisy, are opposing what they thought was in their own billâin fact, what was in their own bill but which was knocked out by the Federal Court. All this government are doing is putting that same condition back in the bill but not in the hands of the tribunal. But the Labor Party seeks to oppose it because it is not in the national interest. There is little difference between you. If you listen to that debate, one after another the bleeding hearts on the other side were indecipherable 
 from your own left wing. That is an absolute fact of life.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I make the point that the wharf is not the great problem the government says it is, it is an annoyance in some areas. I have found the union to be very open  to negotiation. This union is not homogeneous either. I can remember when there was a refusal to transport uranium through the port of Darwin. I went to see the waterside workers at Wyndham and they said, `No problems, bring it here.' I suspect it was the threat of Wyndham that made the wharfies in Darwin see some sense. When we had to bring radioactive material back into Australia because it was inadvertently exported by Western Mining to Singapore, I had no trouble negotiating with the wharfies in Esperance to bring it back through Esperance. It would not come back through Fremantle, but through Esperance it was all right. So the union itself is much more reasonable, much more open to negotiation and by no means as united as the government and the opposition portray it to be. This is a nonsense. The wharf is not Australia's problem.

 have been incurred to date in installing these flags and what additional costs are forecast? I also ask: are these flags to be replaced by larger flags and, if so, why and what costs are associated with this decision? Further, is it a fact that the flags had to be ironed before they were hung in the chamber? Will these flags be replaced daily, as happens with other flags in the chamber?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3013</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the honourable member for Hunter for his question. The answer to his last question is no. It is for that reason that flags have been mounted outside the members entrance to the chamber. These are the flags that will be provided for members to present to their constituents, as they have in the past. They are a lot easier to get down and get up.</para></talk.start><para>Regarding the second question, I do not know whether the flags were ironed. I do know that we are going to trial larger flags tomorrow. The degree to which costs have been incurred is still highly problematic. I do not know how much they will be. They are all trials. Indeed, one of the concerns we had was to try to ensure that the architects looked at mounting them in such a way that nothing would be absolutely fixed. You will notice that the mountings are such that they can be removed. I would have preferred it had they been at right angles but, in order to maintain the design symmetry with the slope of the roof, I was told it was better that they went at that particular angle. The purpose is to make them a more permanent feature of the building in the same way as the flag pole is the centrepiece of the whole building. It is obviously desirable that we do not have things part of this building that appear to be there only temporarily. If at any stageâand, from my point of view, God forbid itâthere were to be a change to the flag,  presumably they could be very easily changed at that time.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CHAMBER: CHANGES</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3013</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3013</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere are a number of obvious difficulties when trialling anything in this place. We cannot trial something unless the House is sitting. The sound system today was unsatisfactory and I apologise to mem 
 bers for that. At the same time, the fact that Hansard, where they are presently placed, cannot hear satisfactorily demonstrates how unsatisfactory the acoustics of this chamber are. I must admit, to the chagrin of most of us, that people in the gallery cannot hear about 50 per cent of the proceedings, and that is unsatisfactory. There are further processes under way to see whether that can be improved, but I have asked that the undue amplification which was a product of today's proceedings be reversed.</para></talk.start><para>Over the next two days Hansard are going to trial a number of different positions in this place. The advantage of Hansard not being seated at the table in front of us is that it makes that end of the chamber far more part of the chamber.

 Commons and that was to maintain the two sides of the chamber within two sword lengths, if you like to use the old jargon, of each other and had the two sides, therefore, far closer. Unfortunately, that was not adopted. I have looked at the whole question. As you will recall, in the building of this chamber there was a good deal of concrete poured so the capacity to narrow the chamber is really going to be astronomic in its costs. It therefore is not, at least at this stage, practicable. I have looked at moving this chair to the same place relative to where it was in the old chamberâif it is practicable and if the cost is reasonable; I will report to the House before anything is doneâwhich would mean that it would be advanced forward so that the rear would be just in advance of the middle of the advisers' chairs.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4T4</name.id><name role="metadata">MELHAM</name><name role="display">Mr Melham</name></talker><para>âThey will come at you from behind, then.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOne gets used to that, even in the National Party. There are problems with the design of this place if you look at trying to revamp it to make it work. Obviously nothing will be done until a costing has been made. In answer to the honourable member for Bruce, the bar table would not be narrowed; it would be a matter of moving the bar table to the west, if you like to think of the members' forum in that direction, and everything moved forward. Whether that would work I do not know.

He has put more spin on this Auditor-General's report, <inline font-style="italic">Preliminary inquiries into 
 the Natural Heritage Trust</inline> , than Shane Warne.</para></talk.start><para>This report actually indicts rather than clears the government. The Auditor-General's report vindicates the opposition's highlighting of the funding imbalance where $9 out of every $10 went to coalition electorates. In his report, the Auditor-General states that neither DPIE or Environment Australia challenges Labor's analysis of that point. The report confirms Labor's highlighting of the degree of ministerial intervention in the process. It states that, notwithstanding the circulation of extensive selection criteria:</para><para>. . . the emphasis placed on particular criteria by Ministers was greater than expected by applicants, RAPs, SAPs, State and Territory Ministers and the Departmentsâ</para><para>their own departmentsâ</para><para>for the 1997-98 funding round.</para><para>In other words, the published criteria cannot explain and do not justify the decisions that the minister has made. We were absolutely right in pointing out the unrepresentative nature of the composition of the panel. The ministers have in fact agreed to make changes for the next round.</para><para>Labor's concern that the Natural Heritage Trust must be improved if environmental priorities rather than political priorities of this government are to be addressed is vindicated and justified by this report. This report is not a clearance. In fact, the ANAO concludes that there is scope to enhance the geographic reach. In other words, this program did not distribute funds equally around Australia on the basis of environmental need. To the extent that the Auditor-General appears to clear the outcome, the opposition stresses that he attributes the flaws in the program to the structure of the selection process. The Natural Heritage Trust is, on the description of the Auditor-General, a submission driven scheme at the mercy of a process which was grafted on to existing rural landcare and catchment programs.</para><para>A national government that was truly proposing a national scheme intended to address national environmental programs would have ensured that funds went to all areas of need and should have avoided the 
 situation where already established groups were disproportionately able to take advantage of that first round. By the time the ministers acknowledged that there was an imbalance and that the community assessment panels had to be made more representative, the first round of funds of almost $200 million had been underwriting the coalition's electoral and political imperatives of this cycle.</para><para>One of the concerns the opposition had, and which we put vigorously, was the level of ministerial intervention by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) once recommendations were put to him after this exhaustive, costly and so-called independent process. We recognise the Auditor-General addressed himself to this particular concern, but we note with particular interest the very guarded language the Auditor-General used in relation to, for example, the notorious Woodhouse Pastoral Company Baillieu project when he said:</para><para>While on balance the project would appear to be eligible, judgement is required to interpret the extent to which there is a `clear and substantial public benefit'. The evidence would appear to support the eligibility of the project . . . </para><para>We really have to feel sorry for the Auditor in his gymnastic language covering up what we always thought was a pretty smelly funding decision. The Auditor-General acknowledges some projects resulted from direct representations from the proponents to the Minister for the Environment, but no indication is given as to how ministerial approval was prompted and finally obtained for the Woodhouse Pastoral Company. The minister has never, under direct questioning in the Senate, offered up any answer. In this context it is worth noting that the ANAO chose not to examine the records from the offices of the ministers. Had that been done, it may have shed some light on this matter.</para><para>Our concerns about the funding dispersal ratios are vindicated in table 6. I urge all those who are genuinely interested in some sort of impartial assessment of this report to go to table 6. Look at table 6 and see how and where those funds were expended. Table 6 precisely matches the allegations the opposition made. Nothing has been said or offered in explanation for the case where apples were 
 compared with apples. In regional Labor held seats and regional coalition held seats the extraordinary funding bias is five to one in favour of the coalition. Nothing has been offered in explanation for the rural Labor seats being disadvantaged on a ratio of two to one.</para><para>The process may have been transparent, but so too is the political bias. The opposition does not resile from having raised legitimate concerns in the public interest. My colleague in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, will be having discussions with the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine with a view to addressing how such structural difficulties can be addressed by the parliament as this fund is an ongoing matter.</para><para>An advance copy of this report was provided to the pressâthe government did not have the courtesy to provide it to the opposition. Reports in the media already show that the coalition will use this as a vote buying exercise in its constituencies in the period of time in the run-up to the upcoming election.</para><para>We will be asking the Auditor-General to look at this very closely. The government have got what they call a preliminary report. The full report will be presented in 1999. There are outstanding questions to be addressed. This imbalance, which the Auditor-General acknowledges and clearly states in annexure 6, is a reprehensible condemnation of a distortion of a program that ought to have been properly addressed to national environmental programs. Instead it has been allowed to run off the rails so as to advantage coalition held electorates as opposed to national environmental needs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>3021</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Keefe, Neil, MP</name><name role="display">Mr O'KEEFE</name><name.id>CE4</name.id><electorate>Burke</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Speaker, on indulgenceâMinister, during your observations you made several references to me, so let us go straight to the heart of them in the little bit of time I have got. Remember the debate about the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) and me? The question was: what is the difference between the electorate of Corangamite and the electorate of Burke? The answer is that there is a $600,000 difference in grants. What is the difference between the member for Corangamite and me? He is a member of the coali 
 tion; I am a member of the Labor Party. Same environmental issues, same state, same electorate sizeâall the issues are identical, but there is a $600,000 difference in funding. We put this on the table.</para></talk.start><para>As the Auditor-General has said, there is an overwhelming number of cases. Let us have a look at the rest. Let us also see why the government avoided a proper debate on this today. Let us also put the government on notice that we expect that in the budget tonight it will announce another round of funding under the Natural Heritage Trust. The government is well and truly on notice that the same scrutiny will apply. If the same bias turns up, the same campaign will be run on it.</para><para>I want the government to remember this: we knew about this six months before the event. We had people inside the government circle telling us the way the process was being set up to rort these grants. The fact of it is that we knew that the recommendations from the ground, the recommendations from the state based authorities, would be overturned in the minister's office. That is what the Auditor-General has found. He has found that both ministers have exercised an extraordinary amount of ministerial discretion in the allocation of these grants. A better example could not be found than the difference between Burke and Corangamite.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>3021</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Capital and External Territories Committee</title><page.no>3021</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Presiding Officers' Further Response</title><page.no>3021</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3021</page.no><name role="metadata">Mr SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the Presiding Officers' further response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled <inline font-style="italic">A right to protest</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>The report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories entitled <inline font-style="italic">A right to protest</inline> was presented to both Houses in June 1997.

We had lost our wayâour budget, under Labor, was $10.3 
 billion in deficit. Government debts had grown nearly $80 billion over five years. Looking out to the next century there was just a haze of deficit upon deficit and climbing ranges of debt which hemmed us in and closed off our future opportunities.</para><para>Australia needed direction. Australia had to change its way.</para><para>So our Government laid out a map. We marked out the places we wanted to get to. We identified the goals we wanted to achieve and we put down a timetable so we could measure our progress. So we could stay on track.</para><para>We wanted to get the budget out of deficitâout of the red and into the blackâin three years. We wanted to stabilise our growing debt then halve it (in proportion to GDP) in five years. We wanted to achieve our goals not by raising taxes but by spending taxpayers' money more efficiently and well.</para><para>That was two years ago. This coming year is the third year of the journey. We will finish the first leg in good shape. We have achieved our goal. Our budget is now in surplus. We are back in the black. We are back on track.</para><para>The Commonwealth budget will be in surplus in 1998-99âa surplus of $2.7 billion.</para><para>When we set out on this journey we knew it would be a tough road. If it were otherwise our predecessors would have taken it. And in many respects the road has become tougherâwith the severe turmoil in the Asian region.</para><para>But we all know that worthwhile achievement requires work and dedication and we have never lost sight of our goals.</para><para>The burdens were shared and the benefits will be shared. It was something that all of usâas Australiansâhave achieved together.</para><para>And now we set out on the second leg of our journey.</para><para>Our second leg is to pay our way now and set up opportunities for the future by repaying Labor's debt.</para><para>Repaying the debts of the past will secure the jobs for the future. Lower debt means lower interest payments. Our taxes will be lower and they will go on new services, better services, improving living standards, rather 
 than servicing the past debts and the past failures.</para><para>We are now well on track.</para><para>In fact today we can map out even more exciting possibilities. The Government's sale of one third of the equity of Telstra gave millions of Australians the opportunity to share in the ownership of this companyâmums and dads, employeesâmany people who have never owned a share before in their lives.</para><para>The Government proposes to sell the further shares in this companyânot because we need to balance the budget. The budget is already balanced. But a once only sale will let us get a once only reduction in our debt burdenâa once only opportunity to reduce net debt to 1Â½ per cent of GDPâto wipe out Labor's debt for good. This would put the Commonwealth, at the Centenary of Federation, back in the strong position it had in the mid 1970sâin its best position in twenty-five years.</para><para>I said earlier that the burdens that have been shared mean that the benefits will be shared.</para><para>When we began this journey two years ago mortgage interest rates were 10Â½ per cent. Now they are closer to 6Â½ per cent. These are the lowest home mortgage rates since 1970. For the average Australian home buyer this represents a saving of $320 per monthâthey are $3,800 per year better off.</para><para>And low home interest rates means the affordability of housing has, according to the HIA index, improved by 24 per cent over the last two years. What this means is more young Australians, more young families can buy their own home and get a start in life.</para><para>Young people and families are sharing the benefits of good economic policy.</para><para>Two years ago small business overdraft interest rates were over 11 per cent. Now they have come down to 7.7 per cent. These are the lowest rates for small business since the 1960s. At the start of the decade, under Labor, small business interest rates were 20.5 per centânearly three times the current rate. Small business is sharing the benefits of good policy. </para><para>If we had not acted to repair the nation's finances, if we had not acted to lock in low inflation, if we had not been able to enjoy lower interest rates, if we had not been able to help small business, jobs would have been lost. But these measures have allowed new jobs, better jobs to be created. Employees are sharing the benefits of good policy.</para><para>There are now more Australians in work than ever before. Whilst unemployment is too high, it is now the lowest it has been in Australia since 1990âthe lowest in eight years, the lowest since Labor's recession. That was the recession we did not have to have. Finally, we are over it.</para><para>CHALLENGES</para><para>In my first Budget Speech two years ago, I said that unless we acted decisively then ". . . Australia would be dangerously exposed to shifts in the international outlook . . . "</para><para>We did not know then that the Asian region would, as happened late last year, experience its greatest financial crisis ever and its largest downturn in economic growth since the oil shocks of twenty-five years ago. We did not know then that the Asian region, which for decades has been an engine for growth in Australia, would become a brake on our growth.</para><para>But we knew that prudent management meant we should strengthen the Australian economy against shocks outside our control. And we did. And it is now clear what an important decision that was. Our critics opposed us. Labor, which had put Australia in deficit, fought to keep it there. We are fortunate their views did not prevail.</para><para>In the midst of the turbulence of the region, Australia's economic growth will remain strongânot as strong as it could have been without this external downturn, a downturn beyond our controlâbut Australia will have one of the highest growth rates in the developed world. Importantly, Australia will be the strong economy of this region. Our economic fundamentals are as good as they have been for twenty-five years: low inflation, low interest rates, good growth, falling unemployment, falling debt and a budget swinging into surplus. </para><para>It is important to remember that this is the result of a coherent policy framework:</para><para>		 a new framework for the conduct of monetary policy with an agreed inflation objectiveâset with the Reserve Bankâkeeping inflation low;</para><para>		 a Charter of Budget Honesty recognised as a standard setter by the International Monetary Fundâimplementing the best practice in the worldâkeeping the budget on track;</para><para>		 a leading edge reform of the financial sector which has proven strong and will be strengthened further under new institutional arrangements flowing from the Financial System (Wallis) Inquiry; and</para><para>		 a programme of Corporate Law Reform that will make Australia one of the most efficient, stable, reliable centres in the world to do businessâdirected to our objective of promoting economic growth and jobs.</para><para>But the turbulent events of Asia in recent times should remind us of the need to continue to work to strengthen our future. While many hard yards have been covered, many more have to be travelled to improve our tax system, to improve our ports and wharfs, to keep our focus on a stronger economy and jobs, to maintain our commitment to help families, the elderly, and those in regional and rural Australia.</para><para>BUDGET OUTCOMES</para><para>Mr Speaker, we have turned around the nation's finances without increasing the tax burden on Australians.</para><para>For the third time in a row, tonight I announce that there will be no increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax, no increase in the petrol excise.</para><para>The uplift factor for provisional tax in 1998-99 will be reduced again one further percentage point to 5 per cent, half the rate that applied under Labor at the beginning of this decade. This will save business and individuals around $75 million in provisional tax instalments in the forthcoming year.</para><para>We are putting the nation's finances in order by being careful with government spendingâtargeting the areas of need, whilst eliminating rorts and wastage. In the social security area alone, in the first eighteen months of the Coalition Government more than $600 million was repaid by people who had received more than their entitlements. In 1996-97, $28 million a week was saved by cancelling payments to those who were not entitled to them.</para><para>Budget outlays as a proportion of GDP are expected to fall from around 27 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to below 24 per cent by 2000-01. This represents an outcome not achieved since the early 1970s.</para><para>And careful management of the nation's finances has allowed us to redirect spending to those with greater need.</para><para>Care and Support for Older Australians</para><para>Mr Speaker, the Government has already demonstrated its strong commitment to older Australians.</para><para>This is the only Government that has, by legislation, set the benchmark rate of the age pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This means that although the Consumer Price Index did not increase last year, the rate of the age pension did. This delivered an increase in the pension of $6.80 per fortnight in March 1998. The Government has also provided for this increase to flow to the recipients of War Widows' pensions.</para><para>This Government also delivered tax fairness to the self-funded retiree. The Government has now introduced, in full, the availability of the pensioner tax rebate to self-funded retirees. Self-funded retirees now pay no more in tax for the same income than do pensioners. This allows a qualifying single self-funded retiree to earn up to $12,163 without paying tax.</para><para>Starting from 1 July 1998, the savings rebate will reduce tax on savings by 7.5 per cent and by 1 July 1999 reduce tax on savings by 15 per cent up to the first $3,000 of income.</para><para>The Government has decided that from 1 January 1999, a Gold Card for health care will be made available to an additional 50,000 
 Australian World War II veteransâthose who faced danger from hostile forces during that war. This measure, which costs around $500 million over four years, recognises the significant contribution made by Australia's war veterans. A grateful nation acknowledges the debt we owe them.</para><para>The Gold Card provides the veteran with free treatment as a private patient with choice of doctor or medical practitioner in hospital, together with a wide range of other services such as optical, dental, physiotherapy, podiatry and chiropractic services free of charge. These services are provided whether the conditions treated are service related or not. Gold Card holders receive the pensioner concession on pharmaceuticals. They are not required to pay the Medicare Levy. Their treatment is free.</para><para>This Government wants to encourage people to save for their own retirement. And so it is determined to support those retirees who through thrift are now living from their own savings.</para><para>To further encourage and support self-funded retirees, I announce tonight that eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card is to be expanded from 1 January 1999.</para><para>The income test threshold for the card, which will be based on taxable income, is to be increased from around $21,000 to $40,000 per year for singles and from around $36,000 to $67,000 per year for couples. This change, costing $190 million over four years, is expected to allow some 220,000 additional self-funded retirees to qualify for the Seniors Health Card.</para><para>It will enable cardholders to purchase eligible pharmaceuticals for $3.20âthe same concessional rate as pensionersâwith any prescriptions above 52 within a year being available free of charge.</para><para>1999 is the International Year of Older Persons. A Government programme which will focus on implementing practical initiatives for improving the health and well-being of older Australians and recognising their contribution to the community and nation is being put in place to mark this occasion.</para><para>A Healthy Australia</para><para>Mr Speaker, the Government is also building a stronger health system.</para><para>Under Australian Health Care Agreements, Commonwealth funding available for public hospitals will increase by $2.9 billion over the next five years. In total, this will increase funding nearly 15 per cent in real terms and bring Commonwealth spending to $30.2 billion over the five year period. As part of this, the Commonwealth has taken on the full cost of purchasing veterans' health care, which is separately funded at $150 million per year. The extension of the Gold Card to an additional 50,000 veterans, separately funded for free treatment as private patients, creates additional places in the public system for others.</para><para>Health Care Agreement funding will ensure that public patients receive free access to public hospitals, and will facilitate reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health services. This demonstrates the Government's strong commitment to the public hospital system.</para><para>Earlier this year, the Government announced a range of measures to enhance the care of older people staying in the community, and to provide greater recognition and support for carers. The Government's package <inline font-style="italic">Staying at Home</inline>â<inline font-style="italic">Care and Support for Older Australians</inline>, announced in April, will assist elderly Australians to remain independent and live in their own homes with additional care and support.</para><para>The measures, costing around $280 million over the next four years, will see the number of people receiving assistance through Community Aged Care Packages to stay in their own home double to 22,000; they expand eligibility for the Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit; they will establish another fifteen Carer Respite Centres to give those caring for older people the chance for respite and help them to look after elderly relatives; and they provide additional respite care places for people with dementia.</para><para>This year, the Commonwealth will also provide increased funding for the States of $130 million over five years under the new 
 Commonwealth State Disability Agreement. This will provide for additional accommodation support services for people with disabilities. This funding is in addition to the $54 million in extra funding which was provided in the 1997-98 Budget.</para><para>Our efforts to improve the health of Australians do not end there.</para><para>Tonight, I am announcing the provision of around $80 million over four years to enhance preventive health programmes. This will fund a number of new programmes, including:</para><para>	 a free annual influenza vaccine to all Australians over 65 in order to treat this preventible illness, as recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council; and</para><para>	 a $6.1 million programme to reduce tobacco-related illness including school education campaigns to warn our children of the dangers of smoking.</para><para>Following the successful introduction of Medicare claims units in pharmacies in rural Australia, the service will be extended to outer metropolitan and growth areas. Two hundred new units will open in pharmacies to allow people to access Medicare refunds from their local chemist.</para><para>Foster parents, who generously give love and care to children, will be entitled to have a Health Care Card for the child, if the child qualified in his or her previous family, to use for health expenses. This recognises the important role of carers and the health needs of those who are cared for by them.</para><para>The Government's commitment to medical research is demonstrated by our decision tonight to provide additional on-going funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council at a cost of around $175 million over four years. This provides longer term certainty for the health and medical research industry, and will encourage those with research skills to participate or continue in medical research.</para><para>Expenditure on diagnostic imaging has grown significantly in recent years. Although this growth was slowed by measures introduced in the 1996-97 Budget, further reforms are needed to ensure that growth does not become unsustainable. The Government will 
 be working with peak professional bodies to constrain diagnostic imaging expenditure.</para><para>The Government will also be taking steps to ensure that abuse and waste in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is minimised, through enhancing the compliance activities of the Health Insurance Commission and the development of education and awareness programmes.</para><para>Youth, Education and Training</para><para>A key priority of the Government has been to expand employment opportunities, through labour market reform and improvements in Australia's education and training system. A particular concern has been our unemployed youth.</para><para>The Government's initiatives have included the major reform of the provision of employment services, with the establishment of the Job Network from May this year; improved incentives for employers to take on apprentices; and the Work for the Dole scheme.</para><para>The Work for the Dole scheme is based on the principle of mutual obligation. A person out of work is given income support by the community and is expected, in return, to support the community by doing useful projects, learning skills and keeping up work habits.</para><para>The Government is also providing an additional $350 million over four years for a range of measures to address problems associated with youth unemployment.</para><para>In particular, the Government is taking the Work for the Dole initiative further, requiring all young people unemployed for six months or more to participate in an activity in addition to looking for work. The additional activities required can include the Green Corps, education and training, a new programme for literacy and numeracy or community job projects.</para><para>This Budget provides for the extension of the Job Placement, Employment and Training programme until the end of 1999-2000. This programme helps young people up to 21 years of age who face multiple disadvantages, particularly the homeless. It provides individual assistance, tailored to their particular 
 needs, to help them overcome the barriers they face in putting their lives back on track.</para><para>A new Youth Allowance is being introduced, which simplifies income support arrangements for young Australians and encourages them to further their education and develop the basic skills needed to secure their future.</para><para>Additional funding is also being provided for programmes to facilitate the transition of young people from school to work and to assist those at risk of early school-leaving.</para><para>This year, the Government will establish a Volunteer Ambassadors for Development programme. This will provide the opportunity for around 500 young Australians of up to 30 years of age to live and work as volunteers in the Asia Pacific region. Volunteers will be involved in activities such as teaching, providing health services, advising small business and improving the environment. This will help build Australia's ties with the region. Importantly, it will also expand the skills and experience of the young people themselves.</para><para>In this Budget, the Government is also providing significant increases in resources to fight the scourge of drugs through the National Illicit Drugs Strategy. The Strategy involves funding of around $215 million over five years to reduce the demand and supply of illicit drugs in the community, for drug treatment and rehabilitation and for community education. The new initiatives funded in this Budget will involve establishing new strike teams against illegal drugs and fighting the drug trade at its source with new Federal Police posts overseas where the drug trade can be intercepted before it reaches our shores.</para><para>Rural and Regional Australia</para><para>Mr Speaker, the importance of the rural industry to Australia, to the nation, can never be forgotten. We know that many in the bush have faced difficult times, particularly because of drought.</para><para>Sound policy and low interest rates are of enormous benefit to rural and regional Australia. The $525 million Government package, <inline font-style="italic">Agriculture</inline>â<inline font-style="italic">Advancing Australia</inline>, aims to help farmers out of debt and drought prob 
 lems and, through the new FarmBis programme, provides assistance to farmers to improve the management of their businesses.</para><para>Shortly after tonight, the Government is introducing legislation to provide a tax rebate for landcare works of 34 cents in the dollar. This will apply to expenditure in the 1997-98 financial year. Primary producers will be able to claim the rebate for works on levee or contour banks to control soil erosion, drainage works to control salinity, and the eradication of pests. There will be an annual limit of up to $10,000 for eligible landcare expenditures. The rebate will be available for those with taxable incomes of up to $20,700 from primary productionâor around 70 per cent of farmers. The landcare rebate is an incentive for farmers with low taxable incomes to improve their landâone of our country's greatest natural resources. The rebate, worth $80 million, will be paid from the Natural Heritage Trust.</para><para>In the coming year over $200 million will be spent on natural resource management and sustainable agriculture under the Natural Heritage Trust and other programmes.</para><para>Steps are being taken in this Budget to improve rural and regional health, through the expansion of multi-purpose health and family services for Australians in rural or remote areas. This involves providing a flexible, integrated range of health and family services in conjunction with the States, in areas where individual health and care programmes would not otherwise be viable. An extra thirty rural areas will have access to new multi-purpose services, with an additional 836 residential aged care places to be made available over four years. This is designed to complement services to older Australians in rural areas who want services near their friends and families.</para><para>Other Measures</para><para>Mr Speaker, one of the first areas where the impact of the downturn in Asian economies has been felt is the Australian tourism industry. We recognise the importance of tourism for the Australian economy. In that context, we recognise the need to promote Australia effectively in the world tourism market.</para><para>Accordingly, this Budget provides increased funding of around $50 million over four years for the Australian Tourist Commission to improve Australia's promotional effort overseas in existing and emerging markets. A further $8 million will be provided over that period for the promotion of tourism in regional Australia.</para><para>The Government is also taking steps to enhance the effectiveness of Australia's immigration and visa procedures. Experience shows that there is a high risk that visitors from certain countries will attempt to remain in Australia after their visas expire. Accordingly, visa applications from those countries are to be more closely scrutinised. These measures are to be funded by introducing a new visitor charge for applicants from high risk countries. At the same time, arrangements provide for faster processing of travellers from low risk countries.</para><para>BUDGET REVENUES</para><para>In August last year the Prime Minister announced the Government's commitment to fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system.</para><para>Our current tax system is not serving Australia's interests and is therefore no longer appropriate to a modern and dynamic economy.</para><para>It is unnecessarily complexâthe result of years of changes to patch up a system that was first developed in the 1930s.</para><para>It imposes high rates of personal tax on additional earnings for Australians who do not have high incomes. The interaction of the tax and social security systems reduces the incentive to find work, or to earn more. Reward for effort is taken away through tax and reduced benefits.</para><para>The tax system includes a Wholesale Sales Tax which applies high tax rates on a relatively narrow range of goods including many everyday items. The structure of the indirect tax system also adds to the costs of businesses and penalises our exporters.</para><para>A more certain, fair and efficient tax system is necessary as Australia enters the next century. We need a tax system that ensures 
 that all parts of the community pay a fair share of tax.</para><para>In its first two Budgets the Government has taken action to protect honest taxpayers by clamping down on tax avoidance and tax minimisation. This has been achieved without increasing the overall tax burden facing the community.</para><para>But repair and maintenance of the present taxation system can only go so far. In short, it is no longer a sufficient option for achieving fairness and avoiding disincentives to work. We must have fundamental reform of the taxation system.</para><para>Mr Speaker, since the Government is committed to ensuring all taxpayers meet their obligations, I am announcing tonight an extension of the funding for a special taskforce within the Australian Taxation Office which is investigating the tax minimisation practices of some high wealth individuals. Examination to date has already unearthed a number of undesirable practices. Tonight's Budget sets aside $19 million for this taskforce which is expected to yield $200 million in additional tax compliance over the next two years.</para><para>Year 2000 Computer Software</para><para>The Government considers that expenses incurred in detecting and remedying software problems associated with the Year 2000 millennium bug should, in general, be immediately deductible for taxation purposes.</para><para>To a limited extent this is provided for in the current law but amendments will be made where this is not so. This decision reflects the Government's determination that businesses should be encouraged to take all steps to iron out possible computer software failure before the Year 2000.</para><para>The Government has also decided to amend the taxation law as it applies to computer software expenditure in response to a recent announcement by the Commissioner of Taxation withdrawing a ruling that deals with the taxation treatment. Unless the Government acted, most software expenditure could not be written off for taxation purposes or at best could be written off over twenty-five years. Most software expenditure would have been 
 treated as capital and therefore as not deductible in the year incurred.</para><para>The Government has decided to act in response to provide that expenditure on acquiring or developing computer softwareâapart from that associated with Year 2000 complianceâwill be written off over 2Â½ years.</para><para>The write-off rate of 2Â½ years reflects the relatively short expected effective life of software arising from rapid developments in the information technology industry.</para><para>The proposed arrangements are generous compared to those applying in comparable overseas taxation jurisdictions.</para><para>The new arrangements will encourage business modernisation and apply from the time of withdrawal of the ruling.</para><para>I am also announcing some measures that will simplify the tax law and address some potential anomalies.</para><para>A new generic tax framework will be introduced for the demutualisation of non-insurance organisations. Demutualisation is an emerging trend as more sectors of the Australian economy respond to increasing competition and structural reform. The development of the framework has benefited from extensive public input. It will provide greater certainty for organisations about the taxation consequences of demutualisation.</para><para>The Government has decided to increase the revenue collected through telecommunications numbering charges in order to better reflect the market value of these numbers and discourage hoarding. Additional revenue of around $30 million per annum will be collected from telecommunications carriers for the use of special service telephone numbers such as `13' and `180' numbers. The Government's decision recognises the fact that special service numbers are a valuable community resource and previous charging levels have undervalued their true worth.</para><para>Finally, Mr Speaker, I am announcing an increase in the Passenger Movement Charge of $3, taking it to $30. This will take effect from 1 January 1999. This increase will help meet the additional costs associated with the transit of people and goods for the Sydney 2000 Games.</para><para>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para><para>Mr Speaker, it is expected that economic growth will remain solid in 1998-99, although it will slow from 1997-98. But for the effect of Asia we would be looking at a continuation of rapid growth in 1998-99.</para><para>The strong growth in activity in 1997-98 reflects strong private sector demand. This is expected to carry into 1998-99. Investment plans remain strong, supported by low interest rates and high corporate profits. The housing recovery is proceeding and consumption will be supported by continued favourable labour market conditions.</para><para>Employment growth should remain firm, supported by recent and prospective growth in non-farm activity. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to around 7 per cent in the year ahead.</para><para>While inflation will rise gradually in the year ahead, it is under control and expected to remain within the RBA's medium-term target band.</para><para>The slowdown in some of our Asian trading partners will reduce Australia's export returns. Continued strength in the domestic economy will lead to a temporary rise in the current account deficit, edging it up to an average 5Â¼ per cent in the coming year.</para><para>However, the rise in the current account deficit in prospect is expected to remain below the peaks in the 1980s and mid-1990s.</para><para>And importantly, the rise in the current account deficit in prospect is taking place in clearly different circumstances to those earlier episodes. It does not reflect excessive growth in domestic demand. It is taking place in a period where the Government has locked in low inflation. It is occurring against the backdrop of policies designed to increase public saving and to provide a better environment for private saving.</para><para>As a result, investor confidence in Australia can be expected to remain strong.</para><para>CONCLUDING COMMENTS</para><para>Mr Speaker, on its election the Government mapped a course for economic and social prosperity into the next century.</para><para>This Government was determined to deliver, not just for this generation, but the next. When we set out, we said that the burdens would be shared so the rewards would be shared.</para><para>That is why young people, homebuyers, small business, job seekers now have better opportunities and a bright futureâwhy we can care for the older people and hope for the younger ones.</para><para>The journey is not yet finished. We should not stop now. This is an important milestone along the road. With the confidence and continued support of the Australian people, we will not stray from the task.</para><para>I commend the Budget to the House.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET PAPERS 1998-99</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3033</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3033</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present for the information of honourable members the following papers in connection with the budget for 1998-99:</para></talk.start><para>Budget strategy and outlook 1998-99;</para><para>Budget measurers 1998-99;</para><para>Federal financial relations 1998-99;</para><para>The Commonwealth public account 1998-99;</para><para>Addressing priorities in indigenous affairs;</para><para>Maintaining our commitment to women;</para><para>Regional Australia: Our commitment;</para><para>Investing in our natural heritage: The Commonwealth's environment expenditure 1998-99;</para><para>Ordered that the papers be printed.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 2) 1998-99</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3033</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3033</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message from the Governor-General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced.</para><para>Bill presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fahey</inline>, and read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3033</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3033</page.no><name role="metadata">Fahey, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FAHEY</name><name.id>HQ5</name.id><electorate>Macarthur</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><para>That the bill be now read a second time. 
</para><para>It is with great pleasure that I now introduce Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1998-99, which, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 1), is one of the principal pieces of legislation underpinning the third budget of the Howard Liberal-National Party government. This bill seeks appropriations of the consolidated revenue fund in 1998-99 totalling $4,172 million. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) provides for proposed expenditure on:</para><para>.	 the construction of public works and buildings;</para><para>.	 the acquisition of sites and buildings;</para><para>.	 certain advances and loans;</para><para>.	 items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital in nature;</para><para>.	 expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not been previously approved.</para><para>Provision is also made for grants to the states under section 96 of the constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in schedule 2 to the bill, the main features of which were outlined in the budget speech delivered by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Costello) a short time ago.</para><para>Reflecting recent experience, the provision for funding from the Advance to the Minister for Finance and Administration contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) has been increased by $40 million to $215 million with a commensurate reduction in the provision contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 1). There is no overall increase in the provisions for the Advance to the Minister for Finance and Administration being sought from parliament.

I have before me a letter dated 2 April signed by the Acting Parliamentary Librarian, which I think has been sent to all members, stating that the library will be closed from 8 p.m. on sitting nights from the start of the winter sitting. I do not know how many of my colleagues know this, but I would like to bring to your attention, Mr Speaker, a statement that was made by the current Leader of the House on 1 December 1995. He said:</para><para>The library people are of great importance, especially to the opposition. Governments have the mass of bureaucracy to assist them. In opposition we do not have those same resources. We rely very much on the Library, the parliamentary research people . . . </para><para>I am wondering, Mr Speaker, if you could perhaps reconsider this decision relating to the right of members to have access to the library after 8 p.m. on sitting days.</para><para></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr Speaker</name></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>The time at which the Parliamentary Library should close on sitting days has been under consideration for the last three years. Use of Library services has been monitored on an hours used basis and, since the Parliament resumed late evening sittings in May 1996, request levels during late evening sittings have been specifically monitored. In 1997 requests received by the Library after 8 pm accounted for only 0.89 per cent of total requests.</para><para>The two principal reasons for recommending an 8 p.m. closing time were the costs of keeping staff on duty and the related question of the quality and extent of services possible to be provided by that limited number of staff. The rearrangement of hours, which includes keeping the Ground Floor Library open until 8 p.m. on sitting nights, will provide greater access to services at times which the Library's monitoring of usage and request levels indicates they are more in demand.</para><para>The two late opening nights cost the Library around $100,000 a year in overtime and allowances. Only about 10 per cent of staff remain on duty and the services able to be provided are extremely limited, not only because of reduced staff numbers but also because of unavailability after hours of many external sources of information and resources. This financial year salaries for staff will account for 75 per cent of total appropriations with maintenance of the collectionâboth hard copy and electronicâtaking a further 10 per cent. With funding as tight as this, the question of the most effective use of the Library's resources is paramount.</para><para>The Library has suffered funding reductions over the last 3 years totalling $1.6 million, almost 10 per cent of its previous funding base, and its ability to absorb cuts of this magnitude is extremely limited, principally because of the very high proportion of appropriations which goes directly to salaries.</para><para>The combination of extremely low usage levels after 8 p.m. and the financial pressures facing the Library both now and in the future mean that the most effective use of all the Library's resourcesâwhich include staff time, salaries and allowancesâindicates that closing at 8 p.m. is the most beneficial balance for the interests of the Parliament overall. The following graph shows requests made to the Library by time of day for 1997. Of the 43,832 requests in that year, only 383 or 0.9 per cent were made after 8 p.m.</para><para></para><para><graphic href="R120598G01.jpg"></graphic></para></interjection></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliament House Television Facilities: Introduction of Digital Television Broadcasting</title><page.no>3035</page.no></subdebateinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hardgrave</inline> asked Mr Speaker on 31 March 1998:</para><para>In light of the government's recent announcement regarding the introduction of digital high definition television, could you detail to the House the extent to which current Sound and Vision Office facilities within Parliament House will be replaced in order to meet SAVO's obligations to provide clean TV feed for broadcast and rebroadcast in digital format? What work has been done to date for the planning for this? What equipment would be replaced at what cost? Would this cost be met from current funds or would it be an addition to the vote for the Joint House budget? 
</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr Speaker</name></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>Digital radio and television broadcasting will have an impact on two aspects of Sound and Vision (SAVO) operations: firstly its role of producing radio and television coverage of the Houses and committees, which is then broadcast internally on the House Monitoring Service (HMS) and (in most cases) also made available as a `clean feed' to media bureaux;  and secondly its role of receiving external television and radio signals and broadcasting them internally on the HMS.</para><para>While the government has announced the timetable for the introduction of digital broadcasting it has not announced the technical standards Australia will adopt for digital television broadcasting nor whether digital radio broadcasts will be satellite or terrestrial. These standards will be critical in determining the extent of re-equipment required by SAVO. 
</para><para>The television broadcasting industry has been moving to digital production, as opposed to broadcasting, for some time and the Sound and Vision Office has been in the forefront of that move, replacing analog production equipment with digital facilities as part of the department's asset replacement program.</para><para>Production of television coverage of the two chambers is now substantially digitised and, when the cameras in the House are replaced next financial year, will be fully digital.</para><para>Television production facilities for committee coverage are also being digitised, with control rooms used for committees having been converted. Existing analog cameras in committee rooms will be progressively replaced.</para><para>In respect of SAVO's role of receiving external TV sourcesâboth free-to-air and payâand then reticulating them within the building, the fibre optic network in the building will carry digital signals. However, a new `head-end' for the HMS will be required to accept external digital input. The funding implications of this acquisition will also be affected by future decisions on technical standards.</para><para>Radio production facilities in nine of the nineteen committee rooms have been converted to digital processing and a further two will be converted by the end of June this year. Chamber audio facilities are not planned to be converted to digital processing until the 1999-2000 financial year.</para><para>The cost of equipment conversion so far has been met from the department's specific appropriations for asset replacement. This was set in 1995-96 at $7.6 million a year, but was reduced in 1996-97 as part of general budget reductions to $3.2 million a year.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>3036</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brown</inline> to move:</para><para>That this House:</para><para>(1)	 condemns the growing practice of companies contriving artificial arrangements to dismiss their unionised workforce in order to replace it with non-unionised scab labour;</para><para>(2)	 condemns the action of Gordonstone Coal Management Pty Ltd, owned by Atlantic Richfield Oil Company (ARCO), which not only sacked its entire workforce and attempted to replace them with a new workforce but also hired a private security firm to patrol the mine and to spy on and intimidate workers and their spouses and children who live in the town of Emerald, Qld;</para><para>(3)	 is encouraged by the decisions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which found that the dismissals were provocative and

These can be summarised as follows:</para><para>-	 The volume of services claimed by residents in the immediate area and, where appropriate, the catchment area that the proposed customer service centre would serve, and the nature and level of the different types of billing by doctors in those areas.</para><para>-	 The likely impact of a cash payment facility on the availability of direct billing.</para><para>-	 The proximity of the proposed customer service centre to other customer service centres and the impact that it might have on the workloads of other customer service centres.</para><para>-	 Transport arrangements in the area.</para><para>-	 The minimum staffing of an office required to be able to satisfy the security needs of an office.</para><para>-	 The minimum cash service workload required to maintain the minimum staffing requirements, that is 150 cash services per day.</para><para>-	 Costs to the HIC of paying claims in cash compared with other forms of payment.</para><para>-	 Pressure on the HIC for continued improvements in efficiency.</para><para>-	 The costs of establishing and maintaining the centre and the overall financial position of the HIC in being able to expand its payments outlets.</para><para>-	 The competing claims of other locations for a customer service centre and the priority to be given these claims.</para><para>The weight given to each of these criteria will be different depending on whether we are talking about a proposed customer service centre in a metropolitan/suburban setting or in a country location. For example, transport arrangements in an area are more likely to determine where to locate an office within a suburban sprawl than assist in establishing the need for a customer service centre. The proximity or distance from a centre only has validity as a criterion where the economic and service viability of a centre is otherwise sustainable.</para><para>The primary data to assess the need for a centre is the pattern of services billed from a particular area. Direct billing has never faltered in its popularity and growth. This is the form of billing that best achieves the Government's access objectives for the Medicare program. It decreases the need for cash and cheque services and renders analysis of customer service centre needs on the basis of the 
 size of population somewhat meaningless. For example, a small population with a low level of direct billing may be better able to demonstrate a greater need for a cash reimbursement facility than a large population with a high level of direct billing.</para><para>If the HIC is operating a new centre it needs to ensure that there will be a sufficient cash service workload to keep the staff of the centre fully employed. For security reasons there needs to be a minimum of two persons on the premises at all times. Thus the minimum staffing of a centre is two (2) full-time and one (1) part-time person. To sustain this level of staffing requires a minimum of 150 cash services per day.</para><para>This is only the first element in the analysis of whether to open a customer service centre. The HIC has to have overall regard for its approved level of funding and the overall impact that added cash services would have on its financial position. Because of the differential costs of processing direct bill, cash or cheque claims, if a customer service centre cannot sustain the minimum cash service load or cause a shift in the mix of services away from direct billing, then the financial impact to the HIC is greater than the costs of merely establishing and maintaining the customer service centre. At the end of the exercise, there is the need, as well, to look at the competing interests of other localities to decide priorities.</para><para>(2) HIC management made the decision which was endorsed by the Minister for Health and Family Services.</para><para>(3) As at 31 March 1998, the following Medicare Customer Service Centres will have closed:</para><para>NSW	 Auburn, Belmont, Cabramatta, Campsie, Corrimal, Dee Why, Erskine Street, Leichhardt, Marrickville, Merrylands, Mt Druitt, North Rocks, Randwick, Rockdale, St Ives, Sylvania, Warrawong</para><para>VIC	 Boronia, Clayton, Croydon, Deer Park, Footscray, Heidelberg, Keysborourgh, Reservior</para><para>QLD	 Cannon Hill, Coorparoo, Queen Street, Wynnum</para><para>SA	 Blackwood, Eastwood, Glenelg, Ingle Farm, Rundle Mall, Sefton Park</para><para>WA	 Cloisters, East Victoria Park, Maddington, Mirabooka</para><para>TAS	 Moonah</para><para>(4) No.</para><para>(5) The HIC is unable to comment as this is a State government matter.</para><para>(6) (a) Yes; (b) No.

The removal of the remaining noxious weeds from the eastern Engine Pond has been budgeted for this financial year. This involves partly draining the pond and excavating the noxious weeds. Re-occurring weeds are an ongoing maintenance issue. The weeds will be sprayed each year as part of the airport's landscape maintenance program. Restocking with native vegetation should be completed soon. A number of access tracks have also been established and will be subject to a continuing improvement program.</para><para>(2) The FAC's interest in the Barton Park Wetlands is confined to the placement High Intensity Approach Lights (HIALs) within the wetlands. These wetlands are owned and managed

 consideration. The overall response to the consultation process has been very positive with most MRCs indicating that they were already following  the broad directions outlined in the Future Directions discussion paper. Many ideas contained in the paper had already been implemented by different MRCs and the consultations process provided an opportunity to identify `best practice' models.

Infestation with this parasite is known as strongyloidiasis.</para><para>This parasitic worm exists in many regions of the tropics and subtropics, including South East Asia and tropical areas of Australia.</para><para>As awareness of the prevalence and possible health risks attached to the presence of this parasite gradually emerged over the years, appropriate action and procedures were instituted.</para><para>Ongoing research into the problem commenced at the Repatriation General Hospital, Concord in 1971. 
</para><para>(2) In December 1971 a Hospital Staff Instruction advised that all Prisoners of War (Japan) should be tested for the parasite, as should all Australian Aborigines and any person with a known past or present infestation. In particular advice was given with regard to action to be taken if immunosuppressive or radiation therapy were to be contemplated.</para><para>In 1978 my Department funded a special research project on strongyloidiasis, the paper produced as a result was published in the British Medical Journal in March 1980.

An awareness program was considered appropriate largely because while the persistence of the parasite in small numbers produced no symptoms of illness, there always remained the risk for development of hyperinfestation.</para><para>A special educational bulletin was prepared and circulated to all Local Medical Officers in December 1982, and another issued in September 1986.</para><para>As far as Vietnam veterans are concerned, there are reports in America of Vietnam veterans presenting with strongyloides stercoralis infestation many years after their service in Vietnam. I am advised that some of the standard textbooks of medicine now warn that veterans of wars in those regions where the parasite is commonly found are at risk of infestation.</para><para>A major morbidity study of Vietnam veterans, involving a survey of all surviving Vietnam veterans, has now been released.

There are several reasons for this including an increase over the previous financial year of the number of applications lodged. The Principal Member of the Veterans' Review Board advises me that the increase in lodgements over the financial year is likely to number 2 000. During the early part of the current financial year there were insufficient cases ready for hearing to allow the resources of the Board to be fully utilised and this resulted in less hearings than would have otherwise occurred. The Board's hearing activities were disrupted towards the latter part of last year and the early part of this year due to the appointment process and training of new members. All members' terms of office expired either at the end of last September or December. The Principal Member of the Board advises me that the position has now stabilised and that he expects to make inroads with a continued high level of hearings.</para><para></para><para>(6)</para><table

Members of the board sit in panels of three on a daily basis for a week at a time. The normal practice is for a panel to hear 15 matters in a week. All members of the Board are part-time, with the exception of the Principal Member and are expected to sit at least two weeks in every five weeks. On that basis each member should sit on at least 30 cases each five weeks. This figure varies considerably depending on factors such as agreed leave, availability of cases and advocates and, in the case of newly-appointed members, time allocated to training and familiarisation. In that context the Principal Member advises me that the fifteen new members appointed in October 1997 have sat on 1,956 cases to the end of February 1998. The average during that period is, accordingly, 130 cases per member. As to the second part of the question, particular members are not allocated to specific types of cases. Cases are listed by order of receipt and members expect to deal with any matter that may be put to the Board. No records are maintained of the particular type of case heard by each member.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title><page.no>3056</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2699)</subtitle><id.no>2699</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3056</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Laurie Ferguson</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) How many veterans are eligible for assistance with pharmaceutical benefits under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS).</para><para></para><para>(2) How many items were listed on the RPBS schedule as at (a) February 1997 and (b) February 1998.</para><para>(3) What was the (a) total number of items dispensed under the RPBS, (b) average number of items dispensed per entitled veteran and (c) total cost to the Commonwealth in each financial year since 1989-90.</para><para>(4) What is the latest revised estimate of expenditure under the RPBS for (a) 1997-98 and (b) 1998-99.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3056</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bruce Scott</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Veterans' Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The total number of veterans eligible for assistance with pharmaceutical benefits under the RPBS is 339,329.

The reason for the decrease in total expenditure in 1992-93 is not apparent.</para><para>From 1995-96 onwards there was a significant increase in RPBS usage resulting from the reinstatement of RPBS entitlements for war widows and service pensioners from 1 January 1996.</para><para>In 1995-96 the average number of prescriptions per client was unusually low at 19.

Secondly, although these clients became eligible for RPBS entitlements in January many already had a supply of their current medications from the PBS so therefore did not access the scheme until later in the calendar year.</para><para>(4) (a) $211m and (b) $227m.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Adult Migrant English Program</title><page.no>3057</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2710)</subtitle><id.no>2710</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3057</page.no><name role="metadata">Mossfield, Frank, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Mossfield</name><name.id>MK6</name.id><electorate>Greenway</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 4 March 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) What criteria were used to select the successful tenders which will replace the existing Adult Migrant Education Service (AMES) in New South Wales.</para><para>(2) Were new and privately owned tenderers successful in 3 of the 5 regions in New South Wales; if so, what (a) assessments were used in awarding tenders and (b) were the failings of the existing AMES.</para><para>(3) Will up to 500 teachers within AMES in New South Wales be lost under the new system; if so, how can the loss of their experience and expertise be justified.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3057</page.no><name role="metadata">Ruddock, Philip, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Ruddock</name><name.id>0J4</name.id><electorate>Berowra</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Immigration and Multicultural Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) The criteria used to evaluate tenders for the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) in NSW were the AMEP operational and policy requirements as described in the Statement of Requirement

The processes followed in tendering the AMEP in NSW were identical to those followed in other States and Territories. From 
 the outset they have met the required standards and have been open and accountable. Their probity was maintained through the measures outlined below:</para><para>	 Oversight of tendering was provided by a steering committee whose members included representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Finance and Administration and the Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship Division and Resource Management Branch of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA). This steering committee signed off on all processes and monitored the implementation of tendering.</para><para>	 The tender process was designed by a professional consultant who provided an evaluation methodology which was followed by the tender evaluation panel. This consultant also acted as adviser to the tender evaluation panel.</para><para>	 Industry briefings and consultations were held in all states and territories with potential tenderers when the Expression of Interest was released and again when the Request for Tender was released. The purpose of these briefings and consultations was to explain the tender documents and the tender process and to answer any questions that were raised.</para><para>	 The tender documentation was made publicly available before the tender was called.</para><para>	 The tender evaluation was a two-part process:</para><para>(i) a tender evaluation panel, comprising three members of DIMA's Adult Migrant English Program Section, a representative of the Department's Corporate Services Division, a representative of the DIMA NSW office and an independent English as a Second Language (ESL) expert, assessed the extent to which tenders met the AMEP operational and policy requirements as described in the Statement of Requirement (SOR) which formed part of the documents provided to all prospective tenderers;</para><para>(ii) a separate financial evaluation was carried out by a firm of Chartered Accountants.</para><para>Results of the two assessments were combined to produce a value for money rating with an emphasis on the capacity to deliver AMEP services in accordance with the SOR.</para><para>The tender evaluation panel presented its assessments to the steering committee for their comments. The assessments, together with the complete tender documentation, were then presented to a delegate for the final decision.</para><para>(2) The tender evaluation panel's assessment of the tenders for the south-west Sydney region was that the Australian Centre for Languages (ACL) tender met the AMEP operational and policy requirements as described in the SOR to a higher level 
 than did the Adult Migrant English Service (AMES) tender.</para><para>(3) The tender evaluation panel described in 1 (i) above made recommendations to the delegate with responsibility for this program. These, together with the complete tender documentation, formed the basis for the delegate's decisions.</para><para>(4) All tenders for AMEP service delivery were submitted on a commercial-in-confidence basis. They cannot therefore be made public.</para><para>(5) Certain documents which form part of the tender proposals may be available under the Freedom of Information Act (1982). However, much of the content of the tenders is likely to be exempt from release under sections 43 and 45 of the Act which relate to business affairs and documents obtained in confidence.</para><para>(6) Details of DIMA's funding of adult migrant English education will continue to be made available through Commonwealth reporting and accountability processes.</para><para>(7) The transparency and accountability of the program will be increased through the new AMEP purchasing arrangements. Both the SOR and the contracts for AMEP service delivery make clear that there are the following accountability requirements:</para><para>	 annual monitoring of the required contract services by the National ELICOS Accreditation Scheme (NEAS);</para><para>	 continuous monitoring of client learning outcomes through the AMEP Reporting and Management System (ARMS) to ensure that benchmarks developed by the National Centre for English Language Teaching and Research (NCELTR) at Macquarie University are met;</para><para>	 submission of an annual report to DIMA which will report on progress of the contract services;</para><para>	 a full evaluation of all aspects of delivery of the AMEP during the third year of the contract;</para><para>	 provision of a grievance and dispute resolution procedure for all clients which links directly to DIMA's proposed client service charter; and</para><para>	 progression to payment in arrears by the second year of the contracts which will entitle the Commonwealth to withhold payments if it forms the view that the services have not been provided to the expected standard.</para><para>(8) DIMA adheres to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines in conducting tender processes. I am advised that there is no evidence that collusive tendering occurred, or that a conflict of interest arose in the preparation of tenders, or that the guidelines were contravened in any respect. 
</para><para>(9) DIMA has made enquiries to ascertain whether a consultant employed by AMES to assist in the preparation of their tenders was also involved in the preparation of the ACL tenders. I am advised that this consultant, who was previously a Director of AMES, was not involved in the preparation of the ACL tenders.</para><para>(10) I am further advised that guidelines have been adhered to throughout the tendering process.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Emergency Relief Program</title><page.no>3072</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2805)</subtitle><id.no>2805</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3072</page.no><name role="metadata">Lee, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Lee</name><name.id>MG4</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Family Services, upon notice, on 25 March 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Will he provide data on the number of eligible agencies and level of funding provided under the Emergency Relief Program to each agency in each federal electorate division in (a) 1994-95, (b) 1995-96 and (c) 1996-97.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3072</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Warwick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Warwick Smith</name><name.id>GJ4</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Family Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Total appropriation for the Emergency Relief Program for 1994-95 was $19.481 million, for 1995-96 was $17.342 million and for 1996-97 was $23.227 million.

answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) To date, the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania have signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish the National Public Health Partnership (NPHP).</para><para>(2) Yes.</para><para>(3) The MOU is a multilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and States and Territories to establish the NPHP. All States and Territories, with the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, are represented on the NPHP Group. New Zealand has observer status on the Group. Since the Partnership was established in December 1996, work has commenced on implementation of the work program.</para><para>Although the NPHP is not a funding mechanism, the process of signing the Partnership MOU is being delayed in NSW and WA, due to the current bilateral negotiations on Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs) and the Health Care Agreements. Despite the formal stance of WA and NSW, both States are represented on the NPHP Group by their Chief Health Officers, and are active participants in Partnership Working Groups and other initiatives. 
</para><para>(4) The NPHP is an ongoing multilateral mechanism between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. The Partnership is a co-ordination and collaboration mechanism for national public health activity with clearly articulated roles and responsibilities for each of the jurisdictions. The Partnership is not a funding mechanism. Work commenced on the NPHP Work Program in late 1996-97. Concurrent with, but separate to the development of the NPHP Work Program was the commencement of bilateral negotiations between the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments on the PHOFAs, a new mechanism for Commonwealth funding of particular public health activities. While there are some policy links, the Partnership work and the Agreement negotiations are two separate processes.</para><para>The PHOFAs are bilateral funding agreements between the Commonwealth and each State and Territory. The first Agreements are for a two year period 1997-98 and 1998-99.

In considering the outcomes of the CSSS review, there was a need for the Government to balance the competing demands for limited CSSS funds while at the same time ensuring that the Scheme supported the Government's wide range of priority areas in the health and family services sectors. There is continuing capacity for input to aged care policy and for effective representation of the views of older people through a range of mechanisms, including the two remaining CSSS funded aged care organisations, Council on the Ageing and Aged Care Australia.</para><para>I am confident that the outcomes of the review provide the greatest opportunity for focused and strategic input to Government health and family services policy and a responsible use of taxpayers' money.

There have also been some delays in payments in state offices. All system errors known by mid January were corrected by the end of January and thus processed claims after January correctly. To make necessary back adjustments (both positive and negative) a reconciliation and back adjustment payments program was developed and implemented on 20 February 1998. This program was designed to recalculate the payment for each resident back to October 1997 and report in detail on resident payments affected and adjust the payment to the provider accordingly.</para><para>Meetings were held with peak organisations to inform them of the problems and how they were to be resolved.
