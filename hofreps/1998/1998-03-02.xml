I particularly wish to comment on the effect that frequent review processes have on the delivery of services by the court.</para></talk.start><para>It is a fact that the business of the Family Court of Australia directly impacts upon approximately 100,000 adults and about 150,000 children per year. The core of the court's business is processing applications for dissolution of marriage and the resolution of related matters, including property settlements 
 and custody of children. All of these issues are very personally sensitive ones for individuals involved and, largely because of this, the court's operations have been subject to unusually intense scrutiny in the 21 years of its existence.</para><para>Audit report No. 33 did not examine the legal functions of the court. To do so would be an infringement of the principle of the separation of powers of the executive, legislature and judiciary. The audit was confined to the examination of administrative matters, which nonetheless are a major element of the service provided by the court. It is right and proper that, in discharging our duty to provide good, open and transparent government, the operations of the Family Court are examined from time to time to assure the court's clientele and the general public that public funding spent in this area is used in a manner that maximises quality, efficiency and effectiveness of service provided by the court.</para><para>In general, the audit resulted in a number of recommendations for finetuning in a managerial sense. These recommendations related to corporate planning, performance measurement, decision making processes, organisational structure, internal procedures and information technology.</para><para>The House of Representatives Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs supports adoption of the recommendations. However, 
 I wish to draw attention to a concern expressed by the court's representatives which is shared by the committee. The large number of frequent investigations into the Family Court's operations has had the effect of diverting resources away from the court's key functions and compromising its ability to provide a high level of service. In the financial year 1996-97, the Family Court was subject to 18 internal and external reviews, excluding audit reviews. Although individual investigations may be well intentioned, such a high rate of review must raise a question of the cost benefits involved.</para><para>The benefits of reviews and audits are that some constructive recommendations can be made, such as those previously mentioned in respect of audit report No. 33 of 1996-97. But large numbers of specific inquiries, limited in their terms of reference, by their very nature take a less than wide-angled view of the overall picture. What can result is a situation where it becomes difficult to see the wood for the trees.</para><para>The House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has observed, for example, that an audit can fail to make due reference to major issues. It is these major issues that affect the ability of the court to fulfil its primary goal of producing desirable outcomes for clients. For example, the major issue of trialling integrated client services at the Parramatta Registry to limit the number of attendances of clients at court and the question of the most appropriate location of the primary dispute resolution services received only a brief acknowledgment in the audit process. The question then arises as to what is the most effective way of addressing both the routine procedural issues and the broader strategic direction to provide the highest standard of accountability for the functions of the court, and indeed other public institutions.</para><para>Devolving responsibility does not mean that the government's responsibility for control has to be subverted. Management is still accountable for decisions and actions, must submit to routine audit procedures and should not be immune to prudent inquiry. In addition to the questionable benefits of frequent review 
 procedures, there are considerable financial costs and significant costs to service provision when large amounts of time and human resources are diverted to satisfying each review process. Furthermore, the insecurity experienced by staff is not conducive to the efficient provision of the best quality service. It is the committee's view that a balance between accountability through bureaucratic intervention and autonomous operation has not been maintained in recent years. There has been an overworking of the former at the cost of the latter and the balance needs to be re-struck. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>2</page.no><name role="metadata">Price, Roger, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PRICE</name><name.id>QI4</name.id><electorate>Chifley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to speak on the Auditor-General's audit report No. 33 of 1996-97 on the administration of the Family Court of Australia. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Grace), has mentioned, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee did some good work in its review of the Auditor-General's audit report No. 33, which is one of two arising from the inquiry into the funding and administration of the Family Court.</para></talk.start><para>It is a matter of regret to me that there has been no report of this parliament which really looks at the issue of contact and brings forward recommendations that would provide satisfaction to both parents. I think that is a very glaring omission from this parliament.</para><para>I note that the chief executive of the Family Court has drawn attention to the number of inquiries into the Family Court, particularly its administration. Mr Glare deserves some commendation in that he has survived each and every inquiry, but I believe that, as the Family Court moves further away from the original principles established in family law some 20 years ago, we are going to see this constant call for inquiries. I have been involved in one of the inquiries but, unhappily, not the review of this audit. There was also an earlier parliamentary inquiry chaired by Senator Jim McKiernan.</para><para>Without disputing the good work done by the various committees, I do believe that we have lacked a clarity of focus about what really needs to be done to change it. The most glaring statistic has already been mentioned: 
 100,000 parents approach the court each year, and this involves 150,000 children. Therein lies the biggest problem associated with the Family Court, and that is that we actually need to remove people from the court process.</para><para>In the past I have spoken about a no-frills family tribunal, and the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) has talked about a commission of the family. In Western Australia, because it still has its own court, we have the opportunity to trial a new tribunal in family law matters which is based on the Guardianship Board, the Small Claims Tribunal and the Residential Tenancies Tribunal. The hallmarks of these tribunals are that they are in very modest accommodation, they do not purport to be courts and there is no legal representation. The overwhelming majority of matters can be brought before the tribunal and both parties can have an opportunity to agree on those things that they can agree on but have a decision arbitrated. Without such a tribunal, I do not think we are ever going to get very close to solving the issues surrounding contact that bedevil the family law area. The tribunals are accessible, low cost and can be very immediate. I think there is a lot of merit in looking at that.</para><para>In relation to counsellingâand I know that the committee will be bringing down a report later onâone of the outstanding failures of the Family Court is the provision of reconciliation counselling, and this is in stark contrast to the New Zealand family court. In other words, it only provides counselling when the relationship or the marriage is dead. When you look at what the Commonwealth is spending on family lawâsomething close to a quarter of a billion dollarsâyou see that we need to be spending money further up the relationship tree. There is no good in parents agreeing to seek counselling about their marriage or relationship and then having to wait three or four months before they can make the appointment. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline></para><para>A real test of success in the family law area involves a couple of things, and I do not think that either political party has come to family law in recent times with particularly clean hands. We need to provide a tribunal that 
 people can go to so that justice and their rights are not only there in theory but also able to be exercised. The Brandy case presents some difficulties but, happily, Western Australia allows for at least a pilot scheme to be undertaken, and I would commend that to the Attorney-General.</para><para>I am very much in favour of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, but things like mediation are not always appropriate for every couple. I am certainly not seeking to abolish the court, but I do think we need to truncate its reach where it deals with those who want to slog it out with lots of money. Issues of sexual assault or domestic violence also need to be escalated into the Family Court very quickly. I am afraid for Mr Glare and the Family Court that while ever we fail to provide reasonable access to the court or mechanisms, there will be constant calls for inquiries.</para><para>Last but not least, I am a firm advocate of lifting the lid on Family Court hearings. Section 121 of the Family Law Act provides for the Family Courtâunlike any other court in this land apart from the Children's Courtâabsolute secrecy. We need to take that away. After all, it only serves to protect the wealthy, the prominent and, dare I say, the politicians in this country. It has had a disastrous effect on  people's understanding of the court and its processes. I would urge all members of this House to support the removal of section 121, which requires that there be no publicity of Family Court proceedings.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>3</page.no><name role="metadata">Smith, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TONY SMITH</name><name.id>SK6</name.id><electorate>Dickson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOnce again I have listened very carefully to the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who has just resumed his seat, and his experience and wisdom in this area are not to be gainsaid. We need to listen to the voices of those who are questioning the role of the Family Court and the role that it is taking in society, given the extraordinarily large number of litigants who come before it every year and the effect of the Family Court's judgments upon those litigants.</para></talk.start><para>There certainly is a need to open up the court. I believe that section 121 should be repealed. As I was thinking of making my remarks today, I was reminded of the decision 
 of Scott v. Scott in the House of Lords, which is the seminal decision on the fact that justice should be done in public. It is important, not only for the proper functioning of a court that it be done, but for the interests of justice. There should only be very exceptional circumstances before the doors are closed in relation to the administration of justice in any court. It is as well to recall the principles of the House of Lords in Scott v. Scott.</para><para>The constant inquiries that are referred to by my friend who has just resumed his seat and others really beg the question: why is it that we have these constant inquiries? I believe it is because the Family Court is seen my many litigants to have failed in many respects. I refer to the fact that, while there are some very good, experienced, competent and diligent judges, unfortunately there are some within the structure that leave litigants somewhat gasping for breath. My experience both in legal practice and subsequently as a member highlights that fact.</para><para>In my view, the court suffers from an inferiority complex. It lacks respect from the legal profession because it fails to properly respect itself. That is a real problem. I believe it arises from the cases that come before it where orders of the court are flagrantly breached and nothing happens to the person breaching those orders. I know from experience in the Supreme Court that a breach of Supreme Court orders is treated very seriously. People who breach those orders wilfully and flagrantly are dealt with severely, because the court must send a message to the community that its orders must be obeyed.</para><para>For example, take the case of Sid Brown: he had an order from the Family Court in relation to contact with his child. His ex-wife had previously been convicted of attempted abduction of the young child, who was four years of age, and had been given a bond. Recently, in total disregard of the orders of the court, Mrs Brown moved house and changed her child's school. She moved about 100 kilometres away without notifying Mr Brown. Of course, by this stage after many appearances in the court, Mr Brown's funds were totally exhausted. He made an application for contempt. He came before the judicial 
 registrar, who said, `There are a number of options. I could send her to gaol, fine her, put her on community service or on a bond. But most probably I will do nothing.' That sows the seeds of contempt for the court from the community when the court cannot uphold its own processes, and a court will not earn the respect of the community until it does.</para><para>The same thing occurs when there are delays in the court with judgments. In the same case Mr Brown had to wait eight months and 20 days to get a judgment in a custody hearing a couple of years ago. This was in relation to a young child, and it is scandalous. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> That particular case involved a very young child and custody and the whole situation changed in that eight months. In fact, the application for custody was made two years prior to the judgment being given. When it comes to questions of status quo, how could you possibly say that Mr Brown had a fair hearing in that case?</para><para>A constituent of mine, Mrs Meech, was defrauded on a property settlement and similarly had to wait six months after many letters to the particular judge, Mr Justice Underhill. He has now retired and the legal profession will not mourn his passing. He took six months to deliver a decision in relation to a case where assets were dissipated. The end result was that Mrs Meech, whose funds were likewise exhausted, ultimately lodged an appeal and a settlement was reached.</para><para>There can be no respect for a system that accepts these sorts of delays. Why are there delays? Are there delays because allegations are made to the court and the courts are tied up in cases that really should not be there? As my friend the member for Chifley said, there are matters that should not be in the court; they should be somewhere else.</para><para>There also has to be some combined disincentive for some people to make false allegations in relation to child abuse. Time and time againâand in the profession they call it the atomic bombâthe allegation of child abuse is made and immediately all rights of the father to see the child are suspended and the system is tied up. In the case of Garry 
 Parmenter, he has not seen his son for something approaching two years. The allegations have been found to be untrue and unsubstantiated, yet the system is still tied up investigating all this material. In this case there has been a suggestion by an expert of parroting in relation to the child, and the person making the allegation will just walk out of the court and there will be no disincentive.</para><para>Indeed, the great playwright and barrister John Mortimer in a book, an autobiographical work, that he wrote not too many years ago said that, when he was practising in the family jurisdiction in the sixties and seventies, in contested divorce applications every conceivable allegation would be made from leaving a ring around the bath to leaving dirty socks lying aroundâall those sorts of thingsâbut you would never hear an allegation of child abuse when, had it been present, it would have been a very, very serious allegation. But so often now it is the first allegation. It is used frequently as a weapon to cause problems for fathers who are trying to get access to their children.</para><para>Consequently, the whole system which we are talking about with this audit report, is bogged down by the making of what are so often unsubstantiated and outrageous allegations. What happens in the system is that all of the litigants suffer because of it.</para><para>Really, we have to start there. And I believe that we have to bring the public into the situation not only as a spectator in the back of the court, but also, I firmly believe, in juries. I firmly believe that the jury process is the one that gets the public into the court, into the process. Believe you me, the criminal jury is one area of law that we have not changed; over hundreds of years of experience, that system is still there. And yet more and more the civil courts have moved away from it.</para><para>I ask this question: should we really start thinking about bringing the public back into it, getting these decisions on custodyârather than in eight monthsâin a few days, the time in which a jury would give them? Let us get commonsense into it, as opposed to all of the experts who are profiting and the huge costs to litigants in these matter.</para><para>Overall, we have to look to the background of these things. But also we have to be sensible about the way we approach the administration of justice. We also have to be forward looking and not be bogged down in the past with any pre-existing and preconceived ideas. We need to change this system: it needs to be made much more user friendly, and litigants need to get justice. I believe that in many cases now they are not getting justice.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>âOrder!

Problems associated with men's health have been exposed as being far broader than was my initial perception. As a member of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I have been privileged to research information which indicates that there are many sides to men's health issues. This report goes a long way to revealing the extent of the concern that needs to be acknowledged.</para></talk.start><para>One of these issues is the matter of correct recognition of men as a key target group, a fact so often overlooked in the day to day routine of health management. You see, Mr Speaker, men experience higher mortality rates compared with womenâand this is not in isolation or restricted to older men. In fact, males between the ages of 15 years and 24 years have a peak mortality rate at 2.65 times that of each single death of a female. When mortality rates are examined as a result of the more common causes, we note that the rate of 
 death from cardiovascular disease was 3.53 times more in men than the rate for what is identified as the working age groupâthat is, those aged from 24 to 65 years.</para><para>The matter of `maleness' or `being a bloke' is an example of one of these problems which must be overcome. It can be inferred, Mr Speaker, that in most instances there is a case to indicate that men need to become more responsible for their own wellbeing. I am sure that other members present will recognise situations in their own families where the matter of attending for medical treatment has become sensitive to the point of frustration for the woman in the household, which eventually leads her to taking the decision to make appointments and push the man into seeking treatment.</para><para>The lack of recognition by men of their health problems is best reflected by the attendance to GP consultation rates which show attendances for women undertaking health promotion services, such as screening or immunisation, at 6.1 per cent compared with men attendees for similar services at 2.1 per cent of all consultations. The difference highlighted by these statistics could in some way be a direct reflection of the advertising and promotional campaigns addressing matters such as breast cancer screening, immunisation and dietary information. Similarly, I am sure that there is a general train of thought amongst men which says, `Don't be a sook, there's nothing wrong with you.' Again I cite this as an example of men being men, and I would not want them to be anything differentâunless it was at the expense of their health and, more importantly, their responsibilities to their family and loved ones.</para><para>In the past it has been assumed that men's issues were adequately addressed by various general interventions. This has changed in recent times with a range of initiatives and research targeted specifically at men. The best example of this would be the strategic actions implemented to combat HIV-AIDS. Many speakers at our hearing recognised the success of this strategyâa strategy which has had international recognition because of its success. There are perhaps lessons to be learned from the HIV-AIDS program and strategies 
 which might be transferred to other issues of men's health.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, we have all been aware for some time of the problems associated with Aboriginal health. It is an awesome and tragic fact that the death rates of indigenous men are eight times those of the general population in some age groups.</para><para>An area of men's health which has some future ramifications has been drawn to my attention in recent times and has come from within my own electorate in Bowman. I recently had discussions with staff and management at a community care centre offering services across the broad base of needs. There has emerged a growing trend towards violence by males under 10 years of age directed at their parents, with a growing number of cases identified in the past 12 months. In most cases, these acts of violence were carried out in single-parent families.</para><para>More importantly, out of the total of 41 families identified as being at risk, 50 per cent had elements of domestic violence by males. These actions are a part of a lack of action in relation to men's health over many years, and it is imperative that any strategy towards the better managing of men's health include early intervention so that remedial processes can take effect on the example I have cited here. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>6</page.no><name role="metadata">Quick, Harry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr QUICK</name><name.id>AV5</name.id><electorate>Franklin</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI, like the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), am pleased to be able to speak briefly on the report on the men's health seminar held last September. This is the second in the series following up on the very successful seminar we held on youth suicide. As the chairman stated in his opening remarks to the seminar, in recent decades we have focused primarily on women's health issues, with the obvious benefits that have flowed from this.</para></talk.start><para>There was a perception in the community that everything was fine in the area of men's health. As we all know, unfortunately, this is far from the truth. We as a sex are pretty hopeless when it comes to our medical needs. We have this foolish preconceived notion that there is no real need to adequately monitor our health status to take preventative meas 
 ures to ensure our long-term viability and longevity. We are scared of the perceived threat to our maleness by shying away, as the previous speaker said, from regular visits to the GP. Many of us see it as a sign of weakness. We know what is best for our own health.</para><para>This was highlighted four weeks ago yesterday in my own instance when I had a pain in my chest. Being a typical male, I raced to the bathroom and took a couple of Panadol. I thought, `This is it, fine.' I went to get a glass of water and the pain was so intense that I knew I was in deep trouble.

I am one of those people whom the member for Bowman spoke of. We grin and bear it and do not go to the GP unless bones are poking out and the like.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said, this seminar was convened in September last year in order to gather some really important information from a range of academics, general practitioners, health workers and other experts to give our committee and the parliament a broad general overview of the complex issues involved. We as a committee recognised that, despite an increased focus on men's health issues in recent times, there is no coherent policy context or direction at the national level. Highlighting the issues to the federal parliament through its committee structure provides a unique opportunity to identify key future directions in a bipartisan manner. The seminar provided us with some statistical information that was, to say the least, rather disturbing. These have already been provided by the honourable member for Bowman, the previous speaker.</para><para>The major outcomes of the seminar that were worthy of note were, firstly, a clear description of men's poor health status which extends beyond standard health measures to broader aspects of men's wellbeing and quality of life; secondly, a clear articulation as to the neglectâI use that term advisedlyâof health systems to systematically identify 
 and address the impact that maleness has on the full range of important men's health issues; and, thirdly, a range of constructive strategies to support and strengthen the existing responses to these problems at the community, regional, state and national levels.</para><para>I would like to concentrate on the whole issue of maleness and the constructive strategies that are operating in our communities. I would imagine that most members could, at the drop of a hat, relate to some of the innovative things that are happening in the area of men's health in their own electorates. I would like to highlight the efforts of Paul Williams, who was a health worker initially at Bridgewater in Gagebrook when I first started working for Senator Michael Tate.</para><para>Paul beat his head against bureaucracy, but he was determined to set up a 10-week program to address some of the issues on men's health because he realised, as a health worker, that they were not all specifically related to medical problems. There are a whole lot of other issues: education, housing, sexual relationships, domestic violence and the like. Paul, to his credit, set up a 10-week program. He initially sent out 500 letters. This was a pilot which worked so successfully that men wanted a second dose. It has now been implemented by the Glenorchy City Council through their community services office. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>7</page.no><name role="metadata">Grace, Elizabeth, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE</name><name.id>ML6</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the House on the report that we have tabled on men's health and the issue of men's health. It is a subject that, for a number of reasons, has not always had a high profile in public discussion. The subject, however, deserves such a profile, and it is very appropriate that such a matter of public importance is discussed in this public national forum so that the reluctance to address the subject is diminished and a greater impetus is given to public inquiry and debate on a number of important male-specific issues.</para></talk.start><para>Previous speakers have mentioned that for a number of years there has been an emphasis on unique women's health issues, and the mobilisation of resources in response to public concern has resulted in improved 
 health statistics for women. We cannot fail to notice the success of widespread breast cancer screening programs in reducing mortality from breast cancer and the rising awareness of the condition within the general population. But no less unique are male health issues. In fact, there are a number of statistics that call for an immediate focus on men's health, more public discussion and an allocation of resources to address a range of male-specific problems.</para><para>The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs was briefed at the seminar in September on the poor state of Australian men's health, wellbeing and quality of life. The statistics were alarming. We were informed of the higher congenital malformation rate for males, the higher infant mortality rate, the higher rate of drowning among boys than girls, higher alcohol consumption rates,  significantly higher rates of obesity and diabetes, a higher prevalence of risk factors and lower utilisation of health services, death rates of up to eight times the general population in indigenous males, significant gender differences in preventable issues such as road accidents, suicides and drowningâand so the list went on.</para><para>It is apparent that the health of any of us in society does not relate just to medical matters. A notable behavioural scientist, Maslow, described the hierarchy of need affecting the wellbeing of all individuals. This hierarchy incorporated a range of elements from basic needs such as food and shelter to physical and emotional security, good health and eventually self-actualisation. It is all of these elements within the hierarchy of health and wellbeing that we must aim to address.</para><para>It is indeed a foundation of Liberal philosophy that government is concerned not only with the basic needs of its citizenry but also with the promotion of conditions that allow for individual choice and an opportunity to pursue one's own private interestsâin other words, to reach the point of self-actualisation. It is in this context, in the light of these statistics that I have referred to, that this government wishes to signal its commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of our male population.</para><para>A wide range of medical and social issues is raised in the statistics, and I would like to illustrate the importance of taking a holistic approach to each of these problems. The fact that men are reluctant to consult medical practitioners is a culturally entrenched problem that will not change overnight.</para><para>It is often reported that the only reading material in doctors' surgeries bears names such as <inline font-style="italic">Cleo</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Dolly</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Women's Weekly</inline>. However, I am pleased to report that a spot check on reading material in a GP's surgery in my electorate uncovered a publication specifically entitled <inline font-style="italic">Men's Health</inline>. It is indeed a welcome indication of a trend towards more open discussion of male issues. This magazine included articles on travel, diet, fashion, sex and relationships, like so many other women's magazines, but it also featured articles on how to win at everything and how to unhook a bra with one hand, complete with illustrations. This may seem humorous or trivial, but it is a recognition of some genuine artefacts of Australian maleness.</para><para>For strategies to improve men's health to be successful, there needs to be an understanding of what things are important to Australian males. Perhaps some more consequential elements of maleness that need to be understood are the importance to males of drinking, learning to drive, not displaying weakness and the need for social proof. Ignoring these realities would be a barrier to improving the health status of men.</para><para>Rural health services and education and training programs which conduct men's nights out and gutbuster programs owe much of their success to designing their strategies in sympathy with the context of the culture of Australian maleness.

My appreciation also goes to the committee chairman, John Forrest, who chaired the seminar.</para></talk.start><para>The exercise was useful, and I am regretful that more of my colleagues were not there to share the benefits. Establishing this kind of process, holding seminars of this nature, has been a useful and important part of the parliamentary committee process. The report is therefore a useful and worthwhile contribution. I also particularly want to thank the people who took partâthose who came to Canberra and presented us with their wisdom, knowledge and experiences.</para><para>In considering this matter, it is important that we first understandâdemystify, if you likeâsome of the things about affirmative action. A lot of damage has been done in recent years with the topic of political correctness. People see affirmative action as being somehow a negative or prejudiced system. Looking at the evidence on men's health, it is absolutely clear that as a country we need to take some affirmative action on men's health.</para><para>Those who get concerned about the notion of affirmative action end up doing great damage to our community. They do not understand that the way to solve all of our problems and to help the whole community is to understand the problem and tailor and target a solution to the actual problem, which means being affirmative about that problem. Whether it be Aboriginal health, men's health, women's health or breast cancerâa whole range of issuesâwe will not design a health system which suits everybody unless we suit each individual need.</para><para>To do that we need to understand and to target and, therefore, be affirmative. It means that more money may be spent on one area than on another area, and it means that one area might be advertised or promoted above and beyond another area to ensure that we are being equal.</para><para>The disabilities that exist in our communityâwhether it be learning disabilities or physical disabilities, or whatever kind they areâshould be recognised, dealt with and understood. It means that we need to be affirmative about addressing those disabilities. Affirmative action is about being fair and equalânot being unfair and some getting more than others.</para><para>We have had this mongering going on in the community that somehow anything that helps one group hurts everybody else. That is not so. By targeting and understanding the problems, we help all of us. Nowhere is that more clear than in men's health. Unless we demystify the language we use and the programs we run, we will not change a single thing and in 10 years or 20 years time parliamentarians will still be looking at the need to better target and better address men's health issues indicated in the statistics.</para><para>The same parliamentary committee is currently inquiring into indigenous health. The demystification that is taking place as we uncover the actuality as opposed to the perception is illuminating. Never before has there been a greater need for particular programs of targeting and affirmative action to help improve the health of our indigenous Australians.</para><para>At the same time many in the community will be saying, `Why should they get special help?' Because they have special needs. Why should men get special programs? Because they have special needs. If we keep the argument about affirmative action, as we appear to do and as do those neanderthals in the community in the political sense, that will do all of us great harm.</para><para>The recommendations of this report are to establish interdepartmental committees and to better understand and to better target men's health needs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

</para><para>(3)	 regrets that the Treasurer has allowed the banks to abandon affordable banking for battlers and pensioners in favour of maintaining or increasing bank profits; and</para><para>(4)	 notes with regret the Treasurer's priority of encouraging billion dollar profits for the banks and multi-million dollar salaries for banking executives at the expense of the ordinary customers of the banks.</para><para>The first thing I wanted to point out to the House is that the banks are a key institution in our society, if not an essential institution. I cannot think of any person who can survive very well without using the services of a bank. I have always thought that the prime purpose of banksâthe most important one, not one that they share exclusively on their ownâis to husband the nation's savings. We have heard a lot in this House about the importance of increasing national  savings, both private national savings and, of course, public national savings.</para><para>No-one can go and set up a bank; they need to obtain a banking licence. I think we need to ask ourselves, setting aside the prudential and fiduciary responsibilities of the banks, `What comes with that banking licence?'. There is no such requirement in the legislation for what we might call community service obligations. Are there a minimum number of branches that are required to be maintained? Do banks need to reach out to every nook and cranny throughout the Commonwealth? I note that the Parliamentary Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration is looking at the reach of banks in rural and regional Australia. I welcome that, and I look forward to its report. There is also an issue about the urban poor and the reach there. I hope that the committee will not be deflected from giving some attention to those people.</para><para>I suppose one might ask: are banks such a poor financial proposition that it is grossly unfair for members of the House to talk about issues such as community service obligations? I will give a few figures on bank profitability. In 1993 the ANZ Bank made $247 million, while in 1997 it made $1.02 billion. In 1993 the Commonwealth Bank made $443 million, while in  1997 it made $1.08 billion. In 1993 NAB made $1.13 billion, while in 1997 it 
 made $2.2 billion. In 1993 Westpac made $39 million and $1.29 billion in 1997. In other words, banks are amongst some of the profitable, if not the most profitable, undertakings in this Commonwealth. I do not have a particular objection to that if they are meeting their customers' requirements. I do not think that is the case.</para><para>When we were in government in 1994 we instituted a PSA inquiry into the fees and charges that banks were levelling, particularly for pensioners and their poorer customers. I think it is an absolute matter of regret, if not shame, that the Treasurer, Peter Costello, refuses to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to undertake a 1998 inquiry. In other words, the Treasurer is quite satisfied with the way the banks are operating, particularly in relation to pensioners and ordinary customersâparticularly the poorer customers.</para><para>If a pensioner wants to avoid using a bank, we require them to use a bank. We insist that their social security benefit cheque be placed into a bank. I am sure honourable members will recall a series of negotiations where all workers were required to give up cash being paid out to them on payday and have that money put into a bank. In other words, people do not have freedom of choice in terms of receiving cash or a cheque in the mail. It has to be put into a bank.</para><para>What is happening with fees and charges? There are some very good examples. I am indebted to <inline font-style="italic">Choice </inline>magazine for giving them to me. A customer with a medium use of their bank account who keeps a low balance will lose between $49 per year and as much as $130 per year. We have to bear in mind that these are the people who can least afford to meet these charges. In comparison, a person with a medium balance and a high use will only lose between $6 and $25 per year, while the person who holds a high bank balance with a medium use would earn, not lose, $95 to $235 per year. Where is the equity in all that?</para><para>It is not as if we have a range of consumer protection at work or an intense level of competition. How often have members of parliament heard those words `competition 
 solves everything'? In fact, in this industry it does not. Although the banks are complaining bitterly about the inroads, for example, that Aussie Home Loans and RAMS are making into their housing market, they still operate with some of the highest profits not just of corporations but by worldwide standards.</para><para>The margins are very high. But this government has allowed banks to increase their fees in a way ordinary people and pensioners cannot retaliate against. It is not a question of shopping around, because by and large they all charge the same exorbitant fees. If you are a pensioner you are not going to be better off by shopping around with banks. If you are a worker with a low deposit you are not going to be better off shopping around the banks because you are not going to do any good.</para><para>People might say, `Well, we have the Banking Ombudsman scheme.' Indeed, it is pleasing to see that we do have the Banking Ombudsman scheme. In the last year he has suffered a 30 per cent increase in complaints, but the ombudsman cannot rule on the level of fees and charges. He can rule as to whether they have been appropriately placed or made, but he cannot rule as to whether they are too high.</para><para>I say that what we need to do is to stop having the banks pay, as the ANZ does to its recently recruited chief executive, $2 million a year in annual salary plus options. I think we need to say that when banks get a licence it is a licence to print money, that there are obligations over and above good corporate citizenship, that the market place has failed to protect ordinary workers and pensioners and that we need to do something about it.</para><para>The National Farmers Federation is much in the news. Apparently, they have a multi-million dollar fighting fund. Let me say to the House: I am disappointed that not once has the National Farmers Federation approached me or any of my colleagues to see why we cannot have a bank farm debt mediation bill, which has been successfully operating, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, in your state and my state for some time. They will not spend one of those National Farmers Federation dollars to save one farmer being thrown out of his farm. </para><para>I have never been approached by the National Farmers Federation saying, `We're concerned about how rural and regional Australia is losing its banking infrastructure.' It seems to me that if you want to be a successful bank you do what ANZ has doneâsay to 1,700 workers, `Goodbye. We'll close a few more branches and we'll increase our bottom line.' Their bottom line, again, was $1.02 billion in 1997. Are they going to better that in 1998? Is the Commonwealth, NAB or Westpac going to better it by declining to provide services to people and by failing to have charges that ordinary people can cope with? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>âIs the motion seconded?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YK6</name.id><name role="metadata">WILTON</name><name role="display">Mr Wilton</name></talker><para>âI second the motion and reserve my right to speak.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>11</page.no><name role="metadata">Hawker, David, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HAWKER</name><name.id>8H4</name.id><electorate>Wannon</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI must admit that while listening to the member for Chifley (Mr Price) the more I heard the more confused I became because I really could not understand what he was speaking about. He has a motion before the House and he started off by saying, `I believe banks are an essential service,' or something close to it. After he said he understood why banks had to make profits, he then turned around and complained bitterly about the fact that they do make profits and spent most of his speech attacking the banks. Yet in his opening remarks he tried to have two bob each way and said, `I'm not really going to attack them; they're really not bad people, but . . . '.</para></talk.start><para>I do not have any brief with the banks, but I do find that whole approach very confusing. His suggestion seemed to be, as far as I could understand it, that we should have another inquiry. He talked about the inquiry when Labor was in power, yet we did not see a hell of a lot happen with that. You will remember when Mr Willis said back in 1995, `I'll direct the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to formally monitor' and so on. We have been through all  that.</para><para>If you want to talk about inquiries, I think one of the most successful inquiries that has been held in recent years, which parallels some that were held in earlier years, is the Wallis inquiry into financial systems. That 
 was one that was initiated by the current Treasurer (Mr Costello), whom I think the member for Chifley wanted to attack in his motion but did not mention much of during his speech. What that was all about was how we do in fact introduce competition. I have to say to my friend the member for Chifley: competition is working because, as you rightly pointed out, home mortgage rates have come down far more than official interest rates have come down. That is because competition has provided a much better, more efficient service to consumers. The consumers have been the winners. That is exactly what has come out of it.</para><para>If we look at some of his other comments, he said that we have to use a bank. Credit unions are also offering a very good service, and a lot of people are turning to credit unions because, under this government, we have allowed credit unions to issue cheques in their own right, which allows them to expand the range of services they are offering. This ensures that people do get an alternative, a choice. That is what competition is, my friend. That is giving people a real choice.</para><para>When I look at the whole motion that has been put, I think it has breathtaking hypocrisy. After 13 years in government, having not addressed any of these issues, he comes into this parliament and starts crying about it as though we do not already have monitoring going on. We know already that the ACCC and the Reserve Bank are monitoring the charges in bank fees. We already know that if there is any anti-competitive measures going on between the banks the ACCC can investigate that. It is already there.</para><para>We have to give full marks to the Treasurer and to the government, because by increasing competition we have ensured that consumers have benefited. I have mentioned already what is happening with the home mortgage rates. I wonder why he has not fully noticed all that. I think you also have to notice that, with the implementation of the recommendations of the Wallis inquiry, we are going to see further competition introduced. As Wallis has pointed out in his report, Australia's financial systems are about mid-range in world terms and there are effectively savings 
 of around 10 per cent of the full cost of operating our financial systemsâsavings of around $4 billion a year that can be had if we go down the path of opening up the system to further competition. I think the member has to remember that, by bringing in that competition, the government is benefiting consumers. We are already seeing some of the technological innovationsâlike EFTPOS, phone banking and ATMsâalso cutting costs.</para><para>I do not carry any brief for the banks. I think at times they have done some remarkably silly things, and I have said so publicly as recently as last week. Today 3AW reported what I would call another silly little move: a bank in East Kew in Melbourne is now charging non-account customers to get notes changed into 20-cent coins or whatever to pay for a telephone call or put in a parking meter. I must admit that, when I hear those sorts of stories, I think the banks cannot help themselves sometimes.</para><para>I was equally horrified when the Australian Bankers Association chose to publicise some fairly useful material when making a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, which I chair. I believe the deputy, the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), will be speaking shortly. The Bankers Association chose to present this information at Penshurst about three days after the National Bank had announced it would close its branch there. I thought that was unbelievable timing, but such is the way some banks do operate.</para><para>What horrified me even more was that, in relation to another branch that was being closed at the same time at Macarthur, just south of Hamilton, it has been revealed that the Moyne Shire Council had a contract with the National Bank after tendering for banking services. Part of that contract said quite clearly that the services would continue to be provided in, amongst other places, Macarthur. That shows quite clearly that the banks really do not understand what it is to provide a reasonable service to customers.</para><para>I would like to expand a bit on some of the work the committee is doing. I think it is undertaking a very worthwhile role. I see 
 another committee member has come into the chamber. I think all members realise that we will do some very good work in looking for alternative ways of providing banking services in regional and remote Australia. We want to see how we can ensure that people who cannot use or access some of the new technologies can still access some of what we would call the more traditional services that people in larger centres take for granted.</para><para>In this vein, the committee was most heartened last week to hear, in a meeting with the ANZ Bank, its new CEO, Mr John McFarlane, take on the concerns of the committee and come up with a very positive approach. He pointed out that he accepts that the market will not solve on its own the problem of providing services in regional and remote areas. He is prepared to look at innovative solutions that would include cooperating with the government and other financial institutions, which I think is a very significant statement. He also put forward a very positive attitude in getting involved on a national scale with GiroPost. I think the committee understood that would include addressing some of the difficulties the banks have had in the past where they may have been cooperating with GiroPost in competition with one of their own branches.</para><para>Mr McFarlane also showed that he is keen to help develop an environment that will help the committee address its inquiry terms of reference that look beyond the concerns of each major bank. Most importantly, he suggested we can address the needs of the community by having the major banks collectively trying to work towards solutions. To hear all that is a big breakthrough. Mr McFarlane went on to talk about his own experiences in Scotland with mobile banking. I think all members of the committee were very impressed with what they heard that day. I call on the CEOs of the other major banks to take up that challenge and join the committee in working towards seeing whether we can find ways of solving some of these problems facing regional Australia and probably some suburban areas too.</para><para>In conclusion, while the mover of this motion can criticise the banks certainly in 
 some areas, I think parts of that competition cannot be taken in isolation as the overall positive effects of competition have benefited the community greatly. Consumers have been the big winners. Instead of condemning the Treasurer with this miserable motion, its mover should be praising the Treasurer for providing a more competitive environment, for bringing about much lower home mortgages and lower overall banking costs and, importantly, allowing new players into the game, which will further benefit consumers in an area that we all know is vital and essential in everyday lives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>13</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilton, Greg, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILTON</name><name.id>YK6</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAs much as it was a privilege for me to second this motion submitted by the member for Chifley (Mr Price), I am equally and obviously a bit disturbed by some of the comments made by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who, whilst he has done a fair and decent job as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, I think on this occasion has made comments which serve no greater role than as the banks' official apologist.</para></talk.start><para>I challenge the member for Wannon to circulate the speech he just made to parts of his own worldâin Timboon, Simpson or Macarthurâwhere banks have closed and monitor the response of his constituents. They might agree that in many areas the committee which he chairs, and which I have the honour to also be a member of, has done some good work but I think we would have done much better work had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) thrown the committee more than a few crumbs as a result of the Wallis inquiry.</para><para>The member for Wannon cites the Wallis inquiry as being a major inquiry into bank activity, but he fails to mention that no consumer protection at all is cited within the outcome of the Wallis inquiry. If Mr Costello does, as I am sure he has already done, accept the Wallis report and recommendation that government keep out of fees and charges, he willâand he already has effectivelyâbe telling banks to go for their lives. Those banks have already been jacking up their fees to make up for the money that they are losing 
 on their housing margins when faced with competition from the new home lenders. They have now been given the green light to push those fees and charges even further.</para><para>The member for Wannon knows that these regressive bank fees and charges should be the subject of government scrutiny and government control. But, under this government, these rising fees and charges have just been ignored. In fact the Treasurer has given a green light to banks charging more and more for basic services. Your average Australian is being charged a substantial amount of money for what is a basic need. This government has indeed turned its back on the battlers. Two years ago today it promised to govern for all Australians.</para><para>Under Labor the banks were pressured into providing a no-frills account where over the counter transactions were free. This helped people on low incomes such as pensioners and students. But banks of course are again putting up these charges. <inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline> magazine, in an often quoted article from March 1997, stated:</para><para>Banks are systematically raising existing fees and charges. They're also coming up with new charges that hit every aspect of your transactions. And they're making some fees harder to avoid. The fees and charges are also confusing, as each financial institution has its own particular combination, making comparison very difficult.</para><para>This article is from a year ago, yet fees and charges in this regard continue to rise. The people hit hardest are those on lower incomes. The facts and figures cited by the member for Chifley are worth repeating. He said that that same <inline font-style="italic">Choice</inline>  article found that a low bank account balance, usually under $500, would attract bank fees from anywhere between $49 and a staggering $139. Mr Costello tells us that competition under these Wallis reforms will lead to lower bank charges and fees. But there has been no evidence of this. There has been no evidence of this in my part of the world. There has been no evidence of this in Horsham or Hamilton. There has been no evidence of this anywhere. Low income people are still paying far too much for a service that they cannot afford to be without.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PRICE</name><name role="display">Mr Price</name></talker><para>âIt's regressive.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Wilton, Greg, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILTON</name></talker><para>âCompetition is not going to fix that problem.

I would have thought, if the member for Chifley cared about the battlers and the pensioners, that he would care about the fact that today interest rates are around six per cent or seven per centânot 27 per cent. I can recall what you lot did to the whole blessed business sector as 
 well as private individuals when, in order to do something about the recession we had to have, you put the interest rates up to 27 per cent. I tell you what: you killed the goose, dead as a blessed doornail, and set in train your own demise. The battlers and the pensioners like the lower interest rates. Why? Because they are the ones that are borrowing the money. They are not putting it up there to get the interest back, are they?</para><para>I have no brief for the big banks. I think they need more competition. I agree with you. I think the fact that we are allowing the community co-ops now to issue cheques for their own accounts is absolutely brilliant policy. It will put more pressure on banks. The mortgage originators have put incredible pressure on the banks. They have helped push interest rates down and down. That helps the battlers; that helps the pensioners; that helps everybody on low incomes. It does not help the high income earners. He has it all wrong.</para><para>I apologise to the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). The member for Wannon called this a miserable motion. I would not put it quite in those terms. I think it is a bit silly, but I would not say it was absolutely miserable. The member for Wannon described this whole issue as one of hypocrisy. That is fair enough. The member for Chifley `notes with regret the Treasurer's priority of encouraging billion dollar profits for the banks and multi-million dollar salaries for banking executives at the expense of the ordinary customers of the banks'. What a lot of rubbish that is. Whoever said that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) was encouraging multiple billion dollar profits? Of course the Treasurer wants the banking sector to be profitable. What do you want? Do you want the banks to go into liquidation? Do you want another government regulator, another government bureaucracy, to tell the banks where they can set the levels of their fees and charges and what levels of interest rates we will have in the country? Is that the kind of re-regulation you would like to do?

I suggest that he is interested more in commercial values than in community values and people. The new system is bizarre, nonsensical and illogical. Dr Kemp boasts that he has set up a seamless service for the unemployed. Instead of a one-stop shop it would be best to describe the new system as the `new job shop hop' as the unemployed hop around from one provider to another. The unemployed will be forced to go from one provider to another, and on and on.

The days of the whiteboard and the sports rorts are well and truly over under this government. Mr Beazley clearly does not remember that there could be no inquiry into the sports rorts because by the time Ros Kelly wiped off her whiteboard there was literally nothing to investigate. Anyone who says that funding allocations to look after Perth's major rivers, such as the Swan and the Canning, would constitute a rort obviously has no concern for our waters, bird life, fish or future of our rivers.

I acknowledge at the commencement of my speech the importance of the fact that those forces were deployed overseas with the support of both the government and the opposition. I think it is always important that when Australian forces are sent abroad there be the maximum degree of political support for the deployment. I should also note that at every stage it has been the desire and in fact the practice of my government to keep the opposition fully informed of the material available to us and fully apprised of what we have had in mind. I want to record at the outset my appreciation of the support given to the deployment of those forces by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley).</para><para>The issues at stake in this resolution go very much to the heart of the future security of the kind of world we want, the effectiveness and credibility of monitoring regimes established by the United Nations and the capacity of the international community to preserve security in the face of threats from a regime which has thumbed its nose at the civilised world.</para><para>There may be some in the Australian community who take the rather misguided view that Iraq is a long way away from Australia and that in some way Australia is involving herself in a dispute which has no relevance to this country and poses little threat to the security of this country, and is in fact involving itself in essentially a dispute between the United States and the Iraqi leadership. That kind of view of the dispute that has gone on in the Gulf is a very misguided view and a view that completely misunderstands the record of defiance, of 
 arrogance and of deceit that has been practised by the Iraqi leadership since the successful conclusion of Operation Desert Storm in 1991.</para><para>It is in Australia's interest that the behaviour of Saddam Hussein be checked. It is in Australia's interest that the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council be enforced and it is in Australia's interest that the weapons of mass destruction that are in the hands of Saddam Hussein do not spread and are destroyed. It is always in the interest of Australia that rogue behaviour by anybody be stopped and it is always in the interest of Australia that the authority of the United Nations be upheld. The reality is that, if Iraq is able to succeed in thumbing her nose at the authority of the United Nations, if Iraq is able to succeed in maintaining and potentially using weapons of mass destruction in the future, other countries, including some closer to Australia, could easily be emboldened into believing that they could do a similar thing. That is why the leadership that has been displayed by the United States on this issue should be both endorsed and applauded. The United States has been a patient respondent to the provocative behaviour of Saddam Hussein, who ever since 1991 has thumbed his nose with impunity at the authority of the United Nations.</para><para>The House ought to be reminded that Saddam Hussein has not been reluctant in the past to use weapons of mass destruction against his own people. He used them against the Kurdish minority in Iraq, and he also used weapons of mass destruction in the Iraq-Iran war. He likes to say that UNSCOM is the problem. The reality is that UNSCOM has uncovered nearly 38,000 chemical weapons, nearly half a million litres of the chemical agents which go into producing these weapons as well as a biological weapons plant, missiles and warheads. It is quite frightening for the world to contemplate the purposes for which these weapons might have been stored.</para><para>All of us, throughout this dispute, have hoped that military action could be avoided, and that remains the universal desire and, I am sure, the universal resolve of all honour 
 able members. It ought to be recorded that the willingness of the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other countries to deploy forces and to indicate a preparedness to use those forces if necessary has played a major role in bringing about the agreement between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Iraqi leadership. As Kofi Annan himself saidâand I think it summed up precisely the strategic importance of what has occurred in recent weeksâ`You can do a lot with diplomacy, but with diplomacy backed up by force you can get a lot more done.' The reality is that if we had not joined the United States and if the United States had not shown the leadership it did then Kofi Annan and the Iraqi leadership would not have concluded the agreement that was signed in Baghdad last week.</para><para>I want to place on record the appreciation of the government, and I believe of the Australian people, for the work that has been undertaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. All of us hope that the agreement that was signed is worth the paper that it was written on. All of us hope that the commitments made on this occasion by Saddam Hussein will be honoured.</para><para>It is fair to say that there are many around the world, including many people in Australia, who are entitled to feel utterly cynical about public commitments that are being made by the Iraqi leadership because in the pastâand there should be no illusions about thisâIraq has made promises which have been cynically dishonoured. Iraq has a track record of deceit and obstruction. It has shown little regard for the United Nations' resolutions and agreements and over the past seven yearsâindeed, since 1991âthe Iraqi regime has constantly challenged the terms of the cease-fire mandated by the United Nations. For four years it denied it had a biological weapons program, it has still not accounted for the germ bombs that were made for the Iraqi air force, and Saddam Hussein has deliberately refused to relieve the burden of sanctions from his own people. I say again, and it is an undeniable fact, that Saddam Hussein has only to honour the commitments 
 of the cease-fire agreement entered into after he withdrew from Kuwait in the face of Operation Desert Storm for those sanctions to be lifted. The international community must see this one through, just as it stood firm in 1990 and 1991 when he invaded a peaceful neighbour.</para><para>It is important that no troop withdrawals take place until Iraq's commitment to the agreement signed last week has been fully tested. It would be absurd in the extreme if Saddam Hussein's word were to be relied upon alone. It is absolutely essential that the commitments that were made by the Iraqis be fully, adequately and comprehensively tested by a thorough and total inspection before there is any contemplation of relaxing the military pressure which has been applied so successfully to Iraq over the past few weeks.</para><para>It is the policy of the Australian government, and I believe the overwhelming wish of the Australian people, that United Nations Security Council resolutions, especially 678 and 687, should be fully honoured. The specific conditions of the cease-fire, concluded in 1991, were that Iraq would dismantle its existing weapons of mass destruction and not reacquire them in the future, and UNSCOM, now led by an Australian, Mr Richard Butler, was constituted to verify compliance by Iraq with those resolutions.</para><para>Australia has made a very significant contribution to its work by providing experts in chemical and biological weapons. Australia continues to be at the forefront of efforts to strengthen the regimes against chemical and biological weapons. As chairman of the group, Australia has led the world in establishing common export controls on chemical and biological agents which could be used for weapons. But more can and must be done to strengthen the international regime against biological weapons. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) will be making a detailed announcement today about a new initiative being proposed by Australia in this connection. There is an urgent need to conclude a verification protocol to the biological weapons convention and Australia, as the foreign minister will announce later today, will take a lead in placing these negotiations 
 on a fast track. Specifically, we will push for the conclusion of the negotiations as soon as possible; we will call for a high level international meeting to inject the necessary political commitment to achieve this; we will develop a draft protocol text to help move the negotiations to an early conclusion; and we will convene a national advisory group, drawing on the expertise of industry, science and academia, to address the complex technical issues which need to be settled in the negotiations.</para><para>I would like to conclude my remarks by addressing some comments to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are currently stationed in the Gulf. Australians can take an enormous amount of pride in the professionalism, the commitment, the courage and the high standards in every respect of our Defence Force personnel. It was a particular experience of my prime ministership to have the opportunityâindeed, the privilegeâto farewell the members of the SAS Regiment and also the Air Force personnel at Campbell Barracks in Western Australia some 10 days ago. On that occasion, I am pleased to say, I was joined by the Leader of the Opposition and we spoke with a common voice in wishing the fighting men and women of Australia godspeed and good luck as they went overseas. They were, in their conversations with both of us, a bright, alert, committed group of people who understood full well the dangers involved in the mission they were undertaking, but because of the superb quality of the training and their finely-honed commitment to professional soldiering they were very ready for the task.</para><para>What lies ahead of them at this stage we still do not know. The prospect of their being involved in armed conflict is certainly less now than it was when they left Australia a short while ago. But we have no guaranteeâparticularly if his conduct to date is any guideâthat Saddam Hussein will ultimately honour the commitments that he has made.</para><para>All of us hope that armed conflict will not be necessary. All of us hope that the deployment of military forces, the willingness to use military force, will be sufficient to bring about an ultimately peaceful resolution of this 
 dispute. But at the end of the dayâand this message must never be forgotten by any member of this Houseâthe history of the whole of the 20th century indicates that if international bullies, dictators and tyrants are allowed to get away with that kind of conduct, if their bullying and their threats constantly bring about retreat rather than resistance, then in the end the price paid by the rest of the world is infinitely greater and infinitely more bloody than the price that might have been paid if resistance had been entertained at an earlier stage.</para><para>Saddam Hussein in 1991 was stopped and forced to withdraw from Kuwait by the combined effort of the coalition forces. On this occasion a smaller but nonetheless powerful coalition led by the United States, including active involvement by Australia, has succeeded in forcing Saddam Hussein to negotiate. It remains to be seen whether he will be as good as his word.</para><para>As far as the Australian government is concerned, it is appropriate that not only the United States but also Australian forces remain in the Gulf while the commitments of the Iraqis are fully tested. I know that we in the government and many people in Australia will await with very keen interest and anticipation precisely what comes out of those inspections.</para><para>Finally, on behalf of all members of the House and the Australian people, I thank the members of the Australian Defence Force who are currently serving in the Gulf. We wish them well. We admire their professional commitment. We thank them for their courage and we respect immensely the enormous job that they are doing on behalf of the entire Australian nation.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reith</inline>)âby leaveâagreed to:</para><para>That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 16 minutes and other members speaking for a period not exceeding 10 minutes each.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>22</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and at the outset acknowledge the comments 
 he made about the views that the opposition or I expressed. I also confirm his statement that when we have sought information on the nature of the commitment that Australia is making and on the detail of the international diplomatic effort it has been forthcoming to the opposition in accord with the Australian tradition. It has been very useful for us to have that information.</para></talk.start><para>I also join him at the outset in expressing my thanks to the Australian serving personnel who have departed for the Gulf. It is of course, at any point in time when we seek to commit forces overseas, a matter for appropriate debate between governments, oppositions and in the community generally as to whether that commitment ought to be made. That is a normal part of the political discourse in a democracy.</para><para>However, it is not a matter of debate for those who are amongst our serving personnel. By way of anecdote, I recollect the occasion that the Prime Minister referred to when he and I farewelled the Australian forces on their way. He concluded his remarks, made at some length, and there was no applause at the end of them. That was not because the remarks were inappropriate or ineffectively delivered. They were appropriate and they were effectively delivered. But there was an atmosphere in the place from a group of men and women who were there to hear from the government which commands them the reasons why they were being deployed. It was not a matter for debate for them; it was merely for them to hear what was being presented to them, to hold discussions, to talk to the Prime Minister, me and anyone else who happened to be around immediately after that and then to go.</para><para>It is a level of commitment which I think is always important for us to acknowledge. I am sure all Australians, whether they have views in accord with the government and the opposition on this matter or not, would also join in wishing the Australian armed forces over there well in the circumstances in which they find themselves.</para><para>There has of course been some matter of debate in the Australian community about this, and I would want at this point particular 
 ly to note the fact that some members of the Arab-Australian community have been deeply concerned. That is not a matter that reflects upon their patriotism or their commitment to this nationânot for one minuteâand that has been appropriately recognised too by the government and opposition in their remarks. I doubt whether there would be a single person amongst that community who would have anything other than good regard for the Australian forces overseas.</para><para>If anyone were to doubt that commitment, I learned anecdotally only the other week that, hitherto, a fertile groundâand a disproportionate representation thereforeâfor recruitment to the Australian defence forces has always been Queensland and particularly rural Queensland. They are being joined in that disproportionality these days by members of the Arab-Australian community. That is a point worth noting in the contextâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">HOWARD</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>âI met one last week in Darwin.

I think that that is an important point to make in reflection upon the past few weeks and in reflection on events yet to come.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I also want to join the Prime Minister in placing on record our appreciation of the services of Kofi Annan and the outcome that he was able to achieve. He had, of course, before him the example of a previous UN Secretary-GeneralâPerez de Cuellerâwho sought to negotiate with Saddam Hussein in 1991 and was unsuccessful. It was not a background that would have given Kofi Annan any encouragement as he approached the task set before him. Nevertheless, he was able to secure an agreementâan agreement which, of course, is yet to be enforced and which, as this motion appropriately recognises, has to be the subject of testing in relation to the word of Saddam Hussein on it. Nevertheless, a substantial agreement it appears.</para><para>Kofi Annan was quick to acknowledge that his capacity to achieve that was because his position was backed up by a willingness on 
 the part of others to display firmness and contemplate force. It was not something that he said when he got back to New York. It was something that he said when he was actually there conducting a joint interview with the official from Iraq with whom he had been negotiating.</para><para>It is an achievement that deserves the greatest possible respect. But it is also an achievement that indicates the significance of the UN's role in this exercise and the importance of our not moving away from stressing the fact that every possible opportunity ought to be taken to ensure that, in this action and in any further action that arises from it, the best endeavours ought to be made to secure the maximum possible cooperation amongst all nations of goodwill who are members of the United Nations to bring about an outcome. When you have a Secretary-General who is capable of performing with considerable diplomatic success, that is something that ought not to be set aside lightly.</para><para>I do think it is important that in this exercise we seek, and the motion refers to, international endeavour in relation to ensuring that this agreement is upheld. I do think it is important that we seek to optimise that United Nations involvement, that international community involvement.</para><para>As somebody who was on the security committee in 1991 at the time that we made an initial commitment to the Gulf in that conflict whose unfinished business we are dealing with here today, I found impressive the way in which United States diplomacy in particularâthat country being head of the coalition forces that were congregating to deal with the problemâwas able to secure agreements through the United Nations for action to be taken. I would urge upon our American counterparts, whose commitment in this regard has been correctly characterised by the Prime Minister, to seek a similar environment in relation to the arrangements that we are now putting in place.</para><para>As I said before, this is a matter which is the principal partânot the only partâof the unfinished business of the 1991 Gulf conflict. At the conclusion of that, Saddam Hussein signed up to an agreement which said that he 
 would `vacate the ownership of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems'. He subsequently misled the international public about precisely his level of involvement and possession of those weapons and, in all probability, continues to seek to mislead the international public about that situation.</para><para>But it is important to reflect upon this fact: many more weapons and materials associated with weapons have been destroyed as a result of UNSCOM inspections than were destroyed by bombing activities of the coalition and other military activities of the coalition during the Gulf War. And they have been very considerable: 480,000 litres of live chemical weapon agents; 38,000 chemical weapon munitions; 30  special missile warheads for chemical and biological weapons; 690 tonnes of chemical weapon agents; 3,000 tonnes of chemical weapon precursors. These are very substantial capabilities, already established and destroyed as a result of UNSCOM activities.</para><para>UNSCOM in the timeâas a product of their own investigations and as a product, too, of defectionsâhas discovered that Iraq produced 19,000 litres of botulism, 8,400 litres of anthrax, 2,000 litres of aflatoxin and a considerable amount of clostridium, and has admitted filling ballistic missile warheads and bombs with the first three of those biological agents. They denied the existence of any biological weapon program until 1995, and claimed that the principal anthrax production facility was for the production of animal feed.</para><para>It needs to be reflected upon that 100 kilograms of anthrax dispersed in a densely populated area could kill as many people as a nuclear weapon, and it is a far easier weapon to deliver by far less sophisticated processes than applies in the delivery of nuclear warheads.</para><para>The question arises from all of that, of course, is: why ought there still to be inquiries in regard to their capabilities? Apart from any inability to rely on Saddam Hussein's word, we still have a substantial number of critical missile components, warheads and propellant not accounted for; nor are 17 tonnes of growth media for biological warfare agentsâenough to produce more than three 
 times the amount of anthrax that Iraq admits it had; and 4,000 tonnes of material for the production of chemical weapons precursors are not accounted for. And I could go on. There are a wide variety of chemical precursors, biological precursors and delivery systems known to be in the possession of the Iraqi government that have not to this point of time been exposed by UNSCOM's exploration.</para><para>It is important to acknowledge also that, of course, an awful lot of what is done in the sorts of establishments which would produce chemical and biological weapons is legitimate, ordinary, commercial chemical and biological business. It can be used for perfectly acceptable peaceful processes or can be converted for use for some of the most heinous weapons that men's imagination has yet managed to devise.</para><para>It is only by an inspection regime that there will be a capacity to discover a continued adherence to the terms of resolution 687, which concluded the war. So I welcome the proposition that has been put forward by the government to fast-track a regime for the general disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, in particular chemical and biological weapons. I think the remarks they made were in regard in particular to biological weapons.</para><para>I think it is a reasonable point to make that it is not just Saddam Hussein who ought to be regarded with concern as potentially the possessor of these weapons. These weapons have no business in the human familyânone at allâand should be excluded from them altogether. Our concerns about Saddam Hussein's situation, while heightened, ought not to be unique. It is entirely appropriate that the point be made to him as well as to others that we are seeking general universal disarmament as far as these weapons are concerned.</para><para>Therefore, we welcome in particular this part of the motion which has been moved here today that talks about the need for this to be a step in a generalised exclusion of weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East altogether. All parties in the Middle East that might possess or contemplate the use of these weapons ought to be part of a regime 
 which sees their dismantling. Resolution 687 anticipated this. This particular proposition is contained within resolution 687. While it is important for the globe generally for all nations to be divested of these weapons, it is particularly important in any historical conflict zone that these weapons ought to be removed. Of course, the Middle East is par excellence a historical conflict zone.</para><para>These weapons, so easily delivered, so interesting not just to governments but to people who seek access to them for terrorist and criminal purposes, ought to create a level of concern in the international community which, unfortunately, is not there. We had a focus during the Cold War on the removal of weapons of mass destruction. We have lost the focus; it has gone. We need to refocus on those issues because they are as critical now as they were thenâprobably even more critical now than it was then, because at least it was under a regime where both sides in those days had established a degree of conservatism in their behaviour with each other.</para><para>That no longer applies to those states which already have acquired or may over the course of the next few years seek to acquire these weapons. There is no such regime of adversarial partnership applying to them. So the stand that Australia takes on this is very important. When we were in government we always took the international arms control issue seriously. I am glad to see that the government has picked up the ball in this regard and run with it on several occasions over the course of the last couple of yearsâand evidently in some decisions arrived at today. I would single out my deputy leader in this regard as somebody who spent a great deal of time when he was Foreign Minister of this country putting these issues on the international agenda and ensuring that these questions were pursued.</para><para>We support this proposition. We hope it is the last time the parliament needs to consider this matter. We hope very much that the agreements that Saddam has entered into will be adhered to by him. We hope that the international community will pursue the enforcement of those agreements with good commonsense and with a degree of substantial 
 unity. I conclude where I began: by expressing again the opposition's well wishes to and appreciation of the preparedness of our serving men and women to make the sacrifice that they do in defence of the interests of this nation and our people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>25</page.no><name role="metadata">Fischer, Tim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TIM FISCHER</name><name.id>DG4</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Trade; Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is with sadness that I rise to support this motionâI guess the same sadness that I felt on 21 January 1991. At that time I said to the House:</para></talk.start><para>. . . it is the duty of this Parliament, quite apart from Cabinet and Government, to return to Canberra this day to debate and discuss the Gulf war and to declare our support for the Australian forces and the multinational coalition of allied forces in the Middle East.</para><para>Dare I say once again, dear friends, that this is the case again. This commitment of our forces is totally justified, and it is for the elected government and subsequently the elected parliament to affirm this. Our forces go with that spirit of commitment to service and of dedicated efficiency and effectiveness that they have always displayed over the decades.</para><para>I might add that same type of efficiency and effectiveness was, in a different format, on display last night in Canberra on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the Royal Australian Regiment at the Australian War Memorial and the birthday of the Australian Army. In the course of that function there was a considerable amount of discussion with regard to the latest developments in the Middle East and Iraq, and great and heartfelt support from all ranks for the decisions made by the government, which was pleasing to encounter on that occasion.</para><para>Let me reiterate that appeasement of Iraq, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, is no solution. It will lead to complete catastrophe in the Middle East. As a Vietnam veteran, I say to the House quite categorically that any comparison between what is happening in the Middle East, then and now, and the Vietnam War is shallow and without foundation. It is a totally different set of circumstances.</para><para>Our prompt action in joining the US-led coalition in standing up to Saddam Hussein 
 shows our commitment to peace and to a world free of the threat of weapons of mass destruction. It also shows our commitment to the Middle East regionâa historic commitment built over the First World War, the Second World War and on many occasions since. The Middle East region is threatened continually by this dictator Saddam Hussein, who has no respect for the rights of his own people or for the national integrity and sovereignty of Iraq's	neighbours. It is not a region which can thrive prosperously and securely in that circumstance.</para><para>I know there are people in the Middle East who are unhappy about the build-up of arms that have been necessary to induce Saddam Hussein to meet his international obligations. Let me say to those people, to Australians of Middle East origin and to other Australians who care about the Middle East region, as I do, that what we seek is a Middle East region free of fear, secure from this horrendous threat which Saddam Hussein and his weapons constitute.</para><para>Let me also say to them that we have no quarrel with the people of Iraq, who are the foremost and most tragic victims of Saddam Hussein's disregard for human life and welfare. On the contrary, we care about their plight, and we have worked hard to supply, within the limitations of UN sanctions, food and other humanitarian goods which will help them materially, thereby strengthening the links between the Iraqi people and the rest of the word. They have suffered far too much for far too long.</para><para>We want very much to see the day when the Iraqi people will be free of the privations they have suffered under sanctions. We welcome greatly the increased opportunities which will be available to the Iraqi people under this month's expansion of the UN's oil for food arrangements. But we can only wonder in anger at the callous disregard with which they are treated by Saddam Hussein, who by his wilful non-compliance with UN resolutions is directly responsible for the continuation of the sanctions, just as he is directly responsible for the appalling violations of the human rights of the Iraqi people in which his regime indulges every day.</para><para>Make no mistake: my concern for the Middle East and its peoples is considerable and longstanding. I have travelled comprehensively throughout the Middle East both as a minister and previously. There are very many people from all countries in the Middle East whom I know well and many I regard as my friends. As minister, I have worked hard to build prosperity and linkages between Australia and the Middle Eastâtrade, investment and tourism linkagesâand I will continue to do so.</para><para>Our trade with the Middle East is now strong, and we will continue to further expand it. On Wednesday, I will produce the second trade outcomes and objectives statement, which will show that, for the first time ever, Iran was our fastest growing export market, in the top 20, last financial yearâmainly due to a large wheat sale. Our $3.6 billion of exports across a wide range of sectors to the Middle East counts a great deal. Let me also say emphatically to the House and our export industries: your efforts to develop this export trade will not be blocked by Australia's determination to help resolve this crisis.</para><para>I therefore welcome the agreement that was forged last week in Baghdad by the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr Kofi Annan. I look forward to it being kept. I salute the contributions of all those who made it possible for that agreement to be reached, in particular the contributions of the armed forces and the armed response by the US, the UK and other nations, including Australia. By putting those troops on line we were saying to Saddam, `It is time to get serious; it is time for you to comply with the resolutions of the UN.'</para><para>I am very proud that Australian soldiers and forces have joined in this brave endeavour. I have great confidence in the competence of the Special Air Services Regiment, the elements thereof committed; the elements of the Royal Australian Air Force refuelling unit, also committed; and the headquarters unit and other resources of the Australian armed forces.</para><para>We learned a great deal in 1991 in the Gulf War, as did those who served in the Middle East at that time. We do not go to learn, necessarily; we go to make a stand for peace 
 against weapons of mass destruction and to turn the tide. We look for Saddam Hussein to keep his word. Let him understand fully that, if he does not, our soldiers, along with the forces of our partners, are prepared to hold him to it. We care too much about the Middle East regionâits peace, its security and its prosperityâto stand aside when there is so much at stake. I wish the allied forces well. I wish the individual Australians well as the government and the parliament go about the very serious and solemn business of affirming this commitment to this justified cause.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>27</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Gareth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GARETH EVANS</name><name.id>VD4</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOne of the most important and encouraging features of last week's events was the reaffirmation of the role of the United Nations in preventing deadly conflict. It is that that I want to emphasise in my remarks in support of this resolution. The United Nations is the only organisation with effectively universal membership that the world has, or is ever likely to have, and the only organisation that is fully, clearly and directly empowered under international law to do as it thinks appropriateâincluding use military forceâin the face of violations of international law.</para></talk.start><para>The UN can be paralysed by its own rules and procedures, especially the veto exercisable by permanent Security Council members. It was so paralysed, much to the cost of the world, through most of the Cold War years. With the end of the Cold War, the UN did start to find a new voice and authority, exercised in many ways and many situations but probably to greatest effect in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwaitâthe first great post-Cold War test of the international order and its capacity for cohesive action in response to tyrannical aggression.</para><para>True it is that it was the United States that supplied the basic energy and fire power in the Gulf War coalition. True it is that without the United States the UN would have been largely impotent. But it was the legitimacy conveyed by the UN Security Council support for the Gulf response that made it possible for that coalition to be assembled and maintained. Of course, it was under UN auspices that UNSCOM, the weapons inspection and 
 destruction regime, was put in place and has been effectively maintained and backed by an effectiveâor at least toughâsanctions regime.</para><para>When Saddam Hussein chose, as he did a few weeks ago, to confront the authority of UNSCOM and the UN, that posed a huge dilemma for the United Nations, for the United States and for the rest of the international community, including Australia. It was absolutely critical for the credibility of the rule of law and for the chances of a civilised international future that nobody blinked; that Saddam be brought back to compliance.</para><para>The issue of weapons of mass destruction, and in particular chemical and biological weapons, is one of the most crucial that remains to be resolved as we approach the 21st century. Australia has played a critical role in recent years in putting in place the Chemical Weapons Convention, in trying to improve the Biological Weapons Convention and in trying to achieve a genuine nuclear disarmament regime. The credibility of these conventions and the supporting regimes that we have all fought so hard to put in place would have been gravely diminished were Saddam allowed to get away with rendering the UN and UNSCOM impotent.</para><para>It could not be allowed to happen. But the big question that had to be facedâthe big dilemma that had to be facedâby the international community was: would diplomacy be effective; would diplomacy, backed by the existing sanctions regime, be enough?</para><para>The judgment was madeâI think rightlyâby the United States and supported, critically, by the UN Secretary-General that diplomacy or mere persuasion not backed by some credible threat of force was not going to be enough. In that context, the US decision to credibly threaten the prospect of such force, to rapidly build up military capability in the Gulf, in conjunction, in effect, with anyone who was prepared to join it, was both understandable and helpful, on the Dr Johnson maxim, if you like, about what is necessary to concentrate people's minds.</para><para>The extra diplomatic clout that was given by this very real prospect of force was frankly and squarely acknowledged by Kofi Annan 
 and we ought to recognise it, as this motion does. In the case of Australia, it was our contribution to making credible and effective that diplomatic pressure that remains the best justification for the course that we took.</para><para>All that said, I think we do have to acknowledge that this was and remains a matter of very fine and balanced judgment as to whether Australia should have joined in this process in the way that we did and at the stage that we did and bearing in mind that we had to face the very real prospect that diplomatic pressure, even backed by this force, may not have been enough, that it would fail and we would actually have to deliver.</para><para>The arguments were not all one way on this issue and feeling on this issue is not all one way in the Australian community. On the one hand, in favour of the course that was taken were these obvious considerations. Many of them have been mentioned in previous contributions, and I will not labour them at length. It is the case that Saddam Hussein has behaved like an absolute villain in trying to conceal the existence of a continuing chemical and biological weapons regime. It is the case that Saddam has a demonstrated track record of actually using chemical weapons in warfare against his neighbours and against his own people, which puts him in a class absolutely apart from those who have merely acquired mass destructive capability, as reprehensible as that might be.</para><para>It is the case, as I have already said, that the need to contain and destroy weapons of mass destruction is one of the great remaining issues to be resolved for the 21st century. It is crucial that the credibilityâknowing where and how to draw a line of that attemptâbe maintained. Sanctions measures so far have proved only to be of relatively limited utility in forcing compliance with the UNSCOM UN regime while at the same time unquestionably doing grave damage to the Iraqi people, damage not being perpetrated of course by the international community but by Saddam Hussein, who continues to resist doing the right thing. Of course also in favour was the point I have been making that the threat of force was obviously going to add an extreme 
 ly helpful dimension to that diplomatic pressure.</para><para>But, on the other hand, there was this to be said and it has been said and it needs to be acknowledged: there has been a real problem in identifying realisable, achievable strategic objectives to be accomplished by actual military operations should it have come to that. It is the case that there has been nothing like the same degree of international support this time that there was in 1991, with the prevailing international belief being that Saddam has been sufficiently contained by the efforts of the UN to date and that there is no imminent threat from him at least with his basic delivery systems effectively destroyed. There have been other reasons also advanced to question the US initiative, including the claim of double standards and so on, but the two that I have mentioned are by far the most important of the concerns that have been raised.</para><para>The point I make is that it has been for everyone involved an `on balance' call, and none of us should pretend otherwise. The opposition believes that it was, on balance, right to give real substance and weight to the diplomatic pressure by creating and applying the realistic threat of force. In the result we can, of course, all be deeply relieved that some very effective diplomacy, particularly by Kofi Annan, created a situation where there is now genuine cause for hope, not only for the avoidance of conflict in the very  short term but for the effective compliance once and for all by Iraq with its cease-fire obligations.</para><para>No-one should be cynical or dismissive about Kofi Annan's and the United Nations achievement. By his actions he averted a horrible conflict, one which would have added yet another layer of immeasurable destruction to the suffering of the Iraqi people that has already gone on for too long because of their utter control by someone who continues to behave like a tyrannical villain, more to his own people in fact than to anyone else. He averted that conflict in a way that was both intelligent and honourable. This was no appeasement. This was no feeble capitulation to someone who stared him down and outma 
 noeuvred him. Kofi Annan is a quiet understated man. You do not get from him the pyrotechnics of some of his predecessors. But as I have cause to know well personally, he is a brilliant diplomat, he is someone who does not get stared down by anyone, he is nobody's fool and he would never settle for an illusory, dishonourable peace, one that cannot in fact be sustained.</para><para>As to the future, it is not a matter of last week's events involving a renunciation of the possibility of a military response in the future by the international community if that becomes appropriate and necessary. But what it does mean is that the prospect of deadly conflict is not now imminent. Of course the international community, including Australia, now needs to maintain a close watching brief. But do let us recognise that a lot has been gained and nothing has been lost to the international community in terms of either military advantage or honour by events taking the course that they did.</para><para>Let us recognise and acknowledge diplomatic success when we see it and let us in particular recognise and acknowledge diplomatic success by the United Nations when we see it. In the world that we are now facing in the 21st centuryâtumultuous and uncertain, with multiple power centresâwe simply cannot afford for the United Nations not to be successful.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>29</page.no><name role="metadata">Downer, Alexander, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DOWNER</name><name.id>4G4</name.id><electorate>Mayo</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Foreign Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI begin by saying that the government was naturally enough pleased that an agreement was concluded on 23 February between the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and the government of Iraq. As I and other members of the government have made clear and as our diplomatic record illustrates, we have long advocated that a peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis was preferable to military action, with a commensurate commitment by Iraq that it comply in full with its obligations under relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.</para></talk.start><para>But we have also said all along that, if constructive diplomacy were to fail, the choice would become a choice between military action and doing nothing. Doing 
 nothing would be to give Saddam Hussein a chance to develop further his weapons of mass destruction capability. From the beginning of this latest crisis the government has done what it could to achieve a diplomatic solution. Obviously, from Australia's perspective, our capacity to do that is somewhat limited.</para><para>First, we did explain our views very directly to the Iraqi government, urging the Iraqi leadership to honour its commitments under the United Nations Security Council resolutionsâin particular, resolution 687. Secondly, in recent weeks we intensified our dialogue with those parties who are actively working towards a peaceful solutionâin particular, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Thirdly, in relation to our own region, I wrote to my counterparts setting out our position reiterating Australia's desire for an effective and a credible diplomatic solution backed, if necessary, by force.</para><para>Iraq's record of honouring its commitments is, as the House knows, not a distinguished one. It will, therefore, be necessary for the United Nations Security Council to nail down the terms of the agreement Iraq signed with Kofi Annan and for UNSCOM and the United Nations to put it to the test before we can be confident that Iraq will in fact meet all of its obligations. Nevertheless, the agreement is an encouraging development and the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, is to be congratulated for his efforts.</para><para>The government believes that the conclusion of a UN-Iraq agreement vindicates our in-principle decision to participate if necessary in military action and to deploy Australian forces to the Gulf as part of an international coalition. As the United Nations Secretary-General has himself acknowledged, diplomacy can play a vital role in settling disputes,, but it often works best when backed by the threat of force. This is certainly the case with respect to Saddam Hussein's persistent defiance of the United Nations Security Council and his unremitting refusal to meet his obligations. It would not be prudent to remove that threat of force until Saddam Hussein has proved his commitment to honour this latest agreement. For that reason, the 
 government has appropriately decided that Australian forces in the Gulf will, like other coalition forces, remain in the area until Saddam Hussein matches his words with his deeds.</para><para>I should like to remind the House of the reasons behind Australia's robust policy towards Iraq's non-compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions. Those reasons are clear and persuasive and they follow from long-established principles of Australian foreign and security policy as well as from the evidence of Iraq's behaviour over the past seven years.</para><para>First, it is a fundamental goal of Australian foreign policy to make every effort to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The recent white paper on Australian foreign and trade policy made it clear that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one of the major threats, if not the major threat, to global security and that Australia has a strong national interest in preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons and banning chemical and biological weapons.</para><para>As honourable members know, Australia has a long and successful record of working towards preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction generally, and we have been instrumental in strengthening the global non-proliferation regime with respect to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Our diplomatic efforts and intellectual input were critical to the indefinite extension in 1995 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. We played a pivotal role in the adoption in 1996 of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and also in negotiating and finally bringing to fruition the chemical weapons convention.</para><para>The next major challenge for the international community is to negotiate a verification protocol to the biological weapons convention. In this context, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said, we will be taking a series of initiatives to fast-track the current negotiations in the Ad Hoc Group in Geneva on a verification protocol to the biological weapons convention. We need to take these steps because, despite a legal norm prohibiting the development, production and stockpil 
 ing of biological weapons being in place for some 25 years, there is no means of verifying effectively countries' compliance.</para><para>Iraq's violation of this norm by developing a large scale biological weapons program demonstrates the necessity of intensifying the current negotiations and putting in place a stringent verification regime that will ensure that the world is free from the threat of biological warfare. To this end, the government is committed to undertake initiatives which will include convening a high level meeting at either the ministerial or senior officials level to inject the necessary political commitment urgently to resolve outstanding issues and to conclude the negotiations as a matter of priority. For our part, the government would like to see these negotiations concluded by the end of this year.</para><para>We will also be establishing here in Australia a national advisory group to draw on the expertise of industry, academia and science to ensure that the verification machinery established under the protocol is as effective as possible. It will be another example of Australia putting significant intellectual effort into a disarmament initiative. We intend to work closely with other delegations, in our current capacity as vice-chairman of the negotiations and as coordinator of the western group, to develop a draft protocol text which will allow an early conclusion of the negotiations.</para><para>The second principle underlying the government's policy towards Iraqi non-compliance is that it is a basic tenet of our foreign policy that the authority of the United Nations Security Council be upheld, because the Security Council is the body mandated by the UN charter with the maintenance of international peace and security.</para><para>The international system must continue to function on the basis of respect for the rule of law, and the council is one of the principal sources of international law through its legally binding resolutions. It is these resolutions which Iraq has so consistently flouted, including some passed by the Security Council acting under chapter 7 of the charter which envisages enforcement measures including the use of force.</para><para>Since the end of the Gulf War and the UN Security Council's cease-fire resolution 687 that established UNSCOM and mandated it to verify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Iraq has concealed its weapons of mass destruction program and obstructed UNSCOM's activities. This recent crisis is just the latest in a long list of examples of Iraqi intransigence and obfuscation stretching over seven years. In its dealings with Iraq during this time and at international forums, the Australian government has consistently deplored Iraqi non-compliance and made clear that Iraq must comply with all its obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions.</para><para>The third reason underlying the government's policy on Iraq is that, as UNSCOM and the UN Security Council have made abundantly clear, there are good grounds for fears that Iraq may still possess weapons of mass destruction capabilities. For seven years Iraq has undertaken deliberate concealment programs to hide those capabilities. In the absence of continued UNSCOM inspections, Iraq will keep these assets and almost certainly rebuild its weapons of mass destruction inventory. That will constitute a threat not only to the Middle East but to the wider international community. For these reasons, I commend this motion to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>31</page.no><name role="metadata">Brereton, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BRERETON</name><name.id>5T4</name.id><electorate>Kingsford-Smith</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âLast week, with Australia's active support, the United States and the United Kingdom were poised on the brink of conducting what was to be a very substantial military strike against Iraq. The declared objective of such an operation was to destroy or at least substantially reduce Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction if they did not immediately comply with the UN Security Council resolutionsâthose resolutions requiring disclosure and elimination, and unrestricted access.</para></talk.start><para>It is fair to say that the threat of military action was not made lightlyâand it never should be. Resort to force always involves significant uncertainty and risk. No-one can have any illusions about that. And it would be very foolish to dismiss the likelihood that Iraqi civilians would have paid a dreadful price. I join with the Deputy Prime Minister 
 (Mr Tim Fischer) in respect of the sentiments he expressed about the civilians of Iraq and the differentiation between the civilians of Iraq and the Iraqi regime. Although any air offensive would have been conducted to minimise civilian casualties, and certainly precision guidance technology has advanced in leaps and bounds in recent years, the fact remains that the only thing `surgical' about the use of air power is what happens in the hospitals afterwards.</para><para>No-one can be enthusiastic or cavalier in threatening military action, but it was clearly necessary and appropriate to compel Iraq to comply with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. These resolutions include resolution 687, the Gulf War cease-fire resolution requiring the disclosure and destruction, under international supervision, of these weapons; and resolution 707, which requires Iraq to provide UNSCOM and the IAEA with immediate unconditional and unrestricted access. These requirements are not arbitrary demands of the United States of America. They are essential requirements for effective verification demanded by the Security Council through resolutions that are binding in international law.</para><para>Iraq's refusal to allow UNSCOM immediate and unrestricted access constitutes a most serious challenge, indeed a complete and direct challenge, to the authority of the United Nations. It was a clear breach of the terms and conditions of the 1991 cease-fireâterms which had been explicitly accepted by Iraq. Faced with such a breach, the United States and the United Kingdom were clearly entitled to look back to the underlying resolutionâthat is, resolution 678, which authorised the use of all necessary means to liberate Kuwait and `to restore international peace and security in the area'. Resolution 678 is still in force.</para><para>The threat of military action was justified, given Iraq's undeniable record as a rogue state. Saddam Hussein has never hesitated to use military force to pursue his objectives. He has twice gone to war in pursuit of his ambitions of regional dominanceâfirst against Iran and then against Kuwait. In the history of the United Nations only one member state has ever attempted to completely overpower and 
 annex another memberâand that country is Saddam Hussein's Iraq. His is a regime with an extraordinary record of aggression, of treachery, of duplicity and of gross abuse of human rights. It is a regime which routinely resorts to appalling violence to achieve its ends and at the end of the day appears to respect only the threat of military force.</para><para>The threat of military action was further justified by the continuing threats to the security of the Middle East, indeed to world security, by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Others have spoken of that today, but no-one must underestimate it. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the international community owes a great deal of debt to UNSCOM and both its first executive chairman and, more latterly, our own Richard Butler, who has served with great determination. Indeed, I say in respect of Ambassador Butler, it is a continuation of his record as a representative of the highest integrity, skill and professionalism.</para><para>As matters stand, Iraq's refusal to allow UNSCOM unrestricted access has left many serious concerns unresolved. I do not think there can be any doubt that, given the chance, Iraq would resume production and stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons. No-one should forget that Iraq is unique in recent history in its repeated use of chemical weapons against Iran, against the Kurdish people in northern Iraq and against resistance forces in southern Iraq. Saddam Hussein would not hesitate to do so again if he thought it would advance his interests.</para><para>So where are we today? I join with other speakers in expressing our highest praise of and gratitude to Kofi Annan for his efforts in securing Iraq's agreement to allow UNSCOM and the IAEA the immediate unconditional and unrestricted access that is required by those Security Council resolutions. His standing has undoubtedly and I think quite properly been enhanced by the outcome of his mission to Baghdad and his splendid advocacy. Having said that, I do not think anyone can pretend that this agreement would have been secured in the absence of a real threat of 
 military actionâa fact that has been publicly acknowledged by the Secretary-General himself.</para><para>The question now facing the world is whether Saddam Hussein can be trusted to implement the agreements reached with the United Nations. In all this, I think British Prime Minister Tony Blair got it right when he said:</para><para>While the agreement signed in Baghdad is welcome, it is not in itself enough. A piece of paper signed by the Iraqi regime plainly cannot be enough. The Saddam Hussein we face today is the same Saddam Hussein we faced yesterday. The only thing that has changed is that he has changed his mind in the face of effective diplomacy and firm willingness to use force.</para><para>Clearly there can be no slackening in our determination to ensure that Iraq complies with all of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Full and immediate implementation of the Baghdad agreements is what will count, and no-one can rule out the possibility that the threat of military action may still be required to ensure that Iraq fulfils its obligations and undertakings.</para><para>I would like to conclude my remarks today by drawing attention to the final paragraph of the motion before the House. This paragraph was added at Labor's suggestion. It states:</para><para>That this House:</para><para>(5)	 looks forward to the satisfactory completion of the work of UNSCOM . . . as a major contribution to world security and as an important step towards achieving a Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction, as recognised in Resolution 687.</para><para>Iraq is undeniably a special case. It is a rogue state which has amassed this dreadful arsenal and it is engaged in aggression. It has repeatedly used these weapons of mass destruction and it has flagrantly denied the United Nations. That said, we must also recognise that Iraq is not the only state in the Middle East to be the subject of international concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Many people have made references to Israel's nuclear capabilities and one cannot ignore the reported ambitions of other states, including Iran and Syria, to acquire weapons of mass destruction. The elimination of Iraq's terror arsenal is clearly only one part 
 of what is required to guarantee long-term peace and security in the Middle East.</para><para>Some critics have suggested that Saddam Hussein is the winner in the latest crisis. I do not believe this is so. But, given the trend in Arab public opinion and the widespread perception of double standards on the part of the United States and its allies, it is incumbent on all members of the international community, including Australia, to do everything we can to encourage a resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and to resolve each of the other outstanding Middle East issuesâissues including the withdrawal of all foreign military forces and foreign-sponsored militias from Lebanon.</para><para>A Middle East policy perceived, whether rightly or wrongly, as solely focusing on Iraq and failing to adopt an even-handed approach to each of the issues of peace and security in the region will ultimately fail to secure the necessary international and regional support. I put it to the House that it would be a pyrrhic victory indeed if we successfully contained Saddam Hussein but neglected the wider issues of peace, security and justice throughout the Middle East.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>33</page.no><name role="metadata">McLachlan, Ian, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McLACHLAN</name><name.id>HT4</name.id><electorate>Barker</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn putting together the coalition in 1991, President Bush, I am told, in the broad put a simple message, five binding points, to those leaders that he approached. The prevention of incursions into Saudi Arabia was the first point. The second was to remove Iraq from Kuwait. The third was to render the Iraqi military machine ineffective. The fourth was to capture or otherwise bring before the international justice machine Saddam Hussein, and the fifth was to go home. I think, as has been outlined in this House by a number of people and put by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), the unfinished business probably still surrounds two of those five points.</para></talk.start><para>The decision the government took to deploy military forces to the Gulf is in keeping with the record of Australia's constructive involvement in issues important to global security. Our involvement shows that our security interests go well beyond the physical protection of our territory. Global issues, too, can 
 have significant security implications for us. So our priority in this current crisis is to ensure that Iraq complies with the relevant Security Council resolutions. We have actively and consistently, for as many years as I can remember, supported the UN efforts to stop the proliferation of weapons and people who behave like Saddam Hussein. It is directly, therefore, in this nation's interest to make sure that the world community works to stop such proliferation.</para><para>In an act which nearly can be described as fratricide, the killing of one's own brothers and sisters, Saddam Hussein used weapons of mass destruction against his own people in gassing in 1988 the Kurds in the north of his country. It is reasonable to believeâin fact, one can only concludeâthat he would use these weapons again. So, if the world community failed in its resolve to stop this country from rebuilding its capacity to make these weapons of mass destruction, it would be derelict in its duty indeed.</para><para>I have no doubt that the agreement reached between Secretary Annan and Saddam Hussein would not have been made without the pressure brought to bear by the gathering of the coalition military forces. It is a clear example of where diplomacy needed the backing of military power to have real effect. Australia's role in the building of this military response was both measured and timely. We are encouraged by the agreement. But, just as the negotiation of that agreement needed the support of the international coalition of military forces, so does the testing of that agreement require those forces to stay in place. We cannot judge the success of this agreement until it has been tested by UNSCOM demanding and receiving unconditional and unrestricted access to potential weapons of mass destruction sites. That means that we must keep Australian forces in the Gulf theatre working with the international coalition to ensure Iraqi compliance. I do not think anyone should assume that if this fails we can put together a coalition again some time in the future.</para><para>I want to say just a few words about the defence organisation's role in the last few weeks both in helping to shape the govern 
 ment's response and in being a key part of that response. Apart from our Gulf commitment, we have been involved in the last few months in floods and bushfires, in supporting drought relief operations in Papua New Guinea and truce monitoring in Bougainville, and in sovereignty and fishing protection issues in the sub-Antarctic.</para><para>In many respects the Australian defence organisation is at its best when it is asked to do things at short notice. I would like to say in this House that the ADF deserves praise for the speed with which it has presented the military options to government and for the even greater speed with which the military deployment was mounted. Defence and government worked hard to put together a package of forces which would be militarily relevant, highly relevant to possible operations and relevant to Australia's place in the worldânot too grand, but not a token offer.</para><para>I reject the view that some have put that the involvement of the SAS, the air force and other elements was simply some form of gesture. I notice that there is some misinformation about the fact that the Chief of the Defence Force said that the operation was a token gesture. He did not say it and he does not believe it. There was some selective juggling, even mischievous juggling, of a TV report which put those words in his mouth. What he did do was to make the point that this decision, like the one taken in 1991, was not a token gesture. There is no doubt that these people will serve with distinction and to the very best of their abilities.</para><para>On this occasion and the last the government held the view that our national interest and our commitment to global stability mean that we cannot walk away from the prospect of conflict. It is not an easy decision but the decision was made both times.</para><para>This matter is not simply a matter of a new set of arrangements which arise out of the Secretary-General's deal with Iraq. That set of arrangements gives Saddam Hussein a little more time to comply, but absolutely and unequivocally requires the carriage and implementation of the previous resolutions 678, and 687 in particular. Iraq must accept an all encompassing UNSCOM inspection 
 regime and their total compliance must be absolute. Let us all hope that that compliance is forthcoming.</para><para>Finally, we have sent to the Gulf a fine combination of defence men and women whose quality and level of training will stand them and Australia in good stead. Therefore, the Australian government, and I glean this House, will give them the level of support to which that body of elite young Australians are entitled.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>34</page.no><name role="metadata">Bevis, Arch, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEVIS</name><name.id>ET4</name.id><electorate>Brisbane</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI join with previous speakers in this debate in supporting the motion before the House. The events in Iraq over the last couple of months are the latest in a round of what has been a long series of difficulties since the 1991 war that removed Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. It should be recalled that the commitments that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime entered into at that time, which were to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction from their arsenal and to enable UNSCOM to verify that and where necessary to undertake the elimination of those weapons, have been honoured in the breach on many occasions since that time. The regime in Iraq has done everything it can since that time to avoid the commitments it gave in settlement of that dispute. Saddam Hussein has systematically frustrated the work of UNSCOM. He has lied about his weapons of mass destruction and he has played a game of cat and mouse with the rest of the world.</para></talk.start><para>Not all of the incidents that have occurred since 1991 are widely known nor have they been reported in the popular media but they are significant and should be noted in the parliament. For example, Baghdad has revised its nuclear declaration that it is obliged to provide to the International Atomic Energy Agency on no fewer than four occasions. Each time a new return is submitted it is following exposure of errors and omissions and wrongful statements in the previous one. Iraq has formally submitted some six different biological warfare declarations, the most recent of which was in September of last year, and all of those six have been rejected by UNSCOM as inaccurate. Indeed, the UNSCOM chairperson, Richard Butler, has 
 said of the latest return that `it failed to give a remotely credible account of Iraq's biological weapons program'. We have here a systematic effort on the part of Saddam Hussein and his regime to hide serious weapons of mass destruction to ensure that he maintains the capability of renewing those weapons and maintaining some of them in stock. That has been a systematic activity undertaken since 1991 by that regime in spite of the undertakings given to the United Nations.</para><para>In fact, for much of the time since 1991, the Iraqi regime, in defiance of its undertakings to the United Nations, has denied that some of those weapons of mass destruction remain, claiming that they had been used in the seven year war with Iran or against the Kurds or independently destroyed under Saddam Hussein's own authority. It was only in 1995 with the defection of his son-in-law Hussein Kamel that Iraq admitted that it had stocks of some of these weapons. His son-in-law was well placed to know because he had been Minister for Defence at different times. He had also been the Director of the Ministry of Industry and Minerals and of the Organisation of Military Industrialisation. In short, his son-in-law was in charge of military industrialisation in Iraq and was responsible for ensuring the production of these very weapons, their storage and their hiding from inspectors. It was only in August 1995 with his defection that the Iraqi regime decided to own up to its possession of some of these weapons.</para><para>It is worth recording the extent of the arsenal which Saddam Hussein and his regime have amassed. These are the figures that the regime admits it has produced. We are talking about large amounts of very dangerous materials. The regime admits to 100 to 150 metric tonnes of G-agents, which I am advised is the sarin gas that the public would be aware of from the Tokyo experience. There are 500 to 600 metric tonnes of mustard gas and four metric tonnes of VX. UNSCOM have been able to identify the importation and manufacture of precursors to the manufacture of VX which would account for 200 metric tonnes. Saddam Hussein acknowledges having 
 four metric tonnes of it, none of which, by the way, he said he had until his son-in-law defected in August 1995.</para><para>The regime acknowledges 8,500 litres of anthrax; UNSCOM's estimate is that the actual figure for anthrax biological capability is three to four times the declared amount. There are 19,400 litres of botulinum toxin; UNSCOM's estimates of the actual amount produced by the Saddam Hussein regime is double that. It is also worth recording that he maintains a series of delivery systems for those weapons, many of which have not been accounted for by UNSCOM.</para><para>Faced with that, the UNSCOM inspectors have tried valiantly over the course of the last seven years to visit the suspected sites and to ensure the elimination of these very dangerous chemical and biological weapons. Saddam Hussein has sought to declare a number of those sites as sensitive; and these are not just the palaces that we read about: on occasions they have included Republican Guard barracks and even a road which he declared as sensitive to prevent UNSCOM inspectors from travelling along it.</para><para>If you read the reports of UNSCOM investigations, you find that when they go into these buildings, having been delayed for hours and in some cases for days, they walk into premises that have been totally cleaned out, with the obvious marks of furniture left on the floor, whether it is the carpet, the lino or the tilesâthe furniture clearly having been removed only hours or days prior to that and in the period, of course, following the delay that has been imposed upon the inspectors.</para><para>We enter this post-Cold War period after the fall of the Berlin Wall, having come through a period of about 40 years in which the world was living in fear of a mutually assured destruction regime that was based upon nuclear weapons. As we go into the 21st century, after that mutually assured destruction approach to global security, we confront what is in many respects a far more dangerous threat. The threat in the 21st century to countries around the world is from chemical and biological weapons. They are weapons of mass destruction: the extent of the harm which they can produce is on a scale with 
 nuclear weapons. They are, however, much easier to produce, they are far easier to conceal and they are far more difficult to detect under regimes of international agreements.</para><para>Mention has been made of the need to improve the verification processes under the international conventions in relation to chemical and biological weapons. That is clearly something the world needs to turn its attention to. These are not things that are easy or even possible to detect by remote purposes; it requires physical presence in the locations to identify the existence of some of these biological and chemical weapons. The simple fact of the matter is that with Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime we know that there are very substantial quantities of these weapons in stock. We know that he has a history of using them, not once but many times over the course of a decade through the eighties and into the early ninetiesâusing them in the war with Iran and using them in his own campaign against minority groups in his own country.</para><para>Before my time runs out I also want to make some comments in support of the other comments that have been made in respect of the Australian forces who are currently on deployment in the Middle East. As the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) has said, we have in the defence forces a very fine body of men and women whose dedication to the cause of Australia and their willingness to accept personal inconvenience and, in these situations, place their lives in circumstances of danger have again provided the government with an option in diplomacy and in military activity which has been needed.</para><para>The members of the Special Air Services Regiment are, without doubt, amongst the finest people wearing a military uniform anywhere in the world. I was in the United States when these events unfolded, and it is the case that their reputation is well known throughout the United States in military and other circles. I wish them all what I hope is a peaceful journey and a speedy and safe return to Australia. I join with other members in trusting that Kofi Annan's very good diplomacy, supported by the threat of military 
 action, will see a peaceful outcome to what has been a very difficult seven years of enforcement of the UN decisions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>36</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to offer my support for this motion but with some grave concerns that are represented in a large body of the Australian public about our commitment to this particular force.

But I just ask, as many Australians do and as some speakers have alluded to today, in this case, unlike that in 1991 when I personally strongly supported the actions taken, where there is no invasion involved and no United Nations mandate for such action, where there is no cross-religious coalition of forces aligned against Saddam, whether this exerciseâshould it have gone on without Kofi Annan's interventionâwould have risked a huge potential to ignite forces of destruction right across the Middle East.</para><para>We know the weapons of mass destruction are a very real threat and we know that Saddam Hussein has in his arsenal weapons that he has already used against the Kurds, but what I askâas do many Australians and people around the worldâis what are we doing about Israel's 300 nuclear weapons and Syria's suspected chemical arsenal? Iran, too, is believed to have such weapons. Pakistan has the bomb. As for Libya, who knows? How about the United Nations resolution on Israel's occupation of Arab lands?</para><para>Double standards abound in international affairs and, while not for a moment do any of us condone Iraq's attempt to annexe Kuwait, where does Australia stand in terms of Indonesia's annexation of East Timor? Is oil the common factor in this? Where did Iraq obtain many of its weapons? I would like to read briefly into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> part of an article by Robert Fisk in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 21 February:</para><para>. . . 1980, when Saddam invaded Iranâan offensive infinitely more devastating and savage than his 
 later invasion of Kuwait, for which the West went to war a decade later.</para><para>I recall that first ghastly Gulf War all too well because I spent month after month visiting the battlefields: I hid in waterlogged ditches with Iraqi troops along the Shatt al-Arab river . . . </para><para>I flew in an Iranian helicopter gunship over Saddam's slaughtered legions outside Ahwaz, the stench of their decomposition so powerful we reeled with nausea in our tiny helicopter as it hurtled over the mass graves.</para><para>And over those awful months, I and my colleagues slowly learned who had armed Saddam. In a field north of the Iraqi city of Basra, I discovered rows of American crop-spraying helicopters. Only the spray was poison and the crops were to be Iranians. I found British radios and Bailey bridges in the hands of Saddam's army. In the middle of the Persian Gulf, I saw the Iraqis attack an Iranian-registered oil tanker with a new Mirage fighter-bomber lent by France.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>But my grimmest memory is of a long and terrible train, 20 carriages long, that rumbled slowly out from the Ahwaz battlefront with a cargo of dying Iranians soldiers and Revolutionary Guards. It was a hospital train, and in compartment after compartment satâand layâthese young men, all coughing their lungs up into bandages and gauze and dirty handkerchiefs, all victims of Saddam Hussein's mustard gas.

The US has unseated regimes in the past; surely it could isolate and eliminate Saddam without a blitzkrieg against suspected agents that could be made and stored in a suburban garage or a hospital or a preschool by this man.</para><para>We should be encouraging a democratic government in exile for Iraq. We should be using the US's vast resources to destabilise Saddam and his fanatical son and his hangers-on. We should, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said, mount a consistent across-the-board approach to all violators, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) alluded to that as well. These are the tactics we should encourage. Let us pray that Kofi Annan's miracle of diplomacy does prevail and that the US can swallow some pride and back the Security Council's endorsement of the agreement. The alternative could well be a Middle East war, given the Israeli PM's predilections, and we in our small way would be partly responsible for that outcome if we jumped to America's bidding alone. Saddam is a butcher, but surely the US can eliminate his regime without eliminating another million innocent Iraqis.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>37</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hindmarsh Island Case</title><page.no>37</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>37</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Gareth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GARETH EVANS</name><name.id>VD4</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to the Attorney-General.

I am delighted to be able to say to the House that the introduction of the new competitor on the Australian waterfront as we started 1998âthe operation by those associated with the NFF; the new business known as P&amp;C Stevedoringâhas got off to a very good start. I am delighted to be able to say to P&amp;C Stevedoring that those on this side of the House support their initiatives to start up a new business. We say that, as far as the rorts and rip-offs on the waterfront are concerned, enough is enough. It is time we had some real competition so that Australia can benefit in our export businesses, as can all of those businesses that rely on an efficient waterfront. The waterfront is the gateway to the economy. We must have an efficient gateway. We must have a system on the waterfront which gives our exporters and others the opportunity to compete in world markets.</para></talk.start><para>When I say that they have made a good start, what have they done? They have set up a management structure, have secured the site to set up a viable operation and have the equipment necessary to conduct their business. The opposition leader referred to the question of the leaseâhe is a bit behind the times because that matter was settled a week or so ago. They have trainees on site and, despite the intimidation of some initial trainers, they now have trainers looking to the accreditation of 30 or 40 trainees.</para><para>Why it is important is that Australia's crane rates and productivity levels are woeful. The reliability on the Australian waterfront is a national disgrace. It was the international 
 shippers who last year voted Australia as the least reliable port to send a ship to. Also, if we had better workplace relations on the Australian waterfront, we would also have a safer environment for the shippers themselves. That is a worthy objective in itself.</para><para>All this has happened for a number of reasonsâprincipally because the government has made significant reforms to the Workplace Relations Act, to the industrial relations system in Australia, to allow anybody to set up a new business if they so desire. As we look at this new business, we see the various facets of our new legislation operating. You would not have been able to set up this business but for the fact that you can enter into an Australian workplace agreement and have a much more flexible and efficient set of operations. We made AWAs available.</para><para>In the early days of this dispute, we saw the MUA taking industrial action. They were told to go back to work by the commission under section 127, which is a new power we gave to the commission that requires people to meet their obligations. Of course, there are the Cheryl clausesâthe Trade Practices Act reforms which place a ban on secondary boycotts and primary boycotts and which are the reason that today Australia is not in a state of national economic paralysis.</para><para>Imagine if Labor got in in the future, or go back a few years when they were in and we had such a development: the whole place would be brought to a standstill. The reality is that those are very effective sanctions. Labor's policy, if they were ever to be re-elected, would be to take the MUA off the leash, to take the Trade Practices Act prohibitions out of that particular law and to gut them and make them ineffective.</para><para>There has been very widespread community support for what the farmers are undertakingânot just within the farming community, where the polls show over 90 per cent support amongst the farming community, but in the community at large. A <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> survey reported on 4 February that 60 per cent of all Australians support the establishment of a non-union alternative on the waterfront, and it showed also that 41 per cent of Labor voters support this move. There 
 will be lots of opportunities to talk about the golden silence from the other side. I see that the shadow minister is about to jump, so I will move onto that presentation of mine as the opportunity is provided.</para><para>I say in conclusion that this is one of the things that has to be done in Australia. We must have a more efficient waterfront. The new act, the new legislative prescriptions and the support that this government will give people prepared to set up a new business and to be competitive are the critical elements that will make this a successful venture. On behalf of all members on this side of the House, I say to those who have started a new business and who are working on it: good on you and we support you.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Companies: Protection of Employees' Legal Entitlements</title><page.no>46</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>46</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to the Prime Minister.

There is no doubt that the Natural Heritage Trust constitutes perhaps the most far-reaching response ever put together in this country and maybe even globally to the twin problems of land degradation and water degradation. If there is one thing the ALP hates more than good policy, it is good policy that becomes popular policy because it works. They cannot stand it. It is even worse if it happens to apply to those people who live between Katoomba and Kalgoorlie because they are not interested in them.</para></talk.start><para>Let us get to a few facts on this. The first I would like to cover is that the funding has been directed mainly to community groups undertaking on-ground works. Secondly, the 
 NHT is designed to address the causes of environmental decline, not the symptoms. Thirdly, it is a rigorous community based assessment processâdemonstrably soâwhere regional and state assessment processes prioritise applications.</para><para>The next point that needs to be understood by those opposite, because no-one on this side has any trouble understanding it, is that the land, water and vegetation challenges facing Australia are overwhelmingly in regional and rural areas. I will give a few statistics. A total of 95 per cent of the funds from the 1997-98 funding round were committed to 99 per cent of Australia's land service. In fact, the ALP only holds 1.17 per cent of the land mass of Australia. The way they are going, they will be lucky to maintain even that. Given their position on this and given their position on tax reform, when everyone in the bush wants tax reform, and given their position on Wik, I cannot see them increasing the percentage of the land mass they hold in this country. You may as well get used to it.</para><para>There are other factors. The documentation on the trust has always clearly indicated that the bulk of funds would be spent in the areas of greatest need, such as the $163 million committed to the Murray Darling Basin. How much of the Murray Darling Basin in area does the ALP hold? Two per cent. In the case of Western Australia, funds were directed overwhelmingly to the salinity action plant. Anybody who comes from Western Australia would know that that is the issue that needs to be confronted over there. It happens to be focused mainly in Western Australia's wheat belt, where the ALP has no representation at all.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">HOWARD</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>âThey used to; they threw him out.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name></talker><para>âThat is right. It is worth noting too that funds expendedâstop and think about this for a momentâin important areas such as landcare, bushcare, world heritage, Cape York and rivercare in the end have almost no hope of falling in ALP electorates because there are so few of them. That does not really matter anyway because the money is spent where it needs to be spent and that does not necessarily mean that that is 
 where the benefits will accrue. This is a very important point.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition's flippancy with regard to this highlights the fact that their interests are political, not environmental. For instance, to get cleaner water in Adelaide requires extensive work to be done in the Murray Darling catchment in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. You do not spend the money in urban seats in Adelaide to get the benefits for the residents of Adelaide with regard to cleaner, more secure water supplies; you spend it in the Murray Darling Basin. Who are the beneficiaries? As much the people of urban Adelaide as anyone else.</para><para>There are a couple of other important facts that I want to get on the record. On checking the figures, it has been revealed that 90 per cent of all recommendations of the state assessment panels were from projects in coalition electorates. Let me spell that out for a moment. In the case of New South Wales, of the applications that they put forward for expenditureâand that is not a coalition government, in case you have missed itâ89 per cent of their recommendations were for expenditure in coalition seats.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">HOWARD</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name></talker><para>âThis is Bob Carr?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name></talker><para>âYes, that is by Bob Carr's government. Why? Because that is where the money should have been spent; that is where it should have been allocated. If you are concerned about environmental outcomes and not political outcomes, like the member for Denison, that is where you will spend the dollars.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I better cut it short. I would like to keep going. The fact is that there is a great deal of public support for the NHT; that is why they do not like it. Whether it is the conservation councils from each state and territory that have recently written to us, whether it is the massive increase in the number of people in the landcare movementâup 25 per cent in the last 12 monthsâthe fact is that the trust is widely supported because it is the largest and most exciting and accountable environmental program in Australia's history.</para><para>The fact is that we managed to fund this very important program in a responsible way,

All of these Job Network members will be competing with each other to provide unemployed people with the best possible chance to get a real job.</para><para>How this contrasts with the complete lack of regard for unemployed people from the Labor Party. The member for Batman has conducted a disgraceful disinformation campaign right throughout the launch of this. He was warning for weeks beforehand that a duopoly of Employment National and Drake International was coming, and now we have 306 providers. Some duopoly! I think it is back to numeracy training for the member for Batman.</para><para>But I think one of the most disgraceful things that the member for Batman has said was in a press release he issued when the Job Network was announced. He said that people will seek to get onto welfare even if they have to cheat to get there. That is a disgraceful statement about unemployed people in this 
 country. That shows what a low opinion the Labor Party has of unemployed peopleâthat they will cheat in order to gain the benefits provided by the Job Network. You should resign for that. You have criticised the unemployed before. In this House you are just the voice for the unions. You do not care for unemployed people.</para><para>You should take a leaf out of the book of your former colleague Graham Richardson, who, on 2GB last week said in relation to the Job Network, `I think we should all give it a chance.' Even your mate Richo sees the advantage of the Job Network.

He said, `Don't be provocative.'</para></talk.start></continue><para>It would not be hard to make some significant improvements to productivity on the Australian waterfront. Members will, I hope, appreciate that in the last few weeks on a daily basis we have sent out a bulletin. In that bulletin on the right hand column, if you have missed it, I refer you to the heading which says, `Rort of the day'. This dispute could go on for six months and we would have a fresh one on a daily basis. But, in terms of fixing up the productivity on the Australian waterfront, you do not need a grand plan. What you need is a commitment for people just to do a decent day's work.</para><para>Let me give you this example. At the start of this dispute at Webb dock the wharfies were worried about their public reputation. They decided that there were four containers that should be moved. They had kiwi fruit in them. They said to Patricks, `Don't worry; we'll remove those to get them out of the way of the dispute.' So they organised the removal of the four containers. How many people would it take the wharfies to move four containers? You would need one bloke to drive the forklift. I would have to say that in most businesses that would be plenty. But, of course, if you have one bloke driving a forklift, you have to have a foreman. There are four containers, so you need three advanced mathematicians who are all members 
 of the MUA to count them. They needed five people to move four containers.</para><para>One of the classic stories of this dispute goes back to December. Overmanning is a constant problem. One of the classic stories of this dispute is the meeting between Chris Corrigan, who runs Patricks, and John Coombs before Christmas. Basically Chris Corrigan said to John Coombs and the MUA, `Quite frankly, John, we've spent a year trying to get an agreement out of you. That was 1996. In 1997 we spent a year trying to get you to do the very things that you had agreed to do. We find running this business basically impossible because we don't run it; you, the MUA, run it.' So he said to John Coombs, `I've got a solution for this. I will sell you the business for $1.' As he made that offer, Mr Corrigan passed over the dollar to John Coombsâ`Here's the dollar you need to buy it.' Why wouldn't John Coombs accept that offer? Because he knows himself that even he could not run that business with the MUA to give it the productivity and the efficiency that we need.</para><para>Mr Speaker, take this example. This is an example straight off the wage records of one of the major stevedores. This relates to a crane driver in the port of Melbourne. These are actual records. The crane driver is paid for an average 50.3 hours a week; that is his average working week. He spends 14 hours on relief time and other duties; 10Â½ hours holiday and sick leave; 8.5 hours on idle time or training; and 3.2 hours on meal breaks. This leaves only 14.1 hours, or 28 per cent of the paid hours, doing what he or she is supposed to be doingâdriving the crane. They get paid $90,000 a year for 14 hours a week on a crane. And John Coombs is going to reveal his plan to improve productivity!</para><para>My plan to improve productivity, just as a starter, is to deal with the rorts and the rip-offs on the Australian waterfront which are being protected by none other than the Labor Party. Why haven't we had a question from the Labor Party on the waterfront? They have been making the allegations about this particular dispute. Where are your questions? I will tell you why we have not heard much from themânot according to my point of 
 view, but according to the point of view of none other than he who knows them very well: Graham Richardson, Richo. This is what Richo said:</para><para>The unions still own a majority of the stock in the ALP and the federal parliamentary Labor Party will be expected to stick with them. There are senior people in the party who know how risky this would be. They can see no way out of defending the wharfies to the bitter end. Perhaps this explains Kim Beazley's silence over the past week. This is the beginning of a major war on the waterfront, a war that could lead to a general strike, and we still don't know what the leader of the opposition thinks about it. This is one silence that isn't golden.</para><para>The Richardson quote sums it up nicely. The fact of the matter is that we need significant reform on the waterfront.

But, as with previous deployments, the Defence Force Support Unit will also provide services for the non-SASR personnel who are on deployment. All of those organisations will work jointly so that information is provided to families as they require it and support is given if there is need because their serving personnel family member is away. If there is ever the need for someone to be brought back for compassionate reasons those organisations will look at those concerns and deal with them as necessary.</para><para>I stress that this government has a great commitment to the families of serving personnel.

As members will be aware, the convention was held to consider three questions: whether or not Australia should become a republic; which republic model should be put to the voters to consider against the current system of government; and in what time frame and under what circumstances any change might be considered.</para></talk.start><para>The Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair MP and the Hon. Barry Jones AO, MP presided as Chairman 
 and Deputy Chairman respectively. They performed these roles with flair, distinction, good humour and great style, and I congratulate both of them. I thank them on behalf of all the people who took part in the convention and on behalf of the many hundreds of thousandsâindeed, millionsâof Australians who observed the proceedings.</para><para>The holding of the convention fulfilled an election commitment that I gave to the Australian people prior to the last election.	 Before that election it was clear that, just as many in the community felt that our present system works well, there was widespread support for the idea of Australia becoming a republic. That is why I made the promise that I did to the Australian voters that a convention would be held in our first term of government. I am proud to say that the convention was conducted in a very constructive fashion, and I feel privileged to have been the Prime Minister responsible for the establishment of the convention.</para><para>May I take this opportunity of recording my appreciation to my predecessor as leader of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, for his initial proposal that, if the coalition were elected to government, a constitutional convention should be held. I think it ought to be a matter of record in this speech that I make to this parliament on the Constitutional Convention that the original impetus for the holding of the Convention was the proposal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was the Leader of the Opposition. I congratulate him for the germ of an extremely good idea which has come to very constructive fruition.</para><para>My government has enormous confidence in the capacity of Australians to debate this issue with vigour and civility. The convention comprised of a diverse group of Australians. Half of the Convention's 152 delegates were appointed by the government. The appointments represented a broad cross-section of Australian society and a wide diversity of skills and experience. They also reflected the government's commitment to ensure that women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
 people, young Australians and local government were represented. </para><para>It has been said before, but it bears repetition, that one of the outstanding characteristics of the convention was the eloquent, compelling and, on occasions, quite uplifting contributions of the young Australian delegates who took part in the convention. The other 76 delegates were elected by the Australian people. These delegates were chosen from the 609 candidates who stood for election last year. I am sure members will agree that the elected delegates also carried themselves in a manner that did the Australian public which elected them extremely proud. That such a diverse group of people could work together constructively to bring us to a useful outcome speaks volumes for the strength of Australia's democracy.</para><para>The convention engaged the public as well as the delegates. Some 6.75 million copies of the public information materials prepared by the government to increase the community's understanding of the issues were published in 68 metropolitan and regional newspapers. Over 1,000 submissions from members of the public to delegates have been received, and there were around 125,000 hits recorded on the Internet home page. During the convention, something like 17,500 visitors moved through the public galleries to see this historic event. I know that much of the rest of the Australian public, as well as many interested overseas observers, were watching and listening to the extensive television and radio coverage of the convention proceedings.	In my opening address to the convention I said:</para><para>Whatever may be our views on the threshold issue of whether or not Australia should become a republic and whatever form we might believe any such republic should take, we owe it to ourselves and to the rest of the Australian people to conduct this Convention in an open, positive and constructive fashion.</para><para>I am very pleased to report that the convention achieved that objective.</para><para>The majority of the convention supported in principle Australia becoming a republic. Of the republican models, the `bipartisan appointment of the president' model, as it became known, clearly had the greatest support. The convention voted overwhelmingly in favour 
 of a resolution that a referendum be held to test that model against the existing system. The convention also recommended that, if the referendum to be held in 1999 results in support for a republic, the new republic should come into effect by 1 January 2001. As I indicated in my opening address to the convention, that is very much the government's viewâthat if we are to become a republic then the relevant commencement date should be 1 January 2001 and, equally, if we are not, then that particular event will be celebrated without the debate raging at that particular time.</para><para>I believe that the convention has spoken very clearly. It is the intention of my government if it is returned at the next election to hold the referendum before the end of 1999. I have asked the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to bring forward a proposal for consideration by the government on the necessary processes leading to the referendum. The final decision about whether Australia becomes a republic will be put firmly in the hands of the Australian people, as it should be, and in the hands of no-one else.</para><para>I table the communique of the Constitutional Convention and inform members that a full report on the proceedings of the convention will be published very soon.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reith</inline>) proposed:</para><para>That the House take note of the papers.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reith</inline>)âby leaveâagreed to:</para><para>That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding seven minutes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>58</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI hope this means that we will not be coming back for debate on a subsequent occasion, because it is pretty darned unfairâeveryone else gets 15 minutes and the Leader of the Opposition gets seven. I know the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) just got seven, but every other person in this place would get 15. I will leave that to one side.</para></talk.start><para>I also join the Prime Minister in the thanks that he gave to the presiding officers of the Constitutional Convention. Before the history 
 of this recedes into the deep, dark mists of time, let me also place on record that the overjoyed response that the Prime Minister had to the convention and to the processes that established the convention were not there in his heart for the bulk of the last 12 to 18 months. We are as thoroughly aware as heâbecause sometimes from time to time we were involved in conversations on the matter with his staff and with the relevant ministersâthat this was not an agenda that the Prime Minister wanted to see advanced; nor was it a convention that he wished to see take place, at least not with elected members. Nevertheless, we arrived at the conclusion and the convention was held.</para><para>I must say I think the convention did those who participated in it proud in the way in which they conducted the deliberations for the people who were represented there. It is without question the best representation of indigenous Australians that we have seen and without question the best representation of young people, many of whom got themselves there by that elective process and made a really major contribution to the deliberations. They exhibited a level of sophisticated thinking and patriotismâsophisticated thinking about the politics of this nation and patriotism which gave you a sense that the country will be in good hands, indeed maybe even better hands, when we move on from this place.</para><para>The convention, however, is simply a process to an end. The end is the completion of bringing home the Australian constitution. I do not think it is sufficient for the government simply to have a view that they will find themselves in a situation of being some sort of midwife for the proposal, that they will assist at the birthâor not, as the case may beâand essentially be a neutral party to the process by which the constitution is changed. That is not good enough for anyone who knows anything about Australian politics. Anyone who knows anything about Australian politics knows that neutrality on the part of government in constitutional change is negativity. There is no evading that. Neutrality is negativity. There is absolutely no evading that point. </para><para>If this proposition is to have any sort of chance at allâat least on one time of asking, and particularly given that what is emerging is a non-elected presidencyâthen it will require the active support of the political leadership of the nation. If the Prime Minister wants to get credit for this exercise, then the Prime Minister must join us on the hustingsâwe hope, of course, as Leader of the Oppositionâwhen this matter is finally placed before the Australian people.	We on this side of the House are very well aware that we have to take a risk with the processes we have put forward which we think are essentialâand I believe the Liberal Party agreesâfor the good governance of the nation. We have to, in a sense, swim against the tideâthe tide which is overwhelmingly in favour of an elected president.</para><para>It is the misfortune of those who advocate change in the Australian constitution in favour of the majority position established at the Constitutional Convention that we look a bit out of sorts with the elective character of the Australian nation. If we had been deciding at the time that these matters were first considered by the Australian people back in the 1890s as to what sort of process should see the appointment of a head of state, then those who advocated a parliamentary Westminster system versus an American or even Irish or French constitutional model in terms of a directly elected president would not have had the disadvantage of appearing to be arguing some form of elitist proposal. Both would have been seen as equally viable within the context of an Australian democratic process then being put in place.</para><para>So we take a risk, and the risk we take is because we think this is the best mechanism for avoiding a change to a Westminster system that we love. But, if we are not joined in the trenches by the leadership of the Liberal Party, and probably also by the leadership of the National Party, that will not be the form that the Australian constitutional change takes.</para><para>Let us be clear about this: even if it is lost next time around, it will not leave the Australian agenda. You could not see those young people at that conference and assume that it 
 would leave the Australian agenda merely for the loss the first time around. What a loss the first time around means is that, in all likelihood, the next time of asking would see serious consideration being given to an elected president, which would change fundamentally the nature of the Australian constitution. That would be unavoidable.</para><para>If the Prime Minister of this country is to show leadership on this issue and not just skirt around the edgesâand isolated he was by his supporters, I might say, at that Constitutional Conventionâhe must decide, given that this is now going to the Australian people, that he must enter the lists in favour of the changes that the convention he established recommended. Many of his colleagues will, though many were disappointed that the monarchists did not produce a situation there where they had produced what was the so-called McGarvie model or ultra minimalist model at the timeâand back scenery work was done quite intensively by government members at the time to try to produce that.

But if that is not to be the case, if that referendum is to have any chance of passage at all, the Prime Minister will need a leap of leadership that we have not so far seen from him. But I join him, nevertheless, in congratulating the delegates for a great performance on their part, again congratulating two very good presiding officers for the role that they played and congratulating my deputy on the resolutions committee and those who worked with him, like the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who produced an orderly conference and did very well indeed with it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Somlyay</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>60</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UNKNOWN</name.id><name role="metadata">The Deputy Clerk</name><name role="display">The Deputy Clerk</name></talker><para>âPetitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Royal Australian Navy </title><page.no>60</page.no><no.signed>16</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>EZ5</name.id><name.id> GJ4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Abbott</name><name> Tony</name><name> MP; Smith</name><name> Warwick</name><name> MP</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</para><para>This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas:</para><para>1. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;</para><para>2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal;</para><para>3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.</para><para>Members of the Army and R.A.A.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya.</para><para>In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.</para><para>Your petitioners therefore request that the House acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Mr Abbott</name><name.id>EZ5</name.id></talker><para>Mr Abbott(from seven citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Mr Warwick Smith</name><name.id>GJ4</name.id></talker><para>Mr Warwick Smith(from nine citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Repatriation Benefits</title><page.no>60</page.no><no.signed>10</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>BV5</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Adams</name><name> Dick</name><name> MP</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled</para><para>The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the 
 costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</para><para>There are two forms of benefits for ex-servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex-members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</para><para>It is claimed that:</para><para>(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</para><para>(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</para><para>(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</para><para>(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex-members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex-members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</para><para>(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, 
 introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</para><para>(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</para><para>Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Mr Adams</name><name.id>BV5</name.id></talker><para>Mr Adams(from 10 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Native Title Act</title><page.no>61</page.no><no.signed>72</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>SE4</name.id><name.id> MG4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Bishop</name><name> Bronwyn</name><name> MP; Lee</name><name> Michael</name><name> MP</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives</para><para>This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need to continue to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who wish to claim native title, the right to access legal aid outside of the Representative Bodies established under the Native Title Act.</para><para>To force Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander claimants to seek funding from so-called representative bodies is oppressive and may result in breach of their human rights.</para><para>Your petitioners request the House to refuse to pass the amendment 183(4)(a) which would remove the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander claimants to seek legal aid for their native tidal claims from the Attorney-General's department independently of and without interference from representative bodies.</para><para>And your petitioners, as is duty bound, will ever pray.</para><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Mrs Bishop</name><name.id>SE4</name.id></talker><para>Mrs Bishop(from 48 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter><presenter><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Mr Lee</name><name.id>MG4</name.id></talker><para>Mr Lee(from 24 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code</title><page.no>61</page.no><no.signed>57</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>5A5</name.id><name.id> GT4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Brown</name><name> Bob</name><name> MP; Truss</name><name> Warren</name><name> MP</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the Speakers and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament</para><para>The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House our concerns regarding the issue of the proposed new Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code.</para><para>Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take immediate steps to reject the current form of the legislation which will:</para><para>1.

 man, Constable Forsyth, and serious injury to his colleague Probationary Constable Jason Semples can be directly sheeted home to the street drug tragedy that is enveloping our country. I am sure my parliamentary colleagues would join me in extending our sympathy to Mrs Forsyth and her young family at the tragedy that has befallen them. This tragedy is one of many that occur almost daily in this country because of the scourge of illicit drugs, and as citizens we are well aware of drug related tragedies and their impact on many Australian families.</para><para>In my own electorate in the last few days there have been a number of arrests as a result of inspection of vehicles that were stopped for other offences. I assume these incidents were unrelated, but on every occasion the people arrested were carrying substantial amounts of marijuana and other drugs. One person carried a replica pistol. One person when brought before the courts said that he smoked marijuana to relieve stress. One would wonder what stress other drivers on the road would feel if they knew he was under the influence of a mind bending drug. Needless to say, in most cases the drug couriers get off with what I would call a slap on the wrist.</para><para>The discovery of drugs in the possession of people whose cars are stopped by police for unrelated matters is a common occurrence on the highway linking Adelaide and Sydney, and anecdotal evidence indicates this. This has drastically increased since the use of marijuana has been decriminalised in South Australia. Adelaide has long been regarded as an important source for the supply of marijuana, now in real effect grown legally, which is constantly being carried across to the eastern states to be traded for amphetamines which are readily available in Australia's largest cities. No doubt the amphetamines will return to Adelaide and further west. Drug dealers are regularly running the gauntlet of police on the Sturt and Hume highways, and although the police do a great job of making arrests no doubt a large majority of dealers escape detection and are able to ply their deadly trade.</para><para>The above incidents, certainly one more serious than the others, give some indication of why I join with many people throughout Australia who are saying that enough is enough in relation to the importation, distribution and use of street drugs. We were warned in the past what would happen if the nation were to go soft on drugs, and we have gone soft. Living as I do in Griffith, New South Walesâa name people would knowâI would like to pay a special tribute to the late Don Mackay, who paid the supreme sacrifice to save his community and his nation from this scourge. It is important that this battle be continued.</para><para>Even allowing for that, we have a headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> `Nation of dope smokers: report'. It says:</para><para>The level of cannabis abuse in Australia is among the highest in the world, according to the United Nations' drug agency, the International Narcotics Board.</para><para>The board voiced concerns yesterday about the rapidly rising level of amphetamines abuse by Australia's young people and of the volume of heroin continually pouring into the country.</para><para>Among the most feared of all the amphetamine derivatives was the popular party drug ecstasy.</para><para>"Substantial amounts of ecstasy and other hallucinogens, including LSD, are being smuggled into Australia mainly from countries in Europe," the report said.</para><para>The board said the battle to combat illicit drugs world-wide was being undermined by a culture of "drug-friendliness", in which dangerous illicit drugs were portrayed as acceptable or glamorous.</para><para>One of the problems the community faces is that many people believe drugs like marijuana are not harmful, and I have heard of one mother who does not mind her son smoking marijuana because she thinks it is less harmful than tobacco smoking.</para><para>The question of drug abuse is a broad subject full of complexities, but one thing I am sure of is that the policy of harm minimisation that has been the government's policy until recentlyâwhich begins with the premise that people are going to take drugs anyway so let us teach young Australians how to take drugs safely and hence minimise the harm they may afflictâis ludicrous and obviously has caused great social harm. I 
 therefore welcome the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) late last year that he would introduce a get tough on drugs campaign. I also welcome the Prime Minister's announcement today of an additional vote of $8.9 million for the Australian Federal Police, who are in the front line in our fight against drug importation and distribution. As Professor Lucy Sullivan from the University of New South Wales states:</para><para>Harm minimisation does not mean the minimisation of the harm caused by drugs. It means legislation on the grounds that the harm of drug users going to court is greater than the individual and social harm of unrestricted drug use.</para><para>Most thinking people would know this attitude has got us into the situation we face at the moment, where street drugs, especially marijuana, are readily available and one out of two Australian teenagers have tried it. The truth of the matter, although many will not admit it, is that no street drug is safe.</para><para>While the term `street drug' can cover other substances, such as heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and designer drugs to name a few, all of which can have a deadly effect, the most readily available is marijuana or pot. We are all aware that people who smoke pot or marijuana vigorously defend its use. They point out that it is no worse than smoking cigarettes, and the unfortunate thing is that most of them believe it. I understand that there are presently about 10,000 documented studies on marijuana, most of them with adverse findings. But, unfortunately, many of these studies have been outdated and invalidated because of the more intoxicating mixtures that are cultivated and processed today such as the hybrid called skunk.</para><para>There is no doubt that cigarettes aggravate many existing health problems as well as harming the healthy person. Comparative studies show both types of smoke possess many of the same compounds, the difference being that tobacco contains nicotine while marijuana contains cannabinoids. Benzpyrenes, well known cancer causing agents produced in the burning process, are 70 per cent more abundant in marijuana smoke than in smoke for high tar cigarettes. There is no study that suggests tobacco is responsible for impairment of memory, personality, driving 
 ability and the physiology of reproduction. The same unfortunately cannot be said of marijuana.</para><para>I am one who is extremely concerned that there is a strong connection between the increasing use of street drugs and the ever increasing number of suicides, particularly among the young. The interrelationship between schizophrenic events and the use of marijuana has already been determined. It is my belief that the only way to handle the street drug menace is by getting tough and adopting the Swedish modelâSweden being a country where only one in 20 young people have tried marijuana against one in two in Australia.</para><para>Having watched Australian society over the past 20 years and witnessed the spread of the use of street drugs, I do not like what I see. Governments, in going soft on drugs, have ensured that the use of these drugs has spread, as the ill-informed South Australia and Canberra experiments will prove. I do not know about my parliamentary colleagues, but I do not want my taxi driver, bus driver, doctor, bank adviser and so on to be high on some mind-bending substance when my family and I are dealing with them and depending on them.</para><para>It is indisputable that if you legalise or decriminalise any activity you will encourage its wider use. I dread the thought of living in a nation of drug addicts. That is why the least option we can take is that taken by Sweden, which is that of a drug free society. I refer to a Swedish National Institute of Public Health publication, which under the heading of `A Drug-Free Society' states:</para><para>A drug-free society is a high objective expressing society's attitude to narcotic drugs: we do not accept the integration of narcotic drugs in society, and our aim is a society in which drug abuse remains a socially unaccepted form of behaviour, a society in which drug abuse remains a marginal phenomenon.</para><para>A drug-free society is a vision expressing optimism and a positive view of humanity: the onslaught of drugs can be restrained, and drug abusers can be rehabilitated.</para><para>That recently published vivid photo of an infant child alongside his comatose drug-addict mother saying, `Get up, Mummy! Get 
 up, Mummy!' says it all. The Swedish National Institute of Public Health also states:</para><para>Drug policy is a part of social policy, the aim of which is to give everybody in Sweden a basic measure of security through a system of general benefits. The restrictive focus of Swedish drug policy is part of this general approach of the idea that everybody is entitled to a decent life and that no groups are excluded from participation in society.</para><para>I ask the House: what sort of a life does this young child have when his mother is comatose and cannot get up? The war against street drugs has to be fought on many frontsâin the courts, by education and by rehabilitation. We cannot go soft on the issue if we do not want a major national disaster on our hands.

I would have thought, though, that he could have provided the House with greater information about the implementation of the Swedish strategy. In part (4) of his motion he calls on our government to implement the program in place in Sweden. I am sure all members would support the vision of a society free of drug abuse, but it would have been good to hear some information as to how that particular vision is being realised in Swedenâwhat sort of combination of community programs, punishment and rehabilitation is being implemented in that nation.</para></talk.start><para>I also thought it was somewhat inconsistent for the member for Riverina to criticise marijuana as a street drug when he is also criticising the South Australian laws. The whole purpose of the decriminalisation of marijuana for personal use in South Australia is to prevent marijuana becoming a street drug, to avoid the trafficking of marijuana on the streets of that particular state. Personal use and cultivation in moderate amounts does not need to be a criminal offence.</para><para>Apparently the figures show that there is no correlation between that particular law and marijuana use in South Australia. Surveys have shown that five per cent to 10 per cent of marijuana users in other states say that their use is motivated by the fact that the drug is regarded as illegalâthat is, it is an act of social rebellion that causes them to engage in marijuana use. You take that away in South Australia and apparently the figure does not show any correlation. It is often argued that correlation does not equal cause. In this case, we do not even have the correlation on which to hang the sort of argument that was being advanced by the member for Riverina.</para><para>It is hard to sustain an argument that there is a domino theory in drug use, particularly when in the motion marijuana is described as a `mind altering drug'. If that is the argument and the member for Riverina is going to be consistent, surely he would be arguing for alcohol to be outlawed in Australia. Alcohol is certainly a mind altering drug. If there is a domino theory whereby alcohol use would lead to marijuana use, surely the member for Riverina and his supporters in this matter should have been consistent enough to call for the outlawing of alcohol. So there are some problems in that particular presentation.</para><para>We need to have close regard for the right balance of policies. I heard a speaker last Friday talking about youth issues, describing the way in which Western society seems to have a habit every decade of finding a new fad answer to youth problems. One decade it is the call for more punishmentâthe call for government to enact tougher laws. The next decade it is a big drive for community based answers to youth alienation and drug abuse. The decade after that it is often a big focus on market driven policies, producing jobs and meaningful employment for young people. The truth is we should not be engaging in a fad response. We should not be engaging in just one aspect of a drug policy response. We need an integrated approach that gets the balance right between community connection and responsibility, between the right type of laws to minimise drug abuse in our society and, of course, the creation of jobs and meaningful activity for young Australians.</para><para>It is very important to get the balance right. There is no doubt that the link between unemployment and drugs represents a social disease that needs to be attacked by government. I can tell some terrible stories to the House about some of the street crime and associated drug problems in my electorate, particularly in Campbelltown. There is a street in Englorie Park where 15 homes in a six-month period were all broken into mainly by young people, according to the sighting that was made as they ran away. The suspicion, of course, is that drugs is a big part of that law and order problem. We need to ensure that if young people are not in school they have some employment opportunities available to them, that there is an integrated approach by government recognising the problem of youth unemployment and its connection with drug abuse.</para><para>We need to get the balance right on the punishment question. I do not subscribe to the domino theory on these drug policy issues. I think the South Australians got it right when they decriminalised the personal use of marijuana. They have taken marijuana off the streets as much as possible and recognised that it can be used in sensible practices that do not lead to more serious drug use and abuse.</para><para>On the question of punishment and law making and the way in which drug addicts are treated by society, I should mention that during the parliamentary recess I had the opportunity to visit Odyssey House in my electorate and talk to some of the residents there. I was very struck by their stories. I do not think it is possible to get a full appreciation of drug related questions in our society unless you talk to people who have that personal experience.</para><para>I asked one of the residents thereâhe was somewhat of a spokesperson for the groupâwhat would be the one policy change that he would make if he was the government for a day. The answer is one that I am happy to pass on to the House, even though it is perhaps not one that my side of politics readily embraces. His answer was that he would close down all the youth refugees. I said, `Hang on, why would you do that?' He 
 said, `The truth is that if young people find comfort and solace in youth refuges and they are not made to face up to heroin addiction, they will not find it within themselves to deal with their problem. The first step is to reach the bottom, take pride in oneself and try to pull oneself out of the problem of heroin addiction. That does not come from being comforted in the first instance; it comes from being forced to face up to the difficulty.' I thought that was a valid point to make.</para><para>We should not have a situation where heroin addicts are able to avoid their personal responsibility for facing up to the addiction. Once they face up to the problemâthat is the important first step that is embraced by Odyssey Houseâwe need support mechanisms. We do need government and community to play a supporting role but, without that personal responsibility and that first step in facing up to the problem, it is very hard to see how such a serious addiction can be overcome. I am interested to learn more. I will be visiting Odyssey House in my electorate and other parts of the country more often as I consider these policy matters.</para><para>We do need systems of public support. At Odyssey House it is based on individuals facing up to their dilemma and then trying to engage much more in a sense of community. I think that is very important. That is the third leg of effective policy. There must be job generation for young Australians and there must be the appropriate balance of law and public and private responsibility but we also need to build a greater sense of social belonging because in the end serious drug abuse is a form of escapism. It is a form of escapism for those who feel alienated from our society, who feel left out and who feel far too challenged and pressured by the lifestyle of our modern and at times difficult society.</para><para>We must consider as policy makers the means by which a greater sense of social belonging can be imparted to young Australians. A lot of the answers lie in youth and community development, giving young people a greater role to play at the local level. A lot of the answers lie in school and employment policy. </para><para>I am interested in the arguments I hear as shadow education minister about the need to cater for diverse youth needs and diverse youth learning inclinations. There is no one form of intelligence among young people. As they go through secondary school, they have a diverse set of learning needs and habits. The role of secondary schooling should be to ensure that every young Australian engages in a positive learning experience and that they have their learning needs customised and provided for by government to make sure that they can each engage in that positive learning experience. If they do that at ages 13 and 14, there is a stronger chance that they will value education and go on to higher educational attainment at ages 17 through to 20. So catering for diverse youth needs and developing programs that provide this stronger sense of social belonging is a very important part of the policy approach.</para><para>I despair frequently when I listen to some of the reaction on talkback radio encouraged by some of the talkback radio hosts, that the only answer in this issue is tougher punishment. I am disappointed when I hear the member for Riverina say that his answer is tougher punishment. The right balance on law making is important but we must also ensure that young Australians have a sense of social belonging, they are recognised for their achievements and they are recognised for their role in the community. A big part of that is the social recognition and connection that comes out of employment, to do more in this vexed area of youth unemployment and to rethink the relationship between state and community to make sure that young Australians do have a stronger sense of social recognition and connectedness as they live through those difficult adolescent years.</para><para>Tougher punishment in isolation is not the answer. There needs to be a fuller and more considered approach by government. Maybe some of the solutions do lie in the implementation of the Swedish model. Perhaps on another occasion the member for Riverina can give the House more information in that regardâperhaps at the end of this debate in his summing up. I would urge other members of the House to consider the full policy scope 
 in this area, to take a balanced view and to make sure that we do not fall into the trap of advocating tougher punishment alone.</para><para>Consideration interrupted.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS</title><type>Personal Explanations</type><page.no>72</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>72</page.no><name role="metadata">Jones, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BARRY JONES</name><name.id>KH4</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon.

The industry is estimated to be worth in excess of $2 billion a year and, in contrast, seizures by enforcement agencies are around $55 million a year. In 1994 the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland estimated that in that 
 state the value of the cannabis crop was $652 million, second in value as a cash crop only to sugar. Last week the United Nations, reporting on drug use in Australia, said that Australia was the biggest user of cannabis in the world.</para></talk.start><para>The progress of the national drug strategy, which reviewed Australia's national drug strategy throughout last year, found amongst other things the following: 10 per cent of 16-year-olds smoke cannabis at least weekly; use amongst teenagers has increased from 20.8 per cent in 1988 to 28.4 per cent in 1995âthat is for 14- to 19-year-olds; and 50 per cent of 14- to 19-year-olds last year were offered cannabis, 40 per cent have smoked it at least once in the past and 25 per cent smoked it in the last year alone.</para><para>Cannabis is a fat soluble drug that contains 421 chemicals and causes all the problems associated with smoking and considerably more. You are six times more likely to suffer from schizophrenia if you are a cannabis smoker. One-third of all patients forcibly admitted to psychiatric institutions in Australia last year were in need of detention because of a marijuana induced relapse. This is not, contrary to what some people may think, a safe or benign drug.</para><para>The critical question though is: why do people take drugs at all? The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) made some extremely important and I think valid points on this. Why is it that people seek the escapism of taking a drug to provide them with the excitement that they feel is otherwise lacking in their day-to-day lives? You can open a newspaper or turn on a television or a radio in any part of the country on any day of the week and you are confronted with evidence of a society that is failingâof which the very high level of cannabis use is but one symptom. We have amongst the highest suicide rates of young people in the developed world. We have a debate about euthanasia and what everyone's attitude is to that. We had the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) last year making a video in anticipation of her death. Death and the discussion of it and preoccupation with it are symptoms of societies generally that are failing. Gambling is elevated to the 
 status of religion in many parts of the country. We have also engaged in a race debate. We have a widening gap between those who have extreme wealth and those who live in extreme poverty.</para><para>The thematic currency for drug use, despair and self-destructive behaviour amongst young people is that, in many of our actions and attitudes, we have failed to transmit a sense of belonging and the sense of meaningful purpose to the next generation who, in many cases, feel that the only thing they have to believe in is themselves and that they live in a societyâas Richard Eckersley, social policy analyst for the CSIRO, has observedâwhere progress and a belief in progress is central to our culture. Yet, for the fist time in many generations, the current generation of young people do not face a future which will automatically guarantee them a higher standard of living than that enjoyed by their parents. In fact, many of them know that they will struggle to achieve it.</para><para>Yet, every day in this place we talk about growth as if it is an altar upon which we worship. The imagery of success and the values to which many young people are still tethered are that success is acquiring a BMW, having a mobile phone, doing very well at school and having fashionable clothing and many of the things which the reality of life will cruelly short change them with. The price of our shallowness is being paid by our children. The problem is not that they have not learnt our values; it is that they have. Then we wonder why the level of drug use is so high in Australia.</para><para>If we cannot keep drugs out of prisons, I question how we will be able to possibly keep drugs out of schools, train stations or any of the other places where people consume them. Like the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), I do not think we should be legalising these products, but I certainly think we need a much broader approach to this issue than simply enforcement. It is about education, it is about cultural values, it is about rebuilding. As Hugh Mackay has said, the most important challenge this nation faces is to rebuild a sense of community.</para><para>What we need to understand is that the most important resource we have is that of our personal relationships, and on the eve of the new millennium what we need most is one another. Many young people feel, as I said, that the only thing they have to believe in is themselves. We need to increasingly look for opportunities to make them feel that they are a part of a society that cares for them and that will provide for them. We need to feel that we are a nation that has strategic visionâa sense of who we are, where we are going, how we relate to one another and, most importantly, what is necessary to get there. Reflex, knee-jerk, conservative responses to the drug issue are not likely to be too successful.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>74</page.no><name role="metadata">Albanese, Anthony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ALBANESE</name><name.id>R36</name.id><electorate>Grayndler</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAt the outset, I would like to agree with the member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) on one thing in his motion: there is terrible damage being done to Australians, particularly our young Australians, by drugs. Around 600 young and not so young Australians will die this year as a result of heroin use. Longitudinal studies suggest that this is about two to three per cent of heroin users who will die each yearâor about one every 16 hours. The death rate from IV drug use is increasing as a result of increases in the availability and purity of heroin.</para></talk.start><para>The costs of drug use in our community are not just in loss of life. Costs also arise from medical treatment for overdoses and other conditions such as HIV infection and hepatitis which can result from drug use. It is estimated that every hour in Australia an IV drug user contracts hepatitis and 18,000 addicts are receiving methadone treatment with even more on the waiting lists. There is a community cost from criminal activity associated with drug use. There are law enforcement and judicial costs. Drug law enforcement cost Australians $500 million in 1996. There is also a loss of quality in lifeânot just for the drug users themselves but for their families and friends.</para><para>This is the point at which my views on this subject diverge from those of the member for Riverina and where they become more in line with both the member for Bradfield (Dr 
 Nelson) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). How do we as a parliament and as a society address the issue of the huge social costs of drug use? I would suggest that hardline rhetoric about enforcement is not the solution.</para><para>The motion suggests a push for an increasingly restrictive drug policy like that operating currently in Sweden. The key elements of this policy currently make it a criminal offence to consume, possess, supply, produce, acquire with a view to supplying, transport or store narcotic drugs. In addition, anyone who puts a supplier in touch with a buyer can be charged with promoting drug trading. Police are also legally able to confiscate drug paraphernalia such as syringes and needles and smoking devices such as bongs and pipes.</para><para>While no-one would argue that suppliers of narcotics should not be dealt with seriously by law enforcement authorities, the Swedish experience, like that of Australia, has been that the vast majority of offences are minor cannabis offences. In Sweden in 1991, of the 7,600 indicted for drug offences, 57 per cent were for minor cannabis offences. To make a comparison with Australia, in 1996-97, 29,000 kilograms of cannabis were seized by police, and 69,136 arrests were made. Cannabis accounted for a massive 81 per cent of drug offences in Australia last year.</para><para>The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence highlighted in its report released in January that the enormous resources being used by police to enforce current marijuana laws could be much better spent on tackling more serious drug and crime problems. The chair of the ABCI, Victorian Police Commissioner Neil Comrie, has stated that law enforcement effortsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon.

</para><para>(1)	 condemn the government of Vietnam for its continuing abuses of human rights, especially its persecution of political prisoners; and</para><para>(2)	 exert whatever political, economic and diplomatic pressure is required to encourage the government of Vietnam to work towards democracy and to release all political prisoners.</para><para>The situation in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam remains one where human rights abuse is endemic, particularly with a justice system which, despite reform, remains in essence an arm of the Communist Party, the ruling party of that country. Although many thousands of re-education detainees were released in Vietnam in the late 1980s, it appears that they have been replaced with a new crop of citizens that the party wants to silence. The actual number is unknown as Vietnam does not permit monitoring of its behaviour in this regard. Regular forms of abuse include the systematic harassment of individuals or groups thought to be opposed to the government; and long periods of detention without trial which include torture, maltreatment and denial of basic medical treatment.</para><para>Systematic abuse of human rights is perpetrated in Vietnam because the judicial system is intimately enmeshed with the country's political system. In reality, it remains an arm of government that is used to control the activities of citizens at will. Human Rights Watch described the situation as beset by a justice system which is:</para><para>institutionally weak, highly politicised and frequently beset by corruption . . . The Party's role is evident in political cases where guilty verdicts and sentences seem to be pre-determined . . . sometimes heralded by elaborate denunciations in the official press.</para><para>Two examples of the range of crimes for which people are regularly incarcerated come to mind. The first is the case of the 68-year-old secretary of the Unified Buddhist Church, Venerable Thich Quang Do, and five assistants, who were arrested and detained for organising and participating in flood famine relief in 1994. After a one-day trial in 1995, Thich Quang Do was sentenced to five years imprisonment. The legal basis for his imprisonment is unclear, although it is endorsed by the government.</para><para>In 1995, Nguyen Dinh Huy was gaoled for 15 years for calling for a gradual, peaceful political transition to democracy. He had been subjected to 17 years of re-education since 1975 and was convicted of `taking actions to overthrow the people's government'.</para><para>What is of obvious importance in today's debate is to look at Australia's role in relation to human rights abuses in Vietnam. What role does Australia have? Australia has an important role to play. We are recognised as a resilient political system in our region with a strong human rights record. Our economic performance has been steady, and our strength during the current Asian crisisâor meltdown, as it is calledâis as much attributable to our political institutions as to our financial ones.</para><para>But there are many lessons to be learnt in our region where failure to tackle human rights fosters corruption. Autocratic systems of government of the type exercised in Indonesia and Malaysia have historically fostered both political corruption or nepotism and human rights abuse. In the past we have adopted a policy of appeasement to attract beneficial trading arrangements with these countries and often swallowed their claims of a special circumstance, in particular cultural circumstances, in relation to their position in Asia.</para><para>The recent financial crisis is as much a failure to deal with human rights in the region as it is in dealing with corrupt political institutions because in essence they are symptoms of the same ailment. In the long run, Australia's trade is damaged by not encouraging political evolution in the tiger economies at the same time as encouraging market access for Australian companies.</para><para>Vietnam, whose economy and political institutions remain undeveloped, is our chance to learn from history. There are still many people who want to equate government repression and human rights abuse with stability. Economic engagement seems to be the answer for themâit is an all-encompassing answerâbut the reality is that economic development will bring social pressures which are more likely to increase turmoil and a reactionary repression in Vietnam unless those changes come hand in hand with democratic 
 development and of course the ending of human rights abuses.</para><para>Corruption has been the largest growth industry in Vietnam's new market economy. Investment is being channelled into development which is politically sound rather than being better economically based. Vietnam has modelled itself on China for its reaction to its changing economic and social fabric. After the Tiananmen Square massacre Vietnam responded with a clampdown of its own in which economic crimes against the state were linked to political ones. Official newspapers described peaceful evolution to a democratic political system and respect of human rights as a capitalist ploy to undermine the government.</para><para>Australia's role is to encourage Vietnam to release all political prisoners who have not enacted violence against the state and allow them to get on with their peaceful efforts at reform. Those who remain in gaols and re-education camps must have their human rights respected. We must link human rights with trade and investment, and convince the government of Vietnam to overhaul its legal and political institutions so as to support resilient, healthy economic growth. Australia must also encourage its own trading partners to adopt a similar approach to Vietnam and other regimes where human rights of their own citizens are not respected.</para><para>Even in our economically rationalist world, the least likely to be sympathetic to human rights, there are very clear and real benefits for us to enforce the respecting of basic human rights in our region. This is a self-interest that goes hand in hand with the object of developing trade ties. It is quite clear now when you look at some aspects of the Asian meltdown, particularly in recent days in relation to the continuing serious problems in Indonesia, that a failure earlier in our role as a friend and neighbour to Indonesia to exert strong and continual influence in relation to human rights abuses and the endemic corruption that exists in that country has obviously contributed to the situation where we are now seeing riots appearing in Indonesia and where of course we have seen the growth of attacks 
 on ethnic Chinese minorities within that country.</para><para>One of the most interesting aspects of the cost of human rights abuses in terms of Australia's own national interest is in the issue of labour costs. It is quite clear, according to the US Department of State report on human rights practices for 1997 released on 30 January 1998, that there are still very serious concerns about abuses in the labour market in Vietnam. Quite clearly, where you have a situation in an open market system where business venture capital automatically seeks out and finds the lowest possible cost of labour, countries where there are distortions, such as in Vietnam, are likely to attract investment for the reasons that the labour costs are lowerâbecause of those abuses.</para><para>This is where Australia must have a stronger role to play and must exert greater influence, because our own industries suffer as a consequence. Investment is sucked out of Australia and goes to countries where, because of those abuses, labour costs are lower. These abuses relate to things like child labour being used extensively in some industries and political prisoners or others being coerced into particular industries or particular activities against their own will.</para><para>The other aspect in the case of Vietnam, as evidenced in the report of the US Department of State, is where, for instance, there is an expressed will on the part of the government of Vietnam to ensure that these sorts of problems are sought out and changed within the Vietnamese labour system, but there are insufficient labour inspectors to be able to do those jobs. As I said earlier, there is a very strong national interest on the part of this country and other trading partners to ensure that this does not remain the case for much longer.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, Vietnam is an under-developed country in terms of its economy and its political institutions and social institutions. It needs the assistance from countries like Australia to provide the continuous, strong political pressure to ensure that these human rights abuses disappear hand in hand with the democratisation of the Vietnamese political system, along with the 
 development of their economic system, to ensure that the citizens of Vietnam enjoy human rights that we consider to be standard and part and parcel of day-to-day living, but also so that they are in a position to be able to compete and participate in our regional economy as equal partners. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon.

Although I concur with most of its sentiments, I would like to perhaps see a change in the first part by replacing `condemning the government of Vietnam' with `the Australian government expresses its concern over the continuing abuses of human rights'. The reason for that will emerge as I speak to this motion.</para></talk.start><para>There is no doubt that Vietnam has a continuing history of arbitrary arrests and detainment of citizens for peaceful expressions of political and religious objections to government policies. Briefly, I can provide the following examples which come from the US report on human rights practices in Vietnam in 1997. Seven Catholic priests remain in prison after being arrested in 1987 charged with, of all crimes, sowing disunity between the people and the stateâa crime that would be very strange for us to hear of in Australia. In 1990 Doan Viel Hoat was put in gaol for 15 years for publishing a reformist newsletter. That makes us wonder what perhaps we could do to the editors of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> were we so inclined and had the same latitude in our laws.</para><para>In 1991 Nguyen Dan Que received 20 years for publicly supporting political reform and respect for human rightsâsomething which in this country I think would give you an award in the honours list. Nguyen Dink Huy has been placed in prison for trying to organise a conference on diversity in Ho Chi Minh City. Thick Quary Do, 68, the second highest leader in the Buddhist church, was arrested in January 1996âand I think the member for Moore mentioned thisâbecause of his role in 
 organising food relief in the name of the church and for criticising the arrest of five other Buddhists. He was committed in April and received five years in prison. Amnesty has listed 54 prisoners they know of held for political reasons, but state there may be more. Some reports are as high as a thousand. They are probably exaggerated. A reasonable estimate is probably 200. Amnesty has documented its concern about particular political prisoners whose health is poor but are kept in regrettable conditions in prison, some of them in solitary confinement.</para><para>However, more recently Vietnam has released some notable dissidents, the most recent being Pham Duc Kham, one of Vietnam's longest serving political prisoners. On the other hand, Human Rights Watch of Asia has expressed concern over recent government directives which appear to legalise detention without trial of individuals considered a threat to national security. With all progress, there will be steps forwards and backwards. We should urge the Australian government, as Mr Filing does in his motion, to encourage the government of Vietnam to work towards democracy, to refrain from arresting citizens for peaceful political dissent and to release political prisoners.</para><para>Australia has maintained a dialogue on human rights in Vietnam with its success being measured more by the preparedness of the Vietnam government to listen than by more concrete successes in the release of political prisoners. Australia makes representations at ministerial and official levels but is also offering technical assistance to set up a proposed national human rights commission, which would be of interest to everybody in this parliament.</para><para>Unlike other countries in Asia and around the world, Vietnam has established a rule of law to protect its citizens. And while that is not to the standard we would want, it is to the credit of that nation. Unlike in many other countries, in Vietnam there are no known politically motivated extra-judicial killings. When we think of that we should also think of some of the things that have happened in South America. There are no known reports of politically motivated disappearances or 
 torture of detainees. The law prohibits physical abuse. This is not to suggest that prisoners are all treated as well as we would expect in our prisons, but they do have a rule of law to try to protect those prisoners. Those convicted of an offence do have the right of appeal.</para><para>The Vietnam constitution prohibits discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, religion or social class. And while there has been some discrimination against those associated with the former republic of South Vietnam, the reports of discrimination are not extensive.</para><para>On the negative side, as I have mentioned, prison conditions are harshâas they are in all poorer and developing countries around the world. And, as the member for Moore and I have both documented, the government can and does arrest and detain citizens arbitrarily. Although arrests are supposed to be accompanied by arrest warrants, they frequently are not. The fairness of political trials is also questionable. There are reports that in political cases defendants are not allowed to access government evidence before the trial, examine witnesses or challenge statements.</para><para>Vietnam is a country in transition in its economic and social structures and, perhaps soon, its political structure. In 1991 an official Vietnam commentary gave this defence of Vietnam's reluctance to embrace democracy and a more open political system:</para><para>Thanks to continued economic development, the people's life has been in the main stabilised and this is a very important factor that makes the socio-political life fundamentally stable. Ordinary Vietnamese citizens are very sensitive to politics, particularly in the context of the very complicated world situation due to the fast disintegration of socialism in Eastern Europe. From the changes in the Eastern European socialist countries and especially in the Soviet Union, the Vietnamese people see even more clearly that if there is no political stability, there cannot be economic stability.</para><para>Australia has a political history different from that of Vietnam. We cannot judge Vietnam as we would judge ourselves. However, there are fundamental human rights that we hold sacrosanct in this country and that we are obliged to promote around the world where we canâand this includes Vietnam. Those fundamental rights include protection from 
 arbitrary arrest and arrest for voicing peaceful political dissent.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>78</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAURIE FERGUSON</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI speak in support of the motion. However, I subscribe to much of the tone of the previous speech by the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). Whilst I am very strongly supportive of the need for the Australian government to be active in human rights in Vietnam, I do not resile from, or equivocate about, recognising the historic role of the current government in its struggle for national identity and against colonialism before its victory in 1975. It is worth saying in the week of the death of B.A. Santamaria that much of the rhetoric about the monolithic nature of communism is perhaps best seen with regard to Vietnam in its subsequent incursions into Cambodia, and its border clashes with China have been exposed. It is worth putting that on the record.</para></talk.start><para>The motion does raise matters of human rights in Vietnam and the previous speakers have given an account of thoseâthe level of treatment in gaols, the lack of representation, the fact that many of the laws are written so widely that they are basically catch-alls and the fact that people are essentially gaoled for being questioners or opponents of the government. As well as those in the Buddhist and Catholic churches and those who have been gaoled for alleged corruption, even dissidents in the Communist Party of Vietnam's internal debate about where they should be going have been gaoled.</para><para>The member for Moore (Mr Filing) raised the question of human rights with regard to trade unions. This is not a complaint coming from those people who politically oppose the regime but from the group Transnational Resource and Action Centre, whose emphasis is mainly on trade union rights. They exposed the way in which the current administration is selling off its work force at the cheapest available price to Nike. They said that the factories were characterised by respiratory problems as a result of constant exposure to carcinogens. That was a result obtained by Ernst and Young, a reputable organisation. They spoke of the work force in Nike plants working 65 hours a week in noise and oppres 
 sive heat. There were insufficient doors in the factory and a large presence of workers under 18 years of age. Therefore it was less than convincing when, after that Ernst and Young survey, a company spokesman said:</para><para>We believe that we look after the interests of our workers.</para><para>Reputable sources such as Amnesty International and Asia Watch also raise various aspects of the situation in Vietnam.</para><para>Amnesty International has also questioned the figures, and the previous speaker made this point. Dissident groups such as the Vietnam Committee on Human Rights have put the figures at 1,200. Amnesty International, a fairly reputable organisation which has been prepared throughout the Cold War to attack South American dictatorships that are pro-American as much as eastern bloc dictatorships, has said that those figures are perhaps too high.</para><para>That is an important point that we should bear in mind in regard to this conflict. This was not a very nice dispute between the current government and those who were politically associated with the United States. It is a situation in which emotions were very strong because of a belief by the current government that those against them were essentially involved in colonial suppression of them. It is worth saying that some of those outside VietnamâI am not for one moment saying all of themâare not exactly the most democratically inclined people either. Essentially, the motion is right and proper, and we would hope that the Australian government would be vigilant in these matters.</para><para>I would like to take up the last few moments of my contribution by talking about one aspect of suppression in Vietnamâthat is, the question of the 39 stateless families in Hong Kong of Chinese background whom the government of Vietnam will not accept back into its country and whom this government, along with others, says it will not take under the humanitarian program. It is a matter on which I have been in contact with the minister. I hope he has second thoughts about this. This is not like some Iraqi getting off a plane from Bangkok and throwing his papers down the toilet at Sydney airport. These 
 people had no choice but to leave Vietnamâthey were not getting their rights in Vietnam. This government, along with the Western world, should accept some responsibility for these 39 families whom the Hong Kong administration says will not be able to stay.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>79</page.no><name role="metadata">Southcott, Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name><name.id>TK6</name.id><electorate>Boothby</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhile I endorse the comments of the previous speakerâthe member for Reid, Mr Laurie FergusonâI agree more with the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) that we should not be condemning the government of Vietnam.</para></talk.start><para>This motion raises an old debate, and that is what role human rights should play in foreign policy. Referring to this debate, Henry Kissinger noted in <inline font-style="italic">Diplomacy</inline> that ideological fervour propelled Napoleon's armies across Europe `on behalf of the universal principles of liberty, equality and fraternity'. Later, Metternich and Castlereagh argued that this was what happened when `the rights of man' were exported. These men were the forerunners to realists like Bismarck, Disraeli, Teddy Roosevelt and Henry Kissingerâindividuals who held that focusing on the balance of power would avoid conflict and maintain order and that human rights were internal matters for states.</para><para>The opposite view that history is on the side of human rights and that democracy should intervene to protect human rights was articulated by men like Gladstone, Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter, and we should remember that their human rights campaigns were all profoundly unsuccessful. As the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> noted in a leader in 1997, `It is easier to posture about human rights, much harder to do anything.'</para><para>In the area of dialogue on human rights with Vietnam, Australia takes a constructive approach. Although the Vietnamese government's human rights record is poor and the government continues to repress the freedoms of association, speech and religion, freedoms which we expect and enjoy, over recent years there has been a small improvement in human rights in Vietnam. Some dissidents have been released, including Pham Duc Kham in September last year.</para><para>As Vietnam moves from a centrally planned economy to a market economyâa process 
 called `doi moi', which began in 1986âgreater political liberalisation is likely to accompany economic liberalisation, but it is not inevitable as Fukuyama suggested. Australia should not condemn or isolate Vietnam but should raise its concerns in a constructive mannerâconcerns like the detention of individuals for their peaceful expression of political and religious beliefs, and also an in-principle objection to the use of the death penalty.</para><para>The most effective way of improving the human rights situation is through cooperation, dialogue and institution building. That is done by regular contact at ministerial level, by an AusAID program which has a strong emphasis on human rights, by courses in Vietnam and Australia for Communist Party and government officials which target human rights questionsâit is particularly important to focus on the party because, much like the Labor Party is the political wing of the unions, the government is only the political wing of the party; it cannot do anything without the Communist Partyâand also by offering help with setting up a national human rights commission.	That approach has established a frank dialogue between Australia and Vietnam on detainees and allows us to provide cooperation and training for the Communist Party's political academy in Hanoi.</para><para>Looking at regional fora, Vietnam has been a member of ASEAN since 1995. What we need to do with Vietnam is not isolate it but involve it in regional meetings like the ASEAN Regional Forum and APEC and also encourage greater openness in its economy, which should bring about greater freedom for its citizens.</para><para>Vietnam faces great challenges: its state owned enterprises need reform and foreign investment is falling. The tendencies towards greater control and isolation are strong. To isolate Vietnam now would gravely harm the vast majority of the Vietnamese people. Condemnation of Vietnam is unlikely to assist the human rights of its citizens. International condemnation did work in the case of South Africa and it does work in democracies but rarely in one-party statesâyou only have to look at Myanmar. It would lead to greater 
 isolation of the ruling Communist Party and encourage those who are suspicious of capitalism and the West. Australia should maintain a dialogue on human rights and raise the issue of political prisoners and human rights whenever we meet with representatives either of the Communist Party of Vietnam or of the Vietnamese government.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon.

These are families who are struggling following this government's progressive dismantling of assistance to people with disabilities. We have a situation now in Australia where levels of unmet need for disability services are rising. Some 13,500 people with severe and profound disabilities do not get the accommodation services that they need, about 30,000 people with disabilities do not get the help with employment assistance that they need and 7,700 people with severe and profound disabilities are cared for by parents who are aged over 65. The important point about these figures that everybody needs to be aware of is that these people are people with severe and profound disabilities who do not have decent accommodation or who are living with parents who are getting much older. The need in accommodation services alone has been costed at $275 million by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.</para></talk.start><para>What has been the government's response to this increasing need? The government's response has been as follows. First of all, they cut $174 million from the disability services budget over the last two budgets. So, in the 
 face of this dire need, what do this government do? They cut $174 million from the budget. They did not even have the decency to tell people with disabilities that they were cutting the budget, preferring to call the lion's share of the cuts `efficiency dividends'. These efficiency dividends are in fact, of course, significant cuts.</para><para>Secondly, this government has failed to sign the Commonwealth-state disability agreements after three token offers which the states and territories have found very easy to reject. This failure has put disability services into limbo, unable to plan for the future, existing from month to month. This is because the states and territories know that the Commonwealth offer goes nowhere near meeting the needs that have been outlined above. The National Council on Intellectual Disability condemned and rejected outright the latest offer made by the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) last week to the states and territories, calling it a totally inadequate offer and saying this:</para><para>Given the Prime Minister's recent promise, [the National Council on Intellectual Disability] strongly criticises the Federal Government for its insult to people with disability and their families that this offer represents.</para><para>The next area where the government is taking cuts out of those families that have children with disabilities is that the government is taking the child disability allowance away from families. About 8,000 children, according to Senate estimates last week, will lose the child disability allowance as a result of the government changing the definition of who is disabled. After June 1998, when the new assessment tables come in, the government has budgeted for savings of $25.3 million in the 1998-99 financial year alone. In one year alone $25 million will be taken off children with a disability. It has also abolished the position of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner.</para><para>Most important of all is what the government is doing to people with disabilities who are trying to get work. The unemployment rate for people with a disability is more than double what it is for the rest of the population. To give people with disabilities the same chances for jobs and decent wages that other 
 Australians have, there used to be specific labour market programs specifically designed to meet their needs. These were called the disability reform panels, and they were successful. The latest review of them showed that clearly. Once again, what has this government done? This government has abolished them. It has abolished something that worked and replaced it with an experiment: the new labour market arrangements that come into place in May this year. What this will mean for people with disabilities who are trying to get back to work is still unclear. But what does seem to be clear is that it will be left up to people with disabilities to find their own way through what will be a much more complicated maze of employment support.</para><para>I make a final point as far as this litany of reduction in support by this government and failure to support people with disabilities is concerned. Late last year we saw the government trying to take away the mobility allowance from people with intellectual disabilities who attend independent living skills centres. This was never announced; it just happened. Gradually the phone calls started coming in and then more and more phone calls and letters were coming in from people saying that they had lost their mobility allowance. This meant that people were not going to be able to afford to pay for the transport that was required to get them to these independent living centres. Fortunately, as a result of considerable pressure on the government, this latest attack on people with disabilities was headed off. It is pleasing to be able to say that mobility allowance looks safe for the moment. Nevertheless, given the litany of attacks that people with disabilities have suffered under this government, nobody could be too sure.</para><para>The 1980s, I am pleased to say, was a period of considerable reform in the disability area. The Disability Services Act was passed in 1986, followed by the first Commonwealth-state disability agreement and then the Disability Discrimination Act. It was a period when we spoke regularly about the breaking down of barriers. But what this government is doing is progressively erecting the barriers for people with disabilities again and again. 
 Each budget cut translates into putting one more barrier up, until we find that over a period we are back to where we started from in the late 1970s. The least the government could do is finalise agreements with the states which provide a decent level of funding to the states to ensure that, particularly in the area of accommodation, a decent amount and a decent quality of accommodation could be provided for people with disabilities. These are people who are currently not receiving adequate accommodation support, particularly those families where ageing relativesâpeople over the age of 65âare caring for adult offspring with serious disabilities.</para><para>If this government walks awayâas it seems to be planning to doâfrom the multilateral agreement that has up until now existed between the Commonwealth and the states and negotiates a variety of deals with the states, we will effectively have the demolition of another plank in disability reform, the Commonwealth-state disability agreement. If we see the demolition of the Commonwealth-state disability agreement, we will also see the loss of the capacity of the Commonwealth to require each of the states to pass legislation that mirrors the Commonwealth legislation. That will mean that we will no longer have a consistent national rights oriented framework for disability services.</para><para>What we face, as a result of this government's budget cuts to those with disabilities and the government's incapacity to negotiate a new agreement with the states over disabilities, is the loss of a national agreement and the loss of any adequate support for people who need decent accommodation. It is a backward step for those who need the government's support and a shameful mark against a government that has shown its true colours in its lack of support for the most disadvantaged in our community: those with severe and profound disabilities.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Older Workers</title><page.no>82</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>82</page.no><name role="metadata">Grace, Elizabeth, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE</name><name.id>ML6</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âYou are reliable, you have been productive from day one, you make fewer costly mistakes, you are focused on your job and you have the potential to make a business more profitable. You are the dream employee. 
 Yet, every second Wednesday, you line up outside a Centrelink office waiting to hand in your social security form. Day in and day out you apply for jobs that you could do standing on your head. Day in and day out you keep getting knocked back. You soon start to doubt your own ability. You become despondent and bitter. You become trapped in the vicious circle of despair, which further restricts your chances of getting a job.</para></talk.start><para>The other night on TV I heard a Welsh coalminer sum up perfectly what I am talking about. He said, `There is nothing so cold, so dark and so black as being unemployed and over 40.' This feeling of total dejection can come whether you are a business executive, a parent returning to the work force or a factory worker. I do not know how many members of this House can relate to this feeling, but I can. I spent 4Â½ years of my life between the ages of 50 and 55 being unemployed. I was a qualified school teacher who was working in the tourist industry when I was retrenched. I learned of my fate on a Wednesday and was told to finish up on Friday. This meant that my whole life changed dramatically. I took it on the chin. I thought I would take some time off, catch up with friends and then I would get another job. I was wrong. It was not as if I  wanted a highly paid job or a high-powered job; twenty hours a week being a shop assistant would have done. I needed a job; any jobâone that provided me with some cash flow and a social outlet.</para><para>People, particularly some bureaucrats and politicians, do not realise that when a person of mature age loses a job it means that the family struggles to pay the mortgage and the car payments, to keep the children in school and to face all the other bills that are associated with running a household. It is a very hard and devastating time.</para><para>Last week while travelling in a cab I started up a conversation with the cab driver. He was saying that Australia has the most educated cab fleet in the world. He himself had two degrees and was a former marketing manager before being retrenched at 55. Because he could not find employment, he gained a cab licence and was driving, but only part time. 
 He said he had applied for hundreds of jobs over the past year and had finally managed to get an interview for a job as a storeman and packer at a sheet metal companyânot his preferred job but a full-time job nonetheless. I wish him all the best.</para><para>The over-40s in Australia are the largest demographic group by age, and I caution both sides of the House that if their employment needs are ignored they could develop into a potential political time bomb. It is easier for me to stand here in the House today and say that something must be done because, in Lilley, I am doing something. I have facilitated the formation of a self-help job network that specialises in finding jobs for people over the age of 40. This employment network for over-40s is vital because there are so many talented mature age people in Lilley whose knowledge and abilities are going to waste.</para><para>I was very fortunate recently to meet a gentleman by the name of Rod Murray. Rod, like me, knows what it is like to be middle-aged and unemployed. He was 45 years of age with three children when he lost his job. He was forced to sell his house, take his children out of school and move his family to his mother's two-bedroom home in another state. However, Rod is fighting back and is the voluntary chairman of a group called `Don't Overlook Mature-age Expertise in Redlands'âDOMER. The DOMER group consists of over 50 members who actively seek jobs for older people by canvassing businesses for employment opportunities. Everybody in the organisation is required, as part of their membership, to make some effort on behalf of the DOMER group. Once a fortnight they spend half a day on the phones in the office, canvassing businesses for jobs for the groupânot for themselves but for the group.</para><para>The figures in Redlands are very promising. On average, after a session on the phones, each DOMER member has contacted at least two willing employers. This equates to about eight jobs a day and about 40 jobs a week. A major spin-off of the network is that it helps rebuild self-esteem. It gives members the chance to unload their frustrations and fears, to receive valuable support and to relate to 
 people who are dealing with similar life experiences.</para><para>It was not long before Rod realised that the over-40s job seekers were a very saleable item if marketed effectively. On more than one occasion employers told him, `Thank goodness, we've now got somewhere to go where we can find a mature age person.' The underlying sentiment is that middle aged employees are stable, willing to work five days a week and will do their job from nine until five.</para><para>Unemployment data also shows that, while over-40s tend to be unemployed longer than younger people, they are six times less likely to return to the unemployment queues. I quickly realised while listening to Rod that it was time a DOMER-style group was set up in Lilley. I sent out a press release to our local Quest papers, the <inline font-style="italic">Northern News</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Northside Chronicle</inline>, which read:</para><para>Unemployed over 40s are being targeted by the Federal member for Lilley Elizabeth Grace, who wants to set up a self-help organisation to find jobs for older people.</para><para>Mrs Grace is joining forces with Rod Murray, who has set up the Don't Overlook Mature-age Expertises Redlands (DOMER) group.</para><para>Mrs Grace said she was looking for a positive community response for the formation of a DOMER style branch in Lilley.</para><para>And a positive community response is what I got. I was overwhelmed: 15 people contacted my office within two hours of the papers being delivered, and in all we took some 50 phone calls, including two from employers who were willing to employ someone over the age of 40.</para><para>A public meeting was organised to discuss the issue and it gave unanimous support for starting a DOMER-style branch in Lilley. It was a great feeling to know that as a community we had come together and were about to achieve something positive. This was because everyone in the room was committed to making the program workânone of them were unemployed intentionally and none of them wanted to remain unemployed.</para><para>We named the new group DOMEN (Don't Overlook Mature-age Expertise Northside) and elected Robert Massey of Sandgate as the 
 first chairman, June Fitzgerald of Nudgee as vice-chairman, Loretta Parchimowicz of Nundah as treasurer and Ross Walters of Chermside as secretary, and committee members elected were Barry Gorton of Kalinga, Paul Froggatt of Sandgate and Robert Zorzetto from Boondallâa huge spread across my electorate.</para><para>The newly elected president, Robert Massey, sent me some interesting facts about the group. He said, `At the meeting you organised 24 mature aged men and women attended indicating their need for employment. This small pocket collectively offered employers a range of 672 years of experience or in excess of 10Â½ million working hours. The mature aged unemployed represent a vital resource which is currently lost to the Australian work force. Australia simply cannot afford to lose such valuable expertise.'</para><para>As a group we have certainly started the ball rolling. We have had the offer of rent-free premises from which to operate, and I would personally like to thank Mr Ian Pritchard from Simplicity Funerals at Kedron for making this possible. A computer is on its way, as well as other general office equipment such as tables, chairs and filing cabinets.</para><para>I am in the process of securing some set-up funding from local Rotary clubs to pay for the telephone lines and the cost of incorporating the group. The new group will also have the benefit of a ready-made database thanks to my 1998 edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Lilley Business Directory</inline>, which contains over 700 local businesses and community organisations employing some 10,000 residents across the electorate.</para><para>The aim of my directory is to encourage residents to purchase local goods and services, giving local businesses the incentive to expand and employ more Australians. Hopefully, these will include more mature age Australians. And it is working, because recently I received a letter from local businessman Clem Scanlan, from Clem Scanlan and Associates, who wrote:</para><para>We thank you for the support given to small business. We are happy to advise that our practice has improved over the past year and we will soon be in a position to engage the services of another 
 cadet. We welcome the support of the people in government.</para><para>The promotion of DOMEN and the benefits of employing someone over the age of 40 will feature in my next electorate-wide business newsletter. This newsletter reaches over 4Â½ thousand Lilley businesses. Furthermore, the DOMEN group will have access to 40 of the top 400 Queensland owned companies that are based in my electorate. The key to the success of the whole program is networking and I am sure DOMEN can forge themselves into an effective self-help employment service. I call on the government to have a long, hard look at this issue and offer some realistic assistance to the jobless mature aged. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation</title><title>Advance Australia Foundation</title><page.no>84</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>84</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr KELVIN THOMSON</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI enjoyed listening to the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Elizabeth Grace) speaking in a convincing fashion about the plight of mature aged unemployed people, particularly people over 40. Indeed, she made reference to people over 55. It would be a little more convincing if she were also on record in relation to decision of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to include superannuation as part of the assets test for those aged over 55. The effect of that decision is to give anyone who turns 55 and happens to be without work some nine months in which to find a job. If they are unable to find a job during that period, they become effectively retired for life because superannuation is included as part of the assets test. They are not eligible for any social security support and therefore they have to dip into their superannuation in order to live. In order to do that, they have to retire. That is a most unfortunate piece of government policy, dating back to 1996. I hope that the member for Lilley and others do everything they can to address it.</para></talk.start><para>Just before the House rose last year, back on 5 December in the appropriations debate, I held up a car tidy bag in the House which had been produced by a company which rejoiced in the name of No Worries Pty Ltd and described the product as the `Aussie

In case we still had not got the message, it even had the `Keep Australia beautiful' logo on it.</para><para>Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have been excused for thinking that this `Aussie Care' car tidy bag from the No Worries company with the `Australian Made' and `Keep Australia beautiful' logos was in fact manufactured in Australia, but you would have been wrong. If you opened up the car tidy bag and looked inside it, it turned out that it was made in India.</para><para>That was just one of the unsatisfactory consequences of the Howard Liberal government's decision in August 1996 to withdraw $2 million in funding from the Advance Australia Foundation, which caused that foundation to go into liquidation. At the time I raised this issue back in December, quite appropriately there was some media interest in it. A spokesman for the consumer affairs minister, by way of response to these concerns, said:</para><para>. . . the Government withdrew funding from AAF because an independent audit had shown it was a loss-making exercise.</para><para>The Government strongly supported the Australian Made campaign, but the AAF had proved it was not the appropriate forum.</para><para>The bad news for the minister is that this defence was nonsense. It so incensed Mr James Malone, the former Chief Executive of the Advance Australia Foundation, that he wrote to the minister to set him straight. It is worth quoting from that letter where Mr Malone says:</para><para>Briefly the facts are:</para><para>.	 April 1996: I briefed the then Minister for Administrative Services, David Jull, on the AAF's plans to rejuvenate the Australian Made campaign including moving it to a self funding basis over a four year period. The Minister said that the government was unlikely to remove funding from the Australian Made campaign.</para><para>.	 May: The Minister advised that, as an outcome of the government's general cut back in expenditure, contrary to his earlier opinion withdrawal of funding was now likely. 
</para><para>.	 June: I again visited the Minister and reported that after careful study the Foundation had confirmed it could continue the campaign on a self funding basis provided government support was available during the transitional period on a phasing out basis.</para><para>.	 July 3: My chairman and I met with the Minister and advised that if government was unable to provide a firm undertaking of funding, the board of the AAF was certain to place it in voluntary liquidation.</para><para>`Certain'. The letter continues:</para><para>The Minister said he could not provide the undertaking and reiterated that funding was highly unlikely.</para><para>.	 July 5: In view of this situation and an independent report which had advised that if the government withdrew funding, the viability of the Foundation was dubious, the board of the Foundation formally decided that the Foundation was unable to maintain its operations on a viable basis. It therefore placed the Foundation in voluntary liquidation and informed the Minister of that action. That outcome was announced in a joint press statement by my chairman and the Minister who congratulated the Foundation on its work with the campaign.</para><para>The charge that the Advance Australia Foundation was not the appropriate forum for the Australian Made campaign was entirely without foundation. This body had run the campaign successfully over a period of 12 years. It created between 900 and 2,000 jobs each year, and contributed some $360 million to gross domestic product.</para><para>Mr Malone's letter referred the minister also to an economic evaluation carried out in September 1995âpresumably held amongst the records of the former Department of Administrative Servicesâwhich confirms the effectiveness of the campaign under the Advance Australia Foundation's management. Mr Malone's letter concludes:</para><para>. . . I ask that you ensure no further statements of the kind quoted above are repeated by your staff.</para><para>It is not particularly surprising that Mr Malone had to write to the minister to set him straight. By my recollection, this is the fourth minister in the Howard government to handle this portfolio area in less than two yearsâfollowing ministers Geoff Prosser, David Jull and Senator Ellison who, for various reasons, fell by the wayside. Indeed, I am told by press representatives who have been pursuing 
 this area of sorry inaction by the government that things had `gone a bit slowly' because of the frequent change of minister. In all seriousness, this was advanced as the reason.</para><para>But there is another aspect of Mr Malone's letter which is quite disturbing. If you look at the timing of this, you can see that on 3 July the government knew that the Advance Australia Foundation would close; there was a formal announcement by Minister Jull and the foundation's chairman on 10 July; and yet it still continued to collect cheques. For example, from the plastics company Kevron, it collected a cheque sent off on 17 July. Kevron has gone back and sought a refund of this cheque which did not relate to the previous year's liability but related to the forthcoming financial year, and for which they have received no service whatsoeverâno promotion of the logo, no true blue campaign, no policing of the logo.</para><para>So we have a situation here where the government was told that the Advance Australia Foundation would go into liquidation, yet it allowed licensees to continue paying. That is an act of considerable deception. It confirms again just what a mess the Buy Australian campaign has become following the election of the Howard government. More than 18 months has passed since the Advance Australia Foundation went into liquidation. There is no sign of the replacement Buy Australian campaign promised by the government. There has been no promotion, no effective policing of the logo. Small businesses around Australia and in the north-west of Melbourne are sick and tired of empty rhetoric surrounding the issue of the Australian Made logo and the promised replacementâa promise made many months ago, still yet to be fulfilled.</para><para>We have a government which sees itself as self-titled champions of small business, but which is doing nothing to assist small business. I know, for example, that Mr Chambers from Kevron Plastics is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Small Business Digest</inline> of February 1998 as saying:</para><para>I showed the Minister for Small Business the Hon. Peter Reith a sample of the `offending product'â</para><para>that is, the made in India Buy Australian productâ </para><para>and quite frankly was astounded that he did not seem to care.</para><para>Yet we have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) writing to small businesses in April 1997 saying:</para><para>My pledge now is to continue to listen to small business and work in tangible ways to make running a business easier.</para><para>Australian Made was never broken; why on earth did this government seek to fix it? The government has to do two things as a matter of urgency: it ought to give back the licence fees paid under false pretences after the Advance Australia Foundation went into voluntary liquidation; and it should restore the Australian Made campaign with a code of practice, promotional support and a protection mechanism so that small business can get on with the job at hand. This is a government that says, `We are the friends of small business.' With friends like these, who needs enemies?</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Disability Services</title><page.no>86</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>86</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday I would like to refer to some extraordinary Australians and the situation that many of them face and sketch out how I believe we can better honour and support these heroic people.

 funding as a percentage of overall government outlays on specific disability services fell by six per cent while the Commonwealth share rose by six per cent.</para><para>Thankfully, since 1989-90 the Victorian government has increased funding in real terms by a credible 44 per cent, while the Commonwealth funding to the state has increased by 48 per cent. Commonwealth outlays on its own areas of responsibility have increased by over 180 per cent during this time. While the growth in total Commonwealth outlays has outstripped the increases in state outlays, the states and territories continue to provide around 80 per cent of the total funding. The current negotiations provide for significant real increases in Commonwealth contributions to the states. Growth funds and yearly indexation amounts to an increase of more than $100 million in Commonwealth funding on offer from the original negotiation starting point.</para><para>Any suggestion that the federal government intends cutting funds for disability services is simply mischievous nonsense. In addition, the efficiency dividend has been removed. The opportunities for efficiency improvements should not be overlooked, but as a good friend of mine in the sector puts it, `How many wheelchairs can one pair of hands push?' To his credit, Minister Smith has also made it clear that the Commonwealth will sit down with state and territory governments to discuss how unmet demand might be addressed once the second agreement is signed. We simply must get on with it. A cooperative partnership between the states, the Commonwealth and leading disability groups is the desire of the minister.</para><para>In the 1950s families of intellectually disabled people and committed individuals set about providing services and facilities to enable disabled people to develop skills, to enjoy life and to fulfil their potential. Their dream is alive today, and families and provider organisations still work towards it. They deserve to know where services are going and to be able to plan with certainty for the future. The states and territories should all sign the second CSDA and join the Commonwealth in the joint task of mapping out how 
 a more effective and coordinated response can be implemented to the unmet demand within the disability sector.</para><para>This need to look forward is becoming increasingly crucial. The arguments in favour of more resources are, in some cases, weakened by decisions which fail to maximise the value of resources already available. With limited services, rational choices are producing perverse impacts on the disability sector. Current policies produce confounding signals for families and snuff out hope for the future. The current supply of supported accommodation, respite and day services falls well short of demand.</para><para>The work of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, commissioned as part of the review of the first CSDA, revealed that there are at least 13,400 people with a disability who have some element of unmet accommodation and respite care demand. In the region that includes Dunkley there are some 229 people on waiting lists for CRUs, and I think we have nine places in the pipeline for the foreseeable future. These places are firstly allocated to people at risk, those who are homeless, abused or neglected or likely to be so. While I understand the emphasis given to those at risk, the pitiful number of places coming on stream barely caters for those in this threatening situation.</para><para>The priority given to relocating people from closing state-run facilities produces a churning of currently accommodated people into higher standard facilities while those on waiting lists get no closer to a place. Settling for modest, comfortable and dignified facilities while we commit to making inroads into the waiting lists might provide more hope for the families playing the primary carer role. Do these families turn their backs on all they believe in, break their own hearts and pledges to their intellectually disabled family member and abandon their child at the local state department offices just to gain a priority ranking? Where is the encouragement for these families to continue to do what we hope of them while policies reward the opposite behaviour?</para><para>Opportunities for voluntary private investment in facilities are quashed by state vacancy management processes. Community and 
 individual fundraising efforts are curtailed by the uncertainty of whom this effort will benefit. Little wonder quality respite care facilities like Connor House are stretched to breaking point, with one day a month support for families being as precious as gold.</para><para>The institute's research identified 12,000 people with an unmet demand for day services. Places are snapped up as quickly as they appear, as demonstrated by Southern Autistic's recently opened Beachlynn Services in Seaford. Their experience mirrors the record of long respected and successful local providers like Woorinyan and Kankama. We have no retirement structure within the sector. Notwithstanding the hastened metabolic rates of many people with intellectual disability, we do not provide a supported environment for disabled people to age in comfort.</para><para>The notion of ageing in place so valued in the aged care sector does not express itself in disability service policies. Why not? A managed transition of an ageing person with a disability would ensure more appropriate care for the individual and vacancies in employment, respite and support programs for the next generation requiring care. The ageing in place model also provides a possible way for improved efficiencies and value for money. Services could adapt to the changing needs of the client, perhaps at the one integrated venue, providing complementary programs in an environment that is familiar and comforting.</para><para>Some might dismiss this idea as too much like an institution but, as those in the sector constantly remind me, there are good and bad institutions. A successful integrated model can only be positive. Such a model would help overcome much of the duplication, competitiveness and bureaucracy of current arrangements. In Victoria two services are being established and a further one planned within 500 metres of one another. All will operate their own transport services, require organisational infrastructure and incur administrative seepage from available funds. Can we afford this type of bureaucracy and fragmentation when such unmet demand exists? Moreover, governments are embracing a network approach to the provision of community health 
 and medical services to maximise the coordination and value for money. Is this the future of disability services?</para><para>Networking or greater levels of agency cooperation may also help to reduce the retention of resources within excessively intrusive state bureaucracies who have yet to grant general competency standing to disability service providers. A strengthened purchaser-provider model focused on performance benchmarks and outcomes would relieve the need for state departments to oversee every detail of the provider's activity while also weeding out the non-performers in the sector.</para><para>This approach would encourage providers and agencies to work together in contrast to the constrained communication and cooperation that occurs under a direct competitive tendering formula. It would promote a culture of partnership and a more mature working relationship between state departments and community based providers. Services like E.W. Tipping Foundation who appear able to operate accommodation services at a fraction of the cost of facilities that are directly managed by the state could bid for the cost-effective delivery of these services and stand on their record.</para><para>Freed of the day-to-day supervision role, state officials could work more closely with families to develop and implement care plans for people with disabilities and ensure that this information is reflected in the planning for future services. The correlation of these needs with an ongoing mapping of services available will provide the building blocks of future service planning. We would have solid information to feed into funding frameworks and forward planning under future Commonwealth-state disability agreements.</para><para>The decisions of earlier generations are about to come home with a bang. The policies of deinstitutionalisation, born out of a commitment to independence, dignity and community engagement, will mature into a huge level of unmet demand for services and accommodation that we simply must address. There are about 1,400 intellectually disabled people living with parents who are well into their 60s who have not benefited from the 
 community support their circumstances and commitment have warranted.</para><para>The untiring efforts of these families has helped to paper over the shortfall in government services and the failure to adequately resource the shift to care in the community. These people will not be able to continue this work indefinitely. We need to give them the comfort and peace of knowing that proper care is available for their adult children. We need to assure them that ever-selfless, lifelong carers earn a peaceful retirement.</para><para>Let us get this second Commonwealth-state disability agreement in place. Let us double our efforts to tackle the current and future challenges facing those committed to a better future for people with intellectual disabilities and their families. I contrast this effort at a constructive, practical and useful contribution to the dribble the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) went on with and say that hers is not the sort of contribution we hope for from those people genuinely interested in this sector if we are going to move this debate forward.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Sydney Airport</title><page.no>89</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>89</page.no><name role="metadata">Crosio, Janice, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs CROSIO</name><name.id>7T4</name.id><electorate>Prospect</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn the grievance debate today I would like to cover a topic that I have mentioned in this House on many occasions but which I think needs to be repeated time and time again. Over the Christmas and New Year break we have seen a great many developments take place concerning plans for the construction of Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek. As was expected, the Howard coalition government, keen to limit public comment and retard the expert examination of its draft environmental impact statement, orchestrated its release just days prior to the Christmas break and allowed only 12 weeksâlater graciously extended to 14 weeksâfor the public to make its submissions on the document.</para></talk.start><para>The token two-week extension by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) was hardly enough to make up for the fact that such an important, lengthy and detailed report had been released for public consumption at the beginning of a peak holiday period. 
 If he was as interested in providing a full and transparent EIS process for the people of Sydney as he states, he would have doubled the time for submissions, not just added to it by a meagre two weeks.</para><para>The EIS report itself was a sad mixture of deficient analysis and incomplete research. The independent auditor's report on the EIS confirmed it as such just over a month later. It said the EIS was `deficient', `limited' and `ambiguous'. The independent auditor's report is a devastating indictment of the Howard government's claims to be pursuing an EIS on Badgerys Creek that leaves no stone unturned. The report states: </para><para>As a result of . . . time and cost constraints imposed by the Department of Transport and Regional Development, the draft EIS generally does not go into the degree of detail that could reasonably be expected for such a major proposal.</para><para>The report said the Howard government's EIS had failed to examine the environmental effect of not building a new airport; failed to provide an adequate economic analysis of the development; failed to build community confidence in the EIS; failed to identify how Kingsford Smith and a new airport at Badgerys Creek would operate together; and failed to satisfactorily examine the impact that noise generated by the airport would have on Sydney's population, especially those living in Sydney's west.</para><para>The Minister for the Environment has said that the auditor's report contains some important criticisms which the government must respond to. Judging by its form so far, I am not holding my breath.</para><para>During the holiday break we were also treated to some refreshing outbreaks of honesty from the government's own ranks. After suffering the rantings of the Member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) last year concerning party loyalty and opposition to Badgerys Creek, I must admit I enjoyed watching his very senior colleague, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), come out strongly against the proposed airport's development. With his local member's hat on, the Minister for Finance put out a press release over the break which said, `I remain to be convinced about any of the proposals for Badgerys Creek.' 
 You cannot get much more unambiguous than that. I hope the member for North Sydney uses the opportunity of this first sitting week of parliament to drop into the office of the Minister for Finance and perhaps over a cup of tea quietly tell him that his opposition to Badgerys Creek is inconsistent with the government and his party's line.</para><para>The member for North Sydney, the champion of consistency and party unity we know him to be, should do nothing less if he wants to remain faithful to his own stance on this issue. But the former Premier of New South Wales was not the only government member making the member for North Sydney look foolish over the summer break. So too were his fellow classmates of 1996: the member for Macquarie (Mr Bartlett) and the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly).</para><para>The member for Macquarie rose in this House for the first time late last year to express his reservations about Badgerys Creek. He said he had been campaigning privately on this issue in his own electorate for some time. I welcome his efforts.	The member for Lindsay conducted a newsletter poll of her electorate to find out just how much opposition there was to Badgerys Creek airport. After finding 60 per cent of replies were firmly against its development, the member for Lindsay not only came out against the airport but also advocated the construction of an immense floating international air centre just outside Sydney's headsâa suggestion which surprisingly won her some support from members on her own side.</para><para>I will take great pleasure in reminding government members the next time I am ridiculed for supporting an airportâfor example, at Goulburn or Wilton, linked between Sydney and Canberra by a very fast trainâthat within their own ranks they have a few paid up members of the `floating airport brigade'. I think that should shut them up quickly.</para><para>Even the member for Parramatta (Mr Ross Cameron)âI am glad he is in the House now; I assume he will also be speaking later in this debateâwas heard to murmur some misgivings about Sydney's west airport, although having seen his own electorate 
 survey, which I believe is heavily biased in favour of the airport, I am not holding my breath as to when we will see an outright condemnation of its construction from him.</para><para>Over the break we also witnessed the amazing actions of the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). As a person who suffered the member for Lowe's vitriol and ridicule for choosing to voice my opposition in this House and other places to Badgerys Creek airport, I was more than surprised when suddenly, just over a month ago, the member for Lowe publicly announced that Badgerys Creek was, in his opinion, no longer a suitable site to build a 24-hour international airport. I certainly welcomed his change of heart, but to watch him then resign from his party only a few weeks later, stating that he was doing so on a matter of political consistency and principle, left me quite incredulous. The member for Lowe is a seriously diminished figure in this House. How any one man can say all the right things about the lack of leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) while discrediting himself at the same time with his own stupefying hypocrisy is beyond me.</para><para>The most recent development on Badgerys Creek airport came last Friday when the NSW Local Government Associationâa long time supporter and advocate of the proposed airportâreversed its position and now, quite rightly, has come out in opposition to its construction. We owe our thanks for this welcome change of heart to the overwhelming majority of city councils in western Sydney who make up the anti-Badgerys Creek airport group, the Sydney West Alliance. After a long campaign the alliance was finally successful in acquainting the NSW Local Government Association with the true consequences of building such a monstrosity on the doorstep of 1.5 million Sydneysiders.</para><para>The people of western Sydney know how badly they will be affected by a 24-hour international airport at Badgerys Creek and are subsequently putting their weight behind the campaign to have plans for its construction rejected once and for all. The campaign against Badgerys Creek is not the work of ratbag activists or single issue loonies. It is 
 driven by everyday mums and dadsâby apolitical Australian citizens who ordinarily would not know a protest rally from a bar of soap. It is driven by people who want the Howard coalition government not only to listen to their concerns but to act upon them. It ignores their voices at its own peril.</para><para>As I have been saying consistently for a great many years, for the sake of 1.4 million western Sydneysiders, it is time we all cut our losses and examined alternative sites for an international airport outside the Sydney basin. They do exist. We should concentrate on suitable sites and real alternatives to Badgerys Creek which we can approach confident in the knowledge that after the necessary environmental tests have been carried out, we can begin construction with as little delay as possible. The people we represent in Sydney's west demand it of us. They demand that we stand in this parliament and every other forum and express their views and their feelings on what they want done about Badgerys Creek airport.</para><para>I am pleased that the member for Parramatta has finally decided to do a poll in his electorate and send out a sheet with a for or against whether we should construct Badgerys Creek airport. Surely if the member for Parramatta had listened when he started to doorknock his area before the last election, he would appreciate and understand the concerns of the people he represents. He has not chosen to do so. I have been aware of my constituents' concerns on this issue for the last 10 years, since the decision was first mooted about Badgerys Creek, and I will continue to remain aware. The people I represent demand it of me. The people I represent want me to keep their voice here in this place and I will continue to raise their concerns. I believe that by continuing to do that, we are finally going to get some common sense in this debate.</para><para>We finally have members from the coalition government, such as the Minister for Finance, past premier of New South Wales, saying that we must not have an airport at Badgerys Creek. We finally have members of the coalition government leaving their own seats because of certain airport corridors, where the 
 Prime Minister of this country made sure his own electorate was looked after, and to hell with everybody else. They resigned from their government and sit on the opposition benches. The Prime Minister is also coming out and saying that Badgerys Creek is not the ideal spot. Common sense will prevail, and we will not give up. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Retirement Funding</title><page.no>91</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>91</page.no><name role="metadata">Cameron, Ross, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ROSS CAMERON</name><name.id>3K6</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI listened with interest to the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), as I always do. I do not doubt that the people of Sydney will give a great deal more weight to her remarks when she is able to stand beside her colleagues the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese), the member for Watson (Mr McLeay) and perhaps the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) and sing the same song. At the moment we get Labor singing this completely opportunistic good guy, bad guy routine in which those close to Badgerys decry the airport as a monstrosity whereas those close to Kingsford Smith greet it with open arms as the answer to Sydney's aircraft problem. When the ALP actually gets its act together and can produce a consistent policy across the party as a whole, the people of Sydney will give a great deal more weight to the remarks of the member for Prospect on that subject.</para></talk.start><para>I rise tonight not on a subject inviting political opportunism and point scoring and not inviting massive internal consistencies in my own party's position. If we were to ask what is the single greatest failure of public policy across all governments since federationâwhat is that one issue in which we have done the least to serve generations where we have failed in our responsibility as national leadersâyou could argue that that issue would be the relations between indigenous Australians and the rest of the Australian community. Certainly that is a critical issue facing us at the moment. It is the squeaky wheel which is rightly attracting the oil.</para><para>In my view, in the long run the critical issue which we have failed to address is something of a sleeper, it is not a particular sexy issue and it does not grab the headlines. It just continues quietly to erode away at the 
 very basis of our quality of life and national ethic. I am talking about the question of how we provide for the retirement of older Australians over generations to come. As I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is nothing that grabs you about it instantaneously in the headlines, but I suggest to you that this issue of how we provide for Australians a sustainable retirement income is the most pressing issue of all of the many that we face as a nation.</para><para>It was The Who that produced their ode to the beatnik generation in the 1960s with the song <inline font-style="italic">My generation</inline> in which they sang the famous words `I hope I die before I grow old'. Regrettably, what we are findingâor perhaps not regrettablyâis that we are not dying as a community but living longer than any of those who preceded us. This is creating a challenge for us never before faced by any generation in history. In the post industrial world we have the phenomenon of the advent of retirement. Historically speaking, it is a brand new concept, brand spanking new; it would have been unknown to those of the century which preceded us. But it confronts us in a most arresting way.</para><para>In his book, <inline font-style="italic">Saving social security's dream</inline>, Bill Shipman addressed what he describes as the demographic tidal wave which is confronting the American peopleâthat is, the rapidly ageing population profile of that country and its inability to meet the costs of retirement of Americans. If you project out current expenditures about 10 or 20 years, you will find a nation which is quite literally bankrupt; it will be completely unable to meet the retirement income costs, the federal pensions, of those who will be calling upon them on current trends.</para><para>Similarly, in his book, <inline font-style="italic">The selfish generation</inline>, published just a few months ago, David Thompson looks at the New Zealand situation. Thompson highlights the capricious nature of the outcomes which flow from a lack of planning, a lack of foresight in relation to retirement income provisions. He says:</para><para>The prizes and penalties of living in a welfare state are distributed more on the basis of birth date than need, justice or desert. In New Zealand the big winners have been the "welfare generation"âthose born between 1920 and 1945. 
</para><para>What you see happening is an expectation in the community among a particular section born between a particular set of years that the government is going to provide for their retirement when the reality is, for those before them and, I have to confess, as a member of generation X, for those after them, there is really no prospect of government sponsored retirement income at anything like the levels which are currently being provided.</para><para>Australia's history in this regard is a sad one. Between 1913 and 1938 there were three separate attempts for Australia to introduce a retirement income scheme, an age pension scheme, that involved a compulsory participation in employment or earnings related retirement income. In 1938, the Lyons UAP government actually passed the enabling legislation, which was called the National Health and Pensions Insurance (Employees' Contributions) Act 1938 and the National Health and Pensions Insurance (Employers' Contributions) Act 1938. The onset of World War II deferred indefinitely the implementation of the scheme. It was not until the early 1970s when Gough Whitlam, I have to confess, initiated the Hancock inquiry into retirement income which subsequently resulted in the implementation of compulsory superannuation, largely under the direction of our colleague Ralph Willis.</para><para>I have to say that those successive failures represented one of the greatest omissions of all previous Australian governments. As fond as I am of quoting R.G. Menzies and, in particular, his remark that the art of politics is to persuade people to think in the long run, this is the one critical area in which his government continued to failâto persuade Australians to think in the long run of providing for their own retirement.</para><para>I want to look briefly at the three demographic drivers which are the engine behind the crisis we presently face. The first is the declining birth rate. In 1800, the birth rate per 1,000 was 36.6âor 4.3 kids per Australian woman. By 1900, that figure had fallen to 27.2 per 1,000 or 3.5 children. By 1950 it was three children. Today, in 1998, it is 1.8 children. </para><para>Next to that declining birth rate you have the phenomenon of increased life expectancyâsomething we all celebrate. In 1800, the life expectancy of the average Australian male was less than 50. By 1900 we had added five years to that life expectancy. By 1950 the figure had risen to an extraordinary 67.1. Today the figure is 75.2 for men and 81.5 for women. One girl in three born in Australia today can expect to live to the age of 100.</para><para>That is an extraordinary gift of life given by modern civilisation, but it presents us with this great problem. With a declining birth rate and a rapidly increasing life expectancy, how do we provide for Australians in the later years of their lives, particularly the economically less productive years of their lives when people are not paying taxes?</para><para>This is evidenced in the ratio of self-funded to government funded retirees. In 1950, 41.5 per cent were self-funded and 58.5 per cent were government funded. By 1997 that ratio was exactly halved, so you have less than 20 per cent of Australians fully self-funded retirees to over 80 per cent government funded retirees. How do we pay for that explosion in outlays? Primarily, it has been by increasing the proportion of social security expenditure in terms of total Commonwealth outlays. That proportion has more than doubled since 1950â18 per cent at that time to 38.8 per cent today.</para><para>So what you see is an absolute explosion of expenditure in meeting the pension costs of this rapidly ageing population. What are we going to do about it? I regard this as the single most pressing problem we face as a nation. Part of the challenge is the fact that it is not a problem that bangs on the door every day. It is not on the front page of the headlines; it is quietly happening behind the scenes. We have to have a sustained determined will of political leadership to do something about it. Generation X is patently being very badly treated by those generations which preceded us. There is currently about $5,000 of Commonwealth debt per head for every Australian born today. That does not include the $40 billion in unfunded Commonwealth superannuation liabilities.</para><para>This government is taking the first steps to fund Commonwealth super, but we have to take all of those other steps to really turn the ship around. It has to be turned around or else young Australians will be born into an environment which is completely unsustainable and they will spend the rest of their lives paying off the debts of previous generations. We have to stop the rot, and we have to stop it now. Our government has to be the government which does persuade Australians to take the long-term view.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aged Care Costs</title><title>Pharmaceutical Benefits</title><page.no>93</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>93</page.no><name role="metadata">Lee, Michael, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LEE</name><name.id>MG4</name.id><electorate>Dobell</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr Deputy Speaker, tonight I wish to grieve over a number of matters, but I thought you would be particularly interested in a letter I received from a constituent from Berkeley Vale in my electorate.

It first came to my attention when two families in my electorateâI state for the benefit of the parliamentary secretary that neither one of them is a member of a branch within my partyâcame to see me to let me know about a change which was to be made to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme that would affect them severely.</para><para>They came to see me just before 1 February. They advised me that they had become aware about two days before they saw me that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee had made a decision to take a food supplement called Neocate off the pharmaceutical benefits scheme for infants over the age of two. Both of my constituentsâone from Tumbi Umbi and the other from Killarney Valeâhave boys who are 2Â½ years old. Both of these boys, unfortunately, have a very severe food allergy. One of the sons could eat only Neocate or boiled rice. The specialists for children who suffer these very severe food allergies insist that every now and again their parents take them off Neocate and try them on boiled rice, potato and other simple foods they hope the children will become used to eventually. The parents and the children go through an enormous amount of stress as they try to make sure that the children become eventually able to eat a greater range of foods without having allergic reactions.</para><para>These two families in my electorate came to see me because they cannot, on the advice of their specialists, allow their children to eat 
 anything but Neocate and boiled rice.

That decision was made in November and took effect from 1 February. It meant that for these two families in my electorate, for example, the cost of Neocateâthis is for infants 2Â½ years old who cannot eat anything but Neocate or boiled riceâwas to increase from $3.20 a month to $1,380 a month. Members can understand the distress that this was causing these families in my electorate with such a massive impost being placed on their basic cost of living, not to mention the enormous stress that these two boys' disability was already causing the families.</para><para>I understand that only a very small number of children were affected by this decision.

It must have been a pretty hard-hearted person who would have made the decision, even if they thought it would affect only 20 families throughout Australia. It would have meant that those 20 families would face an increase of $1,380 in the cost of food which these young children need just to survive. It is pretty hard to believe.</para></talk.start></continue><para>When this first came to my attention, we spoke to various people in the department. The best they could tell us was that the decision may be reviewed at a future meeting some time in March. Obviously, we did not hold out very much hope at all that there would be any reconsideration of this decision.</para><para>I am pleased to say that as soon as this appeared in one of the major metropolitan dailies, and all the basic television networks developed an immediate interest in this matter, the parliamentary secretary took action to have that decision overturned, which I have already welcomed. It makes me worry that there may be other decisions that are being made by PBAC or other decisions that are not being scrutinised by the parliamentary secretary or the minister. I hope that they have now instituted a change in policies within the department of health to ensure that any decision that could have such a serious effect on individual families requires ministerial approval or at least parliamentary secretary approval.</para><para>At the end of the day, people are responsible to the Australian people through this parliament. I hope that bureaucrats are told that decisions of this importance cannot be delegated to them. They should not be delegated to them, unless they are prepared to write minutes to ministers and parliamentary secretaries to ensure that someone who sits in this chamber or the Senate takes responsibility for decisions that can basically cause so much distress and turmoil for individual families. I am sure that, if the parliamentary secretary's 
 approval was needed for that decision, she would never have given approval for that particular decision to go ahead. I hope the minister for health would not have put his name to a minute that recommended families be hit in such a manner.</para><para>The two families in my electorate can quite rightly claim credit not only for ensuring that a decision that affected them unfairly was overturned but also for having had this decision overturned, an action which benefits all of the children right around Australia who suffer from this severe food allergy. We can only hope that in time the two boys of the two families that contacted my office overcome their food allergy.</para><para>I know there are some suggestions that there are some families who might be using Neocate when it is not absolutely essential. I am sure the government could put in place some form of authority system that ensures doctors are granted permission to prescribe Neocate only when it is essential. But I think the minister understands that the two cases we raised did involve two boys who could eat nothing but Neocate and boiled rice, which is a pretty difficult circumstance for anyone. For those reasons, I wanted to raise that tonight in grievance. I ask that the minister tries to ensure that such an outrage never occurs again.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regional Infrastructure Funding </title><page.no>95</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>95</page.no><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name><name.id>KV5</name.id><electorate>Hinkler</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI recognise that we live in an era of economic rationalism. I realise that we must learn to live on a level playing field. I accept that governments must not distort regional economies with the  stop-start measures that characterised the previous government. But my grievance today is with the growing perception in some sections of business and the bureaucracy that government should not fund major regional infrastructure projects; I refer particularly to water projects. I do not accept nor have I ever accepted this proposition. While it might be argued that assistance to an individual industry at the expense of another industry can be distortion, that is not the case when 60,000 or more residents require a degree of certainty in the production of a crop which not only sustains the local economy but 
 also provides a substantial contribution to export earning.</para></talk.start><para>I repeat the philosophy that I have frequently espoused here and abroad that it is inequitable to ask one group of farmers in one generation growing one particular crop to pay for a major water storage which might conceivably provide subsequent generations of farmers for up to 100 years or more growing totally different crops with certainty in water. I repeat the long held view that major dams should be seen as national assets. It is reasonable to ask farmers to contribute to reticulation and to make a reasonable contribution to the cost of the water, but not to have to cover the full capital cost of the basic head works infrastructure.</para><para>Against this background, let me now paint a picture of my district, one of Queensland's leading sugar producing areas. The area has been growing sugar cane for nearly 120 years. It has grappled with issues such as the Kanaka exploitation and it has come through. It learnt 100 years ago that the treatment of fellow human beings in this way was unacceptable and that field work, tough and all as it was, had to pay its way commercially. The era of the cane cutter emerged and this was etched into the Australian psyche. It then survived through two world wars, drought and depression.</para><para>In the early 1960s Bundaberg pioneered the cane harvester, and a new era of world leading technology emergedâa technology which is now exported to the world by the largest cane harvester manufacturer, Austoft, based in Bundaberg. The romance is enhanced by the saga of Bundaberg Rum, the great Aussie spirit, which is Bundaberg sugar's leading by-product. It is now Australia's leading spirit label. Then there is an export port with a bulk sugar terminal, a foundry making sugar milling equipment, much of it for export, and there is more. At the growing end of the equation, a Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations facility leads with world's best practice in the development of new high yield, pest resistant cane varieties. Well you might ask: why this history lesson and why this product profile?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">CADMAN</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>âIt's a great electorate, that's why.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>âNo, it is a bit more than that, Parliamentary Secretary. Let me say to you, to Deputy Speaker Andrews and to all those present tonight that this sugar industry and an emerging fruit and vegetable industry is now at serious risk. I do not want to dramatise it; I just want to spell out the facts. Bundaberg's major water storage is Lake Monduran. It is currently at five per cent of capacity. If you can consider a dam 1.1 times the size of Sydney Harbour that is nearly empty, you get some idea of the gravity of the situation. What this means is that sugar production next season alone will be down 30 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In 1970, after exhaustive studies and a superb information campaign, state and federal authoritiesâand it was not normally federal practice in those days, but they accepted the quality of the schemeâalong with 1,200 farmers funded what was known as the Burnett Kolan scheme, now known as the Bundaberg irrigation scheme. It was premised on two major water storages: one at Lake Monduran, now known as the Fred Haigh Dam, and another one at a place called Kaliwa, on the Burnett River. It has now become an urgent requirement. But yet again you might ask, `Isn't this just another group of farmers that are having a whinge and want a bit more water?' No, it is much more than that. It is the key to the retention of all that infrastructure I have just spoken about and the secondary and tertiary industries that flow from it.</para><para>But it goes further than that. This particular sugar industryâjust the Bundaberg-Childers section of it; I am not talking about the whole Queensland coastâcontributes significantly to our export effort. In 1997, four sugar mills at Bundaberg and Childers grew 4,500,0000 tonnes of cane which produced 667,000 tonnes of sugar worth $230 million. Based on 85 per cent of this going to export, the export task alone was $185 million, to say nothing of the domestic effortârum and harvester sales, engineering and the like.</para><para>The Bundaberg irrigation scheme was planned on the basis of six megalitres of 
 water per hectare. Revised estimates recommend 7.8 megalitres. However, in 1996 only four megalitres were available. This year just gone, 1997, it was down to 3.4 megalitres. To give you an idea of the gravity of the situation, at this five per cent of dam capacity, only 1.3 megalitres will be available. That will mean a loss of production of 30 per cent. I do not need to tell you how that would affect the district, the City of Bundaberg and the surrounding shires. The effect would be quite profound.</para><para>This will impact on the district that now has Australia's worst unemployment, even worse than western Sydney. The Wide Bay-Burnett area now has an unemployment level of 16.6 per cent, so you can imagine the effect that this lack of water is going to have on top of that.</para><para>Again you may ask: have these farmers been a bit profligate in the use in their water? Have they just been pouring it on and now we have come to tough times and they are to blame? Again the answer is a firm no. Judicious use of water has been achieved over many years. They have converted, in most instances, to green cane harvesting and trash blanketing, where you cover the ground with a trash blanket to keep the moisture in. There has been water scheduling, the use of scanners and probes, trickle irrigation and best practice flood irrigation. All these things have been done to the point where those measures alone have lifted the production from 8.3 tonnes per megalitre to 11.4 tonnes per megalitre. Those of you who have been associated with the land will know what a good result this is. So it is not as if people want more water just for the sake of it; a huge effort has been made to get world's best practice at the same time. To lift the volume of water from the 4.5 mega litres that were available even in reasonably good times to 7.8 megalitres could bring the yield per hectare to 116 tonnes of cane. This new dam that has been proposed at a site very close to Kaliwa known as Paradiseâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">CADMAN</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>âI told you that it was a good electorate.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>KV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Neville, Paul, MP</name><name role="display">Mr NEVILLE</name></talker><para>âYes, it is a good electorate. Come to Paradise. A dam there costing 
 about $150 million would deliver 203,000 megalitres of water. Add that to the existing water and you can see what effect that might have for that district and for Australia. I will not go into too many figures. It will create 2.2 million tonnes of cane on existing land and 2.7 on new landâjust under five million tonnes of extra cane. That translates into 711,000 tonnes of sugar. The return is $250 million, which comes down to about $215 million of exports. Add that to the $185 million I spoke of earlier and you have $400 million coming out of one district. You only have to look at our trade figures released this week to know what a significant contribution that could make.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The point I am making is that 60,000 people and a lot of secondary and tertiary industries depend on this crop. There is a desperate need for water. Unemployment is highâthe worst in Australia. I appeal to the federal government, as we emerge from our current deficit problems, to look very seriously at getting back into the business of water storage, not just for the profligate use of water but for areas where industries have demonstrated that they can use this important commodity effectively.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Andrews)</name></talker><para>âOrder!

The then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the then shadow minister who is now the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) both said before the election that, if you are dismissed unfairly, you should have a right of appealâsaid without qualification. They explicitly said, `There will not be such exemptions,' but now they are breaking that promise in a way that is very unfair.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why when the report that triggered this government proposal did not recommend this course of action? A major report into the needs of small business was trumpeted. It recommended some good things, but it did not recommend an unfair dismissal exemption for small business. It said there should be a review of it in about 12 months time, which would be getting on towards now, but it did not recommend an unfair dismissal exemption for small business.</para><para>The government got the report, clearly felt that its response did not have much political oomph, so decided it needed to add some. So it delved back into its box of political tricks and said, `This trick worked pretty well in 1995. We had a great campaign about unfair dismissals in 1995. Let's try it again.' Political historyânot just political history but military history and all sorts of historyâis littered with people trying to revisit their former glories: `I had a great victory three years ago. Let's see if we can do it all again when the circumstances are entirely different.' They thought, `We can create another unfair dismissal campaign,' and `I'âthe Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Businessâ`might just, as an aside, advance my leadership aspirations over those of the Treasurer because I can be a hero to the back bench again, leading the assault against unfair dismissals, and perhaps nobody will notice that I promised before the election that we 
 wouldn't do it. Perhaps nobody will notice that the Prime Minister promised before the election that we wouldn't do it.'</para><para>That is the genesis of this, but now we have a second stage. We now have this back as one of four potential double dissolution triggers. Why have we got it back in that form? Because the government want to mask their desire to have a double dissolution election about Wik. They want to create three other apparent causes and catalysts of any double dissolution so that they can say, `No, this is not just an election about race; this is an election about these four very fundamental issues,' when we all know, and every Australian who is studying the events knows, that the government is deliberately setting out on a course to have a double dissolution about Wik and this is designed to disguise that stark, unpleasant, unpalatable reality.	That is why we are now having this second debate about a bill which should never have been here the first time.</para><para>We do not want to have a double dissolution on this bill, for two reasons. Firstly, it gives this mask to the stark reality of the government's plans with regard to Wik and, secondly, there is the too awful to contemplate possibility that if, heaven forbid, this government were re-elected they might be able to pass this bill in its entirety at a joint sitting. The difficulty for us is there is not much room to compromise on this bill: this is something you are for or against. There are not many graduations and there is not much fine print on Wik. There have been lots of amendmentsâa very substantial amount of compromiseâwhich the government have deliberately rejected. Here there is not much room to compromise. You either think that people have a right to an appeal or you do not. You cannot say, `We will give them back half the right,' or, `They will have three-quarters of the right.' They have either got the right to appeal or they have not.</para><para>So, notwithstanding that political analysis, notwithstanding that it is arguably perhaps not even in our political interest to do it, we continue to oppose this legislation for one simple reason: it is wrong. This government's legislation says that people can be sacked 
 even if that is harsh, unjust or unreasonable. What this government is saying, and wants us to agree to, is that the objective circumstances can be that your dismissal is harsh, unjust or unreasonable, and we are supposed to say, `But it doesn't matter.' People in Australia today have the right of appeal in those circumstances. Law-abiding, tax paying Australian working people currently have a right of appeal in those circumstances, and the government thinks we might come in here in fear of a double dissolution and say that we agree to taking that right away from them, that they should not have it.</para><para>Why have people got that right? We will get trumpeted all this stuff about Labor's unfair dismissal laws and how difficult they were for job creation in small business. I want, if I get time, to say something about the accuracy or otherwise of those reports. But it does not matter if it was true in 1995; we are dealing here with the amendments to the government's laws, to John Howard's law, to Peter Reith's lawâto the law which they said is a fair go all round, that swept away the old laws and put in place a fair go all round. If it was a fair go all round in 1996 when the government passed it, why isn't it a fair go all round now? They stood up and trumpeted that this was a major reform which was fair and balanced in the interests of employers and employees. They said that less than 12 months before they introduced this bill to say, `We thought it was a fair go all round in 1996 but now it is not. It is a fair go part way round. It is a fair go unless you work for small business. It is a fair go unless you happen to be an employee of an enterprise that employs fewer than 15 people.'</para><para>I do not think Australians ever thought that that concept of a fair go, which is a pretty traditional Australian concept, was something that was an optional extra that we give to some and take away from others. A fair go is not something for the government to hand out and say, `Well, we will redistribute a fair go, and we will give all of it to you here and none of it to you there.' Australians think that if something is a fair go then everybody ought to have it, not just some. There will be a growing number of people, employees of 
 small business, whose dismissal is demonstrably harsh, unjust or unreasonable who will have no remedy, no right of appeal. If that happens to you today, you have a right of appeal. If this bill passes, that right will be taken away. What an achievement. I am sure they are all very proud it. I am sure they are going around the electorate telling all their constituents, `I've just done something wonderful. I've taken a basic right of yours away. Why? Because I thought there might be a vote in it.' What an achievement. These are the rights of what will become hundreds of thousands of Australians, rights they have, rights this parliament gave them, rights this government gave them less them 18 months ago, and now they are saying that these rights only belong to some people.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">CADMAN</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>âYou keep saying that, but it is wrong.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name></talker><para>âIt is absolutely right, and you know it is right, or you should.

The government continues to pretend that there is protection because the law protects people from being discriminated against. That is the explanation of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, and his parliamentary secretary, poor little pathetic thing that he is, is parroting that argument. I tell you that that does not protect anybody from being dismissed if it is harsh, unjust or unreasonableâthere is zero protection. What it says to a young woman is this: if you are dismissed on discriminatory grounds because you are a woman, you have got a right of appeal. That is true.

Let me give you some other examples. There are plenty around. A woman was dismissed because the employer said, `A condition of your employment is that you have to enter 
 into this arrangement which is a rip-off of the tax system.' She said no and she was dismissed. She was reinstated under the old law; she would have no right of appeal under this. A worker was told by his employer to sack a pregnant subordinate. He said, `No, this is a most unreasonable thing you are asking me to do and I will not do it,' and he was sacked. He was reinstated under the old law; under the new one he would have no right of appeal. There was an employee about whom it was found, when there was a hearing, that the allegation under which they had been dismissed was entirely unsubstantiated. They took an appeal and they were reinstated; they would have had no right of appeal under this law. We had an employee who was dismissed when his wife told a boss that he was off sick and he had cancer. He would have no right of appeal under this.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">CADMAN</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>âOh, come on.

There was the employee who was dismissed because he refused to certify that an unroadworthy vehicle was roadworthy. He said, `No, that is not right. That car is not roadworthy,' and he was dismissed. The parliamentary secretary keeps saying that they have other avenues, and that is not true, unless he means the common law, unless we are going back to the 19th century. So what we have got to do is get lawyers and go to the courts, because there is no other provision for appeal for people who work for small business if they are dismissed in circumstances that are harsh, unreasonable or unfair.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If there is another right, what is the principal provision in there for, and what was the problem in 1995? If, irrespective of the laws we introduced in 1995, everybody had other rights of appeal, where was the problem? Of course they do not. It is just a travesty that someone could come in here purporting to represent the government on the front bench and pretend, contrary to the facts, that there are other avenues, because not even the minister has ever pretended.</para><para>There is no other right of appeal here. It has been granted and it was given in legislation introduced by the previous government. 
 Continued and confirmed. Not exactly in the way we would like, but that is beside the point. This new system of giving people a so-called fair go all round was passed by this parliament, and that right has been taken away. For hundreds of thousands of workers, it is the plain fact of the case. Employees can be dismissed for the worst of reasonsâfor the most harsh and unreasonable of reasonsâbut if they are given four weeks notice it is all okay. We do not think that is a fair go all round. I do not think Australians will think it is a fair go all round, and trying to pretend, contrary to the facts, that there is some alternative will not help. It will simply expose the weakness of the case. If you have to make up a defence, it means the real one is not very strong.</para><para>This is something that goes to the very core of the lives of thousands of Australians and the households that depend on them. Australian families fundamentally depend on the job that the principal breadwinner has. Sometimes now, in more and more families, there are two breadwinners but in most of them one is a predominant breadwinner. The gender of that predominant breadwinner is now not so apparentâit varies among householdsâbut that predominant breadwinner is the core of the economic and social fabric of most Australian families. The security they have in their job is fundamental to the security they have as a family, and it is not something that should be meddled with. It is a very sad thing that this parliament is being asked to do and, as seriously as we have contemplated the options here, at the end of the day we cannot do this. Even this government promised that these are rights that employees should have. They made it absolutely clear that they felt at the last election that this was a very reasonable right for them to have.</para><para>On 20 February 1996, before the election, the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business said that the redrafted system of unfair dismissals would not contain any exemptions. It would not contain those exemptions, he said. That was almost two years ago. I suppose the Australian worker should have guessed it was not a core promise, but we did not know about this distinction be 
 tween core and non-core promises at the time and we thought they meant it. On 28 February 1996 the minister said:</para><para>Look, our position is very clear. If you have been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal.</para><para>I looked and I turned it upside down. Where are the parentheses that say `unless you work for a small business'? It is not there. It was never said. If that is not authority enough, because it is only the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and perhaps his word is not very well worth taking, let us look at the then Leader of the Oppositionâthe now Prime Minister, who said:</para><para>I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee.</para><para>Do you want to hear that again:</para><para>I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hardworking employee.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8I4</name.id><name role="metadata">MARTIN</name><name role="display">Mr Martin</name></talker><para>âWho said that?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name></talker><para>âThat was the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, and it must be true because he said it to John Laws. We did not realise that in parentheses we should have read `unless that capricious employer employs fewer than 15 employees'. We know that most employers are not capricious, but we know that some are. If there were none, we would not have had the successful cases of the type that I just read to the House, and there are many. Most employers are not like that. As with most employees, most employers are decent, hardworking Australians trying to get on with their jobs and trying to create jobs for others. This law is about the others. Most laws are about the othersâabout the few who do not act reasonably. That is why we have laws: to regulate such people. I thought perhaps the now Prime Minister was caught off guard and that he meant to say something more qualified. But he said to Keith Conlon:</para></talk.start></continue><para>I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it with a law that's fair to both sides so that if you are doing your job properly you can't be capriciously dismissed. 
</para><para>That is two goes, but they were both talkback radio and perhaps you do not measure your words as carefully as you might on talkback radioâalthough you would have thought a leader of a party who has been in federal politics for 20-odd years would probably do that. I thought, `We have got to get to something more substantial and more researched.' So I went to his headland speeches. They were pretty serious stuff. He wrote them all out and distributed them to everybody, and I guess he meant us to take them seriously, or we thought so at the time. He said:</para><para>Let me make a hard and fast commitment that when we win government we will ensure that Australia has a balanced unfair dismissal provision which is fair to both employers and employees. We won't tolerate unreasonable dismissals.</para><para>Where in all that should the Australian worker have believed that it meant `unless you work for some small business'? Where was the qualification to the very fine articulation of principle with which I have no quibble? We did have some quibble about the way the government went about it, but the government won in the parliament and their system is in place. The principles that the now Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and the now Prime Minister articulated are fine principles, and we still support them. It is a pity that they did not mean them when they said them. It is a blatant breach of a promise. Any worker would have been entitled to think thatâstated five times that I have quoted, and there are more if you want to go and look for themâthis might have been a core promise.</para><para>`Okay,' you say, `it's just the Labor Party going on about the concern that this government is being unfair to workers. What about the employers?' The thing about this bill, and all such discriminatory bills, is that it is unfair to the decent employers as well because they have to compete with people who can now get away with the shonky practices. Most of the employers are decent employers. They never get caught up in this system. They do not have this problem. They have their staff with them for a long time. We all know workplaces like that in our own electorates. There are tens, dozensâhundreds of them. I suspect we all know because we see in our 
 electorate offices the people who suffer from the small number who are not in that category. Why should those decent employers who do the right things have to compete with the shonky operators? It is typical of what happens when you allow free play for the unreasonable few: they get an unfair advantage over the reasonable majority.</para><para>The last point I want to make goes to this question of whether this social price that I think is serious for many individuals and many families justified by the leap in employment will take place if we see this change. If there were going to be a great leap in employment, everybody would have to contemplate whether it was a price worth paying. You then get a cost-benefit analysis. It is a high price for some individuals but perhaps worth paying. But we can effectively measure that, because the government said that the previous unfair dismissal laws were really bad for business and they cost lots of jobs. They said at the time that the previous unfair dismissal laws were holding back enthusiastic employers from taking on workers because they were deterred by the unfair dismissal laws. In surveys taken, Recruitment Solutions said that 90 per cent of employers were not affected in their employment decisions by the existence of unfair dismissal laws, and Morgan and Banks said that at least 80 per cent of small businesses did not believe the existence of the unfair dismissal law adversely affected their decisions to employ new staff. The figure of 90 per cent is pretty highâyou would like it to be 100âbut of course it must be higher now because those surveys were taken under the previous government's laws, under the so-called Brereton laws. If you think your laws are so much better, then it must be more than 90 per cent now.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SD4</name.id><name role="metadata">CADMAN</name><name role="display">Mr Cadman</name></talker><para>âYou know the result of the Yellow Pages survey.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name></talker><para>âYes.

The history is that there was no leap in employment when they were changed last time. The one state unqualified by state complication to the operation of the changed unfair dismissal laws is Victoria because there is no competing state system. Coincidental with the change of unfair dismissal laws, the rate of employment fell.</para><para>I do not argue cause and effect. I think it shows there was no leap. There was no suppressed enthusiasm for employment which burst forth when the previous unfair dismissal laws went. Nobody saw it anywhere in Australia. So we have not had that leap in employment, yet we have a proposed exemption which is blatantly inconsistent with the government's pre-election guarantees. That will only add to the prevailing sense of job insecurity, which does not distinguish between unfair dismissal claims on the basis of their merit, merely on the coincidence of your employment contract, which is fundamentally unfair to employees and to decent employers.</para><para>Australians today have what the Prime Minister promised they would haveânot exactly what we wanted them to have but what the Prime Minister promised they would haveâand that is the right of appeal if they are unfairly dismissed. We do not believe that right should be taken away from them, so notwithstanding the political context which I outlined at the beginning we will continue to oppose this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>104</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am pleased to have the opportunity tonight to be

Only those employees who are hired after the commencement of this bill will be affected and the proposed law will not affect employees' rights in unlawful dismissal.

 clear policy commitment to small business to further reform the federal termination laws. This is what small business wanted from the Howard governmentâand this is what the Howard government is going to deliver to small businesses and their workers. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 was introduced on 23 May and was enacted into law, with amendments, on 31 December. The changes contained within this bill are necessary to ensure the continuing growth of employment in the small business area.</para><para>This is not an attack on workers. This is a positive initiative to allow small businesses to employ more employees with certainty and confidence. The present uncertainty that prevails throughout the small business industry over concerns about unfair dismissal cases is a hindrance to those seeking work. The changes contained within this bill are consistent with the government's stated policyâa policy which we took to the election, a policy which we fully announced prior to the last election and a policy which was endorsed overwhelmingly by the Australian community.</para><para>This bill reflects the special burdens that are carried by small business in defending unfair dismissal claims. Most small businesses do not have the time nor the resources to defend extensive unfair dismissal cases. In many cases, small businesses are owner operatedâhusband and wife or family businesses employing one, two or three employees. They do not have the resources of larger companiesâpersonnel managers, barristers, qualified industrial relations peopleâto deal with unfair dismissal claims.</para><para>I know, speaking from experience as a small business operator, the concerns that one has when putting on new employees. My last business was a small general store and service station operating successfully on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Whilst only being a small business, we employed 12 casual people from our local communityâand that was providing considerable work in our small village. When faced with the possibility of putting someone else on, it was always a concern of mine that I could be faced with an unfair dismissal case. In fact, there were many 
 times in our business when I needed to put additional employees on and I did not do so simply because of those concerns; instead, we battled on with the people we had and did the extra work ourselves rather than put an extra person on the books.</para><para>There has been much discussion in the national media over recent times about the possibility of a double dissolution. I noticed that the member for Canberra seemed to raise some sort of political analogy today that this was basically a smokescreenâthat the government did not really want us to notice that we wanted to go to a double dissolution on the Wik legislation, on sensible land management for all Australians, and that this was just going to be a cover that we were trying to slip through.</para><para>The unfair dismissal amendments are important to the people of Australia, they are important to small business and they are important to the people who want work. Most importantly, they are important to this government. We are determined to see these amendments put back to the parliament; put back to the Senate. We do not want to go to a double dissolution on this issue, but we certainly are determined to get these amendments through.</para><para>If this </para><para>	 Workplace Relations Amendment Bill</para><para>is rejected by the Senate again, it will be the first trigger for a double dissolution. The government, in reintroducing the bill, as I said before, does not want an election over this issue. It wants to see this problem rectified for small business and for those who are seeking work with small businesses.</para><para>The message from small business organisations throughout Australia is loud and clear. When the bill was reintroduced into the chamber last session by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, he quoted Rob Bastian of the Council for Small Business Organisations as saying that small business would be able to create an extra 50,000 jobs if this bill goes through the Senate. The Chief Executive of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce said that for the opposition to claim that there was not independent research proving business concerns over this issue is nonsense. It shows just how little attention they have paid to the 
 needs and concerns of the small business community.</para><para>The government commissioned its own research through the Yellow Pages Small Business Survey which, of course, is the largest economic survey of small businesses in Australia and covers some 1,200 small businesses. Seventy-nine per cent of proprietors of small businesses said that they would be better off if exempted from unfair dismissal laws; 33 per cent of those small businesses said that they would be more likely to recruit new employees had there been an exemption in 1996 and 1997; and 38 per cent of small businesses said that they would be more likely to recruit new employees if they were exempted from the current unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>The passage of this bill has the support of many small business organisations including COSBOA, the Federal Federation of Business and Professional Women, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Business Chamber, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Tasmanian Small Business Round Table and the micro-business consultative group. Of course it has the support of small business groups, because they want to get on with the job and they want to employ more people. The message is coming through loud and clear from small business: allow this bill to go through and allow them to employ more Australians.</para><para>The Labor Party and the Democrats claim that they are concerned about unemployment in this country. Yet they are the ones who presided over one million unemployed in Australia and took unemployment to over 11 per cent in this countryâsomething that they very conveniently forget and hope that the Australian community will forget. It is something that I am going to ensure they do not forget about, because we do not want to go back to that situation again.</para><para>Now they are actively seeking to stop the passage of this legislation which will help small business employ more people and reduce unemployment levels. The trend unemployment in Australia now is 8.1 per 
 cent. It is still very serious. It is still a major issue. It is something that we are working to address, but it is the lowest unemployment rate that we have had in this country for seven years. We never hear that coming from the opposition. We never hear them say that we are doing something about unemployment. It is something that they were not able to do.</para><para>It is hypocritical for the Labor Party and the Democrats to block this bill. My electorate of Robertson is made up of thousands of small businessesâfamily businesses and partnerships all employing under 15 employees and all looking to expand. The government has created an investment environment for small business that we have not seen in this country for decades. We certainly did not see it under 13 years of Labor. We have record low inflation and record low interest rates. Businesses want to get on with the job of expanding, producing, exporting and, most importantly, employing Australians.</para><para>I hope the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill is passed through the Senate. I appeal to senators, to the Democrats and to Senator Brian Harradine, in particular, to reconsider their opposition to this bill. This bill is not an attack on workers. This bill supports workers. It allows small business to escape from the fear of unfair dismissal claims and allows them to increase their employment. It is absolutely critical to small business that this legislation be passed through the Senate because this legislation, once and for all, will mean an end to Laurie Brereton's job destroying unfair dismissal legislation for small businesses employing less than 50 people.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8I4</name.id><name role="metadata">MARTIN</name><name role="display">Mr Martin</name></talker><para>âWhat a farce.

It is hardly on the sheet as far as most businesses are concerned. The government have done what they needed to do. Anyone who has had experience in industrial relations will know that this measure is arbitrary, uncalled for, unfair and unnecessary. I am not going to grace it frankly with any further comments, other than to say I intend to vote against it.</para><para>I must express my disappointment and concern at those comments by Senator Harradine. I simply want to say to Senator Harradine that he is wrong. This bill is high priority. This bill is needed by small business. This bill is wanted by small business, and this bill is needed by the workers of Australia, particularly those who are unemployed and who wish to become meaningfully employed by small businesses in this country. I believe Senator Harradine is a fair minded man who looks at the issue and weighs up the issues. Again, I appeal to him to have another look at the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill with a view to passing it.</para><para>It is important to make very clear once again, particularly for the member for Canberra, the difference between unfair dismissal and unlawful dismissal. The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill will amend parts of the act to enable small businesses employing no less than 15 workers to be exempt from the provisions for unfair dismissal. Unfair dismissal refers to the situation where the employer's conduct in bringing the employment relationship to an end can be characterised as harsh, unjust or unreasonableâwhich is certainly in contrast to unlawful dismissal. It is very clear that it is unlawful to dismiss workers for the reasons that I mentioned earlier. I know that it is wished that I

The first is that what people have to understandâwhether they are in small business or whether they are out there listening to the debate in this parliament tonightâis that the laws proposed to be amended by this piece of legislation have nothing to do with Paul Keating, Laurie Brereton or Kim Beazley; they are the laws of Peter Reith and John Howard that were introduced and passed through this parliament in 1996.	 It was the law that came into being in Australia to govern people under industrial awards at the federal level that is operational in Australia from December 1996. All of this talk about Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal laws and that this is sweeping away the remnants of that is absolute nonsense. With the passage of the Workplace Relations Act in 1996, Laurie Brereton's laws as they were under industrial relations have gone. This government knows that is the case.</para></talk.start><para>The member for Robertson, probably under instructions from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), who is the great master of disinformation in this place and in the broad community, constantly says to people that these are Laurie Brereton's laws that we have to change because he has left us this remnant of unfair dismissal and it is all at Laurie Brereton's feet. Quite clearly it is not. If it is at anybody's feet, it is at the feet of Peter Reith, the minister for workplace relations, because it was Minister Reith who introduced the legislation into this place. As was pointed out by my colleague the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), in the lead-up to the 1996 election along with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) he flatly ruled out any changes to unfair dismissal as far as small business was concerned. He flatly ruled it out.</para><para>The member for Canberra read a couple of quotes. Peter Reith on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Daybreak</inline> of 28 February 1996 said:</para><para>Look, our position's very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right of appeal . . .</para><para>On the John Laws show on 23 January 1996, the Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, said:</para><para>. . . I'm not going to have a law where an unreasonable employer can capriciously sack a decent, hard-working employee.</para><para>Again, John Howard in an interview with Keith Conlon on ABC Radio on 25 January 1996 said:</para><para>I'm not going to make it open slather. I'm going to replace it with a law that's fair to both sides so that if you are doing your job properly you can't be capriciously dismissed.</para><para>As the member for Canberra asked, where did they say that there are exemptions from unfair dismissal for small business? Where specifically did small business get singled out?</para><para>It is important again to put a few facts on the record about small business. The member for Robertson mentioned that most small businesses are micro businesses. That is right; about 50 per cent of small businesses are micro businessesâhusband and wife operations, single persons working from home. As a consequence, they do not employ anyone. If 50 per cent of small businesses in Australia do notâ</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Cadman interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8I4</name.id><name role="metadata">Martin, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN</name></talker><para>âIf the parliamentary secretary would only listen. I said that if they are a husband and wife not employing anyone, or if they are a micro business of one person not employing anyone, why would they be subject to these unfair dismissal laws? Are they going to sack themselves? The only laws that a husband and wife might come up against if they had a disagreement would not be in the Industrial Relations Court but in the Family Court. That is where they would sort out any problems on small business or unfair dismissal or any other issues.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other factor that is important when you start to talk about small businesses is that this law that operates in Australia today operates only in respect of people covered under federal awardsâexcept for Victoria, where they ceded their industrial relations power to the Commonwealth government, and I note 
 that South Australia is thinking about doing the same thing. For the moment, only people covered under federal awards and all employees in Victoria are potentially covered by the Workplace Relations Act that is operational in Australia and covers industrial relations.</para><para>If you took a genuine poll and saw genuine statistics from the Industrial Relations Commission, you would see that the workload of the commission under the existing legislationâthe government's own legislationâis falling because the number of complaints registered for unfair dismissal is dropping off. That is a consequence of who is covered under the law. That is the second great bit of disinformation which the minister often puts out in the community. He says that everybody is picked up in Australia. Everyone is not picked up in Australia. You are picked up only if you are covered by federal awards or if you are a Victorian employee.</para><para>The other thing that is important in all of this is the nonsense that small business will hire only if they feel that they have the right to dismiss people. As I understand itâperhaps the parliamentary secretary will clarify the point if he is going to sum up on this bill, if not tonight then certainly tomorrowâit is written in the existing legislation that at the moment there is a three-month period of grace in which an employer can work out if their employee is up to the mark. If not, they can have separation and are not subject to unfair dismissal claims.</para><para>To my friend the member for Robertson who has come back into the chamber and who previously talked about his former life in a general store at a service station: I wonder whether he, as a former employer, when he sat down and worried about whether to put anyone on on a permanent basis or as another one of those 12 casuals he talked about, stopped to think that under his own legislationâthe legislation of this governmentâhe could put somebody on and if that person did not work out within three months that person could be let go, and there would be no claim on him as an employer. Did he ever stop to think that that would be the case?</para><para>I wonder what sort of an employer he would be if in the period of that three months 
 he could not work out whether somebody he had put on the payroll was going to work outâwhether that person he put on was able to pump the gas, pump up the tyres, look after the general store and do all the sort of work that somebody would have to do in that particular role. If he could not work it out after three months, he must not be much of a manager. That is all I can say.</para><para>I say to the honourable member for RobertsonâI am sure he is contemplating his future after the next election and will perhaps go back to the service stationâthat he would want to have a look at the proposals that his mate Minister Reith is putting forward in respect of changes to the Trade Practices Act, because his service station misses out on all the benefits of this so-called fair deal, raw deal, that the government has put up. He would want to have a look at that very carefully. Mr Deputy Speaker, I digressed for half a moment because I thought it was important given that he had come back into the place, and after the preselection of Senator Neal to run against him at the next election he should be looking for a new job.</para><para>I again come back to the bill and the changes. Why is it that the government decided once again to bring back into this place a change which they do not need and a change which their own committees examined and recommended against changing? I take people's memories back to when the Prime Minister, having won government in 1996, decided to seek a way in which to honour some of the commitments and promises he had made to the small business constituency. One they had said they were going to look at was ways to reduce the burden of red tape, reduce the compliance costs on small business. They had given a commitment that within three years the compliance costs would be cut by 50 per cent. So the Prime Minister said, `I know what I will doâwhen in doubt, form a committee.' So he did. He asked Charlie Bell, who was the Managing Director of McDonald's Australia, to form a committee to have a look at red tape. He brought down a report on that particular issue.</para><para>Interestingly enough, in that inquiry Mr Bell actually said to the Prime Minister and 
 the government, `You have only just brought in changes to the industrial relations system in Australia. You have only just brought in your own industrial relations legislation that has absolutely swept away anything Labor had in place.' He recommended that there be no changes to the Workplace Relations Act for a minimum period of 12 months until it had time to settle down. He specifically said in terms of small business, which he was examining, that unfair dismissal as part of that should be left to settle down.</para><para>The Prime Minister was not happy about that. When he brought his recommendations into the parliament in March 1997 he was dreaming up ways to add a bit of oomph to his statement. When he looked at the actual response to Charlie Bell's report, there was a lot of `Yes, we agree in principle', `We'll set up another inquiry to have a look at that' and `Oh, yes, not a bad idea but the government is not prepared to move on it just yet.' He thought to himself, `There's not much in this, is there? This is not going to give much oomph out there in the small business community that I promised to do so much for.' So he decided he would go for broke and say something about unfair dismissal when it came to small business. He decided that he would exempt small businesses of fewer than 15 employees from the provisions of the unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>The Prime Minister's laws had been in place a mere four months. Contrary to Charlie Bell's recommendations, the Prime Minister said, `Small businessâwhat they need is exemptions from unfair dismissal laws because they will all rush out and employ people.' Rob Bastion came along and said, `Fifty thousand jobs will be created almost overnight.' Come on! What sort of an approach to industrial relations and small business policy development is that?</para><para>What we saw at the time was people in small business actually scratching their heads and saying, `We hadn't really thought that unfair dismissal was such a big issue with us any more. Here you are as a government. You promised the world to us. You said, "We'll sweep away Laurie Brereton's laws and we'll put new ones in." You have done that. Here 
 you were out there trumpeting the fact that you had this industrial relations triumph and four months later you said, "Hang on, we didn't quite go far enough. We'll have to go and make one or two more changes. The constituency that is having a bit of a whinge because we really haven't done much is small business so, all right, we'll do something for them."'</para><para>I will also say something to the minister, who unfortunately is not with us tonight. In question time todayâonce again as part of his general approach to take statements at face value and try to convince people if he says them often enough that they must be the truthâhe said that I had been out talking to people. Once again, he said, `You've been talking to big business about small business and unfair dismissal.'</para><para>Again, let me say to the minister that in the last 12 months since I have had the opportunity and the privilege on this side to look after small business, I have spoken to small businesses and big businesses. I have spoken to people in Raymond Terrace, Townsville, Cairns, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne, Wollongong and in the Western suburbs of Sydney. I have spoken to small businesses, I have spoken to micro businesses and I have also spoken, as the minister pointed out, to Lend Lease and to Westfield to ask them their opinions on the changes that we were going to propose to some of the legislation that the government was proposing to introduce to put in place the `new deal, fair deal' concept with respect to retail tenancies and changes to the Trade Practices Act.</para><para>I am out there talking to these people and the minister is in here criticising me for talking to people. I have to say to his parliamentary secretary, `Look, you're right. You can go back and tell him that I have been out talking to all these people and micro businesses out in the electorate of my colleague the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield). I went out at his invitation and spoke to a number of wood turners out there about problems created by the government. I also went into the electorate of a number of my colleagues in South Australia. I have been down to Tasmania and spoken to very small 
 businesses about what they want.' I will tell honourable members what they wanted. They wanted more customers coming in the door. They wanted the promised reduction in the burden of red tape. They wanted to see some genuine government assistance. They did not want to see all the promises that had been made by a succession of failed ministers like Geoff Prosser and now the present minister who goes around disingenuously putting out information about what great things the government has done for small business. We have even seen that today. Today of all days! The parliamentary secretary should go to his minister and say, `What have you done here?'</para><para>The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business said in this place last year that he was going to fix the problem with this `new deal, fair deal' and the issues associated with uniform retail tenancy laws in particular. He rushed off on Friday, 5 December and saw all the state ministers. He sat them down and said, `We're going to bat on again with this industrial relations stuff but I'll tell you what else we are going to do. We are going to put in place the fact that it is you in the states who look after uniform retail tenancy stuff.' They said, `Whatever you say, Minister, because if we do not do this we are not going to get anything, are we?' He said, `Damn right, you're not. You sign up to this or you will get nothing.' Guess what? Three days ago his mate, the Liberal minister in Victoria, decided she could not wait for Peter Reith to get this uniform state agreement. She has introduced her own and she said, `As far as Peter Reith is concerned, I am not going to wait two or three years for that to happen.' So once again it is going to fall over.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>âCould I suggest you will not wait for the minister either.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8I4</name.id><name role="metadata">Martin, Stephen, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN</name></talker><para>âThe minister was caught out again in respect of that but he was also caught out on this industrial relations bill that we are debating here now.

There is not a problem. But from time to time there 
 are those individuals, as employers, who do not do the right thing. Deep down in his heart of hearts, the parliamentary secretary knows it. He knows that there is a need for some protection.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I might say, again, that both the Prime Minister and the minister for workplace relations knew that when they were in opposition. It was only a matter of a few weeks before the election that they said to the people of Australia, `We're not going to touch unfair dismissal laws in terms of small business. We reckon that workers need protection. We stand for the battlers.' Remember the Howard battlers, Mr Deputy Speaker, out there in voter land?

Dead right! That is what this side of the parliament is constantly going to stand up for and speak on behalf of.

New entrants to nursing homes will face complex income and assets tests that will apply from today. This confusion is being expressed right across the aged care industryâby clients, operators and service providers.</para></talk.start><para>Nursing home vacancies have risen to their highest level in 25 years because of growing uncertainty amongst the elderly community about whether they can afford aged care. Nursing home operators, both private and non-profit, representing some 90 per cent of Australia's nursing homes, are threatening to take the government to court. They claim that contracts guaranteeing $90 million in funds for much needed improvements to nursing homes have been scrapped illegally.</para><para>The New South Wales College of Nursing has claimed that some nursing home residents could be forced back into hospital because homes stand to lose money under the federal government's aged care reforms. A study into the new method of classifying the case needs of elderly residents conducted by the research company Latea Pty Ltd found that they were classified in a way that attracted less funding. These multiple changes to government policy have still not removed the possibility that some people may have to sell their family home to pay accommodation charges for nursing homes.</para><para>Australia's population is ageing rapidly. In 1996, some 12 per cent of the Australian population was over the age of 65. By the year 2016, this figure will increase to 16 per cent over 65. Even though on these figures more Australians will be in need of nursing home care, this government continues to reduce its contribution to this very vital area of health care.</para><para>The present reform debate has been carried out against a backdrop of the federal government's disgraceful $500 million cuts to aged care services. While there are many excellent nursing homesâand in Greenway they are outstandingâthe standard between these and the general run of nursing homes is deteriorating. According to Francis Sullivan, Executive Director of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, over 15 per cent of nursing homes fail to meet fire and safety regulations. Many nursing homes have been unable to keep up with building and refurbishing programs because of lack of support from this government.</para><para>Against this background, on top of the $4,380 a year accommodation charge, the 
 government is introducing a means tested daily fee for self-funded retirees and part-pensioners, which represent some 35 per cent of nursing home residents. These fees could be up to $63 a day. Ninety per cent of nursing home residents are pensioners, and over 70 per cent of these are women whose average age is 85. Therefore, there is a severe limitation on the financial contribution that these people will be able to make towards the provision of their aged care needs.</para><para>These new charges will not add one extra dollar to the care of the aged and will not add one extra dollar to the capital needs of nursing homes. They are purely and simply the result of budget cuts. Whether the government likes it or not, in real terms they are an appalling tax on the frail and elderly. What the general public is demanding very strongly from this government is a fair and reasonable aged care policy which builds a community spirit and provides dignified care for the elderly. The government should immediately abandon its cuts to aged care services and at least restore and then maintain the level of funding that applied under the Labor government until all nursing homes are able to reach acceptable standards. The government should also exempt short-stay nursing home residents from paying the accommodation charges. Nursing home care should equally be available to all Australians based on their clinical needs, irrespective of the financial capacity of any of them to meet the cost demands.</para><para>The views that I have expressed in this adjournment debate are clearly summed up in an article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>.

He was always willing to help others and always keen to help younger people. I think, above all, one of the many qualities amongst all those was the way he loved and nurtured his own family. He was always very proud of their achievements, he was always caring and he often worried about what was happening when they were not around. To Roger's wife, Suzi, his son, James, and his daughter, Kate, may your memories live on.

I am indebted to my friend the Hon. Gough Whitlam for drawing to my attention the contribution that Roger made. It is also appropriate that I do this as the federal member for Banks as well as the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs because Roger Dean was elected in 1949, together with the first federal member for Banks, the late Eric Costa. Roger delivered his first speech in the parliament on 7 March 1950 and was followed by the late Eric Costa, the then federal member for Banks.</para></talk.start><para>Roger's last service to the parliament before he retired from the parliament was as chairman of the select committee on grievances of the Yirrkala Aborigines of Arnhem Land reserve. That report was tabled in the parliament by Roger on 29 October 1963. The significance of that is that it was a unanimous report of a parliamentary committee. It was the first official document to mention land rights and sacred sites. Gough Whitlam acknowledges that it was that document that also led inexorably to bipartisan support for the 1967 Aborigines referendum. I repeat, and Gough makes this point, the report is signifi 
 cant in that it is the first official document to mention sacred places and land rights. It is referred to in Gough's book <inline font-style="italic">Abiding interests</inline> on pages 185 to 186. The standing committee, when it reported, recommended that a committee be established. That was not established, unfortunately, until after the 1972 and 1974 elections.</para><para>Too often the contributions of members of this place are not acknowledged if they do not make ministerial rank. Many fine contributions have been made by members of parliament who do not even aspire to ministerial rank. Roger's was a fine contribution. The committee which he chaired came about because of Kim Beazley Sr. In those days there was cross-party support on this. Too often, and it is unfortunateâthis relates to Roger Shipton as wellâwe get to make these speeches about former members only in an adjournment debate, because they did not reach ministerial rank. Perhaps we should reconsider that, because it is a bit elitist in this parliament to be giving us opportunities to speak only in adjournment debates if they were not ministers or if they were not current members of the parliament.</para><para>But, as I say, I did not know Roger Dean. Gough Whitlam knew him and he spoke highly of him. He regarded his contribution as an important contribution. That is an endorsement from someone on the other side of the political fence. That says something about Roger. To his daughter, Julia, she can rightly be proud of her father. He chaired an important committee and made many other contributions. He is remembered fondly by both sides of the House and by indigenous Australians. I have great pleasure, in talking about him tonight, following Eric Costa, who followed Roger in his first speech.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Katherine Flood</title><page.no>115</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>115</page.no><name role="metadata">Dondas, Nick, MP</name><name role="display">Mr DONDAS</name><name.id>5M6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Katherine flood on Australia Day, 26 January 1998 will be remembered as gravely as Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Day, 1974. To put it in perspective, the quantity of water in Katherine on the morning of Australia Day would have filled Sydney Harbour four times in 12 hours. The flow rate experienced at the time has been estimated at 
 12,000 cubic metres per secondâmore than the flow rate of 5,600 cubic metres in the flood of 1957. People thought in 1957 that that flood level had been set and that a flood like that would occur perhaps only once in 100 years or 200 years or even 500 years. The Katherine and Douglas Daly area flood was considered to be almost a one in 500 years flood. So the people of Katherine tried to plan for the future; they did their best and thought that if it were a once in 100 years flood they might be safe. Some areas of Katherine were safe. Although they were surrounded by water, the homes were not destroyed.</para></talk.start><para>In the short time that I have tonight I would like to place on record the appreciation of the people of Katherine for the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his wife,  Janette, to the area a couple of days later. The Prime Minister trouped around in the mud just to see the devastation and to talk to the flood victims, who really appreciated it at the time.</para><para>At that time the Prime Minister made an announcement that all the victims of the Katherine and Douglas Daly region floods would receive $1,000 per person and $250 per child. The Prime Minister's visit will certainly go down as a memorable one for the people of Katherine because he showed an interest and a keenness during their time of need. Obviously there are more things to be done.</para><para>The Prime Minister's visit was followed by that of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), who came and visited the area. He made all the Australian Defence Force personnel in that region, including Darwin, available to help with the clean-up. Almost 1,000 defence people were involved. The people of Katherine have thanked them. I think there is a lot more to be done in that areaâfunctions, et ceteraâto thank the personnel for all the very hard work. That was followed by a visit from the Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government (Mr Somlyay).</para><para>Out of tragedy and bad luck there was some good news. I would like to quote from a newspaper article. The Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government was wandering around the main street 
 after it had been cleaned up and people were trying to re-establish their businesses, and a woman approached him and said that she was having trouble getting stock. The newspaper article, which I think is pretty accurate, says:</para><para>Territories minister Alex Somlyay came to the rescue of Catrina Condon, owner of Popeye's Gourmet Food, yesterday, arranging for needed stock to allow her to reopen her pizza shop.</para><para>Mr Somlyay was in Katherine outlining a $10 million package which provides $10 000 grants to flood-hit small businesses.</para><para>He met Mrs Condon while surveying damage in Katherine's main street. She was frantically talking by mobile phone with suppliers in Adelaide, who were unwilling to send stock before they had received payment.</para><para>Mr Somlyay rang the supplier, explained who he was, told the supplier he guaranteed Mrs Condon would receive $10,000 from the Government, and arranged for stock to be delivered by the end of the week.</para><para>I am very happy to say that that stock was delivered and Mrs Condon opened.</para><para>Mike Reed, the local member and Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, was very much involved in the emergency service. He looked after his constituents before he worried about himself. He lost two homes, but he did not go to either for at least a week. Young Tim Baldwin was also very instrumental in providing information and support to the Northern Territory emergency services, police, Red Cross and the defence department. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Medicare</title><page.no>116</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>116</page.no><name role="metadata">Morris, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr PETER MORRIS</name><name.id>HI4</name.id><electorate>Shortland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMany thousands of my constituents are angry at this government's continuing attacks on Medicare. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in opposition promised to maintain Medicare. That clear and unequivocal promise has been broken. Almost daily we see attacks on health services by this government: higher pharmaceutical charges, drugs removed from the pharmaceutical benefits list, new entry fees for nursing homes, $800 million slashed from public hospital funds and the closure across Australia of 43 Medicare officesâout of about 250 officesâand 200 Medibank offices. All this from a Prime Minister and 
 government that promised to maintain Medicare.</para></talk.start><para>Retired Australians and young families being hit by this government's broken promises and attacks on Medicare will not forget it at the ballot box. In my electorate thousands of people are opposing this government's attempt to close Belmont Medicare office at the end of this month. This office is a great success story in terms of usage by and convenience for people from Shortland and nearby electorates. My earlier representations to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) to retain Belmont Medicare office has been rejected. Petitions from almost 8,000 electors in the area have also been rejected by the minister and the government.</para><para>But we will not give up. I ask the minister, again, to listen to the needs and pleas of many thousands of my electors who cannot afford to pay doctors and then wait two to three weeks to get their rebate from Medicare. Most of them, especially young families, pay the doctor, get their immediate cash refund and buy their medicines. The minister's brawling with doctors has resulted in doctors refusing to bulk bill, so putting further cash strains upon many of my constituents.</para><para>Belmont Medicare is not being closed because it is not efficient or not used. It is exactly the opposite. Its usage is growing. The landlord gave Medicare one year's free tenancy and a free fit-outâprobably of the order of $40,000 to $50,000âto move in there. The government wants to close it to divert the funds to non-Labor electorates and to downgrade Medicare. That is quite clear from the advice I have had from the Health Insurance Commission.</para><para>The next step will be to claim that Medicare does not work and is inefficient and to try to justify further changes to the health care system, just as Prime Minister Fraser and Treasurer Howard did in the seven years of government that they shared. They wrecked the original Medibank with nine different health systems in seven years.</para><para>My constituents want our Belmont Medicare office to be allowed to carry on its important and essential service, the service 
 that it provides to thousands of people in my electorate. That is why thousands of them are signing fresh petitions calling for the retention of the office. Today I presented signatures from 3,022 of them in petitions that came to this chamber. Previously, there were 7,877.</para><para>There will be many thousands more in the next couple of weeks, and that is why on this coming Friday at 10.30 a.m. there will be a rally at Belmont in support of the retention of the Belmont Medicare office. Its services are essential. It is needed by my constituents. It is needed by young families who are cash strapped. It is needed by retired Australians who are not able to suddenly learn how to use EFTPOS or how to use keyboards. Mr Speaker, maybe you are on a keyboard training program at the moment, but my constituents in those age groups are not on keyboard training courses.</para><para>My constituents want the service retained, as do small businesses in Belmont because it brings people to their area, as do the several pharmacies in the area which give sterling support to the Medicare office. Altogether, the office should be retained. I ask the minister to further consider the decision he has made and to direct the Health Insurance Commission to ensure that the office remains open so that those services that are increasingly used are available to the electors of Shortland and the adjoining electorates.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Dean, Mr Roger Levinge, CBE</title><page.no>117</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>117</page.no><name role="metadata">Lloyd, Jim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LLOYD</name><name.id>IK6</name.id><electorate>Robertson</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is appropriate that I should follow the member for Banks (Mr Melham) because I would also like to add my condolences to the family of Mr Roger Dean, the former member for Robertson. The House paid its respects to the former member at 2 p.m. today.</para></talk.start><para>I never met Mr Roger Dean. He was the member for Robertson from 1949 to 1964, some 15 years. Any federal member who held on to what was basically a marginal seat for 15 years must have been quite an incredible person. During that period Robertson was a much larger seat than it is today. Geographically, it extended north almost as far as Newcastle and included much of the Lake Macquarie area and Swansea, and its boundar 
 ies extended far south to take in Berowra as well.</para><para>In trying to learn more about the former member for Robertson, I did a bit of research and read some of the newspaper articles that were published just after his death, which occurred on 7 January this year. An obituary in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> recorded the way in which Roger Dean resigned from parliament, which shows that the man was certainly an unusual person. It says:</para><para>It was in unusual circumstances during question time in the House of Representatives on September 30, 1964, that the member for Robertson, Mr Roger Dean, resigned from Parliament.</para><para>He left his seat, handed a note to the Speaker, walked towards the railed-off area reserved for the diplomatic corps, and sat down.</para><para>"Has Mr Dean resigned his seat and are we to take it from his present seatâ</para><para>over in the diplomatic corpsâ</para><para>that he is prepared to accept a diplomatic appointment?" asked the Deputy Opposition leader, Mr Gough Whitlam.</para><para>"He has just handed me his resignation" replied the Speaker, Sir John McLeay.</para><para>So it was a rather unusual resignation. Roger Dean went on to become a driving force in the Northern Territory. He had a great concern for the Aboriginal community of the territory. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I am pleased to see that he was able to put his talents towards helping the Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.</para><para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 19 January this year there was also an article about Roger Dean, headed `MP became a driving force in the Territory'. It says:</para><para>As Territory administrator for six years (1964-70), he travelled extensively, making wide and enduring contacts with Aborigines in settlements, outstations and homelands and developing a deep understanding and affection for them, their history of survival and achievement, their unique culture, religious beliefs and extended families. This was a period of great expansion in the Territory, in which he played a significant part.</para><para>In 1968, in acknowledgment of his public and community services, Dean was awarded the Order of Commander of the British Empire. 
</para><para>In 1970, he was appointed Australian consul-general in San Francisco. His area of responsibility embraced 14 western States of the US, including Hawaii and Alaska. In 1974, he was appointed dean of the consular corps. Following his return to Australia that year, he established strong links with the Australia-America Association, becoming its federal vice-president in 1979.</para><para>Roger Dean was certainly a great Australian and made a great contribution to his community.

Roger Shipton was a friend, one that I greatly miss. 
 At his funeral the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that he was a very decent man, and I think every member who knew Roger Shipton knew that and understood it. I had served with him the whole time that he was in the parliament. The way that we leave this place often has difficulties associated with it. In Roger's case there could well have been a considerable degree of disappointment, and I dare say there was. But he saw to it afterwards that he played a constructive role in public life. He supported the member who succeeded him, he supported his party, and in that sense I think he showed far greater honour and integrity than most of us have ever seen in public life, given the difficulties that he faced at preselection on two different occasions.</para></talk.start><para>I will not elaborate further on that except to say that I did personally greatly admire him as an individual. I saw a lot of him. It was a great pleasure to have him undertake two tasks for me as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The first was as a member of the Lim committee, which inquired into and reported to me on the employer nomination scheme. More recently he was chairing for me a reference group that is advising on the review of the points test system for migration entry. In both of those areas he brought sound judgment. I have discussed the matter with officials. He brought great insight and he was able to contribute in a very positive way. He continued,  of  course,  in  the  range  of  public </para><para>advocacy. He started a consultancy business, where he continued to maintain his wide range of friendships in this place.</para><para>I think that Roger Shipton as a friend is one of those people who will be greatly missed. I do not know whether members know that his death was very tragic. He was still a relatively young man. I saw him only two or three days before he died, in Sydney. He took ill and was taken to Sydney Hospital. It was suggested that he should have some heart surgery. He underwent that. I saw him after he had undergone that heart surgery and he looked enormously fit. I had every expectation that he would recover well, and I think that was the expectation of the doctors at St Vincent's Hospital, where he was obviously in the very best of care. But, as members know, none of us know when our time will come and, tragically, Roger was taken with a clot that was not detected, and for which I guess nobody can be blamed.</para><para>I extend to Suzi, his widow, and his children, James and Kate, my personal condolences.

The cash rate maintained by the Bank of Japan as an instrument of monetary policy is around half a per cent, but the Bank does not lend to manufacturing and rural industries at this rate.</para><para>(3) The Japanese Ministry of Finance provides loan funds for various purposes through the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program. These funds come primarily from the postal savings and compulsory employee pensions schemes and are lent at rates currently comparable to those available from commercial lenders. Spending on public works by the Japanese Government has been at high levels over recent years but is being reduced as part of the Government's medium-term fiscal consolidation program.</para><para>(4) The 3.5 per cent interest rate for Singapore is a money market rate. The corresponding rate in Taiwan has recently risen to around 8 per cent, while the comparable rate in Australia is 5 per cent.</para><para>(5) Until 1983, the Reserve Bank occasionally provided funding to the Commonwealth Government at 1 per cent per annum by buying Treasury bills from the Commonwealth Government. This facility was used to cover shortfalls in the issue of debt securities by the Commonwealth Government to the private sector. The facility was formally put aside in 1986. Since 1985, market-related interest rates have applied to both cash balances held by the Commonwealth Government at the Reserve Bank and, on the rare occasions when required, overdraft 
 finance provided by the Reserve Bank to the Commonwealth Government.</para><para>(6) The levels of unemployment, foreign debt and foreign ownership at any time, together with conditions in rural industries, reflect a variety of factors. The deterioration in Australia's external situation over the past 2 decades reflects both investment and saving deficiencies, with the latter being the more important influence. The decline in national saving has in turn largely reflected a structural deterioration in public saving. The Government's medium term fiscal strategy of achieving underlying budget balance, on average, over the course of the cycle, is intended to address this situation by ensuring that the Government will not, on average, be calling on private saving to fund its investment needs.</para><para>(7) and (8) No. The selective provision of finance at below-market interest rates would distort business investment decisions, advantaging some industries at the expense of others. Investment funds are likely to be used most productively when investment decisions are made on a fully commercial basis, with government interventions limited to clear cases of market failure where the benefits of intervention exceed its cost.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Airlines: Domestic Routes</title><page.no>122</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2165)</subtitle><id.no>2165</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>122</page.no><name role="metadata">Tanner, Lindsay, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Tanner</name><name.id>YU5</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 28 August 1997:</para></talk.start><para>Are foreign carriers flying multiple domestic legs in Australia; if so, (a) to what extent and (b) what procedures are required to enable foreign carriers to fly multiple domestic legs.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>122</page.no><name role="metadata">Vaile, Mark, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Vaile</name><name.id>SU5</name.id><electorate>Lyne</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Transport and Regional Development</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>Whilst most foreign carriers are permitted to operate to a number of ports within Australia, they are only permitted to carry traffic that is part of an international service between these ports.</para><para>(a) There are currently nine foreign scheduled passenger airlines operating multiple domestic legs in Australia.

The ACCC's informal monitoring program comprises the collection of information from banks on changes to fee structures on transaction accounts as they occur or are planned to occur.

A universal visa system for entry to Australia remains in place, as it was before that date, under which all foreign citizens seeking to enter or remain in Australia must meet the criteria for a visa as set out in the Migration Act and Regulations. However the processes used to issue visas continue to change and adapt to keep step with the growth in applications for visitor visas. For example, the Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) was introduced in Singapore in September 1996 and has since been made available to 26 other low risk nationalities. The ETA is not available in countries where experience indicates a high risk of overstay.</para><para>Prior to the implementation of ETA arrangements were introduced for authorised travel agents to receive visitor visa applications. Details of these applications are forwarded by fax to the responsible DIMA post for approval by an authorised officer. The performance of agents participating in these arrangements is subject to close monitoring procedures. In many cases these agency arrangements have been superseded by the ETA.</para><para>(2) From 1 October 1996 to 30 September 1997, 10,715 protection visa applications were lodged. The ten top source countries for protection visa applications were: Indonesia 1589, the Philippines 1451, Sri Lanka 1330, the Peoples Republic of China 1314, India 362, Colombia 285, Thailand at 277, Lebanon 261, Turkey 205 and Fiji 204. Citizens of these countries are not eligible to obtain ETAs to travel to Australia.</para><para>(3) I have received advice from my Department on the operation of visa processes, and on the factors which affect applications for on-shore protection. As I announced on 25 June 1997 the Government has also introduced a number of mea

These include:</para><para>.	 limitations to work rights for people making protection visa applications</para><para>.	 introduction of a post-decision fee of $1,000 for unsuccessful Refugee Review Tribunal applications.</para><para>These measures will act as a disincentive for people who are trying to extend their stay in Australia or who have overstayed their visa and are simply abusing the system by making non bona fide applications.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economic Development</title><page.no>136</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2360)</subtitle><id.no>2360</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>136</page.no><name role="metadata">Thomson, Kelvin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Kelvin Thomson</name><name.id>UK6</name.id><electorate>Wills</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 20 October 1997:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Has his attention been drawn to a recent report by BIS Shrapnel entitled "State economic prospects 1997-2001" which predicted that the rate of economic development in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory will greatly exceed the rate of growth in other States during that period.</para><para>(2) Will he provide a special range of assistance measures to those States facing slower growth prospects over the next five years.</para><para>(3) Will he raise the report with the Victorian Government and discuss what steps can be taken to ensure the report's prediction of higher than average unemployment in Victoria is not realised.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>136</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Yes.

These include all employer and tax deductible personal contributions, specified roll-over amounts (that is, the untaxed element of the post June 1983 component of an eligible termination payment such as a `golden handshake') and payments of the shortfall of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge. A surcharge is also payable in respect of certain contributions made by or on behalf of high income earners.</para><para>(2) Generally, taxable contributions made to a fund in a year of income are to be included in the fund's assessable income for that year. In some cases a superannuation fund may effectively transfer its tax liability in respect of taxable contributions to a life insurance company. Generally, the superannuation fund is liable to pay the surcharge; in limited circumstances individuals are responsible for paying the surcharge.</para><para>(3) It is common practice for the trustees of superannuation funds to reduce end benefits available to fund members as a consequence of any taxation liability associated with taxable contributions.

</para><para>(4) The Government believes the circumstances in which tax is payable on taxable contributions is set out clearly in legislation.

Because these retailers operate through an independent wholesaler, they may pay more sales tax than the large retailers which operates through its own wholesale/distribution centre. This is not a consequence of a higher sales tax rate being imposed on independent retailers, but rather a consequence of retail chains that operate their own wholesale outlets being advantaged by the status of the existing sales tax system.</para><para>I have met with representatives of independent supermarket wholesalers and retailers, including Australian Asia/Pacific Wholesalers Pty Ltd and the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia. I have been briefed on the circumstances in which this problem has developed, and the implications for independent supermarket retailers and consumers. I have raised their concerns with the Treasurer. I am also advised that the industry has raised these issues with the Commissioner for Taxation by way of formal submission. The issue highlights the structural weaknesses of the existing wholesale sales tax system and reinforces the Government's determination to fundamentally reform the Australian taxation system. Had the system been reformed 
 by the previous Labor government in its 13 years of office, this problem would not now exist.</para><para>(2) In responding to part (a) of the question, advice was sought from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The ATO has advised that the wholesale sales tax (WST) system is a single stage tax at the wholesale level. Sales tax is payable on the wholesale selling price (the taxable value). The WST legislation allows the Commissioner of Taxation to enter into administrative agreements with taxpayers concerning the calculation of the taxable value. I am advised that these agreements on taxable value are used in situations where the wholesale selling price is not readily apparent or capable of ready calculation. I am further advised that consideration of industry submissions is continuing in discussions between the ATO and industry representatives.</para><para>The issue raised in part (b) of the question goes to the very nature of the operation of the sales tax system, namely the application of a single rate of tax at the point of last wholesale sale. I am advised that any proposals for reform of the current arrangements are necessarily complex as they involve examination of a key building block of the current system and have direct adverse revenue implications.</para><para>As the honourable member would be aware, the Prime Minister has announced that the Government plans to reform and modernise the Australian taxation system for the twenty-first century. In evaluating the options for tax reform, an important consideration for the Government will be to ensure that Australia's tax system does not disadvantage smaller businesses and is conducive to growth and employment in this important sector of the economy.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Greenhouse Gas Emission Targets</title><page.no>149</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2441)</subtitle><id.no>2441</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>149</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilton, Greg, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Wilton</name><name.id>YK6</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 October 1997:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Will there be benefits flowing to Australia and the Australian economy from the Commonwealth Economic Declaration, particularly with respect to greenhouse gas emission targets, following the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh.</para><para>(2) Were acknowledgments forthcoming from Commonwealth countries in regard to greenhouse gas emissions; if so, what.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>149</page.no><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Howard</name><name.id>ZD4</name.id><electorate>Bennelong</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Yesâalthough, given the meeting was not a negotiating forum and its outcomes are declaratory, the benefits are not strictly quantifiable.

ERDC provided investment support for R&amp;D projects in the energy sector. As such there is no similar program now operating. However, I note that companies that may have been supported through the ERDC could seek assistance through the R&amp;D Start Program. Under the R&amp;D Start Program the IR&amp;D Board expects to approve around $120

This is consistent with the Commonwealth responsibilities for employment assistance for people with disabilities. Accordingly, CAAS does not provide assistance for people whose sole disability is incontinence or for people whose incontinence results from surgery, medication, illness or disease, or is caused through age related conditions.</para><para>Consistent with this labour market focus, once a person has turned 65 years of age and is no longer in employment, they are no longer eligible to receive assistance through CAAS.

</para><para>(3) (a) Data for the number of applications received for each Clasp for the Australian Service Medal 1945-75 is not maintained.</para><para>(b) Medals awarded for each Clasp are:</para><para>BERLINâ30; FESRâ5596; INDONESIAâ12; JAPANâ8284; KASHMIRâ45; KOREAâ2790; MIDDLE EASTâ15; PNGâ7597; SW PACIFICâ2576; THAILANDâ1191; THAI-MALAYâ799; W NEW GUINEAâ10.</para><para>(4) An average time to process an eligible application for the medal is difficult to identify. However, establishing the correct entitlement of an individual is a time-consuming procedure involving lengthy searches of personnel records. To ensure fairness, each inquiry is processed in order of receipt. Based on the information provided, the applicant's records are checked for the correct entitlement to this and any other medals. The records are not computerised and thus searches are done manually. If an entitlement to an award is established, the award must be formally approved by the Governor-General, engraved and forwarded to the applicant by registered post. This process can vary from several weeks to some months, if the record search reveals the applicant to be eligible for a number of medals.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Service Pensions: Malayan Emergency Personnel</title><page.no>156</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2476)</subtitle><id.no>2476</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>156</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Laurie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Laurie Ferguson</name><name.id>8T4</name.id><electorate>Reid</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 17 November 1997:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Did the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Tambling), speaking for the Government in debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Compensation Measures) Bill 1997 (Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> , 22 October 1997, page 7775), state that former navy personnel who served in the Far Eastern Strategic Reserve could qualify for full repatriation benefits if they met the same requirements applying to army and air force veterans and could prove that they incurred danger from the enemy.</para><para>(2) What requirements must army and air force veterans who served in the Malayan Emergency meet to qualify for the service pension.</para><para>(3) To be eligible for a service pension, are the veterans referred to in part (2) required to prove that they personally incurred danger from the enemy.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>156</page.no><name role="metadata">Scott, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Bruce Scott</name><name.id>YT4</name.id><electorate>Maranoa</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Veterans' Affairs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Yes. 
</para><para>(2) Army and air force veterans must have served in the Malayan Emergency at a time when either they or their unit were allotted for duty by the Department of Defence.</para><para>The criteria for allotment are set by the Department of Defence. Allotment for duty is a term defined in section 5B(2) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. A member of the Defence Force who has been allotted for duty, or deemed to have been allotted for duty, and who has rendered service in an operational area as defined in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, will have qualifying service for the purpose of a service pension.</para><para>(3) Any veteran who was allotted and who served in the area does not have to prove that they incurred danger. Allotment acknowledges an underlying assumption that when members of the Defence Force enter the area concerned they will be (or were) exposed to danger from the hostile forces of the enemy. However, if an individual was in the area but was not allotted, the Department of Defence would have to be satisfied that they did incur danger before they could be retrospectively allotted and hence have qualifying service for a service pension. As indicated in the response to the first question, the Government has agreed that the cases of any veterans, who believe that their operational service did expose them to danger from the hostile forces of the enemy, can be so reviewed.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Termination Payments</title><page.no>156</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 2481)</subtitle><id.no>2481</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>156</page.no><name role="metadata">McClelland, Robert, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McClelland</name><name.id>JK6</name.id><electorate>Barton</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 November 1997:</para></talk.start><para>Have amendments to section 27F of the Income Tax Assessment Act resulted in persons being disadvantaged if they work beyond the age of 65 years because their termination payments are not regarded as bona fide redundancy payments for the purpose of a concessional rate of taxation.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>156</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr Costello</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>No.</para><para>Section 27F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 was introduced in 1983 to give concessional tax treatment to bona fide redundancy payments.
