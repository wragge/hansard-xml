It will take a couple of moments for that material to be made available.</para></talk.start><para>I might start by thanking those officers of the parliament and officers of the Attorney-General's Department and other relevant sections for the work they have been doing overnight. We have been through this situation before where, when the Senate sits very late, there is then the very significant task of putting together the sum total of the considerations of the Senate so that the amendments and outcomes of the Senate process can be transmitted through to the House of Representatives.</para><para>That also involves a very detailed examination of the outstanding issues, so it is therefore important that the executive be fully briefed on the outcomes from the Senate. That has meant that a very large number of people have had to work all through the night, for hour upon hour. I do not think the Senate completed its deliberations until around 2.30 a.m. So we thank all those who have been responsible for completing that work.</para><para>The course of action now proposed is that the House will consider these matters in committee. We propose to have two speakers a side of 15 minutes and five minutes, so we hope the House will be able to adjourn for the Easter break in roughly 45 minutes. They are the administrative matters that have been concluded.</para><para>The schedule of amendments made by the Senate will cover validation, the right to negotiate, the question of the Racial Discrimination Act, the proposals in respect of a sunset clause, all of those being very significant issues, and other significant issues which have been raised during the lengthy debate in 
 the Senate. I thank members for their patience.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>FT4</name.id><name role="metadata">BRADFORD</name><name role="display">Mr Bradford</name></talker><para>—If I could take a point of order, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the House announced arrangements that have been made for this debate.

The bill that was passed through this parliament last year, and again a few weeks ago, was a fair and balanced piece of legislation. It already represented a major compromise. It represented a fair balancing of the interests of all sections of the Australian community. It was fair as between Aborigines and farmers; it was fair as between city and country; it was fair as between Australian and Australian.</para><para>The bill as amended by the Senate will not treat farmers and Aborigines equally. The bill as amended by the Senate gives special privileges to one group of Australians denied to others. It contains provisions which are not available to other sections of the Australian community and are specifically available to one group of Australians, and that group of Australians alone. It is a fundamental of our kind of society, and it is certainly a fundamental of the approach of my government, that all Australians should be treated equally before the law. All Australians should be entitled to an equal dispensation of justice, and all Australians should have equal responsibilities before the law.</para><para>There are four major objections which the government has to the bill as amended by the Senate. They surround the areas that have been debated at length over the past weeks 
 and the past months. They relate, firstly, to the right to negotiate, secondly, to the registration test, thirdly, to the application of the Racial Discrimination Act to this piece of legislation and, fourthly, to the so-called sunset clause.</para><para>We have long argued that it is wrong in principle that there should be a right to negotiate over pastoral leaseholdings subject to mining applications in the hands of indigenous claimants, yet that right is not available to farmers and pastoralists. We do not believe that that right should be available to one group and not available to others.</para><para>That is the fundamental reason why we have always said that a bill which contained the right to negotiate was always going to be unacceptable, not only to the rural community of the Australia, not only to the mining industry of Australia, but indeed to the vast bulk of the Australian community, who believe in a very sacred principle, that is, the equality of all Australians before the law.</para><para>Mr Speaker, I would remind the parliament that when the original native title legislation was passed at the behest of the Keating government in 1993 it was never intended that the right to negotiate should apply to pastoral leaseholdings. Nothing which has happened in all the hours, all the weeks and all the months of the debate that has gone on since the High Court brought down its decision in the Wik case in December 1996 has disturbed that unassailable historical fact that the original legislation was predicated on the basis that the grant of a pastoral leasehold extinguished native title.</para><para>That was contained in a preamble to the 1993 act. It was asserted by Mr Keating, my predecessor as Prime Minister. That assurance, that assumption, that statement, that declaration of belief was contained in correspondence which passed between the then Prime Minister and some premiers of the Australian states. It was the belief and the assumption under which the former Labor Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, operated. It was always believed, even by prominent members of the indigenous community, that the idea that native title should have survived the grant of a valid pastoral lease was com 
 pletely unacceptable. The whole basis of all of our understanding was that that was an unassailable fact.</para><para>Then to our very great surprise the High Court of Australia decided in December 1996 that that was not necessarily so. There were many people then with a great deal of justification, including many of the farmers of Australia and all of the state premiers of Australia—and I say advisedly: all of the state premiers of Australia—including the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, who said that the proper response of the government in the wake of the High Court decision was in fact to pass a law that simply confirmed the understanding of the parliament and the understanding of the Australian people in December of 1993 that the grant of a valid pastoral lease extinguished native title.</para><para>That was the pressure under which my government was placed, and that was the view of many of my colleagues who now sit behind me, not only in the National Party, but also in the Liberal Party, because they believe that is what the Australian people had been promised, guaranteed and led to believe by the former Labor Prime Minister.</para><para>But, because of our respect for the decision taken by the High Court and because of our belief that we had to properly balance the interests of farmers and Aborigines, we said, `No, we will not embrace that course of action, but what we will seek to do is establish a legislative structure—which was ultimately embodied in the 10-point plan and subsequently in the Native Title Amendment Bill—that would enshrine the principles of equality of treatment, respect the principles of native title laid down in the Mabo case, confirm the interpretation of that in relation to pastoral leaseholdings enunciated in the Wik decision, and present it to the people as a fair and decent compromise.</para><para>If anybody has any doubts about the veracity of that proposition, go and talk to the rural representatives in the western lands division of New South Wales, who argued very strongly that their particular leaseholds were exclusive tenures of the type contemplated by the Wik decision and therefore should have totally extinguished native. But because our 
 legal advice was that that was not so, we refused to include those particular leaseholdings in the schedule to the Native Title Amendment Act. In the face of the fiercest criticism—and understandable criticism from those people—the government said no, it would not compromise the integrity of the legislative framework that it had established.</para><para>I mention these things, Mr Speaker, because it is important in perhaps the very final speech I will make in this parliament in relation to this piece of legislation that the Australian public ought to be reminded of the original expectation given voice by Paul Keating as Labor Prime Minister of Australia that the grant of a valid pastoral lease extinguished native title—an assumption under which all Australians were entitled to operate; a bona fide belief held by all Australians; a High Court decision that overturned that exception; a refusal by my government to simply embrace the extinguishment option in relation to those pastoral leaseholdings; and the hammering out of a compromise that was honourable to everybody, bitterly disappointing many of my own party supporters and having to say face to face to many representatives of the rural community of Australia, `We are prepared to go so far, but no further.'</para><para>In the interests of fairness, balance and justice the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and I were prepared to say to many people and many organisations that have been lifelong supporters of our two parties that, in the interests of fairness and balance, we could not go any further than the 10-point plan.</para><para>I mention those things as a measure of the bona fides of my government and the bona fides of the Deputy Prime Minister, who, I might say, has displayed conspicuous courage, tenacity and decency on this particular issue. In this speech I want to thank the Deputy Prime Minister again for the contribution he has made in very difficult circumstances.</para><para>I say to the farmers of Australia: although we could not do everything that you would want us to do, there is one thing we have been able to do—that is, we have clung tenaciously to the principle that all Australians should be treated equally; we have clung 
 tenaciously to the principle that farmers and Aborigines should be treated equally; we have clung tenaciously to the principle that no one group in the Australian community should have rights that are not enjoyed by another group. That is why we were never prepared to compromise on the issue of the right to negotiate.</para><para>We have said to the farmers of Australia: we are not going to legislate to implement your legitimate expectation raised by the Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating; not only are we going to fail to give force to your legitimate expectation but we are going to go further, we are going to leave the right to negotiate over pastoral leaseholds although it was only ever intended that it would apply to vacant crown land. That would have been to doubly throw dirt in the face of the rural community of Australia. We were simply, in the interests of fairness and balance, unprepared to do that.</para><para>It has always been a cardinal principle of our handling of this legislation that, once the Wik decision was brought down, the right to negotiate over pastoral leaseholds had to go as a matter of ordinary commonsense and logic because the original basis of the legislation was that you could only make a native title claim over vacant crown land, and that was the belief enshrined in the recital of the original act. It defies logic, fairness, commonsense and balance in the Australian community that that right to negotiate should continue to apply in relation to pastoral leases. The failure of the Senate to accept that principle means that the amendment on that issue alone is absolutely unacceptable to my government.</para><para>The other issues, although of lesser significance, are nonetheless very significant in themselves. I thought at one stage that we had amended the original registration test, but I found last night that we had not because there was a double backflip with triple pike done by the minor parties in the Senate. The registration test in its present form—the Senate form—is unacceptable.</para><para>And of course there is the application of the racial discrimination clause. This is the clause that the Labor Party in government decided not to apply. This is the clause that Father 
 Frank Brennan, in that now notorious correspondence in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, said was being used by the Labor Party as a device to get an early election on this issue. If you leave the bill in the form proposed by the Senate, you will end up applying the principle of double jeopardy in relation to every piece of litigation that might take place under the Native Title Act. That of course is also unacceptable.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">TUCKEY</name><name role="display">Mr Tuckey</name></talker><para>—A lawyers' clause.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>—It would be a lawyers' feast.

It does not take away the common-law right to bring an action in the Federal Court; it is merely limited in relation to registered claimants. It is a totally fair and reasonable principle, but that is also regarded as unacceptable by the Senate.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to the Senate, the Senate has been guilty of some quite bizarre behaviour on this. I talk in particular of the Senate's gyrations and chopping and changing on the issue of the registration test and the sunset clause. We did at one stage have a decent registration test but that disappeared in the dead of night last night. We did at one stage have a sunset clause which was reasonable and fair but that also disappeared. Not only did the Senate deny us what we wanted in relation to the right to negotiate, what Labor said was fair—and Father Frank Brennan continues to say is fair—in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act, but at the 11th hour, at five minutes to midnight, so to speak, they have also denied the House of Representatives what was wanted in relation to the registration test and the sunset clause.</para><para>There are numerous other amendments listed on the grey sheet that have been inserted by the Senate which we find completely unacceptable. There are just two other things that I want to say very carefully to the parliament and to the Australian people. I reject completely the description constantly used by many in the media that, if the Wik bill is the 
 subject of a double dissolution, the next election will be a race election. There will be no race election as far as my government is concerned. We will never embrace the politics of race. We will never seek to exploit a political issue or create a political argument based on race. We do not have in our ranks people who have used racist language. We do not have in our numbers people who have used racist language. I notice that I am going to be followed by somebody who has still failed to apologise for having made some very crude and some very crass remarks.</para><para>It will not be a race election so far as my party is concerned. It will not be a race election so far as the Leader of the National Party is concerned. If those media commentators who continue to loosely and glibly describe it as such had any concern for the harmony of the Australian community, they would stop using such a ridiculous title.</para><para>I believe that this bill, after it has been disposed of, should be laid aside, but there will be some further amendments to be dealt with shortly. In its form as presented by the Senate, for the reasons that I have outlined and in circumstances that I greatly regret, the bill is absolutely unacceptable to the government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>08:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2962</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Gareth, MP</name><name role="display">Mr GARETH EVANS</name><name.id>VD4</name.id><electorate>Holt</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is deeply depressing that the government has chosen to reject the <inline ref="r455">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]</inline>  in the form in which it is returned to us from the Senate. There is no reason in law or justice or economics or morality for this bill in this form to be rejected. If it is rejected, it will not be for any reason of law or economics or justice or morality. It will be for reasons of politics—the politics of the coalition and the accommodation of the National Party within it, the politics of the forthcoming Queensland election and the politics of winning the federal election in rural and regional Australia.</para></talk.start><para>This is a divisive and confrontational government which has deliberately taken a divisive and confrontational course on issue after issue since it has been in office. It has taken that course now on the Australian waterfront and it has taken it now here on an 
 issue that is even more explosive—the issue of race and Aboriginal rights. The tragedy is that it has been so unnecessary for the government to take this course.</para><para>We in the opposition approached this whole issue from the outset in a conciliatory and consensual fashion. We kept trying to find solutions throughout the course of this debate that would be acceptable to all the key stakeholders—indigenous Australians, pastoralists, miners and the larger Australian community. We have been constantly disappointed by the government's reaction and we are disappointed again—disappointed to the extent of total depression—by the government's reaction today.</para><para>Let me proceed immediately to the substance of the issues and explain why it is that the government should be prepared to accept this bill in the form in which it has come back to us. The government says there are four key issues in the legislative package which make that impossible. That is not a view that is accepted by the opposition and let me explain why. First of all, the threshold or registration test. This is the key to a great deal else in the bill. It is crucial that it be effective. It is crucial that we end so-called paper claims once and for all. It is crucial that the right to negotiate in future be exercised only by claimants to native title with a reasonable chance of success.</para><para>The amendment passed by the Senate is not precisely what the government wanted in this respect, that is true, but it does get that result. It is a very different set of provisions from that which passed the Senate in December. What we now have—and let me identify it—is first of all a set of tough procedural hurdles that have to be jumped. We have a criterion whereby each individual claim has to be prima facie sustainable and determined as such by the registrar. We have to have a traditional physical connection, not just any old connection, or, in the absence of that, a lockout. That is going back only one generation: the issue has not been put in the legislation of going back more than one generation.</para><para>Alternatively, if you have not got that kind of traditional association or a lockout, you at the very least have to have an acknowledged 
 traditional law association or a customary association which has been maintained with this particular patch of land to the extent practicable—the Mabo test outlined by Mr Justice Brennan. That is not some loose, vague, spiritual association test, as has been constantly claimed; it is a workable and defensible addition to the legitimate bases for such a claim being made.</para><para>There is moreover something the government was always reluctant to accept—God knows why because it adds very significantly to the armoury of the miners who want to contest rights to negotiate being triggered in situations where they think the claims being made are indefensible. There is provision in our threshold test for a collateral challenge to be made to the registrar's decision in circumstances where it is beyond the registrar's power to determine a contested matter of fact, but it is a matter of the court's power. We have now put in a provision expressly enabling an unsustainable claim, in effect, to be swept away at the threshold. So much for the threshold test.</para><para>As to the right to negotiate, yes, as the bill comes to us from the Senate that has been retained for mining on pastoral leases—the issue that was left open, not foreclosed, in 1993. Why shouldn't that right to negotiate be retained? What we are talking about here is a common law right to have native title or a claim of such common law right which the government recognises legitimately does trigger a right to negotiate in relation to mining and compulsory acquisition exercises if it is on vacant crown land. What difference should it make that a pastoral lease has been given over that crown land? We are not talking about freehold and we are not talking about full commercial leasehold of the kind which involves exclusive possession; we are talking about pastoral leases, which, as we all know or should know, historically were no more than essentially grass and water licences to graze. That is the truth of the matter.</para><para>The onus is not on those who want to argue for a right to negotiate to be extended to pastoral leases; the onus must be on those who would want to take away the right to negotiate from those with credible common 
 law claims to native title who would have that right if it were vacant crown land and for whom the existence of a pastoral lease should make no difference. Pastoralists are not being prejudiced in any way. Their rights will not be one iota diminished from what they are under statute or common law at the moment.</para><para>The final point to make about the right to negotiate is that it is critical not only to the justice and morality of this package but also to its legal certainty. The Hindmarsh Island case left very much open the necessity for a race based constitutional provision to operate to the net benefit of Aboriginal or indigenous people and it is clear that the right to negotiate will be crucial in any determination of that net benefit.</para><para>As to the third issue of the sunset clause, it is true that has now been deleted from the legislation, but this has always been the least credible, least plausible, of the government's positions and, frankly, acknowledged as such in many private conversations, which I will not be rude or crude enough to actually identify, going right back to the beginning of this debate. The truth of the matter is that it has always been acknowledged that the sunset clause would not inhibit the pursuit of common law claims—and that has been acknowledged again by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) today; all it would do is rub out the statutory procedures being applicable. All the existence of a sunset clause would have done is trigger an avalanche of ambit claims which would make much more difficult the practical resolution of these vexed and sensitive issues.</para><para>As to the final of the four issues, the Racial Discrimination Act clause, this is not the kind of destructive weapon the government claims it to be. We did amend the text of the bill to make specific provision to exclude from any possible override by the Racial Discrimination Act its application to not only the original validations but also the validations that have been accomplished for the intermediate period from 1994 to 1996. There has been in addition an interpretive footnote inserted in our amendment designed to make it clear that the RDA applies in relation to the performance of functions, the exercise of powers or the resolution of ambiguity.</para><para>In other words, there is a very clear direction being given to the courts that it is not the intention of the legislature that the Racial Discrimination Act cut some sort of destructive swath through the substantive provisions of the legislation. It is there as an interpretive guide and it is there as a restatement of the fundamental principle, which we all ought to be prepared to accept, that non-discrimination ought to apply and ought to be visibly seen to apply.</para><para>It is critical to appreciate that these four issues are not the only issues that have been the subject of the Senate debate. A huge number of other issues have been debated and overwhelmingly in relation to all these other issues the government got what it wanted. Let me list what the government has achieved in this respect so people can understand why it is we say that the government should not be rejecting this legislation in the form in which it has come back and for it to do so is politically driven rather than driven by economics, law, morality or justice. Let me list these issues quickly.</para><para>On the validation issue, the government got what it wanted with ALP support. On the issue of confirmation of past extinguishment, the government got everything it wanted with a couple of comparatively small exceptions. On the question of indigenous land use agreements, largely as a result of a consensus in negotiation we have achieved something that is supported by both the government and the opposition parties, a better outcome than December and one that in particular will allow for the resolution of a great many of those tangles of outstanding claims from the pre-1996 period which will not be revisited under the new threshold test and which have to be somehow addressed if we are to resolve the continuing problem areas, particularly in the Goldfields and elsewhere.</para><para>On the primary production regime, the government's pastoral diversification regime was here accepted, effectively in its entirety. The government and the pastoralists have everything in practice they could reasonably want, and did in fact want. Non-claimant applications, water and air space issues were clear wins for the government in the sense that it 
 got exactly what it wanted; it got its bill. On the renewals issue, the government got nearly all that it wanted, with one huge advance on December, which was given to it with ALP support, and that was the renewal of mining leases and interests on the same terms as they had previously existed. That will not now trigger a right to negotiate. It was a matter on which the mining industry had very strong feelings—a matter on which we sought and achieved a consensus outcome. </para><para>On the issue of reservations, the government got what it wanted. On the question of services to the public, there was a mixed outcome for the government. It got everything except the right to construct new facilities without a compulsory acquisition right to negotiate regime being associated with that. On low impact acts, there was achieved in the Senate an extension to low impact exploration—that is, that does not now trigger a right to negotiate. That is a major advance for the mining industry and for the government on what was achieved in December, and it was delivered with complete cross-party support as a result of negotiations. On the freehold test and offshore issues, the government got exactly what it wanted. On statutory access rights, the government got half of what it wanted. It maintained what we would regard as the unfair element of suspending common law native title rights when statutory access is in fact achieved, granted or exercised, but the opposition won its position on the extension of those access rights to cover various lock-out situations.</para><para>On compensation, we achieved an improved regime—delivered by agreement—and one thing that will make the bill a lot more certain in its legal application so far as this area is concerned. On the question of applications procedure, the government got what it wanted. On claims procedure, it got what it wanted. On the question of representative bodies, it got what it wanted, with some significant improvements on the 1993 bill incorporating some positions negotiated by the government with the opposition. On a whole miscellany of other issues, which it is not easy to simply characterise, the government got 14 of its amendments up; we got seven, including, 
 might I say, an amendment to guarantee the Queensland Chevron pipeline deal which was delivered last night—a statutory provision to that effect—by the opposition, the Greens, Senator Harradine and the Democrats against government opposition. That is there in the text of the legislation and that will not be forgotten in the forthcoming Queensland debate.</para><para>The point is this: I have just rattled through, together with the original four matters I dealt with at more length, the 20 key issue areas that were up for debate in the Senate. On 14 of those 20 key issues, the government got exactly or more or less exactly what it wanted. On two other of those 20 issues, the outcome was divided from a government perspective. On four of those issues—the RDA, the sunset clause, the threshold test and the right to negotiate; the big four that the government keeps emphasising—it did not get what it wanted. But I should say that overwhelmingly the balance is there and any reasonable analysis of the outcome in the Senate will make it absolutely clear that this is a package that should have been accepted by the government. I should say that even this outcome has been even more divisive and confrontational than could have been the case. More options were on the table that could have delivered consensual negotiated outcomes on issues which still remain divisive as between us, including, I have to say, the right to negotiate itself.</para><para>The debate lost its way when the government, as I understand it, backed away from various undertakings or assurances or understandings that were given in negotiations with Senator Harradine. That led him to walk back from positions that he previously had taken. There is no point in going over the agony of all that debate over the last two weeks, but all I can say in general terms is that, had the political atmospherics been a lot better, had this government been not so obviously determined to create the conditions for confrontation here, a totally acceptable outcome could have been achieved; and that is of course something we have been arguing for from day one—that it is possible with goodwill to achieve that.</para><para>What we have as a consequence of the failure to reach a complete agreement on all these issues is a number of residual areas of quite serious legal uncertainty so far as this bill is concerned. Because of the government's achieving its way on a number of the issues that I have already mentioned, there is a very real question as to whether this legislation can in its present form satisfy the beneficial requirement which we believe continues to exist in section 51(xxvi) and which will be determined by the High Court when it finally gets around to addressing the substantive issues on things like confirmation of extinguishment to the extent that it does not apply common law rules. There are some just terms, issues which again are redolent right through this legislation, which had I the time I would address.</para><para>But let me just come back to where I started. Nothing in the economics, the law, the justice or the morality should stop this bill being accepted. The government will be judged by its failure to accept this bill. It will be judged, of course, by indigenous people who, once again, have had their hopes of reconciliation and advancement sadly dashed. It will be judged by the miners and all those others who want commercial certainty and who have been denied it by the failure to reach agreement on these issues. The government will be judged internationally by those who are all too conscious internationally of the long record of insensitivity this government has chalked up on racial issues. And this government will be judged by the Australian people, who do not want division and confrontation, who do not want to see unleashed all those forces of prejudice, fear, humiliation and hurt that, whether intended or not, are absolutely inevitable if we do proceed, as now seems inevitable, to a race based double dissolution.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2966</page.no><name role="metadata">Fischer, Tim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr TIM FISCHER</name><name.id>DG4</name.id><electorate>Farrer</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Trade; Deputy Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government stands firm to deliver a practical solution to the problems associated with Wik.

Indeed, as late as 10 o'clock last night the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) took the precautionary step of calling a joint party meeting to explain the state of play, and even at the end of that meeting—if I can have your permission to reveal this—the Prime Minister put a caveat that it may have to be resumed to consider any last minute changes in the remaining four hours of sitting of the Senate. In other words, we were prepared, right through to 2.15 this morning—in fact right through to the 7.30 cabinet meeting this morning—to look at any last minute changes from the Senate.</para><para>Alas, that was not to be the case. I accept the phraseology of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there were in a sense 20 main issues and on six of those 20 there was not agreement between the government and the opposition. The four big issues were the right to negotiate, Racial Discrimination Act alteration, the sunset clause provision and, above all else, the threshold test provision, which was carried briefly in the Senate in favour of the government's longstanding 10-point plan position but was of course reversed yesterday afternoon.</para><para>I will go back to Longreach on Saturday. I will make a point of going to Longreach to meet with a number of people at a function which is mainly associated with the 10th anniversary of the Stockman's Hall of Fame. In the morning of that Saturday I will go to Winton to the opening of the new Matilda Centre and in the afternoon to the Stockman's Hall of Fame to unveil the 10th anniversary plaque. They will be magnificent iconic events in their own right. But I will take the opportunity to informally reiterate to the people I meet with in Winton and Longreach 
 this Saturday that we gave an undertaking—the Prime Minister, John Howard, gave an absolute undertaking—that there was a fair 10-point plan and that we would not be walking away from that 10-point plan, and I will say that that is exactly what we have done in the houses of parliament this particular week and this particular moment.</para><para>I note that one Independent has expressed particular interest this morning. The member who has been the most consistent of the Independents is the member for Calare (Mr Andren). At every stage he has opposed giving the farmers a fair go in respect of the 10-point plan. I will allow this: he has been absolutely consistent on this; he has been absolutely consistent with the Labor Party on this. In respect of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), sometimes she has been here and sometimes she has not. She has not even fronted for some of the key divisions on the Wik legislation.</para><para>I want to conclude by quoting from a committee hearing in respect of native title. That committee hearing took place on 24 September in Canberra. The member for Page (Mr Causley) asked Mr Djerrkura, whom I greatly respect, a couple of questions. I simply read from the transcript of that particular deliberation of the committee at that meeting. The member for Page said:</para><para>Many of the legal minds that we have had before the committee have said that they think the High Court is saying that it is access to land for hunting, gathering and ceremonial rights. Do you agree with that, or do you think that it is more than that?</para><para>Mr Djerrkura replied:</para><para>Of course it is much more than that . . . It is a total being. The land is our mother . . . Particularly in today's world, there is a willingness by indigenous people to participate in commercial activities.</para><para>Fair enough. He went on to say:</para><para>It is total ownership. It is a recognition of our rights to this country. That is what native title reflects. That is something we are not going to surrender.</para><para>This 10-point plan, this legislation, does not wipe out native title across mainland Australia. It provides a fair process in accord with the utterances of Mr Djerrkura and others at that very key committee hearing last year. What we are about is a fair outcome, an 
 equality of rights and a determination which now must go before the people of Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>2967</page.no><name role="metadata">Melham, Daryl, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MELHAM</name><name.id>4T4</name.id><electorate>Banks</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If the <inline ref="r455">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]</inline>  forms part of a double dissolution trigger, then let us be under no mistake: it will be a race based election. It will be divisive and it will be ugly. Not only will the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have diminished his office, he will have diminished the nation and he will have diminished each and every one of us, because this is totally unnecessary. What has driven this is low grade politics and the fact that this government has been the captive of sectional interest.</para></talk.start><para>The first sticking point is the Racial Discrimination Act. It was coalition policy that amendments to the Native Title Act would respect the Racial Discrimination Act. The Prime Minister repeated that in this parliament when questioned. He repeated that to every community group. The first sticking point was a core promise of this government both before and after the election and we will hold them to it. We will hold them to it because, if one reads Mabo, if one reads the Western Australian challenge to our Native Title Act and if one reads Justice Brennan in the Wik case, one realises that without the Racial Discrimination Act the states can extinguish native title. That is where the `bucketfuls of extinguishment' are.</para><para>In relation to the second test, the threshold test, this government seeks to make it harder for indigenous people to pursue native title claims under this act than it is under the common law. What will that do? It will drive indigenous people to the courts to assert their common law rights. What does that do? It creates delays, uncertainty and unworkability. Development will be at a standstill. What will a sunset clause do? It will repeat the mistakes of the framers of the constitution. In the 1890s when the constitution was framed there were negative references to indigenous Australians because the framers thought that they would not be with us much longer, that they would die and we would not have to worry about them in the constitution. So a sunset clause means that they are not going to be a 
 problem in six months time or in six years time—a total misreading of what this act is about, an alternative to the common law, an alternative that puts people at the table.</para><para>The fourth sticking point is the right to negotiate—not a right of veto. The second explanatory memorandum of the government at page 15, paragraph 3.15 says:</para><para>The right to negotiate was not a veto.</para><para>It is a right to be consulted. Why is it there? Because it is an intrinsic element of native title. But, more importantly, if you want a constitutional bill and you want to acquire the property rights, even of indigenous Australians, just terms acquisition requires consultation, a proper process. And, at the end of the process, there is a right of override. The Labor Party, from the outset, stood ready to provide a solution that had the broad support of the parliament. That was rejected by the Prime Minister.</para><para>Senator Harradine set the bottom line on this bill because the Democrats, the Greens and Labor still did not have the numbers. Senator Harradine—a decent, honourable human being—gave the government two out of four of their sticking points and was told by the Prime Minister, `Not enough.' Why? Because they did not want a solution. They do not want an outcome because there is a Queensland election around the corner and they want some votes on this. I say this: you might get an outcome that is not agreed to, but in the end you are not above the courts and you are not above the constitution.</para><para>Justice McHugh, one of the more conservative judges on the High Court, had this to say in the unreported judgment of the Waanyi case at page 52:</para><para>The community will quickly lose confidence in the courts of justice if a perception arises that the courts are ready to ignore the legal rights of individuals whenever intervening governments or litigants urge that public or private convenience requires such rights to be by-passed.</para><para>That is what this debate has been about: ignoring the property rights of indigenous Australians, ignoring the common law rights of indigenous Australians—throwing them off the table. They went to our courts and had a terrific victory. We should have respected the 
 High Court.

Native title for them is a substantial part of the solution to that problem. Of course equality before the law is important for all Australians and it is an issue, but equality in the terms described by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) this morning misrepresents the situation—and that has been the flaw in the government's position throughout in this debate.

Minister, are you aware of repeated approaches that have been made to your office, going back to August of 1996, from Lt Col. Harry Smith, retired, who was the officer who commanded D Company 6 RAR at the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966? Why have you not investigated Colonel Smith's allegations that his recommendations for Military Cross awards for two of his platoon commanders in that battle were destroyed and that they were given a lesser award, one that was also handed out to the postal clerk at Vung Tau? Why did you refuse to investigate these matters before closing the End of War List for the Vietnam War, and will you now give the House an undertaking that these issues will be fully investigated and that the Australian soldiers, who clearly displayed gallant and distinguished service in action at the Battle of Long Tan, are properly recognised.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>SE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BISHOP</name><name role="display">Mrs Bishop</name></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>I am aware of LTCOL Harry Smith correspondence concerning nominations for military awards in the Battle of Long Tan.</para><para>LTCOL Smith raised the issue with this Government on three occasions, with the Prime Minister in August 1996, with my Senior Adviser in May 1997 and with me in December 1997. The letter of August 1996 being to the Prime Minister was in part referred to my office for response which was given by my Senior Adviser. It was also dealt with by the PM's Parliamentary Secretary. The May 1997 letter written to my Senior Adviser was responded to in full. Correspondence relevant to Mr Bevis's question is set out below.</para><para>LTCOL Smith's second letter, being the letter to my Senior Adviser is a lengthy eight page letter largely dealing with his recollection of the Battle of Long Tan and the difficulties he had with his immediate commander. This letter was also responded to.</para><para>In his only letter to me on 16 December 1997, he again traverses the same ground but asks that the matters raised by him be treated as a special case, which is not in line with Government policy. As was stated to him it is only possible to include people on the End of War List who were recommended at the highest level in Vietnam. This letter is still with the Department.</para><para>I have retrieved from our records the recommendation for Honours and Awards in respect of the two platoon commanders of concern to LTCOL Smith. The recommendations were made by the Commanding Officer of 6RAR, countersigned by the Commander of the First Australian Taskforce and the Commander Australian Force Vietnam. The awards recommended were for Mention In Dispatches which were in fact made. It is important to point out that at the time of the Vietnam War, the MID was awarded for both meritorious service under adverse conditions and for acts of bravery under fire.</para><para>It does not reflect well on Mr Bevis to disparage the award given to one individual while trying to promote the worthiness of others.</para><para>This is just another legacy of the Labor Government's thirteen years of inaction and bad policy which this Government has to clean up.</para><para>This Government did promise that if further cases come to light of recommendations for Honours and Awards which meet the Government's criteria, (i.e. being recommended at the highest level in Vietnam and then either not awarded or down graded) we would deal with those cases.
