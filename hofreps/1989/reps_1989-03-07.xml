<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia will host a major international chemical weapons conference later this year. The conference will bring together governments and representatives of the international chemical industry. It will discuss the growing problems of the trade in feedstocks, plant, equipment and knowhow which are being diverted to the production of chemical weapons. The idea of the conference followed discussions between Senator Gareth Evans and United States Secretary of State Baker about how to build on the momentum created by the Paris conference on this matter in January this year. It is interesting to note this comment on Australia's decision to host the conference, made yesterday by the Secretary of State:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>For a number of years, Australia has played a leading role internationally in trying to prevent the spread of chemical weapons, including as the leader of the Australian group of Western chemical producing states.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia has worked very actively with other governments to establish barriers against inadvertent involvement of several chemical industries in other nations' chemical weapons programs. This has included, firstly, convening consultations among 19 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, known as the Aus Group, to develop coordinated export controls over chemical weapons preservers; secondly, developing consultations with regional governments to prevent the spread of chemical weapons in our neighbourhood and building a constructive working dialogue with Australia's own chemical industry. Like the Paris conference, the proposed conference will be supportive of the aims of the chemical weapons convention under negotiation at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. A comprehensive global convention banning chemical weapons once and for all remains Australia's prime objective in this pressing area of disarmament. The fact that we will be hosting the conference referred to by the honourable member is a further reflection of our leadership role in the international efforts against the spread of chemical weapons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. In the first draft of the Commonwealth-State task force report on Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, it was estimated that a third runway would increase capacity by 83.5 per cent. The Commonwealth, without explanation, insisted that this be downgraded to 40 per cent. Last week in the Parliament the junior Minister, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, said that a third runway would increase capacity by only 15 per cent, but in his 1987 election advertising he claimed that a third runway would increase capacity by 65 per cent. In view of these confusing and conflicting statements, will the Minister tell us what advice he has received on extra capacity for each specific third runway option, in particular for the medium spaced proposals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The conflict that the honourable member for Richmond thinks he is pointing to just demonstrates the sheer ignorance of the Opposition on matters relating to this airport.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The capacity that a third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport will bring to the airport will depend on where the runway is put. If it were close spaced, it would not increase capacity very much. If it were medium spaced, it would give more capacity. If it were wide spaced, it would give even more capacity. In the dying days of the previous Government, it finally gathered together the courage to make a decision about Sydney. We have made plenty of decisions about Sydney. Those opposite will hear a lot about that if they listen to the matter of public importance. What the previous Government decided was to have a close spaced runway. That would give a minimal increase in capacity and on a cost-benefit basis would be a ridiculous thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>EXERCISE KANGAROO 89</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. What training benefits, if any, will the Australian Defence Force derive from exercise Kangaroo 89? Is the cost of that exercise justified?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="510" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen in debate in this House comment by the Opposition that the cancellation of Kangaroo 89 would be a desirable thing on the ground that strategic circumstances have changed since the planning took place. What that demonstrates is that in this critical area of defence policy, in which it does not have a shadow Cabinet Minister, it is as ignorant as it is on every other major area of policy that the Parliament is obliged to deal with. The point about the Kangaroo 89 exercise is that it is about the testing of our capability to deal with low level contingencies that might arise with little warning. The point about that exercise that provoked the comments of the Opposition was a discussion in this place of the fact that we do not plan our defence forces on the basis of the least likely threat, which is a massive invasion of this country. What Kangaroo 89 is directed at is based on not only the intelligence advice that we have received since we have been in office but also intelligence advice that our opponents received when they were in office, that is, the probability or possibility of a low level of threat arising in a very short period. In doing that, our defence forces maintain and develop their capabilities to act over very long distances indeed. So in testing our capacity to defend against low level harassment in our area of direct military interest-that is a threat directly aimed at us-we also test our capacity to operate elsewhere if need be, and that includes operations outside the immediate area of this country. So in terms of all the likely low level contingencies that are going to arise, Kangaroo 89 exercises our capacity to deal with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that a number of defence exercises have been cancelled in order to make up the numbers engaged in this exercise. In fact, something like $70m worth of defence exercises has been cancelled in order to pay for more than $90m worth of exercises associated with this. Why would they be cancelled? Because instead of exercising the individual elements of the armed forces singly, as would be the case on those particular exercises, they are now exercised in a joint and combined fashion. They have maintained and developed, in terms of their individual unit skills, exactly the same sort of benefits that they would have had from those exercises that they did on their own. They have the additional benefits of added resources in this exercise and an opportunity to operate as combined arms. If Opposition members want to see the genesis of this Kangaroo 89 exercise, they can go back into the exercises organised when they were in office in the early part of the 1980s. We have been extending those series of exercises, developing them and refining them.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a very strange thing-because the Opposition is yet to release its defence policy-that what is now emerging from the Opposition is no discussion relevant to either the intelligence assessments related to this country or the strategic planning that occurred under both the Opposition and us, but some sort of wild throwback to the 1960s, to an era that has long since disappeared. One can only guess why this should be the case and why there should be calls for cutting out the most important exercise, albeit one of a series building up to this point in a way that started under the Opposition. There can be only one reason for cutting out this exercise and that is that the Opposition must be opening up ways for defence cuts. It is true that if all Opposition members wish to do is to show the flag, if they do not wish to be serious about the defence of this country, they do not need a dozen frigates, or whatever, as they can probably make do with two or three; they certainly do not need the air defence capabilities that this country is building up with FA18 aircraft based across the north and F111 bombers; and they do not need an army the size of 32,000. They can do all of that if they want to and show the flag around the neighbourhood with an awful lot less than half of the type of military capability that we have in this country. We have major military capabilities in this country. We are developing those capabilities further and we are expanding them significantly. The fact is that our expansions and the expenditures that we make on them are directed towards detailed strategic planning. Obviously, Opposition members are incapable of that. They are incapable of understanding a strategic basis for a defence policy. They are incapable of understanding an intelligence estimate to go into that strategic basis, and they are incapable of devising a defence strategy that gives this country the security it needs.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="511" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer to the honourable member's question is that not one organisation which purports to represent Australia's rural industries has presented any alternative policies for the primary industries and resource sector-not that any are needed. Frankly, on this side of the House we are all breathlessly awaiting some form of policy document from the Opposition. At the time the Leader of the Opposition introduced his policy of `jumping forward into the 1950s' the Deputy Leader of the National Party made his last promise-that he would have a policy on the table by February. It is a week into March and we have not heard a thing. We know what the problem is with the Opposition. It is hopelessly split over the fundamental question of wheat marketing. This is symptomatic of the problem that members of the National Party have with policy formation. There is not an original thought among the lot of them, so they have to be told by the various farmer industry groups what their policy really is. This traditional head in the sand approach has finally been put to the test by the Liberal Party. It is a battle of wits. It has made even the honourable members for O'Connor and Wannon look pretty good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the National Party is having a problem with policy formation it is hardly being assisted by the farm groups themselves. In matters of policy the National Farmers Federation, which has added a bit of thrust to policy making, is dodging its own constituency. For example, it fought tooth and nail against the Government's consumption tax proposals three years ago, but has now gone full circle and wants a goods and services tax. So no doubt the National Party will be turning the same big circle. I can assure it that if it wants a broad based indirect tax it will have to justify to the farmers and everyone else a tax on all food, all clothing and everything else. It will have to justify every farmer filling in an additional form for tax on everything he or she sells and buys. The National Farmers Federation supports the slashing of tariffs but the sugar growers want tariffs of up to 140 per cent. The National Farmers Federation wants deregulation but it cannot get that notion past the Grains Council of Australia or the Queensland Cane Growers Council, who want to maintain regulation. The National Farmers Federation constantly calls for big Budget cuts-$9 billion-but wants extra spending on roads, wool promotion, research and other big ticket items. It is obvious that the people who dictate policy to the Nationals cannot get their act together either. It is very apparent that the National Party will be flat out again coming up with an election policy. This next election is one it will lose, again, because it is a laughing stock in the bush, is led by a troglodyte and is totally irrelevant.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="512" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. This concern for defence personnel is well known in this place. The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is yes. The Prime Minister, in the course of his statement to the House yesterday, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Repatriation benefits appropriate to the tasks and hazards encountered will also be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>Having regard to the risks confronting the peacekeeping force-risks which were well canvassed during the Prime Minister's statement and the ensuing debate-I can confirm that the force will be regarded as being on operational service. The Government will push through the necessary legislative amendments during the current sittings. I am confident that we will have the cooperation of the Opposition, given what was said in the course of debate yesterday. In the interim, my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has gazetted the force to provide it with the coverage that normally applies to peacekeepers.</PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable members may not fully understand the implications of that decision. It is, after all, something that no previous government has done in respect of an Australian peacekeeping force as listed in schedule 3 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In basic terms if means that members of this force will be entitled to the full range of benefits and entitlements available under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. For example, they will be eligible for service pension and certain associated allowances. An appropriate amendment will also be made to the Defence Service Homes Act to extend coverage to the small number of Namibian peacekeepers who would not otherwise quality for a defence service homes loan.</PARA>
<PARA> In coming to this decision in respect of this force, the Government should not be regarded as setting a precedent for the conditions which will apply to any future peacekeeping force. Those conditions will have to be assessed at the time and on the basis of the likely danger. Nor should it be assumed that it presages a review on our part of the conditions that applied to previous forces. The point is that what we are doing in the exercise we are going through, in determining the conditions of the service personnel that are going to Namibia, is identifying them as a peacekeeping force that is distinctly different from those in which we have been involved in the past, with some functions-particularly given the nature of those troops as engineers-that are more roughly the equivalent of the sorts of experiences of troops who were deployed to theatres such as Borneo and Vietnam. That would not be the normal condition of peacekeepers. We would not regard those currently engaged in peacekeeping operations elsewhere-for example, in Iran, Iraq or the Lebanon-as operating under the same conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> An essential difference here-this will in some form or another feature in the amendments to the Act-is the fact that this force has been designated as required to be armed. Whilst out on operations the soldiers will carry weapons. That is, of course, a very considerable distinction between their situation and that of the other peacekeeping operations that I have referred to. In order to be able to do this, to demonstrate that it is a one-off and not a general extension of conditions which appropriately apply to return of service in operational theatres in areas where there is not, in our view, the requirement to do that, we will require amendments to the Act and they will be brought forward.</PARA>

Perhaps I can add slightly to my previous answer to extend some further information to the Opposition about the lead times and so on. This would apply whether the development went ahead in either the public sector or the private sector. On the best advice that has been given to me, I believe we could complete by the end of this year an accelerated acquisition process using the intended new Act. If that were done, it is possible-even probable-that that would be completed before construction commencement.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="514" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that my Department in 1987 sold an F28 aircraft to Ansett Transport Industries. Of course, 1987 was well before I became Minister for Transport and Communications. The disposal of the aircraft followed the Department's decision in 1985 to replace one of its F28 aircraft with a smaller, more efficient, less noisy jet aircraft. The action was principally designed to reduce the cost of the Department's jet aircraft flying program. In order to identify the most suitable aircraft type, in October 1985 the Department publicly invited registrations of interest from aircraft suppliers for the exchange of one of the Department's F28s for a small twin jet aircraft. Nine organisations responded to the request. Evaluation of the expressions of interest led to the BAE125 aircraft being considered the most suitable replacement for the F28.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 26 October the Department decided to invite public tenders for the provision of a BAE125 in exchange for the F28. Advertisements were placed in the Australian national press and the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, and copies of the tender documents were forwarded to Australian Government representatives in Washington and London for regional distribution. In addition, invitations were issued directly to about 20 companies. Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd was the successful tenderer. I am advised that the tender procedures complied with Finance regulations and that the then Department of Local Government and Administrative Services was consulted. It considered the proposal reasonable and that it would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth to accept the Ansett offer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department took over the BAE125 aircraft and released the F28 to Ansett during December of 1987. I understand that Ansett subsequently sold the aircraft overseas-for what price, of course, we do not know, although I have noticed that Mr McMahon, the General Manager of Ansett, was reported in the press today as saying that the aircraft was sold for a small profit. The allegations made in a question yesterday by the honourable member for Richmond that there was no tender process and that the Department of Administrative Services procedures had not been adhered to were quite incorrect. Everything was absolutely above board. All of the appropriate procedures were adhered to. I suggest that the honourable member, instead of engaging in scuttlebutt, get on with the real issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister will be aware that the oldest political party in Australia will celebrate its centenary in two years' time. It was, as all honourable members will know, an aftermath of the debilitating shearers' strike in 1891. He would also be aware that the first branch meeting was held under the Tree of Knowledge at Barcaldine. That is when the word `masochism' was introduced into the English language. For some years now members of the local community have been working very hard to establish an interpretive centre to commemorate the early pioneers, the shearers and those who founded the Australian Labor Party. They have sought, so far without success, financial support from both State and Federal governments. It would appear that there may be some reluctance on the Government's part to provide that assistance because of possible criticism from the non-Labor side of politics. I ask the Prime Minister: Will he give consideration to this request and, if necessary, discuss the matter with the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party on the grounds that, while the shearers strike and the Tree of Knowledge are an important part of the Labor Party's history, they are also a very important part of the nation's history? I would hope that when, in the near future, the Liberal Party has its fiftieth birthday and the National Party its seventy-fifth, the Labor Party would similarly acknowledge their contribution to our heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think everyone will agree that the town of Barcaldine in central Queensland has a special place in the history of the Australian Labor movement and, indeed, the Australian nation. There, in June 1891, shearers did meet under what has become known as the Tree of Knowledge and, with the imminent collapse of their great strike that was being conducted at that time, they determined to pursue their just cause through the ballot box. The aspirations of those bush workers merged with those of other working men and women throughout Australia. As a result of that impetus, we then saw the birth of the Australian Labor Party. Out of the adversity of the defeat which they then suffered came hope for future success and for ultimate progress towards the creation in this country of a fairer society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shire of Barcaldine is proposing to mark the centenary of this event, as the honourable member suggested, with the establishment of an interpretation centre.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member wants to knock the shire, that is his business. We will duly note that he is knocking their suggestion. It is the suggestion of the shire, and we will convey the honourable member's attitude, that he is knocking their suggestion. I was first approached by them in 1986 with a request for assistance for a project to mark the shearers strike of 1891. There were subsequent meetings with several of my Ministers, and the Deputy Prime Minister unveiled the Tree of Knowledge monument in 1987 at Barcaldine. The monument was built with Commonwealth assistance of $20,040. The Government has provided a range of other assistance measures: $25,000 towards two archaeological surveys of the site, and $20,000 towards a consultant study on the viability of an interpretation centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the provision of further Commonwealth funds, the Government's current guidelines restrict the funding of museum capital works to Commonwealth establishments. This position has been advised by the present Minister for Arts and Territories and I believe it was advised by the honourable member for Robertson himself when he held the portfolio responsibility. Having said that, may I say that this commemorative project has my full personal support and I have indicated to the shire that I will assist in any appropriate way with fund raising for the project, and I reiterate to the shire today that I personally will do whatever I can to help. As for that part of the honourable gentleman's question which suggests that I should have a talk with the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party, I am more than happy to do that. On the basis of the record so far, I would not think it would be terribly productive, but I am always ambitious in these matters and I will talk to them.</PARA>

Let me just say in connection with the proposed F5 freeway that a considerable amount of work has already been done by the Roads and Traffic Authority in New South Wales concerning the possible route and the design of it. I indicated in Sydney a couple of weeks ago that if the Government pursued the expedition of the policy decision that has been made concerning the development of any aviation facility at Badgerys Creek, there would be no question about the Government also making adequate provision for people's transport.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. Did the Minister receive a card from motorist organisations with 2c attached? Is this part of the Australian Automobile Association's (AAA) political campaign against the Federal Government's road funding program and is there any substance in the Association's assertions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="516" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CHARLTON" MINISTERIAL="LAND TRANSPORT AND SHIPPING SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I did. I also understand from a newspaper report, from the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) at least, that one of those cards was sent to each member of the House of Representatives-that is 148-and to 76 members of the Senate as well. I think that part of the campaign went down like a lead balloon, because only about two people have mentioned to me that they received it. It really has not had a great deal of impact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that I would like to mention is that although the 2c attached to each of those cards really represents a relatively small amount of money, I suppose it does reflect the general contempt that the NRMA and the other State affiliates of the AAA have shown for the subscriptions of their members. Any honourable members who are members of those State motorist organisations need to keep in mind that part of the subscription is being used to fund a $6m campaign against the road funding programs of the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Throsby asks whether there was any basis to the claims of the AAA. It has made essentially two claims. The first is that the Hawke Government has reduced the level of funding for roads. It has done no such thing. In fact the Hawke Government, during its six years, has applied directly to the national roads system a greater volume of money in both nominal and real terms than has ever been applied by any government in any six-year period in the history of this Commonwealth. In fact the amount has increased by over 20 per cent in real terms and that represents an annual average increase of $250m every year for those six years. The second claim it has made is that only 20 per cent of the fuel excise goes back into the road system. I want to emphasise that that 20 per cent represents what the Federal Government injects back into the road system directly, that is, $1.2 billion. But, in addition, the State governments inject another $1.6 billion back into the road system, largely from the over $12 billion that the Federal Government makes available to them in untied grants. In addition to that, State governments put an extra $1.5 billion back into the road system. That represents $4.3 billion every year going back into the road system from three levels of government, and that represents 85 per cent of the fuel excise.</PARA>

It was also identified in the joint Commonwealth-New South Wales task force on Sydney basin needs in November of last year. Obviously, for unrestricted movement at Badgerys Creek, should the Cabinet proceed on that basis, some amendment of horizontal and vertical airspace boundaries would be needed in Sydney.

But he is not even prepared to make a comment on it. What is important is that he is not prepared to have a public discussion. In fact, the Minister and the Government at large are running what can only be described as a disinformation campaign on the construction of this vitally needed piece of social and economic infrastructure. One would think they were proposing to build a missile base or something. We are talking about an airport-a public works construction project. There should be public debate about it. But, no, the whole thing is being conducted in secret. The debate is political-not economic, not rational and not based on the needs of the industry or the needs of the community. There is a determination not to provide any information. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) has asked a series of questions of the Government about the construction of Badgerys Creek and, of course, on the third runway at Kingsford-Smith. I think some of these questions on notice go back a year. They are fairly straightforward and simple questions, but we still do not have answers. The reason we do not have answers is, firstly, that the Government does not know the answers, or, secondly, that it would be horribly embarrassed for its very junior Minister if the information became public. The whole situation has become a question of high farce. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year, as a result of questions we put in this place, the junior Minister made comments about how the Government would accelerate the construction of Badgerys Creek. He said that a submission would go to Cabinet before Christmas. It is now March. When that did not happen he said that the submission would go to Cabinet in February. That did not happen. It went to Cabinet but was postponed and now I am told the Government is trying to organise another meeting for Thursday of this week when it will finally take a decision. Today we appreciate from the answers we got from the Minister for Administrative Services that the Government really does not know what it will do and its starting point is general aviation. We have to contrast that comment with the comments made by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, who when he started to make his comments talked about a full international airport being constructed in five years. Then it went down to three years. The other week in this place he tabled letters from Lend Lease saying that it can build the airport in four years. He is not addressing the fact that the Government has not fulfilled the preconditions attached to the Lend Lease offer, and that is that it does not own the land. I will refer to some of the problems with acquiring land. It is interesting that the Government will use new legislation to acquire it on an accelerated program. That will be a very interesting proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to addressing some of the more fundamental issues, the Government is determined to walk away from them. It amazes me that it is not prepared to adopt a more rational approach to this facility. Someone in the Government must have some sort of conscience, and I hope it is Senator Walsh, the Minister for Finance. Whilst the proposal for a third runway is quite feasible in construction and economic terms, the Government is not prepared to do it. It keeps talking about accelerating the construction of Badgerys Creek. If the Government is going to make the announcement on Badgerys Creek properly, not only does it have to tell us what sort of facility it will have and when it will complete all the necessary arrangements before construction begins, such as the acquisition of the land, the environmental impact studies and the review of the flight paths around the Sydney basin, but also it has to tell us how much more the facility will cost us not than just the third runway but because it is being accelerated in its construction. It should also tell us how much more it will cost because it delayed its decision on going ahead with this facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the Prime Minister abruptly ended Question Time, I was going to ask the Government a further question. I hope that the Minister for Transport and Communications, who is at the table, and who will obviously respond to this motion, has an answer for me. The Government's official reports say that Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is currently operating at 200,000 movements a year. Two hundred and twenty thousand movements are anticipated by the end of 1990. The estimate by the Federal Airports Corporation is that the demand on Kingsford-Smith will reach 340,000 movements by the year 2000. That is not very far away. The Minister for Administrative Services has said that we can build a general aviation facility with some sort of international capacity. I wish he would be a bit more precise. </PARA>

I would like to know what the Government's estimates are of what sort of facility it needs to build to cope with the overflow and also to cope with the 100,000 movements that will be displaced from Hoxton Park when Badgerys Creek is open, because Hoxton Park is closed. How long will it take to construct that facility and what sort of air traffic control facilities will it apply to this new airport?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present I believe the Government is running for cover. It has dug itself a monumental hole. In fact, the hole has been dug by the junior Minister, and every time he says something he digs it a bit deeper. As I said, that is why he is not here today. The Government is desperately working behind the scenes to come up with some sort of proposal that will have some sort of credibility not only in this Parliament but also in the community and in the aviation industry. The general view of the aviation industry is that the Government is suffering from policy paralysis. It puts the interests of one member ahead of the entire industry and the tourist industry. It just does not believe that a facility can be built in three or four years. It believes that a more likely timeframe is of the order of 10 to 15 years and that the cost will be not $60m that Minister Punch offered late last year or the couple of hundred million dollars that he was talking about spending on Badgerys Creek in January, but more of the order of billions of dollars. It will be $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are talking about putting in international and commercial facilities, I wonder what sort of land transport corridor is available. I had at Question Time today a tape recording by the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown). He had a press conference in Sydney at which he said, `If there is a need to build a road link to Badgerys Creek, we can do it'. Then he was asked how he was going to pay for it. He said, `This Government has a $5.5 billion Budget surplus so there is no problem'. So today we asked the Treasurer whether he had authorised that statement and how much of his $5.5 billion surplus was going to be spent. He said, `I have no knowledge of this', and ran for cover. I wonder what the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, is going to say in the Senate if that question is put to him. It was a classic example of what some members of the `best Ministry since the war' say when they are let off the leash. They wander around the place making promises. It is a classic example of pork barrel politics, fiscal irresponsibility and getting into a tight corner and making promises because no-one will remember them. The great problem is that people actually make tape recordings of what goes on. </PARA>

<PARA>I hope the Minister will table the proposals for the new railway. He then said-and this is a classic statement-that it takes `no more than half an hour to 40 minutes' to cover the distance from the centre of Sydney through to Badgerys Creek. The problem is that the media is a bit like Parliament. It writes down what one says. Unless one is careful about what one says one has a monumental problem. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to Badgerys Creek it is not all plain sailing. It has massive problems. The largest dairy farm supplying milk to Sydney is located there. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission have stations there. The list goes on. It will need 70,000 cubic metres of fill, and the environmental impact studies have not been completed. At the very beginning of my remarks I said that this Government has allowed itself to be pushed into a political position as a result of the right wing of the Labor Party not thinking carefully about who got what job and also the national consequences of some very parochial politics that go back to the days when a certain person was campaigning for local government. It has just snowballed into a situation where we now have the entire aviation industry in Australia being held to ransom because this Government did not think through its policy. It does not think through its policy in transport and aviation very carefully. I could list at length its problems with Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Federal Airports Corporation, Perth Airport and a whole range of other issues. But the reality is that it does not have a policy position. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government needs to tell the Minister to be objective. If he is not prepared to be objective the Government should remove him. We should have a full public debate on what the airport needs of Sydney are. We should not have the determination to hide the information. We need to put it all on the table, take a rational decision and have an environmental impact study as proposed by the New South Wales Government. We should know what the costs of it are. We should then-and I am sure this is what we will end up doing-proceed to develop the third runway at Kingsford-Smith and also, on a rational cost effective timetable, develop a second airport for Sydney. We should not have this half-baked political response to a crisis that has arisen simply because one junior Minister cannot control his mouth and has pushed the Government to the limit of political credibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a quarter of an hour I have been waiting for the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt) to make a substantive point. Basically, we have had a quarter of an hour of gossip rather than any substantive point being made. The fact is that this Government is very much concerned about the aviation industry. It has shown that concern throughout the period that we have been in government and has made many decisions in relation to the aviation industry which have undoubtedly helped to set that industry on a much better footing than it was left on by our predecessors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My predecessor as Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Evans, issued a very comprehensive statement about aviation policy which included the historic decision to scrap the two-airline policy, which not only had been maintained throughout the long years of Liberal-Country Party government in the 1950s and 1960s but also was renegotiated in 1981 in a way which, particularly in relation to terminals, was rather scandalous. The Government has put an end to the two-airline policy. We want a much more efficient aviation industry in which there is greater scope for competition and a capacity for new entrants to come in, for better service and for cheaper fares. Generally, we want a much more dynamic aviation industry than this country has been given by the policies pursued during the long years of Liberal-Country Party government in the postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA> Part and parcel of the approach to the aviation industry is that we need to ensure that we have an adequate infrastructure for that industry. We have not been at all neglectful of that need. In fact, in the period that we have been in office we have made many decisions to improve that infrastructure, including, of course, the historic decision on where the second Sydney airport should be. That was a very important decision for government to make. Everyone recognises that sooner or later there will need to be a second Sydney airport; no-one is disputing that-not even, I believe, the honourable member for Richmond. So, the question is simply: Where will it be-we have made that decision-and when should it come into operation? That issue is under consideration at present. The decision to develop the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek was a very important one made by this Government. It followed a long environmental impact study involving 18 to 20 months-I think 20 months-of study before the decision was made as to where the airport should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made that decision, we have now moved on to the next stage of seeking to acquire the land. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) said during Question Time, we have acquired a little under half of the properties. Over the last few years $15m a year has been allocated for the acquisition of property. Obviously, there is still quite an amount to spend-in the order of $55m-to acquire the rest of the property; but that can be done in a relatively quick time frame, if the Government so decides, by use of the Lands Acquisition Act. Of course, the new Lands Acquisition Act, which is currently in the Senate, pays particular regard to the rights of individuals whose land is being acquired. From their point of view, it is a much better piece of legislation than that which currently prevails. But, of course, at present we are not pursuing a compulsory land acquisition process; we are doing it by way of voluntary purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we are well on the way to the establishment of the second Sydney airport. If the Government decides that we should accelerate that program, that can be done. The land can be acquired more quickly and we can move quickly into the development of that second Sydney airport. The question is: should that be done now or later? I am not going to canvass those arguments here. Those are arguments for consideration in Cabinet. Once Cabinet has made its decision we will be only too willing to tell this Parliament and the nation why we made that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is relevant to note that much of the controversy which has been occurring-probably much more outside the Parliament than inside it-in relation to whether there should be an immediate move to develop a second Sydney airport or to further develop the Kingsford-Smith Airport by use of a third runway has proceeded on a massive amount of misinformation. All sorts of people who have a vested interest in this issue one way or the other have been putting in their oars and saying things which are without real justification. In particular, one point I would like to draw attention to is the allegation by many people that there is a quick-fire solution to the need for more runway space in the Sydney region, and that is to build a third runway. The fact of life simply is that that is not a quick solution. There should be no misunderstanding about that at all. Whatever else one wants to say about it, it is not a quick solution because there would need to be an environmental impact statement. We have had an environmental impact statement for Badgerys Creek which was very comprehensive. Any further environmental impact statement that needed to be done would be a much smaller exercise than the one that was undertaken before. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the third runway, there would need to be a comprehensive environmental impact statement where no such study has been done. That would certainly take quite a period of time, after which the runway would need to be constructed, which cannot be done until there is a lot of filling in of the sea. That process would be very time consuming indeed. I am not going to go into our understanding of these time schedules now, but let me say quite emphatically that, in our considered view, looking at all of the evidence we now have available to us, there is no doubt whatever that in the time frame that it takes to build a third runway we could have a quite substantial second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Moving on, what is also true is that this Government in the period it has been in office has taken quite a number of steps to improve Kingsford-Smith Airport, particularly in relation to the international terminal. We are just completing a $40m upgrade to that terminal, which was built about the end of the 1960s, since which time traffic has increased enormously. The fastest growing segment of traffic at Kingsford-Smith Airport is the international traffic, and that terminal was certainly being stretched to bursting point. With that $40m upgrade we can contain the situation but it is certainly far from ideal. As a consequence, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is now proceeding to develop a $214m addition to the international terminal, a very extensive addition to the capacity of that terminal to handle international traffic. Of course, this will greatly upgrade Kingsford-Smith as an international airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is also happening in relation to the domestic area is that we have negotiated with the major airlines an increase in the amount of terminal space and the number of gates for both Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia in the forthcoming years, which involves considerable expenditure by both those airlines and the FAC in the support infrastructure which it has to provide. Of course, those airlines are also required by the condition of those leases to provide space for any new entrants who may come in with deregulation of the airlines from October 1990. So not only are we adding to the capacity of Sydney to cope with additional traffic at its gates and not all at stand off positions but we are providing for new entrants to be accommodated at those gates. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist with the operation of the airport, there is also a move by the Civil Aviation Authority to introduce new radar to Sydney Airport. Its radar is getting a little old, although it is not unusual for airports around the world to operate with radar of that age. We are moving to slightly increase the capacity of the airport by adopting new radar, which not only makes the life of air traffic controllers easier but will increase the efficiency of the airport by 2 or 3 per cent. Increasing the capacity of the airport is important because, whether Kingsford-Smith has a third runway or Badgerys Creek is constructed, we will certainly need to cope with the next few years and, therefore, we need to take various steps that will enable us to increase the scope of the airport to cope with the continuing increase in traffic over those few years. So radar acquisition is one such step. </PARA>
<PARA> There are various other traffic management procedures that will need to be introduced. Those measures are being considered in the broad by Cabinet at the present time. They will be considered in detail in a little while from now. What that basically amounts to is taking steps which will ensure that Kingsford-Smith maintains a viable operation until additional runway space is available somewhere in the Sydney region. What the means is that, with the pace of growth of the traffic which we have been experiencing in Australia at Kingsford-Smith, like many other major airports around the world, we are bumping against capacity much sooner than had been expected a few years ago. </PARA>

Can I also say, in relation to that, that the major issue that has been raised of commuters and commuter traffic is one that will be considered by Cabinet in what is before it at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should also mention that one of the steps being taken, and which is public, is that the FAC is introducing peak period pricing for non-regular passenger transport arriving at Kingsford-Smith during peak periods. That comes in from 1 April, and there will be a minimum charge of $200. Of course, what that indicates is that light traffic that comes in at that time particularly is using up valuable airport time and space and, indeed, takes up more time of the airport than the normal trunk line traffic because it travels more slowly and needs a greater separation time than those aircraft and jet aircraft or, indeed, than two jet aircraft. So with greater separation time and slower speed that traffic takes up much more time at the airport. It is, therefore, appropriate that it pay a reasonable price for the valuable airport time and space that it is taking when it comes in at peak period. Peak period pricing is one step along the way to ensuring that we can provide continuing capacity for the major trunk traffic, commuter and international traffic, over the next few years. This matter of public importance which has been raised today from the Opposition is simply an attempt to get the Government to commit itself before Thursday. The Government will make its commitment when it has considered all the issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin with a few facts. Last year 200,000 aircraft movements were registered at Kingsford-Smith Airport in Sydney; 220,000 movements are expected to be registered in 1990, and 340,000 movements by the year 2000. Four million people pass through Kingsford-Smith Airport every year; two million of those people are delayed because of the inadequacy of Kingsford-Smith Airport. Australia has some of the highest air fares in the world. Part of the reason for this is the bungling of this Government and the delays caused at Kingsford-Smith Airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another fact: $30m is spent annually by Australian airlines in circling Kingsford-Smith Airport and in aircraft waiting on the ground burning fuel because of the inadequacy of that airport. Another fact: we can overcome some of those problems with the third runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport. Another fact: Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines, Ansett and every major business group in Sydney are demanding a third runway because that is the only solution that we have to the problem that confronts the whole of Australia as a result of the congestion at Kingsford-Smith Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Another fact: in 1983 the Liberal Government gave the go-ahead for that third runway. In 1984 the present Government said that that project would not continue. We really have to look at the record on international airport developments by the Labor Party. Do honourable members remember Towra Point? Do we remember Galston? Both of those were Labor initiatives and both were absolute disasters. Is the decision on Badgerys Creek that we expect to be made on Thursday going to be another Galston or another Towra Point? Will the Minister who brought us the electoral voting system in Canberra also be making the major input into what the future development of Sydney airport needs is going to be? If that is the situation, what future can we hope for Australia? There is a very great worry within the Sydney community as to the effects of the non-development of that third runway and just what those effects are going to be. I guess we are already seeing some of the rub-off of what is happening there. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the tremendous expansion of tourism into Australia, which is going to continue. By the year 2000 we will have at least five million international visitors coming into Australia annually. Now half the total of international visitors coming into Australia go through Sydney. The worst sort of advertising that we can possibly have for promoting international tourism is bad mouthing Australia. One of the worst things that we can do is to have arriving in Australia people who experience delays in getting on to the ground and delays in getting through Customs and Immigration; and once a holiday is over and they have to go home, they object to the further delays that they are now subjected to by virtue of the problem of Sydney international airport. </PARA>
<PARA> I would think most members of this House, who tend to fly late in the afternoon, especially on Thursdays and Fridays, have seen the effect of overcrowding at Kingsford-Smith Airport. Up to 15 aircraft at any one time are lined up, waiting to take off, with regular delays of 20 minutes. It is not unusual to have delays of up to 50 minutes in departures for domestic aircraft out of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. We are told these days by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mr Punch) that in three or four years we can get a brand new international airport at Badgerys Creek. I refer to the Hansard record of the adjournment debate on 2 April 1984 about the future requirements of Kingsford-Smith Airport. The speaker said he was looking at a growth rate of up to 60 per cent, another 20,000 planes per year. He said that we really need to do something about a new international airport, and then said:</PARA>
<PARA>The lead time to construct that runway is an estimated seven years. The lead time for a second airport is 10 to 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA>On 26 March 1987, during the debate on private investment in airport terminals, when we were talking about the development of a third runway or a second international airport for Sydney, that speaker said that either the runway or the new international airport `would take in the order of eight to 10 years to build, presuming of course that a second runway could be built into Botany Bay'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speaker on those occasions was the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, who comes in here now and tells us that he is going to build a brand new airport at Badgerys Creek in three or four years. The real facts are these: it is absolutely impossible to get a fully operating brand new international airport under way at Badgerys Creek in less than 10 years. If the Government wants to do it in 10 years it will have to fast track the project. If it fast tracks the project, it will have the same situation as it had with the new Parliament House-there is going to be a doubling of the cost. Ten years' time is the earliest that we could possibly get a brand new international airport running in Sydney. The fact is that it would take three to five years to get a third runway operating at Kingsford-Smith Airport. That is bad enough but, if the Government had had the sense to proceed with that project after it came to office in 1984, that would be operating now and we would not have the difficulties that we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another fact which the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis), referred to is that the navigational equipment and the safety aids operating out of Sydney are decades old. I think it has been a matter of gross neglect that they have not been upgraded over the years. Sydney operates on aircraft separations of three minutes. In a parallel runway situation in places such as Chicago and Los Angeles, aircraft separations are 20 seconds. I am not suggesting that Australia need go to a stage where we have 20-second separations, but there is a very great difference between a separation of 20 seconds and a separation of three minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that we are understaffed with air traffic controllers and the new air traffic controllers we are getting in at the moment have not had the training to handle the heavy traffic; we have antiquated equipment; and we have absolutely no indication, apart from what the Minister just mumbled, of what we are going to do to update that equipment. But do we hear anything from the Government about putting a little vision into the situation at Kingsford-Smith Airport? The Australian of 15 February of this year reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Precision-landing techniques being tried in the United States could double the capacity of Sydney airport, if a small, additional runway were built. </PARA>
<PARA> This would invalidate the Federal Government's claim that a proposed close-spaced runway at Sydney would increase capacity by only about 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, if we worked closely with the Federal aviation authorities in the United States we would see that we could double the capacity of Sydney international airport in a few years with that extra runway. One would then wonder, in light of what is happening with aircraft development, whether we would need that second airport at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Blunt), who spoke earlier, indicated that the cost of building Badgerys Creek on a planned basis is about $1 billion in today's terms. The fast track method would cost about $2 billion. A third runway for Kingsford-Smith Airport would, if built now, cost about $300m. But we could get that into place and get it operating in three to five years and save a lot of money. We could then invest in the futuristic air traffic control mechanisms that are being developed and use them within a matter of years. But no, we have to go through the charade that is being put on, and has been put on by this Government for some years now, as to what the real situation is concerning Kingsford-Smith Airport. The situation is that there are 16,000 people, many of whom live in the electorate of Barton, working at the airport. I suppose they will all be very thrilled about packing a cut lunch and a thermos of Milo to take out to Badgerys Creek when they go to work, because that is what will happen. Within the immediate area of Kingsford-Smith Airport an additional 60,000 jobs are being provided from offshoots to the requirements of that airport. International airlines are presently looking at other destinations to avoid the bottleneck at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith). Let the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) go back to his electorate and confess that he is depriving the people of Sydney of jobs for their kids. That is what he is doing. Every time the number of international visitors to Australia increases by a net 1,400, that means an additional job for a young Australian. The cartoon in this morning's Canberra Times was right. It shows people sitting in the terminal and the caption reads:</PARA>
<PARA>We apologize for the congestion and delay caused by the Hawke Government's concern for the marginal Sydney seat of Barton held by a Mr Gary Punch . . . We sincerely hope he is worth it . . . </PARA>

<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Opposition members were quiet for a moment they might learn something. The honourable member for Fadden suggested that we on this side of the House were responsible for stopping the construction of an airport at Towra Point and an airport at Galston. If the honourable member looks across the aisle at the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) he will see someone who has claimed in previous speeches in this House to be partly responsible for stopping the construction of an airport at Towra Point. The honourable member for Cook is nodding in agreement. The honourable member for Cook, along with Labor members at the time, fought hard against the Towra Point proposal. It was not the Labor Party which stopped Towra Point; it was the residents of St George and the Sutherland Shire who thought it was inappropriate. I point out to the honourable member for Fadden that it is totally inappropriate to suggest that we stopped any potential sites for a second airport for Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What was the position of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) in 1973-74 when the Whitlam Labor Government suggested that Galston should be the site of our second international airport? Members on the other side of the House whipped up a campaign of opposition in their local areas to stop Galston being chosen as the site. So they should not suggest that people on their side of politics were the ones who had the solutions to Sydney's aviation problems. Both sides of the House have delayed for too long in solving those problems. I believe that the Hawke Labor Government will go down in history as the Government that finally made the decision on the site for Sydney's second international airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) trumpets in this House that he was the Minister for Aviation who took the decision to build a new runway at Mascot and that it was the Hawke Labor Government which stopped the development of that second runway. He conveniently forgets to remind the House that that runway was not a medium space parallel runway, which he seeks to suggest when he makes those comments; it was a close space parallel runway, which would have increased capacity by only 15 per cent. The honourable member knows that that is right. So even taking into account those figures and the figures cited by the honourable member for Fadden, we would already be looking for another site for Sydney's second international airport. That was the Opposition's answer to the problems. It would have built a close space parallel runway-not a wide space or medium space runway-that would have cost as much as Badgerys Creek. We would have been in exactly the same position that we are in today. We would still need a site for a new airport for Sydney. That is the problem with the Opposition. It wants the quick fix; it wants the short term solutions. It is totally obsessed with shortsightedness and with looking for a quick fix. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this Government should be commended for looking at Sydney's aviation problems and deciding on the long term answer. As all members on this side of the House are aware, the long term answer does not involve a new runway at Mascot; the answer involves a new international airport at Badgerys Creek. The Opposition has suggested that by building another runway at Mascot perhaps our problems can be solved overnight. The honourable member for Fadden cited a figure of 340,000 passenger movements by the year 2000. I say to the honourable member: How can we handle 340,000 passenger movements at Mascot with a close space parallel runway? Mascot cannot handle it. </PARA>
<PARA> The real hidden agenda, of course, is that the Opposition wants a wide space parallel runway. It does not mention that when it campaigns in Barton or St George or in any of the seats surrounding the airport. It knows that if we do not reserve a site for a second airport for Sydney now we will never have a site that is near enough to Sydney. The Opposition delayed the decision on Towra Point; it could not commit itself to Galston. Now we are having to find a site which is a fair way out of Sydney. Sure, we would have been happier if we could have found a site closer to the major population centres of Sydney, but the Opposition fumbled. I admit that Labor governments in the past could have done a better job and could have made a decision earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Hear, hear!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite are very good at saying `Hear, hear!' when I say that those from my side of politics could have done better but they are very quiet when I remind them that those from their side of politics torpedoed two alternative sites-Towra Point and Galston. I suggest to Opposition members that perhaps there is a bit of fault on both sides. Which side is taking the decision to providing the long term answer? It is this side of politics, and I commend the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Willis) for ensuring that that will take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the House that at the moment international passenger flights into Sydney still take up only 15 per cent of the capacity at Mascot. The honourable member for Fadden reminded us that more than half of the international visitors to Sydney come through Mascot. That is true, but they still make up only 15 per cent of passenger movements at Sydney. Another 45 per cent is due to the major domestic trunk flights. Yet even though Mascot has scarce runway capacity, 15 per cent of movements consist of light general aviation. Who can suggest that we cannot afford to move the light general aviation out of Mascot to some of the other airports around Sydney? We do have some capacity there which will be made available when this Government seeks to make sure that we use market forces to ensure that only those planes which need to use Mascot will use Mascot. That is something which I endorse. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you would, of course, be aware that one of the major problems at Mascot is the massive demand for services in the peak periods. The Government is introducing a $200 premium charge to try to discourage unnecessary aircraft from using Mascot during those peak periods. Anyone who has looked at the figures will be aware that not every light aircraft, every small commuter plane, has to land or take off at exactly 9 o'clock. Because there are some marketing advantages in taking off at 9 o'clock rather than at 10 past nine, every airline wants its aircraft to take off at 9 o'clock. Mascot cannot afford to have those little airlines deciding that they can all take off at 9 o'clock. I believe that this Government is right in introducing a premium charge to ensure that this problem is handled. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that the Opposition's alternative is to build a new runway at Mascot. There has been no environmental impact statement on any proposal for a new runway into Botany Bay. There has been no discussion about the impact of a new runway on Botany Bay National Park and the mangroves in Towra Point. The honourable member for Cook will be aware of the massive damage that was done to Towra Point by the Port Botany development and the construction of the current runway in Botany Bay. If we build another close space or wide space parallel runway, that would also damage that essential national park. I remind the Opposition that it would cost just as much to build this extra runway in Botany Bay as it would to build Badgerys Creek. Why do we not make the decision to build the new airport at Badgerys Creek as a long term answer?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants us to build an extra runway at Mascot. What good will that do us in 10 years time? We would be right back where we are today. We would have lost Badgerys Creek as a site and we would have to build a new airport further west. I suppose that would make the Opposition happier. It has no concern for the people who live near Mascot Airport. There are a million residents living near Mascot whose lives are being disrupted by noise, and who are affected by that airport, yet the Opposition believes that those people should continue to suffer. It would abolish the new curfew and build extra runways. That is something that we on this side of the House reject. I remind those opposite who do not get many chances to visit parts of Sydney, apart from Mascot Airport, that there is a lot of industry around the Mascot area. There is the ICI Australia Ltd chemical factory at Botany and the Kurnell oil refinery. I would hate to imagine the effect of an air crash somewhere near those industrial centres. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Badgerys Creek will provide the long term answer to Sydney's needs. All of the people who fly, either international or domestic, do not start their journeys from the central business district of Sydney, as John Elliott does. When one looks at the centroid of passengers using Mascot Airport, one sees that that centroid is now at Balmain, and it is heading west towards Parramatta day by day. The Opposition's argument that we must build extra runway capacity at Mascot is ridiculous. People from my electorate, north of Sydney, can get to Badgerys Creek just as quickly as they can get to Mascot, because at the moment they must travel through the northern suburbs of Sydney, through the central business district and on to Mascot. Certainly, people living north of the city will find it just as easy to get to Badgerys Creek as to Mascot. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) That, in accordance with the terms of the resolution of the House of Representatives of 8 May 1985 and of the Senate of 10 May 1985, the reference of the acquisition of automatic data processing facilities by any Commonwealth Department or authority to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts be rescinded; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>On 8 May 1985 this House resolved to refer to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts proposed acquisitions of automatic data processing (ADP) facilities by Commonwealth departments or authorities. The House also resolved that the resolution continue in force unless and until amended or rescinded by the House or the Senate. The Senate concurred with the resolution on 10 May 1985. The old procedures for ADP acquisitions provided for compulsory referral to the Committee of acquisitions costing more than $5m. In March 1988 the Government agreed to new procedures which no longer included compulsory referral of proposals to the Committee but still enabled Ministers to refer any particular proposal to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> The new procedures contain the following elements: departments and authorities are required to prepare an information technology strategic plan every three years. The plan is to identify a strategy for the development, use and management of information technology and to show how the technology will contribute to the goals and objectives of the organisation. Acquisitions that cost less than $5m and are consistent with the information technology plan can proceed subject to receiving approval in the Budget process. Proposals for acquisition costing $5m or more are to be considered by Cabinet for in principle approval outside the Budget process and funding approval as part of the Budget process. A department or authority must establish an acquisitions council to provide an independent source of advice where an acquisition proposal is likely to require Cabinet approval. The acquisitions council is to include at least one member of standing from outside the organisation and at least one member from a central agency. The council provides an independent report on the proposed acquisition, which is attached to the Cabinet submission. The departments and their authorities should refer in their annual reports to information technology acquisition approvals in excess of $5m, including information on goals and priorities. The Department of Administrative Services in responsible for providing tendering and contracting services and for ensuring that propriety and probity are observed in procurement action. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to remove compulsory referral to the Committee was taken after an efficiency scrutiny review which identified shortcomings in the old procedures. The review concluded that, in the case of computer acquisitions, a review by the Public Accounts Committee is of limited benefit, is costly and introduces significant delay. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, this motion rescinds the resolution of 8 May 1985 but it does so in the context of both that deliberation by the efficiency scrutiny which found that this was no longer required and was costly, and also the fact that now a considerable process of oversight has been put in place to deal with these problems within the departments-an oversight that was not in place back in 1985. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has no objection to the matter before us dealing with the revocation of the resolution of the House back in May 1985 dealing with the referral to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of acquisitions of automatic data processing facilities by Commonwealth departments or authorities. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), I am familiar with the issues that are involved and I am conscious of the matters raised by the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) when he referred to the time that it took the Public Accounts Committee to undertake the reviews that were necessary not only for it to get across the issues involved but to satisfy itself as to the appropriateness of the particular purchases being undertaken by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were a number of reports, with quite significant shortcomings brought to light as a result of the Public Accounts Committee reviews. Those reviews were very important from the point of view of establishing proper procedures for supervising these sorts of purchases by the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the time that the Committee took to get across those issues was a serious impediment to effective purchasing programs for new equipment and the putting in place of equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise the matter of the Public Accounts Committee reviews in this context because I think it is important that the Government have in mind, as it goes down the path of the new procedures that have been put in place, the shortcomings that the Public Accounts Committee was able to establish through its reviews. I certainly would not be one who would say that the sorts of problems that led to this PAC review in the first place could not recur under the new procedures that the Government has adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter I would like to highlight is that the Government, when it made this reference to the Public Accounts Committee previously, provided the Public Accounts Committee with some element of additional support to enable it to undertake these inquiries. I have to say that the sorts of inquiries involved are time consuming and difficult. Considerable specialist expertise is necessary if effective reviews are to be undertaken. Staffing needs to be made available in a timely fashion. One of the problems that we have seen recently has been that this Government has not been willing to ensure that the Public Accounts Committee, in the whole variety of areas in which it has to operate, has the staffing capacity to ensure that it is able to offer to the Parliament the independent advice that the Parliament sees as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Parliament has not heard a great deal recently about the question of staffing support for the Public Accounts Committees, I remind the House of the discussions that took place earlier on this matter. I for one am not satisfied that the Committee is properly resourced to enable it to undertake the work that is expected of it. Certainly, without considerable additional staffing facilities available to the Committee, it would not have been able to continue scrutinising adequately all of the references referred to it previously in relation to computer acquisitions. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be understood that it is against the background of the shortage of staff and the time that was taken, even with the limited support that was given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), that this reference has been rescinded. I simply remind the Government that there were significant shortcomings in purchasing arrangements previously. It is a matter that will have to be watched very carefully in the light of the new procedures that have been established. Otherwise, we may well find that there will be expensive acquisitions which will not be able to be utilised as fully and as effectively as the Government would want. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the amendments that have been brought to us from the Senate. We do not oppose them because they mirror concerns expressed by Opposition members in the House, particularly by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and me. Maybe the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) spoke on that occasion. The honourable member for Berowra, the honourable member for Curtin and I were concerned that there had been a steady transition away from the original charter of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). We were concerned about the nature of the programs and the effectiveness of the bank. On behalf of the Opposition we called these into question and indicated that we would be watching the work of the bank with far greater vigilance. After all, a great deal of money goes from Australia to the IBRD and there seemed to have been a change in the way in which programs were being pursued and the nature of those programs. These matters that have been raised, whereby the Treasurer, through these amendments, will be called upon to report to the Parliament and to spell out an assessment of the managerial efficiency and the financial and economic effectiveness of elements within the bank, are welcomed by us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since we made our criticisms I have noted that a response was circulated to people-among others, members and senators, I assume-from the IBRD. It called into question a number of the criticisms made by those of us particularly on this side of the House. Whilst those criticisms by those speaking, or purporting to speak, on behalf of the bank were done in a detailed way, they were also done in a rather frantic way, it seemed to me. All the more reason, therefore, for this Parliament to insist on a better accounting as to the effectiveness of the bank's operations. I do not say that with any pleasure. I was one of the longest serving Foreign Ministers in this country-albeit that the Treasurer handles matters for the IBRD-and in all those years that I was Minister for Foreign Affairs I kept a careful eye on what was transpiring at the IBRD. The moves taken in the Senate reflect, as I say, the concerns that have been expressed in one form or another. They give us the opportunity, through this mechanism contained within the amendments, of putting the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on notice that we will be following with even greater interest the nature of the reports that he has made. The requirement to report will assist us. It will assist all of us who have watched the operation of international forums such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. As I say we do not oppose the matter. I trust that other members on my side will be given an opportunity to express a view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), we support the amendment which was moved and carried in the Senate, an amendment which caused Senator Macklin to echo sentiments I have been expressing in this place for six years or more: that there is and has been a lack of regular and detailed information about Australia's participation in the World Bank. It is only recently, but with some pleasure-and that is not putting it too highly-that we note that Government Ministers-with one exception-although not curtailing our contribution and participation in funding for the World Bank and its agencies, have expressed some doubts about whether we should be involved. The one exception I mentioned is a Bill sponsored by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs involving the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). We indicated last year that after the current three-year funding program we would discontinue our involvement. At that time doubt was expressed about the work, efficacy and efficiency of the Asian Development Bank. I note that a joint committee of the Parliament is examining its operations critically with a view to reporting. I hasten to add that I am not a member of that committee, so I am not constrained by anything it might or might not find.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about that; I am modest by nature. This amendment is before the Committee of the House because of repeated calls for more and adequate information about the World Bank and its activities. We pour hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars into these agencies. Those repeated calls for information have not met with a great deal of favourable treatment by this Government. I have already mentioned, however, that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed some doubts about those agencies which fall within his and his successor's area of responsibility. The truth is that there is and should be less than wholehearted and unqualified support for legislation to continue to finance these agencies with what I can only call handsome injections of taxpayers' money. That doubt does not seem to have been translated, in the majority of cases, into any positive action. The truth is that those in the Parliament like myself who are interested have been left in considerable doubt about detailed considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that the report proposed in this amendment will eliminate some of those doubts. As has been noted elsewhere-and probably in debate in this chamber earlier-it is true that the Treasury publishes a report, as required by the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947. It is equally true that there is a paucity of information upon which to indulge in serious debate in this place in that report. The debate on this particular measure was conducted in the House on 30 November 1988. It is interesting to note that these Bills come up regularly and that this is the third or fourth such debate that I can recall in the last six or seven years on the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) alone. On top of that, there are other international financial institutions, as they are quaintly called. It means that we could probably double the number of debates in which we have had to consider measures involving the injection of vast amounts of taxpayers' funds into such bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that it is encouraging to see that perhaps we will obtain more information in the future. Without that information, we, on behalf of our constituents and taxpayers, cannot question the Government; we cannot make it accountable. Nor in turn can we make affiliates of the World Bank such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development accountable to our Government. There is some question as to the viability of projects on several grounds. These include environmental considerations which these bodies do not appear to have dealt with very adequately, conscientiously or efficiently. We see examples reported of the effects of projects financed and undertaken by the World Bank and its affiliates, including the IBRD, which have effects on indigenous people to which one would think, given the rhetoric of this Government, we would not as a country want to be a party or give the stamp of our imprimatur. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, because of the dearth of information to which I have already referred, we have had to rely on diverse sources of information. We have had to rely on records of the debates in the United States Congress, for example. It seems that a majority of that august legislative body have very grave doubts indeed about the work of the World Bank and its affiliates. We acknowledge that there has been a change of management and that Mr Conable is claiming to pursue a line which will help us to understand its development policy. However, there is a definite trend towards a departure from its charter. If that is happening, as I believe it to be happening, we should be fully aware of what the World Bank proposes to do through its agencies. We should be in a position to consider those proposals when we are considering measures such as that embodied in the principal Bill involving an expansion of the capital that the IBRD may raise, as well as the additional funds which we are obliged to pay under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Opposition support the amendment not because we are convinced that the World Bank and its agencies are efficient or working in a way which we would prefer; we support the amendment not because its 6,000 strong bureaucracy inspires confidence that it operates more in line with its charter than it apparently does; and we support the amendment not because of the well-documented failings of the bank, some of which are admitted in the annual reports of the bank and its agencies, over the past 10 years. We support it because any further information will be better than nothing. We also support it because the Government, its Treasurer and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade might be more aware and forthcoming about the bank and its operations if bound to report to this Parliament and to the people of Australia in greater detail than they have in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), and my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). This side of the chamber strongly supports this amendment requiring the Treasurer to report to the Parliament on the operations of the World Bank. This should be part of a process to enable a better surveillance and assessment of Australia's overall effort in development assistance. In recent years the order of magnitude of Australia's aid effort has been $1,000m; that is, Australia allocates about $1,000m to overseas aid and development assistance. That represents about 0.35 per cent of gross domestic product. I remind the chamber that in the first year of the Hawke Government that ratio was in excess of 0.5 per cent. If the Government had given the same degree of priority to development assistance as it gave in that first year, it would be currently spending $1.5 billion in this area. That is 50 per cent more than it is actually spending. I am not suggesting that tomorrow the Government could spend an extra $500m on aid, but this is a very significant indication of the slide in the priority of this area for this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It underlines the need to ensure that whatever aid and assistance we do give-whether it be in the order of $1 billion or whatever-is given in the most cost-effective way. As my colleague has pointed out, there is a significant amount of expenditure coming under the heading of this country's support for the World Bank. It is therefore an important responsibility for us to do what we can to assess what the bank is doing and to ensure that it operates efficiently and along the lines of its charter. My colleague has raised some serious questions in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time we debated this matter I said that we ought to be looking at more cost effective ways of giving assistance to developing countries, and that there should be a greater involvement of the private sector and, particularly, non-government organisations. I mentioned at that point an organisation with which I am associated, the Maranatha Trust of Sydney, which has programs in many parts of the world, but I refer particularly to the Philippines. It is attempting to stimulate a bit of grass roots capitalism in that country. Advances of money are made to people in the so-called informal sector, the poorest of the poor, who have no collateral to put up in order to borrow funds and establish small businesses. The Maranatha Trust makes such advances without collateral and achieves very effective results in terms of increased employment, greater self-esteem and great assistance to large numbers of the poor in that country. The overseas aid cost from this country can average out to $100 per job, whereas I know of jobs `created' by the World Bank which cost in the order of $500,000 a job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few moments left to me I want to refer to the fact that in the debate yesterday and last evening it became abundantly clear that there is very serious concern about the Government's policies for the care of the aged and the provision of hostels, nursing homes and related facilities. I make the point that there is a very great need for the Government to enunciate much more clearly and in a much more fundamental way the course of action that it intends to take. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) will say that he has made statements about that and that they have been conveyed to the existing providers of care and to those who may be motivated to move in the direction of fostering additional facilities by raising funds, putting forward propositions and so on. The fact remains that there is a great void when one compares the circumstances of the past with those of the last two or three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier in the debate I said that changes are always necessary when there is an ongoing administration of the sort that we are dealing with, but those changes should be made in a way that accords with practical considerations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened carefully to this debate. I have not been able to be present in the chamber all the time, but certainly I have kept my eyes and ears on it, as have many of my staff. I generally commend honourable members for their contributions and interest in what is a very important area of policy and action in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On listening to some of the contributions made by those on the other side of the chamber I wondered whether they fully understood the implications of the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill. While recognising that it was a very wide-ranging debate and that many honourable members had many local or general issues to raise, I feel that in many cases the point of the Bill was lost. It goes to the heart of the matter in that, instead of having the old system of ad hoc arrangements and a lack of planning, we are in this Bill, along with others that have gone before it, bringing in some very important policies and positions to deal with the issues concerning aged care in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. I draw their attention and the public's attention to the fact that this Bill deals with planning arrangements. Planning was almost totally lacking in aged care in this country until this Government decided to grasp the bull by the horns and do something about it. In view of the issues that were facing Australia because of the ageing of the population there was a need to make sure that the resources were used properly in government and within the community in general. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill introduces new hostel planning arrangements which determine the maximum number of hostel places to be funded on a recurrent basis for each State and Territory at any time in a particular financial year. It enables the Minister to specify the distribution of those hostel places among planning regions. In the first part of the Bill we have the whole concept for planning and putting the hostel places where they are actually needed. The Bill also introduces an approval in principle arrangement for the provision of capital and recurrent funding or recurrent funding alone in respect of the acquisition, erection, demolition, reconstruction, alteration, extension or transfer of a hostel. That in itself is another planning procedure that provides organisations and people who are keen to provide much needed hostels in Australia with a process by which they can plan for a development and be sure of subsequent approval-in most cases-if they fulfil the general requirements of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also enables us to ensure that all Commonwealth funded hostels-existing and future-are approved for a fixed number of hostel places, including, importantly, respite care, for recurrent funding purposes. That allows us again to improve the financial management and planning in the hostel sector. The Bill ensures that the approved number of hostel places will be occupied only by eligible persons. It is a waste, totally unnecessary and not necessarily appropriate for the people themselves if the occupants of a hostel are not eligible persons. Obviously a hostel is there for a purpose. The Government-the taxpayers-pays a considerable subsidy towards the upkeep and operation of it. It should be there for people who need it; not simply as a form of alternative accommodation for those who are not in a state of frailty.</PARA>
<PARA> Very importantly, the Bill enables the payment of a recurrent subsidy for an eligible person occupying an approved respite care place for a maximum of 63 days in a benefit period in the same hostel. That is a considerable advantage to hostel operators. It certainly removes many of the inadequacies or unnecessary paperwork and confusion that arose in the past. The Bill enables money borrowed or received from the Commonwealth or borrowed from other sources to be taken into account in calculating the amount of a capital grant in relation to a nursing home. That is an added plus when it comes to the development of our aged care sector. It also brings in another range of transitional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point at the outset that rarely in the debate were those sorts of points brought home. As honourable members have been quite willing to point out, many changes are occurring. We are bringing about a very important planning, consultation and development emphasis to the whole of the aged care sector. Opposition members did not refer to the importance of those points, which I think are extremely relevant to the development of aged care in Australia; they simply referred to problems they felt existed in the aged care area in general. Unfortunately, many of them not only were misinformed on some points but also made quite spurious claims and in some cases-I would hesitate to say this but I suspect it is truly the case-deliberately misrepresented the successful programs that this Government has introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I am unable to understand how the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), in talking about the bed ratio, said that nursing bed availability will be reduced from the present figure of about 70,000 beds to about 45,000 beds by the time the program is completed. That is in complete contradiction to any of the released figures and any of the understandings of the industry of which I am aware, given the fact that there will be an increase in the number of nursing home beds, particularly over the next three years, of about 1,400. While we have over 75,000 nursing home beds at the moment, the implication-I hope it is not the case but I can only draw this implication from his words-is that about 25,000 beds will be taken out of the nursing home program. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the case. There has been an extension of the nursing home program. That is indicated by the growth that is projected over the next three years alone. If the honourable member for Dawson wants to show me his figures or the sources he got them from, I will be quite happy to explore them. Perhaps I have misunderstood what he was talking about. However, they were in contradiction of what is actually being done. There will be a steady increase in the number of nursing home beds while at the same time-and it is very relevant to this Bill-there will be a huge increase in hostel beds. When this Government came in there were only about 22,000 hostel beds in Australia. By 1990, after only seven years in government, we will have effectively doubled that number to about 43,000. That brings an element of flexibility into the aged care system that just was not there before. It brings in options that were not there before. That is something members of the Opposition are quite happy to accept when hostels are opened in their electorates and their constituents get the benefit, but it seems that when they come into this place they throw around figures to denigrate the massive program of capital works and recurrent expenditure that this Government has undertaken to fulfil the need that exists in our community to plan for the future in a way that was not done under the previous Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government's priority of fair and equitable planning is encompassed in this Bill and has certainly replaced the ad hoc arrangements of the past. The reform strategy is underpinned by several basic requirements. The first is that aged people should be supported as long as they wish to be, in particular in their own homes, by residential services as long as this best suits their needs. There must also be promotion of rehabilitation, thereby enhancing personal freedom and independence, and a recognition that a move to a less supported residential or community based support centre will be possible and desirable for some people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore of concern when honourable members opposite, and some in particular, criticise the Government for the home and community care (HACC) program. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) mentioned that the Government had `cut the guts'-I think they were the words he used-out of the home and community care program. That is quite amazing considering that, when this Government came to office in 1983, the total combined expenditure of the Commonwealth on programs that now come under the HACC umbrella was about $53m. At this stage this year the Government is spending about $210m. That is the Commonwealth's contribution-$210m this year. If that is cutting the guts out of a program that is seeking not only to extend the traditional home care services but to add new services tailored to individual needs, then certainly I am quite happy to have that accusation levelled at this Government and at me on any occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other issues that have been raised relates to the figure of 87 1/2 per cent. In July 1991, due to the funding arrangements this Government has been putting into place, no person living in a fully government sponsored nursing home-and that will represent about 94 per cent of beds-will be required to pay more than 87 1/2 per cent of the standard pension rate, plus rent assistance. That is is in direct contrast to the situation that exists for so many thousands of people today, where many have to pay not only that standard pension contribution but fees of the order of thousands and thousands of dollars a year. Yet it would seem that that is what the Opposition is pushing for. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is bringing in a system of aged care support in this country as security for older people at the point of greatest vulnerability in terms of their financial security as well as their health security. This Government has set about a program, as part of its overall reform strategy, of ensuring that no one need pay more than 87 1/2 per cent of the standard pension rate plus rent assistance for living in a nursing home. But the Opposition-as has been stated in its policy, espoused by the New South Wales Council of the Liberal Party and by members in this House-is now setting out on a new path. The Opposition's approach would ensure that old people who deserve that security, that time in their lives when they do not have to worry about having to rely upon their own resources or upon the support of friends or relatives, are returned to insecurity. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt) made a number of comments about lack of consultation. If consultation has occurred on any issue in Australia over the last couple of years, I think it has been in the whole area of aged care, whether it be the nursing home industry, hostels or home and community care. There has not been a lack of consultation but, in many cases, overconsultation. There have been some quite significant changes of direction, but certainly all along the way every attempt has been made at consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks)-and I thank him for it-was appreciative of the efforts that had gone into ensuring that under the new arrangements, as he has been assured and the Cobar Council has been assured, the Lilliane Brady Nursing Home in the remote town of Cobar will not suffer under the small home arrangements. I think that is very important. A lot of other comments were made in the House about this issue as a way of scaring people, particularly those in the more remote areas, into believing that their very important nursing home accommodation would be taken away or else be made not viable. That is certainly not the case. Anyone who knows the location, the remoteness and the size of Cobar would imagine that if any town were to suffer then that town probably would, because of its locality, but that is not the case-and the honourable member for Riverina-Darling, to his credit, has acknowledged that. </PARA>
<PARA> Other members have spoken about the issue. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) also raised the point. I think we have to recognise-and I hope it is now recognised in the community-that there are a number of small nursing homes in Australia, whether they be in urban areas or in remote areas, which we want to encourage, particularly in remote areas, to continue to serve their communities in the ways they have. We are therefore looking at ways not only of improving their viability but also of enhancing the quality of care they can give. Services such as a 24-hour director of nursing cover did not exist before but exist now. Many of the small homes will receive quite significant increases in nursing home hours as a result of the changes we have brought in, as well as the consultancy support that will help them to rationalise and improve their structures and efficiencies. If members of the Opposition are concerned about any small homes in their electorates, I would certainly welcome their representations and we will look at them on an individual basis. The Department is similarly setting out to assist those homes. I can assure people in remote areas of Australia that their aged care services will not suffer; in fact, they will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lowe, in one of his typical speeches, talked a lot about dreaded socialism and inappropriately putting people into hostels when many were too frail to be there. I appreciate that the honourable member is a doctor but perhaps he has not spent much time speaking recently to people in nursing homes about the way in which the consultancy was carried out. He will find that many people who are in nursing homes at the moment, if they had the opportunity again, would choose to be in hostel care. </PARA>
<PARA> We certainly recognise that people in hostels will need to have more care. That is why we have set in place, as hostel operators know, a process of increasing the personal care subsidy. We do not consider hostels to be simply a cheaper option. They are for people who do not need to be in nursing homes, where so many people in the past were placed inappropriately. We consider them to be a better option in terms of quality of life and, in many cases, quality of care for certain individuals. Quality of life is very important to this Government in the way in which it respects the older people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lowe also said that there would be no funding for new nursing homes. That is just patently wrong. If he has any issues that he wants to raise-and I would like some of the honourable members opposite to show me their figures to back up the assertions that they have been making throughout this debate-then I would be quite happy to consider them and give them a full and open response in the hope that honourable members would be better informed in debates in future. Many honourable members spoke about a lack of information. If any honourable members opposite want any information, they can have a box load of it delivered to their office. On the other hand, the Opposition claims in the same debate, when it talks about a lack of information about what has been happening, that a whole lot of government propaganda has been put out. So it is a little difficult to understand what it really wants when it is all boiled down. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lowe and others have made reference to financially disadvantaged people. I am quite amazed at this. There is a problem in this country in that many of the hostels and nursing homes have an attitude-and it was expressed to me at a seminar that I was addressing earlier this morning-that hostel operators should only take who they want to take and that the Government should be responsible for the financially disadvantaged. That is lovely, is it not? We have a situation here where nearly all these hostel operators in the past, or possibly in the future, have been receiving substantial Commonwealth subsidies in terms of capital and certainly receiving substantial subsidies in terms of personal care, yet they are ready to flick off the financially disadvantaged as the ordinary pensioner's, the ordinary person's, battle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to the point you are raising shortly. They are ready to flick these people off into some other hostel. (Extension of time granted) The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) addressed the need for information and consultation. I notice that he also mentioned that he had not been to any of the seminars in his area, although he had been told that nursing homes needed more information. What nursing homes, the people who operate them and their boards of management-the people who work in them-need is in fact not more information on paper but the ability to discuss and get to grips with the changes that are going on. When one considers that there are about 1,400 nursing homes throughout Australia and the best part of 1,000 hostels, and when one then adds up the number of people on boards of management, mostly in a voluntary capacity, it is obviously very difficult to understand the vast changes that are going on. I can assure those opposite that the Government is doing all it can to foster the development of that information and understanding. Again, if honourable members opposite have any ideas as to ways in which that can be enhanced, then I am only too happy to look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) was a little bit confused on one point that he raised. He spoke about nursing homes in remote areas. He was concerned about small homes. He said that they are only going to get $4,000 a bed and asked how any bed could be built for $4,000. I point out to the honourable member for Barker that this Government does not expect any nursing home, or hostel operator for that matter, to provide a bed for $4,000 of capital. What is important to realise, considering the way in which the Opposition has attacked this Government's relationship with the age care sector, is that that $4,000 is not simply a capital subsidy for them to go out and build a new bed. For the first time, that subsidy is not just a capital subsidy but an interest subsidy to help private nursing home operators in restructuring. It is actually an extra grant for money that has already been put forward by the private nursing home operators to help them overcome the subsidy arrangement. So here we have a situation of extra support for the first time being given to the private sector. In fact, for an ordinary bed, the rate is about $23,000. For a financially disadvantaged bed, if a hostel decides to set up a percentage, as hostels are supposed to for financially disadvantaged, the rate is $46,400 plus the land subsidy per bed. Again, if the Opposition wants to get more information, then I am quite happy to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot was said about user rights and Chris Ronalds's report entitled I'm Still an Individual. That report is a very important one. It forms the basis of stage 5 of the Government's eight-stage program of aged care reform that will go through to 1992. This is to do with residents' rights now, and this is the major push this year, considering that most of the funding arrangements and the planning and organisational arrangements have been dealt with in the past. Chris Ronalds is a respected lawyer. She has done a lot of work in this area. It is not only her work, but what perhaps honourable members opposite do not know or, if they do know, fail to recognise, is that this consultancy did not simply involve her running around Australia talking to a lot of people. It was under a steering committee led and chaired quite ably-and I thank him very much-by Professor Peter Hanks of Monash University. There were consumers on that committee from the Australian Council on the Ageing, the Australian Pensioners Federation, the Accommodation Rights Service, the Older Persons Action Centre, the Pensioners Action Group and the Aged Care Coalition. Perhaps the Opposition would like to level some of its accusations about user rights at those groups instead of directing them simply and solely at Chris Ronalds. Perhaps they would also like to accuse the unions of bashing away at nursing home proprietors because the Royal Australian Nursing Federation, or as it is now the Australian Nurses Federation, and the Queensland Nurses Union were also represented. Apart from the Commonwealth Department, Senator Giles and the Western Australian Bureau of the Aged, there were also representatives of providers-John Gilroy from the Australian Nursing Homes Association and Donald Coburn of the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations (AAVCA). Considering the comments that have come particularly from Mr Gilroy as well as the AAVCA, I believe that they are very supportive of the general direction the Government is taking in aged care and the Government's initiatives to ensure that people in nursing homes and hostels throughout Australia have the best quality of life, and in relation to their dignity and self-respect, that we as a society and they as providers and the staff can provide for them. I commend them for that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing that there has been such a reaction from honourable members in this House and particularly from people in Victoria. I was hoping, as were Chris Ronalds and the rest of the steering committee-and everything that I have been saying has been to this end-that the issue of user rights in residential care and for older people generally is very much a community issue. Those of us who have good health, who do not depend on other people and who have good jobs do not realise the problems that affect us down the track when we are older, perhaps when we are more frail and vulnerable and when we need to depend on others for care. What people were saying to Chris Ronalds, as well as on the hot line that has run in different States, concerned not so much the issues surrounding their fees or water being in the orange juice but simple human issues of dignity and respect which need to be addressed in their day to day lives. Sometimes in our community we do not pay sufficient regard to how people feel. I believe that this is a valuable report because it points the way, without attributing blame to anyone. </PARA>

<PARA> I wish to talk specifically, in the minute I have left, about the issue that the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and others have raised; that is, for existing hostels, the problems associated with the Government's requirement that 20 per cent of the total number of permanent places be for financially disadvantaged people. It has been a requirement of the recurrent funding agreement at least since 1984 that hostels provide that level of access for financially disadvantaged people. However, it has been recognised that some organisations may not immediately be able to attain that 20 per cent minimum requirement of places for financially disadvantaged persons in each of their existing hostels. Representatives of the Uniting Church in New South Wales approached the Government-despite the fact that we have been talking about it for quite a while-when it came down to the wire, to see whether, across their 35 hostels, there was any way in which the Government could address this matter. We have had discussions with them. I thought that the situation had been resolved. Maybe it has not been. But this Government has made a considerable concession to that organisation and others like it to aggregate that requirement across their facilities and I hope that that will satisfy the honourable member. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 23, after clause 20, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Certain provisions not to apply to an organisation which has not received any subsidy towards capital cost of an approved hostel</PARA>
<PARA> ``20a. Before section 10fb of the Principal Act, the following section is inserted:</PARA>
<PARA> Provisions not to apply in certain circumstances</PARA>
<PARA> `10fab. Nothing in section 10f or 10fa of this Act or in the General Conditions formulated by the Minister under section 10f of this Act shall require an organisation which has not received a subsidy towards the capital cost of an approved hostel to enter into an agreement to admit, or to admit, any person who would be defined as a financially disadvantaged person.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the amendment, particularly to the point in question without relating to the rest of the Bill, I found it extremely difficult when confronted with the current legislation to find the precedent for the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) to be doing various things that seemed to be in conflict with the legislation we were yet to consider. Apparently it goes back to earlier legislation of 1987, the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act, by which certain amendments were made to the Act which gave the Minister fairly wide discretion in administering general provisions within the Act. One of the aspects of the 1987 amendments was the introduction under clause 10f of general conditions of recurrent grants. One then goes to following subsections which allow the Minister to introduce these provisions. At the time, the Opposition agreed with those general provisions because they seemed to be in keeping with what the Opposition had in mind by way of reforms for the aged and frail aged. The amendment gave the Minister wide powers-one might say discretionary powers-and very little accountability at the end. Among other provisions, section 10f (2) (c) reads:</PARA>
<PARA>the class or classes of persons to be accommodated at an approved hostel and, where there are to be two or more classes, the proportion of the residents at the hostel included in each class. </PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, even at that time there was a category of financially disadvantaged persons. I am not sure about the background of the second reading speech at that time, as to what the Government intended, but certainly since 1987 and the passing of that Act, what the Government had in mind has become much clearer. In the second reading debate, or the summary, we discussed paragraph (d), the fees or charges payable by a person or class of persons and, contrary to what the Minister says, the Opposition still does not disagree with that ceiling for those financially disadvantaged persons. We have never had that, but it surprises us that there is an allowance in the hostels legislation for a further contribution to be made to the capital cost, which then can be drawn down in relation to administration fees, but there is no such provision under the Nursing Homes Act where the ceiling is put at 87.5 per cent and I understand the extent of the housing subsidy beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not disagree with that, contrary to what the Minister has said, but we wonder why, where a person has an ability to pay fees as a consequence of having substantial property and having a need for nursing home care, a nursing home in certain cases cannot cross-subsidise against the cost of the financially disadvantaged, as we do in many other Commonwealth services. Telecom would be a good example of that, of which you, Mr Chairman, would be well aware. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also talked about paragraph (f) subsection (2) of section 10f-the rights and obligations of residents at an approved hostel. Again, I would say that that was put in there, and allowed to be put in by the Opposition of the day, without knowing the ramifications of it. In spite of what has been said about I'm Still an Individual, I go on record as saying that if one wanted a person to give a predictable answer, one would get a predictable person to provide that result. I am not saying that the author was not capable of doing the job. We are saying that it should have had a balance. I disagree with the Minister when he says that the committee that was responsible in that regard provided that balance. It did not. I have spoken to some of the members of that committee. While they were able to ameliorate some of the original suggestions, what came up eventually was not a fair reflection of the views of some of the members who sat on that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of other paragraphs of the subsection, going right up to (n). As I said, the Minister had a lot of discretion under those general conditions. We found just prior to Christmas, even though some of these things were discussed in consultation with the industry beforehand, that although the provisions of the regulations pertaining to the Statutory Rules Publication Act had been circumvented-except in some cases-that discretion means that the Minister can make general provisions providing they are not inconsistent with the general tone of the industry. He is allowed to gazette those for a period of 28 days and then have them declared as being the rules by which the game is played. According to letters which I have received, the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette refers to a tremendous amount of regulation and there was not time, from the time of presenting that regulation and its declaration, for proper consultation to have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> We are particularly looking at one aspect of this, and that is under what policy or regulation-again this is basically under the hand of the Minister-a particular type of hostel is declared to be in a most disadvantaged area. I understand about 24 out of 950 hostels were encouraged to self-fund their capital funds. The Government of the day apparently went out and said, `If you capital fund these from your own resources, we will then provide the subsidies', and that has continued. Some of those hostels, because of group situations, have been able to aggregate their financially disadvantaged places and then spread them around. But in some cases those funds were raised on the basis of contractual arrangements with each of the residents. As far as I know those arrangements were paramount in law. The hostel owners, because of a contribution which would eventually be repaid at face value, would be allowed accommodation within those units. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has said in those cases that the financially disadvantaged quota of residents has to stand at 20 per cent. The hostels were told, early in December I believe, that they had to complete an agreement by 10 January. They were under threat; one might even call it blackmail: `You either sign this or do without your subsidies'. What does a hostel that has a contractual arrangement do with its current arrangements when it has to sign an agreement which has built into it a 20 per cent quota for financially disadvantaged persons? I understand it was the industry that sought aggregation on certain terms, it was not something that was offered by the Minister. Under those terms the Minister was asked for a face to face discussion on the matter. He responded with a letter in which he laid down three conditions under which aggregation would take place. In all fairness, the organisations could not really say that under those aggregation arrangements they could fulfil the three conditions, because one of the conditions of the financially disadvantaged placement is that the residents would have to come from the immediate region. Under aggregation, this might have meant that the people would have to go from one region to another, and the organisations could not give a guarantee that aggregation would work under those terms because they had to find out from experience whether it would work. I do know that particular arrangement has caused deep distress in some cases, not for those hostels in the private sector, because the private sector hostels are not allowed to be subsidised, but for a genuine sector of the industry that has a proud record in this country of providing accommodation for the frail aged both in hostels and in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment seeks simply to exempt from the area of financially disadvantaged placements those hostels that have been fully self-funded, and particularly in this area of residential contracts. We see no financial disadvantage in this to the Government. It is not going to mean more financing. It is just going to mean that its philosophy of a 20 per cent quota for the disadvantaged cannot in these cases be fulfilled. I understand that these people can be taken into other homes under the arrangements providing for the placement of financially disadvantaged people. There is a lot more that I would like to say, but that is the basis on which we make this call for an amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the Minister for Housing and Aged Care was present during the whole of my comments in the second reading debate on this matter, but this amendment was the kernel of the matters that I addressed when this issue was at the second reading stage. I think the Minister had one minute in which to respond to the comments I made, and I note that he was not able to deal with the matter completely. But as he may follow me again, I thought I would take the opportunity-I hope he will forgive my interceding-to formally support the amendment on behalf of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I want to make during the time that is available to me, and I do so for reasons of emphasis, is that it seems to me that the Government's policy since coming to office has been to seek to find places for financially disadvantaged people in resident funded hostels. That was a policy initiative of this Government's that presumably commenced early during its term of office, in 1984, and that may well be the case. But as most of these hostels were developed before then, I make the point that we are seeking retrospectively to change the arrangements under which certain churches, and they are mainly churches, were involved in building hostels with funds obtained either from the church, very often borrowed, or capital obtained from people who bought places in these hostels and people who I describe as the near poor, because they used up a great bulk of their own resources to get into a resident funded hostel. The Government has seen fit to alter the arrangements that were made with previous governments, whereby these arrangements were put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> These voluntary organisations essentially obtained funds, as I have mentioned, under this system so that the Government would provide additional hostel capacity with no capital funding by government involved. In other words, it was to save the Government of the day having to find the capital to build the hostels to meet the demand of people who required a level of personal care which they could not provide for themselves in their own homes, where meals and some servicing would be available but not the sort of greater attention that is required in a nursing home when people are less able to look after themselves. There was an agreement-that is how the hostels saw it-between the Government of the day and them which they believed would be honoured and continue to be honoured by successive governments. There was an expectation that the recurrent funding would be made by successive governments, because the Government of the day had agreed to raise this capital money. The difference was that in relation to the other hostels, the Government was meeting both the capital and the recurrent costs. Those hostels were financially geared on the basis that they would often borrow the money and over time, with the way in which fees were paid, some of the capital would be recouped. There was a form in which resident funded hostels were developed with interest free loans financed by residents to meet the total cost of the project. Traditionally those ongoing subsidies enabled the hostels to keep weekly fees below the age pension rate, and that was an important factor in the financial way in which these hostels were developed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unconscionable for the Government to seek to rewrite an agreement retrospectively. It may be argued, technically, that the Government is now making it a condition of future recurrent funding that certain financially disadvantaged people be taken into these resident funded hostels. Although that may be a technical argument against retrospectivity, the impact of what is being proposed is certainly retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like the Minister to clarify for me whether he has discussed these matters, particularly, with the Uniting Church. I am not a member of the Uniting Church. I do not hold any particular brief for the Uniting Church in raising these matters. One of these resident funded hostels is in my electorate. I understand that it has been established for sufficient time so that this measure will not create a difficulty for it. The fact is that the impact of this legislation will vary greatly, having regard to whether a hostel was developed recently or is older. This is one of the points that needs to be clarified. I understand that officers of the Uniting Church have sought to see the Minister to put to him their concerns in a far more comprehensive and detailed way than I am able, particularly in relation to financing matters. They have not been able to see him in relation to these concerns. The Minister has said that the Government is keen to consult, sometimes there is too much consultation. I hope he is not saying, in relation to the Uniting Church's requests to see him, that there has been too much consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope also that the Minister will be quite precise as to which of these resident funded hostels is not willing to accommodate any disadvantaged people. I understand that the Uniting Church in particular has sought to take such people. Originally, the church saw it as part of its mission to take in financially disadvantaged people. It was to assist the near poor, as I have said. If the Minister has in mind particular organisations that have been involved in resident funding which do not see it as their lot to assist financially disadvantaged persons, let us have it out in the open: which organisations are saying this? The Uniting Church assures me that it is not in that group. It tells me that certain of its newer hostels are so financially geared that it would provide problems for them to take in financially disadvantaged people at this point whereas that is not the case among the older hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of aggregation arose in that area. I understand that the Minister has said that aggregation would be possible, that is, that the Uniting Church would be able to bring together all its hostels. Some of these hostels accommodate more financially disadvantaged people than the 20 per cent figure. The church wants to be able to say, `If our hostel at Ryde has a 40 per cent figure, the extra 20 per cent can go to, say, the Garrison at Mosman and be used to make up part of the 20 per cent financially disadvantaged component at that hostel'. That is what aggregation should mean, and that is what that organisation understood it to mean. I gather, from discussions with officers-maybe they do not understand what the Minister had in mind; I would like this to be clarified-that each hostel must have this 20 per cent component and that aggregation will be largely ineffective. This is of real concern to the Uniting Church. Its requirements could well have been met if aggregation were to be pursued in a realistic fashion. I understand from the way in which officers have proposed to rewrite the rules that the aggregation that was thought to be available under the Minister's written advice is, according to their understanding, not to be the case. That matter should be clarified today. It may well be that some of those concerns can be resolved. It does not in any way derogate from my principled concern that we ought not to rewrite these arrangements retrospectively, notwithstanding the Uniting Church's good intentions to provide accommodation for disadvantaged people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I recognise that you are very familiar with many of the issues that we are dealing with because of your chairmanship of the former House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure. The House and the country owe you and your Committee a great deal of gratitude for the work you achieved in developing a substantial increase in aged care reforms in this country. I make that point by way of introduction because this is a very complex area. In fact, the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition does not have very much to do with the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill. I suggest that the amendment relates more to the provisions of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1987. The Act was proclaimed and commenced operation on 11 January 1989. Prior to that time, the details of the new equitable funding arrangements for hostels had been the subject of very extensive consultation with service providers, consumers and other interested groups for much longer than 12 months. The consultations in their major form go back to September 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations, of which most voluntary care organisations, religious and charitable organisations are members, was involved in those discussions and there would have been quite extensive feedback throughout that time. That is an important point to bear in mind when considering the Opposition's amendment, which seeks to provide, in effect, that organisations which have not received Commonwealth capital funding-that is, the 100 per cent resident funded hostels-are not subject to the requirement to accommodate a percentage of financially disadvantaged people. We are talking about approximately 25 resident funded facilities out of 974 hostels Australia-wide. Of these resident funded facilities, 13 are Uniting Church in Australia facilities in New South Wales. As I pointed out in my reply to the second reading debate, the Commonwealth pays, on behalf of the taxpayer, a recurrent subsidy to ensure that all members of the community, including the financially disadvantaged, who need hostel care can get access to such important care. Since 1984 all hostels which have accepted Commonwealth recurrent funding either have been required under the terms of their recurrent funding agreement or have been put on notice to admit one financially disadvantaged person in every five people admitted; in other words, to accommodate a financially disadvantaged person component of 20 per cent. Of course, even prior to this time many hostels have sought to accommodate a percentage of financially disadvantaged persons. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the five years' notice already given to the hostels of this requirement to accommodate financially disadvantaged persons, the new arrangements have given further special recognition to the position of resident funded hostels by including quite generous transitional arrangements to 1990-91 to allow them to meet the requirement to accommodate this group. That has come out of the consultations and discussions between the Government and the industry. I do not think that the degree of consultation should be understated, nor the frankness and the mutual good intentions of the consultations and discussions which were carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to representations made by the Uniting Church during 1988, prior to the commencement of the new arrangements, I agreed to an aggregation arrangement whereby resident funded facilities could aggregate their requirement to accommodate the financially disadvantaged component of 20 per cent across all their facilities. This means that, in the case of the Uniting Church facilities in New South Wales, which is the case in point, this requirement can be aggregated across all 35 of its hostels in that State. People should not take from that that we are suggesting that aggregation means that residents will have to move from one facility to another. That is certainly not my intention. That is contrary to the whole concept of aggregation and certainly to the spirit in which that decision was arrived at.</PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that only one resident funded facility in Australia, which is in fact one of the 35 Uniting Church facilities in New South Wales, has not already entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth on the basis of the concessions that have been granted and agreed. The Garrison hostel was not originally capitally funded by the Commonwealth. Its entry contribution is between $150,000 and $240,000. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that the financially disadvantaged do not feature in this hostel's clientele. The Government recognises that aspect of the past. In the aggregation proposition that the Government has negotiated with the industry, in particular with the Uniting Church in New South Wales, we recognise many of the problems it has faced in the past and the problems it faces in dealing with the new arrangements which have to be taken into account nationally as well as in specific cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention that a study carried out some time ago indicated that the financially disadvantaged had only about 60 per cent of the access to hostel care available to the financially advantaged. Many of the aged in this country do not have access to the more secure or larger forms of self-contributory programs such as superannuation in the workplace, which is now becoming more and more a feature of income security in this country. Many people, because of chronic ill health, because of having a large family and being on a low income over their lifetime, or for many other reasons, have not had access to such programs. This Government is quite firm about and proud of the fact that it supports those people who do not have much money to ensure that, in their old age and when they are frail, they have access to secure and affordable accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention that, in order to assist organisations to adjust their financial arrangements in the transition to the new requirements, I have offered funding for a consultancy to assist operators, particularly of small homes, to achieve value and efficiency from these new arrangements. Considering our experience of the types of management consultancies that have taken place in the nursing home industry as a way of helping management to adapt to the changes, I expect that the community, and more specifically the hostel operators, will benefit greatly from this consultancy process and, through that, have a better understanding of the new arrangements and how best to make those arrangements work in their situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot support the amendment moved by the Opposition on the ground that in effect it has very little to do with the Bill before the House. It is more relevant to the earlier piece of legislation passed last year. I cannot support it also on the ground that I believe that satisfactory arrangements have been reached across the board for resident funded facilities, as evidenced by the agreements entered into by those organisations. In saying that, I recognise that many organisations and hostel operators are unsure of and perhaps lack full confidence in the new arrangements. That is understandable considering what is expected of them to plan for the future and to embark effectively upon a new world. </PARA>
<PARA> But I point out that, as with nursing home reform, any of these changes agreed to between the Government and the field will be closely monitored. In fact, we welcome the involvement of the industry and the sector in this monitoring, as we have done in the nursing home arrangements. If it appears that changes need to be made, the Government will make those changes. Having gone to the effort of ensuring the number of hostel and nursing home beds that have come on stream, there would be no value to the Government in seeing those lost because of lack of viability. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government certainly recognises the tremendous role played, particularly by the voluntary sector, in providing both hostels and nursing homes. I certainly applaud its effort over years and decades-efforts taken when there was very little government involvement. But times have changed. We are now in the situation of there being greater need in the community and a realisation that that care needs to be extended right across the community, not simply, as in decades gone by, to the lucky ones who had the opportunity to get into some form of aged care. </PARA>
<PARA> If further adjustments or transitional arrangements are necessary, they will be introduced as the need arises. Consultation with the industry certainly does not stop with the passage of this Bill. It will be an ongoing process which my officers are keen to ensure continues. That is the way we get feedback and that is the way we can progress with certainty in the future. Considering the very substantial subsidies that the Government, on behalf of the taxpayers, pays to hostel and nursing home operators, I hope that that spirit of cooperation will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of people from the Uniting Church, from every State and every organisation, have wanted to see me on this matter and it has been difficult for me to fulfil those requirements. That is why we have departments, and specialists within those departments, to deal with such matters. In relation to the points raised by those opposite, if the Uniting Church, because it feels it is particularly disadvantaged by these arrangements, feels that there are other points that need clarification after my Department has spoken to it, I will do what I can to meet with its members in order to see in what way the Government can help it, as I will do with any other organisation. </PARA>

<PARA> The Minister observed that the churches that have received capital funding-I make the point that they are the ones I am speaking about-have had five years notice of this change. He made the point that there might be further transitional arrangements running on until 1990 or 1991. The point I was making-it needs to be borne in mind-is that the arrangements that people have entered into involve financial commitments of a very considerable order and are for periods far longer than five years. We are talking about arrangements running over 20-odd years in terms of the way in which the capital was borrowed and lending arrangements negotiated. It was on the basis that they would receive recurrent funding over a long period that many of the people whom I describe as the near poor-I am not talking about the Garrison at Mosman-entered into these arrangements. The prospect is that in order to operate some of these facilities in future, when people who are taken in will not make a contribution to the capital fund, there will be a reorientation of the basis upon which the remaining 80 per cent will have to pay fees in future. In many circumstances that will mean an increase for them. I want to make my point clear because I noticed a letter in the Sydney Morning Herald of 30 December from the Reverend Harry Herbert of the Board for Social Responsibility of the Uniting Church. He referred to aged costs, as the letter was headed. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Sir: The announcement by the Commonwealth Government of ``a new deal'' for residents and operators of aged persons hostels may well deceive many aged persons and their relatives. While claiming to help aged persons many will be disadvantaged by this so-called new deal. </PARA>
<PARA>He was speaking about those who will have to pay increased fees. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Residents in hostels which cannot meet the new requirements will face increased charges when those hostels lose Government funding after January 11. Incoming residents in hostels which were built without Commonwealth capital funds face much higher entry costs as those hostels attempt to fulfil the new requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>He makes it clear and states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Uniting Church, the largest operator of non-profit hostels in New South Wales, is signing the new agreement only under the greatest protest. While the Uniting Church fully supports the basic policies that underline the new changes, it believes that the way in which the changes have been implemented has been mishandled by the department with unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister made the point that all but one of the resident funded hostel managements had entered into these new agreements, but it is clear that they did so under duress. They were told that there would be no recurrent funding unless they signed the agreement. The Minister said, `These are the terms. These are the dates. Sign on the line'. It is not a question of `You really don't have to. This is a fairly jolly arrangement. We're all here to help you. Put your signature here if you like. If you don't, take it to your lawyers. Consider it. Think about it', and so on. It was a question of `Sign and the funding will continue. If you don't, the funding will no longer be there'. If we had some commercial organisation entering into agreements with individuals on that basis, we would be referring the matter to one of the other departments for which the Minister previously had responsibility. I do not think that is the way in which these matters ought to be dealt with. I wrote to the Reverend Harry Herbert. I have met him in other circumstances. I asked him about this matter. He wrote to me responding:</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you for your letter of 6 January concerning the new hostels agreement being implemented by the Department of Community Services and Health. The policy aims of this move cannot be disputed. </PARA>
<PARA>It was not as though the church was complaining about what the Minister was trying to achieve. Its whole rationale is to help the poor, to help the needy. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The intention is to ensure that financially disadvantaged persons occupy 20% of beds in hostels and that all persons retained are not stripped of all their assets in paying hostel entry fees. The Uniting Church supports these principles. </PARA>
<PARA> However, difficulties arise in regard to hostels which were established without any Commonwealth capital funds. In these cases residents themselves provided capital funds under various arrangements. While the church wishes to make every effort to have lower income persons admitted to these hostels it is very difficult to achieve this at a level of 20% and in respect of persons classified as financially disadvantaged by the Department. The Uniting Church has attempted to obtain flexibility by seeking to be treated as a totality in the achievement of these figures but without success. </PARA>
<PARA> Some hostels will have to decide not to accept further government funding and this will mean fee increases for residents. Others will have to re-arrange entry fees so that higher fees will have to be charged. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of my letter to the Editor was to take exception to the claim by the Minister . . . that the new agreement represented ``a new deal'' for aged persons. Also, our church takes exception to the inflexible way that the agreement has been implemented by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the concerns expressed very frankly and clearly to me. I seek from the Minister clarification of the precise questions I have been putting. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I reiterate the question that I raised at the beginning of these comments in relation to meeting with the Uniting Church. I understand that the church has been seeking to see the Minister. I found the meetings very beneficial. I hope the Minister will see them as well and hear from them first hand. I am not trying to heavy-hand the Minister or to make political points-although everything is political in the way we discuss things. They have a difficult task to fulfil. They have people they have to satisfy. They will have to put charges on some people who will not be in a position to afford them. As I said, we are dealing with the near poor. The Minister has to understand these issues. It seems to me that the amendment we are proposing deals with the principle question as to whether one ought to be seeking to rewrite these arrangements retrospectively, whether we ought to be changing them. We are dealing with elderly people who really do not understand these issues. The Government has a particular responsibility to be totally fair and equitable in the way in which it addresses these matters. There needs to be absolute fair dealing with these old people. That is the standard we would expect of others. I think that is the standard people are entitled to expect of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might come as a surprise to the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples)-and I acknowledge you, Mr Chairman, as chairman of the former Standing Committee on Expenditure-that the McLeay Committee was commissioned by the Fraser Government. I also happened to be a member of that Committee. Although we spent a great deal of time on the recommendations, when I go into nursing homes and make that confession the guns are immediately turned against me as though I was the architect of the current state of affairs. No member of that Committee when forming those recommendations would have expected them to be delivered in the manner in which they are. With respect, what is happening at the moment obviously is an incapacity of the providers to be able to consult with the Minister face to face. In that respect, the letter that was written by the Minister to the Uniting Church, which had sought a meeting with him to discuss the matters, was obviously framed by his minders. It states in the last paragraph:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that I am unable to meet with you. </PARA>
<PARA>That was basically because of what was in the letter. That letter contained three conditions on aggregation that the Uniting Church found unable to accept. It is a matter of genuine consultation on which the Minister should meet these people. I can tell the Minister that it is not difficult to see them. I have been into many nursing homes over the last four or five weeks and I have consulted these people face to face. They are not difficult to consult. They continually bring up two matters. One is their genuineness to cater for the frail aged in the manner in which the McLeay Committee required. The second is that the delivery of those services is being prevented in many cases by a bureaucracy that is not consulting in the proper way. The best way one admits to not having a proper consultancy is by having an inflexible consultancy. I am suggesting that the whole lot of this is inflexible. The Government has appointed a consultancy to help people move from one position to another. It happens all the time in government. It is happening at the moment in disability services. A group outside is being funded by the Government to sell government legislation. I do not say that the Government should be prevented from doing that, but the Minister should not come in here and say that he is flexible. It is one of the difficulties under the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Act 1987. The Minister said that it should not be debated now, but I remind him that the full time given to a debate in November on an amending Bill which was of a similar nature to this was 45 minutes, under a guillotine. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I was just referring to a comment the Minister made in his response. That is why we take this opportunity for debate. I put to the Minister again the position of the Uniting Church, and other churches that have forwarded copies of correspondence to him. They are finding massive difficulties with the section 10f agreements. This would indicate that the consultation that the Minister refers to has not taken place. The references are to the gazettal notice that had a period of 28 days for absorption. When one is trying to absorb one's future, that is difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister also mentioned the fact that there has been a five-year period for transition. Only two of those years have gone by-1986-87 and 1988-89; the other three years are yet to come. I suggest that in this event, where people are trying to rearrange their affairs on a contractual arrangement, giving a five-year transition period is like a banker giving a loan so that the client can pay off his interest. All the Minister is doing is delaying the inevitable. If he talks about the generosity of the transition period, I must underscore the fact that there is a grave difficulty here that could be overcome by a simple amendment. If the Government is fair dinkum about wanting to relieve the pressures it should say, `We will buy you out of those capital funded beds'. The Uniting Church has 631 beds available. Twenty per cent of that is 126. The Minister advises that each bed for a financially disadvantaged person will cost $44,600, plus the land cost. If the Government is fair dinkum, and if it wants the 20 per cent in there, why does it not offer the money in order that the contractual arrangements can be satisfied? But no, it does not. Quite reasonably, the people observe this as being a financially disadvantaged persons tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the nursing homes nor the Opposition have said at any stage that the financially disadvantaged should not be catered for. In my speech during the second reading debate I said that we do not disagree with the philosophy. But in these particular cases where the Act has been found wanting, the Minister has displayed inflexibility by saying he will monitor. I say to the Minister that the Act of 1987 has been monitored to an extent where in these very few cases it has been found wanting. It has been delivered in a manner other than what the McLeay Committee would have envisaged at that time. As I took care to say in my speech, there is no financial disadvantage to the Government in doing this. When we talk about aggregation we talk about aggregation over the whole of the 947 homes. Perhaps in those terms that aggregation is not severe. But to do it in this way without offering to buy out and insisting on it being done by 1991-92 is to disregard the legal obligations that the homes have on these contractual arrangements. As the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said, these arrangements are not made over a five-year period. They are carried on over such a period that the finances and the homes themselves can be amortised before they are replaced. I went into that carefully at the beginning of my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation where the Minister is telling a volunteer organisation-a charitable organisation that has at all times been predominant in providing for those financially disadvantaged in that social class, not only in housing but in many other ways-that he does not trust them and does not believe them. When relief could quite successfully be implemented by our legislation, the Minister refuses to accept that on the basis that he will continue to monitor.</PARA>
<PARA> I have one other thing to say about consultations. We have referred to the document I'm Still and Individual. I was interested in a report in a paper on Monday that consultations had taken place in Canberra. A report was issued, but unfortunately it did not indicate what were the views of the providers and residents. It contained only those of the author of the report and the Department. I sought information from those people who were involved in that consultation process. It amazed me to see that after four pages of what the residents, the providers and the carers were saying to the Government as to how far off beam that report was, and after discussing this with the author and the Department, a reply came back saying, `We will still do it our way; we are not interested in what you say'. If that is the basis on which consultations are going to take place in this process leading up to a final report-and, I suppose, more general provisions under this Act-that is not the type of consultation that the people are expecting. It is an issue in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> On the McLeay Committee we did see instances where user rights were being abused. I believe we would have reported on that. Some homes were regimented in their nature and gave no flexibility or home comforts to those people who were going to be there for the rest of their lives. We understand that in some instances this is being done. But unfortunately the report is framed in such a way, as is the Minister's response to it, as to indicate that every nursing home and hostel throughout Australia is guilty of some form of abuse. The manner in which this is being presented is most unfortunate, particularly the manner in which the consultation process is being put into place prior to some final decision being made. We ask the Minister again to consider this as being a monitoring process. There is a deficiency in the Act and we ask him to please correct it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to leave the debate at this point but I think it is important to note what people see as deficiencies in consultations. Those consultations have been going on for a very long period-in fact, since well before I was the Minister responsible. If honourable members opposite-particularly the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite)-were to talk to the members of the Australian Affiliation of Voluntary Care Associations (AAVCA) they would understand that the agreement arrived at was the result of very extensive consultations over a very long period. I and many senior members of my Department attended these meetings and discussions, as well as the final formulation of the agreements. I would hope that they are not suggesting that agreements have been gone back on. As I understood from speaking to people from the AAVCA at the time, despite some concern in Victoria at the turn of the year, they were quite happy with the result. Unfortunately, we are dealing with a very complex issue. It is one which has been difficult for many hostel service providers to understand and to feel confident with, considering the nature of it and the changes that are put forward. The AAVCA is a major organisation which represents virtually all nursing homes and hostels in Australia. After considerable consultations with the Department, me and my officers, it has come to an agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as my offer to the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the Uniting Church to meet with them is concerned, I said-as Hansard will show-that if the Uniting Church wants to meet and discuss further with the Department its concerns, to clarify any problems and to assure itself of what the Government and the Department is saying in this regard, I think that would be appropriate, and I am sure my officers would be keen to do so. I will seek a briefing in response to that, and if there are still problems as a result of that-and I think there could be some confusion-then I will meet them. I make the point that consultation is relatively difficult. People often do not feel they have been adequately consulted when they do not get everything they want. I have met many groups, particularly those dealing with the major State voluntary care associations and also the AAVCA, in coming to these arrangements. I have attended the odd public meeting and general discussion. I think it would be silly to consider that a Minister should be able to meet every person or group who writes to him and asks for a meeting to discuss issues of particular concern to them. There is just not enough time to do that, physically. </PARA>
<PARA> In his closing remarks, the honourable member for Dawson made comments about I'm Still an Individual. I hope that he takes into account his experience of being around nursing homes in the past and currently and the consultation on the report that is now going on in the community. I expect that the consultant will take account of the views put forward by the community. It is travelling around Australia to get those views from the wider community as well as from the major cities. Honourable members should be aware that between 13 and 17 March there will be a residents' phone-in. That will be available for people who cannot physically make it to one of the many meetings being held around Australia. I hope that those opposite are aware of the extent of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly point blank, totally and unequivocally refute any assertion that I have made the suggestion that all nursing and hostel operators are to blame-I think that was the word that was used-for the situations expressed in that report. That is simply and patently not the case. I have been at pains continually, since day one of the release of that report with Ms Ronalds, to point out exactly the opposite, as I pointed out in my speech. I will probably have to keep on saying it until I am black and blue in the face, until people stop using it as a way to beat up some problems or because they have failed to listen to what has been said. I have said continually, and will say continually, that this issue involves the whole community in its attitude to old people and the way in which we, as a community, treat our old people. We should be giving them the dignity and the respect that they deserve. There are lessons in that for every one of us. No-one is perfect in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address the House on the Crimes (Hostages) Bill this afternoon on behalf of my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), the shadow Attorney-General, and I am very pleased to do so. He, I think properly, holds a reputation in this place as a very eminent and learned person in the law. I think it is very good that within the Parliament, particularly from the Opposition's point of view, we do have someone of his calibre to lead debates in the Attorney-General's area. It is not just good for the Parliament; it is good for the Opposition. It is well known that he runs rings around my colleague the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), and I am very pleased to speak on his behalf this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General will be pleased that the Opposition supports this Bill. There is no doubt that it does make good sense for Australia to accede to the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. It is the effect of this Bill to incorporate the provisions of that convention into domestic law. To put the convention into effect, the Bill creates the offence of hostage taking and imposed a penalty of up to life imprisonment for the commission of that offence. The Bill defines `hostage taking' as taking a hostage to compel a person, an institution in Australia or an international governmental institution to do something as a condition of the release of the hostage. It imposes a penalty of up to life imprisonment for the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill applies to offences committed in Australia or its external territories, in the Australian coastal seas or on an Australian ship or aircraft, and also to offences committed outside Australia by an Australian citizen, someone present in Australia, or someone who committed the act in order to compel an Australian institution to do or abstain from doing an act. Section 68 of the Judiciary Act requires the prosecutions to be pursued in State or Territory courts. The Bill is intended to be a companion measure to the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act, the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act, and the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is consistent with the Opposition's law and justice policy and with the Future Directions document which was so successfully launched by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) prior to Christmas. For those general reasons we support this measure. The measure, as is referred to by the Attorney-General in his second reading speech, follows consultations with the States as to its implementation. This cooperative federalist approach which has been picked up in this one instance is something which is very much supported by the coalition parties. I put on record the fact that the coalition parties have an excellent record in the criminal law enforcement area. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard in the last few days that the Government has this seven-seven tactic or strategy and wants to compare its term in government with the seven years of the Fraser Government. I welcome that. It is interesting that, after the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that strategy, within a couple of days he had decided to drop the whole idea. On Sunday, when one would have expected him to be talking about the great efforts of the Hawke Government after six years, he went to the races. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) said yesterday, the one good thing about that is that when he was gambling at the races he was gambling with his own money for a change. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition is very happy to look at records because the record of the Fraser Government in this area stands out as a very considerable record of achievement and effort. If one looks at institutions in Australia in this policy area, those institutions by and large were either initiated by, established by or followed initiatives of the Fraser Government. I think of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence; I think of the National Crime Authority, which followed initiatives by the Fraser Government; and let me mention Senator Durack and what a tremendous job he did when for many years he was Attorney-General of this country. I think of the Australian Federal Police in 1979-a tremendous initiative and a tremendous mark of the efforts of the Fraser Government. Kevin Newman was one of the Ministers responsible for that initiative. In the area of counter-terrorism, the Standing Advisory Committee for Protection Against Violence was another Fraser initiative. What a long list it is when one looks at the initiatives of the Fraser Government. It includes the National Police Research Unit and such things as the Australian Police Ministers Council. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that, when some bright spark had this idea to compare the Hawke years with the Fraser years, the whole thing was dropped like a hot potato after a couple of days. Whether it is home interest rates, whether it is a decline in family living standards, whether it is the increasing number of homeless young children in this country, whether it is policies to remove child poverty-whatever one nominates-the fact is that the Fraser Government matched this Government and then went further, when one looks at its tremendous initiatives. In terms of policy for the future, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), with a proposal for a national institute of forensic science, have contributed another important initiative which follows on the efforts of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition support for this measure is in part based on our concern at the increasing levels of violence in society. I referred to the Future Directions document a moment ago. One of the themes of that document is to reflect a view held by many people in the community that we really ought to be getting back to some basic values. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. If honourable members would care to turn to the Crimes (Hostages) Bill 1988, they will see that it refers to Australia adopting this convention into domestic law to deal with acts of violence over which this Parliament has jurisdiction. Future Directions outlines a view which is held very widely in the Australian community. People say, `You see things on television, but you never really thought that it could happen to your children'. There has been a bit of a heatwave the last few days and people are saying, `I can remember when in this country on a hot summer's night you could sleep with the front door open'. It is time for us to address some of the fundamental values and try to get back to tin tacks, if you like.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question that it is time that in the area of law enforcement, as it is in the area of government policy generally, we had some plain thinking. Future Directions contains more than 300 policy commitments. One of them is entitled `Stamping Out Terrorism'. The document contains within it-and this Bill is part of the implementation of this policy-the general framework which ought to be adopted by this Parliament in addressing these basic issues. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is general agreement among civilised countries that terrorism, both domestic and international, is a growing threat to the security of their governments and people. There remains considerable scope to develop common measures against terrorists, and against governments that sponsor terrorism or shelter terrorists. </PARA>
<PARA> To allow the present state of affairs to continue is, by inaction, to aid terrorists. Despite the great political and legal difficulties that confront the securing of effective agreement on co-operative measures against terrorism, it is our view that the dimensions of the problem and the threat it poses to the democracies are such that positive action is urgently required, including an initiative to examine ways and means of securing agreement on internationally agreed penalties on individuals and governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst individual countries faced with possible reprisals shrink away from tough action, terrorism will continue to be used as a powerful weapon to debase humanity and paralyse governments. By acting in concert with others the democracies can demonstrate that we will not be held to ransom by those who perpetrate such atrocious acts against humanity. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a direct quote from Future Directions which was launched by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) before Christmas. When it comes to providing some leadership and when it comes to reflecting community concerns about the need to get back to basics, traditional values, then this document and its success is founded on that capacity to draw on concerns widely held in this community. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply conclude by saying that the Opposition supports this Bill. It is an appropriate measure and, therefore, we give it our endorsement. However, it is but one part of a more comprehensive approach which is necessary. It is an approach outlined in Future Directions, from which I have quoted but one part. With those remarks, I endorse the Bill and commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that the Crimes (Hostages) Bill is endorsed by the members of this House. It is also very important that it proceeds as quickly as possible onto the statute books. I note the comments made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). He talked about the ongoing activities that have taken place under the previous Government and the Hawke Labor Government. It is important that this country is able to accede to and implement the international covenant and convention against the taking of hostages. There are many people out there in the broad community who, faced with fear and trauma when they hear of the hostages that are taken, the crimes that have occurred and the threats to aircraft, are worried about the whole scenario. It is important that we, as a nation, have the legal jurisdiction to deal with this problem. It is also important that we take an apolitical approach to this and that we do not have the Liberal Party and the National Party fighting each other as they often do on so many other issues, let alone fighting the Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be commenting on some of the other things that the honourable member for Flinders raised. I am sure that he did not stick to the Bill. He tried to talk about comparisons, and I will deal with that later. There is a need to ensure that we create offences of hostage taking and attempted hostage taking and that some action can be taken against those who participate or are accomplices in hostage taking or the attempt to do so. It is very important that we have jurisdiction over these types of offences in all the sorts of circumstances that can arise in connection with this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that the honourable member for Flinders has stated on behalf of the Opposition that it supports at least the general intention of this legislation. I say that because there is a very narrow and, unfortunately, very vocal point of view being expressed in the community which is being stirred up by some of the extremist groups on the Right. Regrettably, I have to mention again the League of Rights, because it seems to be groups associated with the League that are part of this. The vocal point of view that is being expressed is that Australia should shun involvement with the United Nations in every way, that it should cast aside any initiative taken at the United Nations General Assembly, that it ought not be part of any international convention or covenant and that we ought just to live our lives alone on this island. That worries me. It is important that these conventions are adhered to. If we are going to play our role as members of a world community, it is important that we participate and are active in these discussions at the world forum. More importantly, when decisions are made in bodies such as the United Nations that are aimed at protecting the ordinary citizens of the world, we should do our bit in bringing down the necessary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to these extreme groups because it was not so long ago that members of Parliament started to receive letter after letter about how we were part of some sort of convention to disarm Australians. Many people were saying this. Comments have been made at public meetings and all sorts of publications have been produced saying that Australia has signed a document at the United Nations level which will remove the right of any Australian to have a weapon. That is nonsense. The convention that that issue was aimed at was not to disarm Australians. That was a misconstrued, misrepresented position. It was referring to Australian participation in a world effort for nuclear disarmament. It was aimed at trying to reduce the number of weapons-in other words, a worldwide reduction in arms-across this planet. But those who want us to isolate ourselves, who want to keep tearing at the very fabric of this Government, this Parliament and our society, have as their tactic this misconstruction, misrepresentation, of these international issues, just as they did with this so-called move to disarm Australia. It was total nonsense, total lies, but many people out there believed it. </PARA>
<PARA> Because there is this consensus between the Opposition and the Government, the major parties-I would hope that the Australian Democrats would be a part of this and I am sure they will be-we need to come together to say that there are those types of issues dealt with at the international forums that we ought to be participating in. It is regrettable that it has taken so long. This was originally enacted at the United Nations in 1979 and it has taken a long time. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) said in one of his speeches, it is not up to us to explain why the Opposition when in government did not act on it during the period from 1979 to 1983. We have had a problem in dealing with it ourselves because of the negotiations that were necessary with the States and the Territories. But now we have this legislation that sets down not just guidelines but laws. It gives us the jurisdiction when we are talking about crimes that involve hostages. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is an island. Despite its geography and its position in this world, we cannot isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. We are affected by all the world events, sometimes in major ways, sometimes in a very partial way; but world events have a consequence for this nation. So we need to participate positively as a member of the world community. Yesterday I received a letter saying that we have no right to have a peacekeeping force anywhere in the world, other than in Australia. That is just nonsense, but it seems to be the mentality of some people. I have had letters saying that we should withdraw from the United Nations. I think the people who write letters of that sort have a myopic approach; they are blind to the realities of the world in which we live. I get letters continually saying that we must withdraw our aid. I say that we need to maintain our peacekeeping forces where that is seen to be in the interests of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to maintain our part and our role in world forums, particularly the United Nations. We need to maintain our role in providing carefully directed aid. And we need to be signatories to national conventions such as this. Australia has a responsibility to work with the nations of the world to combat the threats to the world, because in doing so we are combating the threats to Australia. That is a responsibility, whether the threat be through famine, poverty, war, or terrorism, which is what we are talking about here. We have to work to deter and suppress terrorist acts. We need to have in place adequate punitive measures. That means enacting legislation to give this Parliament national power. I accept that the States have certain powers in this field, but this is a national problem. We need to face the problem at a national level. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Flinders said, I believe this Bill is evidence of Australia's willingness to participate in these fields. We have had previous Acts. There was the Crimes (Hijacking of Aircraft) Act in 1972; the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act in 1973. Under the previous Liberal Party and National Party Government, we have the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act of 1976. So there has been participation on both sides in playing this role internationally and it should continue. There are also recent initiatives that the Attorney-General and other Ministers are involved in-initiatives to ensure that we maintain a role in the discussion at international levels about the way to stop and suppress terrorism at the airports, at the shipping ports, and at our offshore drilling rigs and platforms. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not solve these problems by hiding oneself in the island of Australia, hoping that they will all go away. One combats these problems by joining with other nations and working together with them to come up with a worldwide strategy and plan to have the instruments to fight the terrorists on their own ground. I am told that later this year legislation will be brought to this chamber to ensure that these discussions turn into law. We certainly need to approach these issues on a national basis and on an international basis. </PARA>
<PARA> There need to be appropriate penalties for terrorism. Also we need to send a signal across this nation and across the world that terrorist acts will not go unpunished. We also need deterrents and legal jurisdiction to be clearly established. I totally support what the Attorney-General has brought to this House. It is very important that the terrorists of the world know that Australia is part of the family of world nations in its efforts to try to put an end to terrorism. One would have to be the supreme optimist to believe that that will happen, but the terrorists of the world have to know that if there is an act that is affecting Australia in any way, then we will have our laws to act against the perpetrators of that act, particularly if it is associated with any airline, any port, or any shipping facility; we will have these powers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, terrorism brings fear into the minds of many people. We must act in a coordinated international way to end that fear to the best of our ability. This convention is part of that action and it deserves the support of all members, irrespective of their political persuasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), who so eloquently has put the Government's position and commitment with respect to this Crimes (Hostages) Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to enable Australia to accede to and implement the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. The effect of the Bill will be to create the offences of hostage taking and attempted hostage taking, and participation as an accomplice in hostage taking or attempted hostage taking, and to establish jurisdiction over the offences in a range of circumstances connected with Australia. The offence of hostage taking is defined in article 1 of the convention, which I will refer to in a moment. The offence of hostage taking created by the Bill and the related offences created by the Crimes Act 1914 extend to all prescribed acts committed both within and outside Australia, except those specifically excluded by articles 12 and 13 of the convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I turn to the specific terms of the Bill and the treaty which lies at its heart, let me reply to the unsubstantiated allegations made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). This debate has ranged quite widely-dare I suggest, trespassing slightly beyond what ought to be the ambit of the debate. I believe that the matters raised by the honourable member for Flinders ought to be replied to. He and his Opposition colleagues ought to hang their heads in shame that they dare to come into this chamber and trumpet the achievements of the Fraser Government. That Government had a sad and sorry record in failing to take up issues involving law enforcement and organised crime. I ask the people of Australia to judge the present Government on its record: The establishment of the Director of Public Prosecutions in March 1984; the establishment of the National Crime Authority; the convening back in April 1985 of the special Premiers Conference on drugs; the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, involving illegally obtained assets; and the commitment that this Government has brought to bear in making Australia a world leader in relation to extradition. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that when we came to office in 1983 Australia had one of the worst records in the world. It was only because of reforms of this Government that we were able once again to hold our heads high in the international community. So I say to the honourable member for Flinders that he ought to hang his head in shame if he comes in here supporting the record of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House is one that ought to have the bipartisan support of the Parliament. It was not my intention to introduce partisan debate in the course of my remarks, but I believe that the comments of the honourable member for Flinders had to be responded to. As I have indicated, the Bill will enable Australia to accede to the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, which was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 17 December 1979 and which came into force on 3 June 1983. We in the Government place great store on the potential for international cooperation to resolve a number of the world's problems. The issue of hostage taking, such as that outlined by the honourable member for Capricornia, is one that demands the coordinated efforts of all governments to solve. We are, of course, acting on other legislation to give effect to our international treaties in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent initiatives of the Government in this area to combat terrorism include participation in the negotiation of international instruments aimed at suppressing terrorist acts at airports serving international aviation and terrorist attacks on international shipping and offshore drilling platforms. The Government, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said, intends to introduce legislation to implement these instruments in the Parliament. There has been some delay in giving effect to the convention. The major part of that delay has resulted from the need to consult the States and Territories before Federal legislation was enacted. That consultation has occurred and the decision of the Commonwealth has been that we need national legislation for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is that it would not be possible for Australian participation in the convention to be based on existing State and Territory laws. State parties are obliged under the convention to make hostage taking punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account the grave nature of the offences. State law is unfortunately inadequate for the purpose. More importantly, existing State and Northern Territory offences do not have the necessary extraterritorial application required by the convention. A person who commits an act of hostage taking anywhere in the world must, in accordance with our obligations under the convention, be able to be tried, if found in Australia, or to be extradited to Australia if any of the grounds on which Australia is required to exercise jurisdiction apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is an important contribution. It is only one of a package of initiatives that the Government is taking to combat terrorism. I have read and seen, as have other people throughout Australia, some of the horrendous consequences of acts of international terrorism that result in the taking of hostages. To take just one of many examples, there was the case of journalist Terry Anderson, who was the bureau chief of Australian Associated Press in Beirut. He spent the first three weeks of his captivity lying chained to a bed, threatened with death if he uttered a single word. For the next six months he was beaten, kicked and tortured with taunts that his family and government had abandoned him. There is, of course, a new dimension to international terrorism and hostage taking, with the attack on the Achille Lauro with its crew and passengers aboard, which was, as the Sydney Morning Herald said in its editorial, and with which I agree:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . political terrorism in its essence: terrorism does not recognise an adversary's legitimacy but seeks to demoralise it with dazzling, spectacular violence. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the sorts of acts that are the subject of the Bill before the House today. As I have indicated, I join with the honourable member for Capricornia in strongly supporting this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other point I wish to make, and that concerns the terms of the convention concerning the extradition of a person who has allegedly committed a convention offence and who is found in Australia to be subject to extradition to a country where there is a doubt that person may obtain a fair trial. Article 9 of the convention provides that a request for the extradition of a person alleged to have committed a convention offence shall not be granted if the State party to which the request is made has `substantial grounds for believing' that the request was made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion, or that the person's position may be `prejudiced' for those reasons. Those concerns, that I think a great many people in the House would have, are dealt with in the Extradition Act 1988, which was proclaimed on 1 December 1988 and, of course, which is in all Australia's modern bilateral extradition treaties. I do not wish to comment further on the Bill. I join Government members and those members of the Opposition who have made a constructive approach to this important debate, in commending the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate. The Opposition has indicated its support for the legislation and my colleagues the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) have also indicated the need for Australia to accede to conventions, and particularly the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. It is an important convention which relates to the taking of hostages and terrorism. Whilst we would hope and pray that we will never be the subject of such incidents in Australia, that cannot be guaranteed. The United Nations, after looking at instances across the world, naturally wants to get some uniformity in the type of legislation that the world's authorities agree should be implemented. This legislation does just that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have excellent security agencies in Australia which are not able to advertise the problems that they think might be coming our way. They are all very vigilant in an effort to prevent such problems occurring in Australia. So it is important that when we have legislation such as this we get the cooperation of State governments, which we have got as there has been consultation in that respect. There have been arguments, as often happens in a federal structure, as to why we need Federal laws and why we cannot rely on State laws. I think this is an excellent example of the need to have Commonwealth legislation. When we are talking about penalties and the definition of offences, with the greatest respect to the States and the Northern Territory, they have different interpretations and different applications. We might find that penalties vary from what the international convention states ought to be the adequate penalty, in this case life imprisonment. In some States, we might find a narrowing of the definition of kidnapping and matters of that type, which might mean an inability to apply the terms of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that we feel it is in both the national and the international interest that we act on that basis. In no way should it be interpreted that we are trying to overcome States' rights in the matter. I know that has not been suggested, nor should it be. But it is important to make the point that we also have an obligation under Article 9, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Hughes, that if there are substantial grounds for believing that if an extradition request were made that the person asked to be extradited might well be the subject of punishment on the basis of religion, nationality or political opinion, we have an opportunity to evaluate that situation and possibly regard the person as being prejudiced and we may therefore be unable to agree to the extradition. In other words, the national interest understands all the problems that Australia faces in the world. Basically that was the background of the reason for Federation-that extraterritorially we would act as one nation, and this convention ensures just that. I thank honourable members for their contributions and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing to be said is that the coalition parties do not oppose this package of insurance legislation. As the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) noted in his second reading speeches on the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill and cognate Bills, it is the result of a recent High Court decision. The contents of the legislation-that is, the charging of a supervisory levy on insurance firms partly to cover the Government's administrative costs in regulating the industry and various other regulatory changes-were contained in the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1988 which was passed by the House of Representatives in November last year. So the essence of the legislation before the House was before us only a few months ago, but the Bill was withdrawn prior to being debated by the Senate in order to reassess the provisions in the light of the High Court's decision in the Air Caledonie case to reject the arrivals tax. The Minister explained that the reason for this course of action was to ensure that the provisions imposing the charges were constitutionally correct-an understandable course of action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition had no difficulties with the substance of the previous legislation. Given that the substance of the present legislation is practically identical to the 1988 Bill, we could hardly reject it, either. Indeed, the second reading speech delivered by the Minister on the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 in most places matches word perfectly the speech made in November 1988. That leaves me with the option of not needing to add a great deal to my speech made during the second reading debate last November. </PARA>
<PARA> I looked at the Hansard to recall what I said at that time. Needless to say, I still hold the views that were expressed then. Many of the points simply need briefly to be re-emphasised. For example, the first essential point that I made in November was that members of the House had virtually only the weekend in which to analyse the 1988 legislation before it was brought on for debate. I noted that this was simply another example of this arrogant Government's disregard for the role of Parliament and the people of Australia whom it represents-or is alleged to represent. Too often, badly drafted legislation has been introduced into Parliament with little time given for detailed consideration. It is certainly satisfying to know that the people of Australia have had the foresight at least to deny the Government a majority in the Senate, so that it cannot ram through legislation in that place. In order to appreciate that point, of course, only yesterday yet again Opposition sponsored and supported amendments from the Senate were brought back to the House to prevent injustices being perpetuated in capital gains tax legislation-the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA> I note that point, although I do not oppose the legislation, for the same reason that I gave last year. The Government has done the same thing again. This package of four pieces of insurance legislation is of great importance to the insurance industry, albeit that it is recycled. The same practices are occurring again. The legislation was introduced last Thursday, and I was then able to examine it. Here we are, on the following Tuesday, debating it on the next sitting day bar one. As I said last year, the excesses of slipshod drafting of taxation legislation are well-known. We certainly recall only too well the example of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) last year, in regard to measures related to the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), when he introduced 280 amendments to his own piece of legislation and gave the Opposition notice of the 280 amendments only the night before. It has not happened in this case. Let us hope that it never happens again. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I mentioned in my 1988 speech was the tardiness of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in introducing legislation dealing with changes to the insurance industry that were made or announced in the May economic statement. The May economic statement was the precursor to the Budget that was described on Budget night by the Treasurer as the one that would bring home the bacon. I have made a number of allusions to parts of a pig's anatomy, to which he was obviously referring rather than to the bacon, which I will not repeat tonight.</PARA>
<PARA> Given that I went into the relevant tax changes in detail in my November speech, I will not repeat my remarks now. Suffice it to say, however, that I raised then the question of whether the changes to the tax treatment of life offices and friendly societies would lead to competitive disadvantage for those types of investments. I said that, as a result, thousands of taxpayers may suffer greater tax because of their existing investment in life insurance. Those points were made last November. The legislation has still not been brought on for debate. It was announced in the May 1988 statement; it is now March 1989, and these allegedly essential pieces of legislation, foreshadowed in May last year, have still not been brought before the Parliament. Some certainty for an industry, and some certainty for those who seek to invest therein! We still cannot be sure what the implications are of that element of the May statement. In essence, we will be celebrating the first birthday soon without ever having seen the baby. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I noted in my speech last year was a comment in the second reading speech of the Minister on the 1988 legislation. He said that the charging of the insurance supervisory fee was done to relieve the burden of `taxpayers in general'. The same point is repeated in his speech this year. Just as I am going over a number of points for the record, so too did the Minister, in introducing his legislation, make essentially the same points as he made only a few months ago. Of course, I noted that I thought these were simply crocodile tears from the highest taxing government in Australia's post-war, if not entire, history. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth about the Government's treatment of the average Australian family is irrefutable. If one were to give a taxpayer, with a dependent spouse and two children, in receipt of average weekly earnings the same disposable income that he had in March 1983 when the Hawke Government came to power, he would actually need to be given an extra $56 a week. That is what I said last November. The irony is that since then, sadly, the figure has risen to $58 a week. That is the setting. The Minister has again expressed concern and sympathy for taxpayers in general, when the searing reality of this Government is that it is not only the highest taxing government in the history of the nation but also one that has reduced and depressed living standards as a result of its own default, neglect and ill advised policies that have been shown to impact on the overwhelming majority of low to middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been unable to answer the charge that we have levelled at it, supported by the research section of the Parliamentary Library, that if a person in receipt of average weekly earnings were to be given that same disposable income as he had in 1983, he would need a setting of $58 a week. That is outrageous. The Government cannot deny that figure. It cannot deny the simple fact that, at root, it has ripped into Australian living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I made in my speech on the legislation last year also dealt with the wider issues coming out of certain aspects of the insurance industry. I noted the public concern about the operation of the Western Australian State Government Insurance Corporation and Western Australia Inc. I dare say that we will hear a lot more as certain actions are commenced in Western Australia as a consequence of appointments made by the NCSC last year. I noted then the shady deals and the lack of public disclosure. We will get a bit more now. I noted that Western Australian voters would soon have a chance to register their disgust at such activities in the then forthcoming State election. They registered their vote. There was a massive, rarely seen, 10 per cent swing against the Australian Labor Party in that State, with a two-party preferred swing of 6 to 7 per cent towards the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA> A more important element is that bit by bit the truth is coming out as to what State Government owned insurers have been up to in Western Australia. If it were relevant tonight I would love to give a run-down on public institutions in Victoria and the way in which they have had their fingers in the till. The boys have been trying, like kids in a lolly shop, to get into the public funding through the Victorian Economic Development Corporation and the like. As to whether there is corruption, that will out even more in the months ahead. But here tonight we are dealing with insurance legislation, so I will not discuss that. In terms of what transpired with State owned insurers, the example was set before us. The great worry is that not only has there been a breach of trust in the insurance of Western Australia, but also there is the reality that State Government owned insurers are not subject to the provisions of the Insurance Act, and that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner has no supervisory role in regard to those insurers. Nonetheless they set a model for those public institutions to follow in terms of prudential management, a model that was not followed in the case of the Western Australian institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the coalition parties do not oppose these Bills. We hope that they will prove effective in improving the administration and the regulatory supervision of the insurance industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to support the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill, the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill, the Insurance Supervisory Levies Collection Bill, and the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill which we are debating cognately. As the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has noted, these Bills have been presented previously to the House basically in this form, and the Opposition does not oppose them. In general we could say of these Bills that they are aimed at maintaining effective supervision over the general insurance and life insurance industries, and also over insurance intermediaries. The Bills provide for the registration of insurance intermediaries dealing with unauthorised foreign insurers. They also introduce the concept of an appointed actuary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill introduces, in line with the 1988-89 Budget decision of last August, an annual supervisory fee. It says that that fee should be levied on general insurers, Lloyd's, and life insurers. This measure is intended to recover the ongoing costs of supervision of these bodies as described in the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945 by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. As I have said I am pleased to see that the introduction of that annual supervisory levy is not opposed by the Opposition parties. It was a decision announced in the Budget last year and it basically reflects the Government's view that in this industry there is a need, as has been given effect to in previous legislation, for some protective regulation of this industry, and that in terms of meeting the cost of that regulation-the Insurance and Superannuation Commission-there should be some element of user pays. As the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) made clear in his second reading speech last year, and again this year on the reintroduction of the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Bill, the Government believes that general taxpayers should not have to supervise the cost of regulating the insurance industry. We see great benefits in a properly and sensibly regulated industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent years the life insurance industry and the insurance industry in general has seen an enormous number of changes. We have seen an increase in the variety of products which are marketed and, consequently, the life insurance business is certainly much more complex today than it has ever been. It is in that environment that the Government believes there is a role for regulation, albeit in a limited way, of this industry, to ensure that the industry itself is held in high regard by consumers. In an era in which there have been rapid changes in the industry we think it is extremely important that consumers ought to be able to have confidence in the industry in which they are investing their savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of user pays covers many areas of government activity. The Government has embarked upon a program of recovering some of the costs of regulating an industry which confers benefits on its users. We have done it in relation to other areas of the finance industry such as approved deposit funds and, in relation to another Bill that will be before the House this evening, export inspection where in order to ensure that the quality of Australian agricultural exports meets a certain standard it is necessary for inspection procedures to be undertaken. The Government believes, as does the Opposition, that some element of cost recovery should occur. So in many areas of government activity there is an element of user pays. We believe in relation to the insurance industry that there is an appropriate role for regulation to protect and provide information and guarantees about the reliability, the worthiness, and so on, of those who participate in the industry so that consumers can have more confidence when they invest their hard earned savings.</PARA>
<PARA> When this legislation was debated last year, the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) spoke on these matters. I highlight the contribution which was made by the honourable member for Capricornia. He stuck very much to the precise terms of the legislation and indicated his interest in and his concerns for the insurance industry. He had been very involved in the consumer protection side of the industry and has had a number of meetings with the Insurance Council of Australia. I encourage anyone who is interested in these Bills and in the consumer protection aspect to look at the contribution made by the honourable member for Capricornia because it was a very good one. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong virtually repeated tonight the contribution he made last year. He made the same comments about matters relating to Western Australia and about taxation in general. Tonight he tried to introduce some element about the Victorian Economic Development Corporation. None of those matters is particularly pertinent to this legislation, but I think the comments that the shadow Treasurer made about the tax system and about the user pays principle warrant some response. The honourable member for Kooyong claimed in this debate that this Government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. I do not accept that remark. In fact, I reject it quite categorically. If one looks at the performance of this Government and at the relationship of government revenue to gross domestic product (GDP) one will see that it is quite clear-and judged this way by independent analysis-that total government revenues have declined for the last two successive years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1F4">Mr BRUMBY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. They have declined in the last two years in relation to gross domestic product. Furthermore, the point that is made about outlays is also incorrect. Under this Government, outlays have been cut from more than 30 per cent of GDP to 25.6 per cent of this year's Budget estimate of GDP. The expenditure pruning process which this Government has put into effect over the last three Budgets has been successful in reducing government outlays to a lower level than was ever achieved in the seven years of the Fraser Government. So I do not accept the shadow Treasurer's claim that a family on average weekly earnings is paying $58 more tax than it was seven years ago. I do not accept that proposition. I do not accept that it is accurate and, moreover, it fails to take account of the very considerable benefits which this Government has provided for what we broadly term the social wage. I am referring to elements such as the family allowance supplement which has helped more than 200,000 Australian families to maintain their living standards. I am talking about programs such as Austudy which has provided very significant boosts to families with children at school and at university, and I am talking about programs such as the first home owners scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appreciate that these Bills do not provide the opportunity for a general economic debate. However, the point was raised about taxation. The shadow Treasurer has been coming into this House for the best part of the last six to eight months claiming that taxation has increased under the Labor Government. He has not produced figures to sustain that, but moreover he has failed on every occasion to meet his commitment to announce the Opposition's tax policy from August last year. We on this side of the House, and people in the community, are still waiting to see whether the Opposition will produce policies that are going to return to the Australian taxpayers $58 per week, as was intimated by the shadow Treasurer this evening. To return that amount in the form of a tax cut to someone on average weekly earnings would cost well in excess of $20 billion. What the public would like to know, and what I would like to know as a responsible member of this House, is: if it is the Opposition's policy to fund tax cuts of that amount, exactly where is the money going to come from? Is it going to come from hidden taxes elsewhere or from expenditure cuts? If it is going to come from expenditure cuts, the public eagerly awaits advice from the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) as to where $20 billion worth of spending cuts can be made to finance the tax cuts which the Opposition suggests it will be providing. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the shadow Treasurer that the members of the Opposition went into the last election promising a fistful of dollars. They were resoundingly defeated. They were rejected by the voters for their overt cynicism. I would expect that as they go into the next election campaign they would at least have the good sense to announce their taxation and expenditure policies before that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills before the House are aimed at improving and maintaining effective supervision over the insurance industry. They have been developed after consultation with all of the relevant industry bodies. The Opposition quite strongly supports the Bills. I believe they are Bills which will improve and heighten the standing of the insurance industry in our community. They will improve its protection. They will improve it as an industry in terms of consumer protection. They will lift the general consumer confidence of this industry. Therefore, I believe the changes are very much in the industry's interests and in Australia's interests. I have pleasure in supporting them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 1989 has as its purpose an amendment of the Ministers of State Act 1952 to provide for an increase in the salaries payable to Government Ministers. Madam Speaker, you would appreciate as well as anybody the controversy that any pay rise to any occupant of this chamber, or for that matter the other place, causes in the community. This evening the House is to debate an increase in the salaries of Ministers. One is entitled to ask what the public is getting for this increase in salary. There are people suffering under crippling interest rates, people unable to purchase homes, people who have seen their disposable income eaten away by inflation, and people who worry about the nation's future, its balance of payments, its foreign debt and the value seesawing of the Australian dollar. There is a litany of errors of judgment which can be sheeted home directly to the occupants of the front bench of this Government, to whom we are now debating whether to give an increase in salary. For those families that are $58 per week worse off than when these Ministers took their ministerial oaths--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The Ministers of State Act requires a legislative amendment to increase ministerial salaries. This Bill therefore provides an increase in the limit on the annual sum appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue for ministerial salaries from $745,000 to $820,000, being an increase of some $75,000. This increase has resulted from two reviews conducted by the Remuneration Tribunal in 1987 and 1988. Following the 1987 review it was recommended in part that all politicians' salaries be increased by 2.2 per cent, effective from 1 July 1988. In its 1988 review the Remuneration Tribunal recommended that ministerial salaries be increased by 7 per cent, effective from 1 January 1989. This increase is in line with the national wage case increases granted to the work force under the second tier increase-and I refer you, Madam Speaker, to the March 1987 national wage decision-and the 3 per cent increase awarded in the August 1988 national wage decision. As the increases in ministerial salaries that I have outlined are in line with Remuneration Tribunal recommendations, the Opposition will not be opposing the Bill before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity to make some comments on the nature of parliamentary salaries. The truth is, Madam Speaker, as you will be very well aware, that members of the public, in Australia at least, do not regard politicians in the most favourable light. In Britain politicians' salaries are surprisingly low. They hover at around $35,000; the argument being that one does not want to attract anyone to public life just for remuneration. In other words, one does not enter parliament just so that one can secure a well paid job. The United States tends to go the other way. The salaries there are well into the six-figure amount. The United States believes that nobody should be disqualified from entering Congress for financial reasons and financial hardship. It tries to attract to public life very successful people that have proved themselves in the private sector and in some instances, naturally, the public sector. In Australia, we seem to fall somewhere between the two. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that there is never a good time to increase the salaries of politicians. Having been in this place for six years, I simply do not believe that we are attracting the best people to the Parliament. We are not attracting to public life the best qualified people and those with the best motivations. That is a general comment. It is not just related to salaries, which is just one aspect-one of the least important aspects--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-As I pointed out in my second reading speech last week, the only purpose of the Ministers of State Amendment Bill is to amend the Ministers of State Act to increase the limit for the annual sum appropriated from Consolidated Revenue in respect of the salaries of Ministers. That arose from the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal in July last year to recommend an increase in ministerial salaries of 2.2 per cent. It also allows for the recommendation of that Tribunal of an increase in ministerial salaries of 7 per cent in report No. 2 of 1988. That increase was effective from 1 January 1989. As I said, the only effect of this change as far as the Act is concerned is to increase the total sum paid in ministerial salaries by $75,000 this financial year. I do not think that the Opposition's spokesperson on this subject, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), raised any particular matter that I should specifically respond to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Amendment Bill 1989 lifts the legislative amounts for export inspection of grain and dairy products and removes other items which are now charged on a fee for service basis rather than on quantity. The actual operating levels are not included in the Bill. These are set by regulation and most were increased on 1 October last year. The Bill extends the Government's push towards a fee for service for export inspection instead of a charge per quantity. Of the 174 items now inspected for export, only some dairy products and grain remain on a quantity basis. The current legislative maximum for dairy products is $5 a tonne and the proposed maximum is $10. Grain is split into three groups: bulk grain, which has a legislative maximum of 33c a tonne, will be lifted to $1; bagged grain, which has a maximum of 33c a tonne, will also rise to $1; and containerised grain, which has a maximum of $1.46 a tonne, will be lifted to $5.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The passage of this Bill will result in the Government regulating to increase the inspection fee for bagged grain from 30c to 47c and containers of grain from $1.46 to $2.95. The fee on bulk grain was increased from 16c to 17c on 1 October last year. I have been advised it will not be increased again before the next annual review. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy claims it has been losing money on bagged and container inspection because the current maximum in the Bill does not allow it to recover costs. It states that residue testing of grain has resulted in a 31 per cent increase in costs. This is a major reason for the large lift in the maximum fee. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no increase in the operational costs of dairy products. These fees actually fell on 1 October last year due to efficiencies made in the service and no change is planned before the next annual review. Many dairy factories now undertake approved quality assurance programs, and the Inspection Service then just monitors the program at a cost of $49 an hour. More factories are moving to this type of inspection and saving costs. The Department anticipates having all grain on a fee for service basis by 1 October this year or earlier. While fees have not been set for this, the current fee for inspection of grain ships is $47 an hour. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition supports the general thrust of the Government's changes to export inspection policy, which actually commenced under the relevant Minister in the previous coalition Government, Mr Peter Nixon; but there are problems, particularly with some horticultural products. While the Government has targeted horticulture as a growth area for exports, the Inspection Service fee is causing untold damage to many budding industries-no crack is intended there-and the Government appears to have filed these problems in the too hard basket. </PARA>
<PARA> One example we had recently was Wondabah Orchids Pty Ltd. That is a company that has been caught by the inflexible rules which are, if not ruining, certainly restricting its export business. One of its regular overseas orders is from a small island for about $100 to $150 worth of orchid plants. The inspection fee was previously zero. Now the export attracts the minimum of $47. Of course, the order has been cancelled because there is no profit in it. During the last week in February this company received three inquiries from France, including one via a recommendation by the Australian Embassy in Paris. But there is no way in which that company can send the French a catalogue telling them that for any order there is a $47 charge, and that charge even applies to a sample. There is obviously no hope for any order to be won on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In the nursery business much of the overseas business is obtained by supplying samples. This allows the buyer to inspect the quality and ensure that plants and flowers will travel well and arrive in good condition. Even those samples attract a $47 inspection fee, and this has caused many nurseries to decide not to try to get into the export market. Yet a private person who wants to take a plant or flower overseas can take that plant to a central place and have it inspected free. Surely the same system could be applied to orders of, say, under $500. The nursery people, as I have been advised, would be happy to take these consignments to a central place and the fee could be abolished or drastically reduced for these consignments. This would also avoid the unbusinesslike way in which inspectors are obtained at the moment. Most nursery people actually have to ring inspectors at night at their homes to arrange for them to come to inspect a consignment. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Opposition is in general agreement with the fee for service, we certainly do not agree with the Government's decision to break its promise to recover only 50 per cent of inspection costs from industry. Most industries now have felt the full force of the increase to 60 per cent recovery, and they will not forget this at the next election. It is obvious that it will not end there. The levels of the legislative maximums in this Bill will allow the Government to move up to 100 per cent recovery of costs purely by regulation, once this legislation is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties believe that the people of Australia, as well as the exporters, have an investment in exports from this country. The overseas income helps all Australians gain a better standard of living and obviously reduces that terrible trade deficit which we have at the present time. We believe that all Australians should share in those export inspection costs. When the coalition parties are returned to government at the next election, we will reduce the recovery to a maximum of 50 per cent, instead of the 60 or 100 per cent of the present Government, and we will encourage exports by solving the inspection problems of the small and new exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about 60 per cent or 100 per cent of cost recovery, what are we talking about? Sixty per cent or 100 per cent of what? At the moment there is no accountability back to the exporters who are being forced to pay this increasing percentage of an arbitrary charge. I think in particular of the absurd situation reached with the fisheries section of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, where there is now a 90 per cent recovery, allowing that section of the Department to build an empire within the Department, all on fisheries levies and charges. </PARA>
<PARA> In government, the coalition parties will encourage export industries to increasingly self-manage-and self-assure, if you like-and stand by the brand images of their products. I do acknowledge that the Government is also on this path with its quality assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government export inspection arrangements should be limited to what is required by international agreements or by importing countries. Outside that, it should be left to the exporter to maintain that quality standard. Our Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) also has a responsibility, as well as its work with the export inspection services, to assist Australian exporters to overcome quarantine barriers and gain access to overseas markets for our exports and also to determine whether imports of plants and animals meet our quarantine protocols. Having seen a variety of examples, I am forced to say that I sometimes wonder whether AQIS has its priorities wrong and encourages imports of doubtful quarantine validity more than it assists exports of our products or assists our exports to overcome other countries' quarantine barriers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Opposition is not opposing the Bill, but we do want to highlight to everyone engaged in the export of agricultural commodities the Government's broken promise that it would recover no more than the 50 per cent cost of this arbitrary inspection levy and also the sly way in which this Bill reveals that the Government is well down the path to 100 per cent recovery, while at the same time the Government claims that it is supporting and encouraging exports. For that reason, I move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) for breaking its commitment to recover not more than 50 per cent of the cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) for its obvious policy to move to 100 per cent recovery of the cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities, as evidenced by the dramatic increase in the maximum permissible levels of this Bill'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Export Inspection (Quality Charge) Amendment Bill will make the rate of recovery of costs for export inspection more efficient and equitable. It will place inspection costs on time rather than on the volume of the commodity exported. This reflects the Government's policy to recover 60 per cent of the cost of the provision of inspection services for agricultural export commodities. An expanding number of companies, however, are entering into approved quality assurance arrangements with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS). Under these arrangements companies undertake to apply mutually agreed quality control procedures. AQIS then limits its activities to infrequent auditing of those procedures rather than maintaining a permanent or regular inspection service. This style of inspection is available to non-meat products and, consistent with the Government's thrust towards industry self-regulation, it is the sole mode of inspection in the case of live fish exports and canned fruits and vegetables. It is intended to extend approved quality assurance (AQA) inspection techniques to the meat sector as agreement with overseas markets permits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is moving towards fee for service charging for its activities in place of the previous charges per unit of production. That is a positive step. Programs such as AQA and fee for service charging are demonstrating that substantially reduced costs for both government and industry are poss- ible, as well as greater flexibility for industries in adapting to new or changing markets. There is scope for additional cost cutting with the application of those measures to the meat industry, along with the development of a national meat inspection service and the introduction of new technology related to inspection and quality control. </PARA>
<PARA> There are eight items of note in this Bill-eggs, fruit other than dried fruit, fruit juice, fruit products, fish, vegetables, vegetable juice and vegetable products-and I would like to concentrate briefly on vegetables. I mention in passing the improved export inspection service which is being offered to the expanding horticultural industry in Bundaberg. The industry has grown from a $14m enterprise to one worth in excess of $100m during 1988. Leading the way in this is the famous Bundaberg tomato crop. Tomato production increased in 1988 by 14 per cent to over 7 million cartons and the value of the crop jumped by 42 per cent to over $83m. Capsicums were the second most valuable crop, being worth a total of $6.46m. Zucchini production is now worth $6.11m and rockmelon production is now worth $5.86m. </PARA>
<PARA> The horticultural industry in Bundaberg is now a major source of jobs and income for those living in the Bundaberg district and, more importantly, for Australia. It shows the ability of farmers and others to adjust and to adapt to changing markets. It also shows the potential there is, particularly in the Bundaberg region which has the best and most equable climate in the world for agriculture, particularly the horticultural industry. I believe that as we look towards Asia and its improving living standards in the years to come, we have a massive market that is still untapped. With that will come dollars that Australia will welcome. Of course, it will also mean jobs and security for families in my district. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is constantly on the lookout for export markets and needs to ensure that its product is of top export quality. The industry asked me recently to approach the relevant authority for the location of an export inspection officer in Bundaberg. Inspection is carried out by officers of the Queensland Primary Industries Department on behalf of the Commonwealth. I am pleased that the Queensland Primary Industries Minister agreed to that request on behalf of the industry and that the State Government has acted in that way. It is a very positive step and is a great plus for our district. </PARA>
<PARA> Several years ago the Federal Government initiated a country centres study to help define new investment opportunities for development. The study identified the need for the development of sustained export markets in the Northern Hemisphere. It will require very efficient time management of all relevant elements in the marketing process to ensure that products are delivered to these markets in the appropriate off-season times. But there are marketing niches there for a lot of our products. </PARA>
<PARA> The expansion of the market will also create important opportunities for various services to be introduced. This will include packing services and the need to establish dedicated export packing sheds. It will need the production of packaging services. Each product will require purpose built packaging materials and containers tailored for specific markets and transports. The study recommended that an export standards branch be established in Bundaberg to help in the promotion of export products. The industry has already demonstrated a flair for international promotion. Its activity displays at Expo 88 were outstanding and a credit to the industry. That demonstrates that we can get up and beat the rest of the world; it just needs a positive approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The production of high quality goods from the Bundaberg district will give the horticultural industry the reputation it needs to carve out its name in world export markets. We are already doing that in manufacture and I believe that we will continue to do it in agriculture. The Minister for Primary Industry and Energy (Mr Kerin) has assisted the tomato industry with the approval of an innovative agricultural marketing program grant for local grower Mr Ron Simpson to help him in the export of refrigerated tomatoes. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the overall cost impact on industry and on the recovery of costs to the Commonwealth will be minor. The saddest thing I have seen today was at Question Time when the Opposition showed that it still has no agricultural policy and no fiscal policy. Indeed, the greatest decision that has helped agriculture has been the floating of the dollar, which has not been recognised by the Opposition. While the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has told us what he will do when in government, unfortunately he is never going to have the opportunity. Not only the agricultural sector but also the Australian community recognises that the Opposition is a sad sight compared to 20 years ago. It does not have any policies and it does not have any hope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to admit that I was agreeing with the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) until he got to the end of his speech, when I thought, `How pathetic'. I agree that we can and should match the rest of the world in our exports and that we should be working at that. I preface my speech by seconding the amendment moved by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and explaining in some more detail why it is necessary to move this amendment. It highlights where this present Government, and particularly the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), has been very deceptive in the way it has approached the whole question of export inspection charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As was pointed out by the honourable member for Murray, the Government came to the last election and put up a promise that it would not increase export inspection charges. Come the May statement of last year, for some reason that promise, like so many other promises that were made to primary industries, just got jettisoned. It was like the promise made to the wool industry about the level of government funding for promotion and a number of other promises that could not even see out 12 months, let alone six months. Another broken promise, which I am going to come to in more detail, is the undertaking given to the Victorian Government on the question of the transfer of the Victorian meat inspection service. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Minister in his second reading speech made reference to the fact that in determining the revised maximum rates for quantity charge specified in the Act it has been necessary to set rates of charge at a level which will allow scope for any future response to inflation-which is interesting-or appropriate changes in policy. Those last few words are very relevant. The Opposition is moving an amendment to point out, first of all, that the Government has broken its promise about the 50 per cent cost recovery and, secondly, that, when one looks at the way the maximum level for the levies or fees is going to be set, it allows the Government scope to increase this cost recovery. If one looks at some of the case studies, we find that on butter, for example, the current charge per tonne is $2.39 and the current maximum is $5. That is already more than double the current maximum that can be charged, not is being charged. Yet the proposal is to double that maximum possible charge again to $10. There are other examples. Bulk grain is currently 17c a tonne. The current maximum is 33c, which is almost double the maximum which can be charged. The Government wants to treble that to $1. The current charge for bagged grain is 30c. The proposed charge is to be lifted by over 50 per cent to 47c, yet the proposed maximum is again $1.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition has done in moving this amendment is to warn Australian primary producers that the Government does have a hidden agenda-it is not prepared just to move from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, which, as the Minister has already stated, is a fairly arbitrary move anyway-and that it does have plans to increase it further if budgetary requirements force it to do so. All Australians should have a long hard think about this Government and, in particular, about this Minister, who was prepared to go to the people at the last election and say that 50 per cent was the maximum; yet he has already increased it to 60 per cent, and who knows whether it will go further. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that, as the honourable member for Murray has already pointed out, the coalition has given an undertaking that it will reduce the maximum cost recovery to 50 per cent. I emphasise that we are talking about a maximum, not necessarily the actual amount. To emphasise the ad hoc way that the Government has gone about setting this increase I would like to quote briefly from the Ausmeat Feedback magazine of December last year. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was being interviewed. He was questioned on the fact that cost recovery had been increased to 60 per cent and asked whether it would move up further. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>No, I thought it could stay at 50 per cent, but a 40 per cent subsidy by taxpayers seems reasonable enough. There are some pretty arbitrary decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the Minister's words, `some pretty arbitrary decisions'. In other words, he thought 50 per cent was all right but someone-probably the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-said 60 per cent and the Minister thought, well, that is not too bad, and he went on to say that there are some fairly arbitrary decisions, so presumably he would not be too worried if it happens to be increased a bit more. In fact, as the Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I used to think 50/50 was the fairest all round, given the statutory requirements of the customer countries. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Minister thought that 50 per cent was all right, but he is prepared to give in every time the Treasurer says, `We want a bit more money. Go and get it from the farmers'. What does the Minister do? He says, `Yes, well, look, here is a way to do it'. He went on to say, in this interview, justifying his 50 per cent:</PARA>
<PARA> And because there is a public health matter involved I suppose taxpayers should pick up 50 per cent of it. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was a reasonable attitude. It was something that the Minister ought to have had the guts to stand up for in Cabinet. If he believed that 50 per cent was reasonable, why did he not stand up to the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh)? The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> While I wouldn't use the word trade-off, there was balancing done. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this Minister-the man of great principle-when it came to raising more money from farmers and extracting a bit out of them, thought 50 per cent was reasonable, but he was not prepared to stand up in Cabinet and fight for the farmers. In view of the track record of this Minister, I think it not unreasonable for the Opposition to move the amendment that we have, pointing out our concern that the Government obviously has a hidden agenda to increase cost recovery to 100 per cent. I noted that the honourable member for Hinkler and the May mini-Budget statement made an interesting reflection on the matter by saying, when the Government increased cost recovery from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, `Greater cost recovery will encourage industry to take a closer interest in how the services are provided and to ensure that overall inspection costs are kept down'. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the obvious question: why is an increase from 50 per cent to 60 per cent going to change anything? Clearly, if there is cost recovery of 50 per cent, that should be enough incentive to make sure that there is a closer interest in how the services are provided and that efforts are made to ensure that the costs are kept down. Increasing the rate from 50 per cent to 60 per cent is not going to alter that. All it is going to do is give the Government an opportunity to use it as another form of revenue raising at the expense of the primary industries. I would also like to allude to another area in which this Minister has shown that his word is not worth a great deal, and that is when the Victorian meat inspection-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would point out that in Victoria, when the meat inspection service was handed over to the Commonwealth, an undertaking was given to the Victorian Government and through it to the Victorian Farmers Federation that the cost recovery would not be increased from 50 per cent. Yet within two months the Government broke that undertaking and, as was pointed out in a couple of letters which I will quote from briefly, even the Victorian Government was caught unawares by the fact that its Federal counterpart could not keep its word on the question of whether or not it would increase cost recovery. The president of the pastoral group of the Victorian Farmers Federation said in a letter to the Hon. Evan Walker, then Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is disappointing in the extreme that less than two months after the transfer, the Commonwealth has moved to breach the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words, `to breach the agreement'. The writer went on:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that you share our concerns at this attempt, and are to discuss the matter with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Hon. Evan Walker, in a reply to the Victorian Farmers Federation said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Minister, Mr Kerin acknowledges there was an agreement for this to occur during his term as Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The agreement was that the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy would maintain the cost recoupment level at 50 per cent. That was an undertaking given to the State Government and within two months the Federal Government reneged on it. Yet members on the Government side wonder why we question the integrity of some of the people involved. Having highlighted why we feel it necessary to move this amendment, why we suspect that the Government has a hidden agenda, that the 60 per cent cost recovery is not going to be sufficient, and that its rapacious attitude towards ripping off primary producers will show in due course that the Government has another plan to increase that cost recovery, I want to look at some of the problems that have arisen since the Government announced that it was going to move to the fee for service arrangement for meat inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government announced that it was going to change that arrangement on 1 July last year, it also repealed the statutory per head inspection charge of $2.50. The intention was that meatworks would be responsible for paying a meat inspection fee, but that inspection fee would no longer be related to the per head charge. Regrettably, some meatworks decided that they would continue to raise that levy and at the same time would pay the Commonwealth under the new fee for service arrangement. Figures that have been produced to me show that in at least five cases these meatworks were making a profit out of this arrangement. They were deducting more from the proceeds that they were paying to producers for their livestock than they were paying to the Commonwealth for the cost of the meat inspection under the new fee for service arrangement. I flag that issue because the Government has clearly been negligent in allowing this to go on and is doing very little about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite obviously a number of meat works have been overcharging and not only overcharging but making a profit by deducting more from the grower's proceeds than they are paying for the service for which they claim a deduction. Furthermore, they are deducting under a system which no longer requires them to do so. In support of the coalition's amendment we highlight the fact that the Government broke an undertaking that it would not increase the cost recovery from 50 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A blatant disregard, I agree. I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his interjection. We draw attention to that fact. Furthermore, as I have demonstrated by the actions of this Government, not only was it prepared to break the undertaking, but it has raised the ceiling for the level of inspection charges that it can impose so that it has more than adequate room to increase those charges further, possibly up to 100 per cent. So we have moved, as a second part of our amendment, that we condemn the Government for its policy of moving towards 100 per cent cost recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have pointed out that the Government gave the undertaking. I have shown that the Minister, in an interview towards the end of last year, said that he believed that 50 per cent was a reasonable figure. But he was not prepared to stand up for it in Cabinet. He just walked away from that belief. Within two months of giving an undertaking to the Victorian Government that the cost recovery charges would not be increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, he walked away from that undertaking. Therefore the amendment deserves the support of this House and the Minister and the Government deserve the condemnation which the producers of Australia will so rightly give them for the way they have behaved over this whole question of export inspection charges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to rise in this debate and indicate my support for the legislation which is before the House and my opposition to the Opposition amendment. The basis of the Export Inspection (Quantity Charge) Amendment Bill in a sense arises from the May economic statement, in which the Government announced a policy of 60 per cent cost recovery in relation to costs incurred by the Government in providing inspection services. The Bill before us puts effect to that announcement, and the amendments contained in it allow appropriate levels of charge to be set for effective recovery of costs for export inspection of dairy produce and grain. The exclusion of a quantity charge on certain commodities results from the Government's move towards the recovery of costs on what we strongly believe to be the more efficient and equitable basis of inspection time used rather than the volume of commodity exported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation is sound. It is based upon the principle that there ought to be a contribution by the industry towards the cost of providing export inspection services. In this Bill we have announced an increase in the recovery of costs from 50 per cent to 60 per cent but also a shift away from the quantity based charges which apply to some export commodities at the moment, and we have moved towards what I think in anybody's understanding is a more efficient and equitable basis of charging on the basis of inspection time used, rather than simply on the volume of goods exported. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has claimed in this debate, and in the amendment that it has moved, that the Government has some sort of hidden agenda and intends moving towards 100 per cent cost recovery in relation to all the export inspection services. There has been no announcement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) or any decision by the Government to that effect. Tonight we are debating a Bill which seeks to recover 60 per cent of the cost of inspection. It is worth pointing out to the House and to those listening to this debate that the Opposition, when previously in government, had decided to move towards a much more significant level of cost recovery in inspection services. I think, therefore, there is some agreement across the House that a level of cost recovery is important in terms of a contribution by the industry towards inspection services and towards ensuring that the inspection services which are provided, are provided in the most efficient and equitable way. As I say, there is no hidden agenda. There is no secret decision waiting in the wings to increase this to 100 per cent. This legislation before the House moves the system from a quantity based to a time based system and it lifts the level for recovery for some quantities-I shall return to that point shortly because at the moment we are talking about only some commodities-from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. In all of these changes there has been consultation with the industry. That is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of claims made in this debate by the two Opposition speakers who have so far contributed. I suspect that by the completion of tonight's debate there will be a number of other claims made which are not factually based, which are simply errors of fact. I think that the Opposition, particularly the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), whose contributions in this House are usually well informed and thoughtful, is confusing the legislative limits which have been set in previous legislation with the changes which are announced in this legislation. I will give the honourable member for Wannon the example of the dairy industry, and I refer particularly to the major items of butter and cheese which are exported. The current legislative limit for export inspection charges is $5 per tonne for butter and cheese. The proposed legislative limit is $10 per tonne. But the actual inspection charge which is levied on butter in that industry was $2.42 per tonne in 1987-88. In 1988-89 it is $2.39 per tonne. In other words, despite this legislation, despite the changes and despite the 50 per cent to 60 per cent cost recovery, there has been a reduction in the charge attracted by products in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the honourable member the example of cheese. The current legislative limit is $5 per tonne; the new limit is $10 per tonne. The charge for the previous financial year, 1987-88, was $4.48 per tonne; and the new charge is $4.42 per tonne, a reduction in nominal terms and a significant reduction in real terms. Current charges on other elements in the dairy industry are $3.79 a tonne, and the new charge is $3.74 per tonne. So in all of those areas there is in real terms, and indeed in these examples in nominal terms, a reduction in the actual export inspection charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I have alluded particularly to the dairy industry, but I make the more general point that all of the 164 export charges are less today in real terms than they were four years ago. I am reliably informed that two-thirds of all of the recoveries in this industry for export inspection charges are for meat. The honourable member for Wannon has a particular interest in the meat industry, which I fully recognise and understand. But if we look at the statistics-and I hope he does before he decides to vote on this amendment later tonight-we see that the charges which are being levied now for meat inspection are 18 per cent less in real terms than they were four years ago. </PARA>

Over recent years significant improvements have occurred in the efficiency of the inspection service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are increasing the level of cost recovery, but despite the increase in that level, the actual charge for meat inspection is 18 per cent less in real terms than it was four years ago. In other words, producers, the Government, exporters and Australia are better off in terms of a more efficient export service than was being provided some years ago. The point about industry efficiency is important, and it is one of the changes which are embodied in this Bill which is a shift away from the quantity based charges to the time based charges, and it is a shift that we believe is important because it will engender in the industry increased opportunities for further improvements in productivity and efficiency. Seventy per cent of the charges on those 164 products are already on a fee for service basis. In this legislation we are talking about changes to the other 30 per cent. We are trying to ensure that throughout the industry there is a basis for improvement in efficiency in the way in which agricultural export products are inspected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wannon also made some points about the domestic meat inspection situation in Victoria. He claimed that the Commonwealth had breached a clear understanding and a clear commitment with the Victorian Government. I can say quite categorically-I say this particularly for the benefit of the honourable member for Wannon, because he has a particular interest in these matters-that because of the transfer of meat inspection services from the State to the Commonwealth, and because of improvements in efficiency in that industry, meat producers in Victoria this year will save $4.5m in meat inspection charges. So the shift from the State to the Commonwealth, coupled with improvements in efficiency that have occurred, despite this change from 50 per cent to 60 per cent cost recovery, will save meat producers in Victoria over $4m. </PARA>

I would have thought that as sensible members of Parliament our objective in discussing any legislation that comes before the House, particularly legislation which relates to such an important matter as the inspection of exports, particularly in the meat industry, where there have been problems in the past-I do not need to remind the House of that-would be to provide the best possible service at the lowest cost. Despite the honourable member's quibbling and his semantics about this 50 per cent or 60 per cent stuff, what I am telling him is that for export products in total the cost of inspection has declined in real terms over recent years. The reduction in the meat industry has been 18 per cent in real terms over the last four years, and in respect of Victoria, about which the honourable member for Wannon has made a particular point in this debate, meat producers this year will save $4 1/2m in inspection costs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who could have saved more? They have saved $4 1/2m. Someone has to meet the cost; we are trying to apportion the cost in a fair way. All these changes show that with a bit of leadership such as that provided by this Government, with a sound legislative framework, and with new criteria and new arrangements in the inspection of export products it has been possible during the period of this Government to produce demonstrable savings. The statistics are correct. I cited the dairy industry before, in which the charges are less in nominal and real terms. The dairy farmers north of Bendigo-not in my electorate but in the electorate of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd)-are benefiting from this. Are honourable members opposite telling me that those farmers will complain-in a period in which inflation is rising by 7 per cent but they can have their export product inspected for less in nominal terms and real terms than they could last year? They will not complain. They will be pleased that they are one of the few groups in the community benefiting from reducing costs and charges and not facing increasing costs and charges. I make the same point in relation to the beef industry. As honourable members know, it seems to have the best export potential that it has had for many years, certainly in the short to medium term. The meat industry is doing pretty well. Are honourable members telling me that meat producers, who today are paying 18 per cent less for their inspection services, are going to come to the Government and complain and be unhappy about the 18 per cent real reduction? They will not. Similarly, in Victoria producers have saved $4 1/2m in the last year. So I reject the Opposition's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Opposition seems to oppose everything. Seven months ago the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), promised that they would bring before this House detailed proposals to take to the people in the next election campaign; that they would put forward detailed proposals in relation to taxation matters. We are still waiting. We are all holding our breath waiting for the Opposition's policies to come forward. It is easy for those in opposition to oppose every bit of legislation that comes before the House, and this is a classic example of that. They are saying something is going up, so it should be opposed. Their chance will come when they release their policies.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite an increase from 50 per cent of cost recovery to 60 per cent, a change which this legislation gives effect to, the producers in most industries-and particularly the beef industry, in which the honourable member for Wannon has a interest-face reduced charges. I would have thought that as sensible members of parliament we ought to be implementing in this place sound legislation which can produce savings over time for our export industries. That is what this Government has done. I support the legislation. </PARA>

With the sort of confidence that we have come to expect from the honourable member for Bendigo, with an air about him that, if you will pardon the pun, suggests that butter would not melt in his mouth, he tells those of us sitting on this side of the House and in the gallery that all the Opposition has done is oppose. In this very week Ministers, including the Minister responsible for this legislation, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), have come into the House and commended the Opposition-particularly the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), I might add-for not just opposing Government legislation. So the honourable member for Bendigo had better decide on which side his bread is buttered. At that point I will stretch the pun no further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This nation, as shown by the January balance of payments figure, faces a real problem. The Government has to be bothered, as the Opposition is bothered, about a $1.5 billion balance of payments deficit when in January 1988 it was only $0.5 billion. We are bothered because, as the next government of this nation, we are inheriting a problem that will be difficult to address. If this nation needs anything right now it is an increase in its export income. We need to be exporting not iron ore but steel or motor cars; not wool but suits; and not bulk wine but quality product. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all the areas in which we have an opportunity to address the problem of a falling export income, the horticultural and floricultural areas are the classic examples. Let me illustrate this point by drawing to the attention of the House some comments made by Mr Barry Waldeck, one of Western Australia's leading nurserymen. When he spoke in Canberra at the National Agricultural Outlook Conference on the future of floriculture in Australia, he told the delegates that Australia presently holds only 0.06 of the world flower trade and that a 2.5 per cent share of that market would be worth $100m a year. At the same time, he said, it should be taken into account that the floriculture market is increasing at the rate of $400m a year. To provide some encouragement-note that word-to potential growers, Mr Waldeck noted that Holland, which holds 63 per cent of the world flower market, speaks of Australia as an untapped goldmine of unique flower species. The home consumer market cannot go unnoticed. The Norwegians currently head the list as the world's largest flower consumers. With a remarkable $65 a year per head of population being spent on flowers in Norway, Australia's $10 per head serves only to highlight the enormous potential which exists in the floriculture market. </PARA>
<PARA> I open with that illustration because it highlights the point so graphically made by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) when he gave the example of the Wondabah orchid growers, who are involved in the export of orchid plants and who are more than a little concerned about the legislation before the House because it is such a disincentive to the exporters of floricultural product. Right now, when more than anything else we need to be exporting valuable product, when more than anything else we need to be earning export dollars, we are putting, as is reflected by this legislation, real pressure on new exporters. Worse than that, acute pressure on exporters of small packages of produce is reflected by this legislation. The $47 minimum fee for the inspection of horticultural product is a real disincentive, particularly to those who choose merely to send a sample of their product overseas in order to open some new market. The honourable member for Bendigo said that this legislation `should engender further improvements in productivity and efficiency'. Far from engendering further improvements in productivity and efficiency, this legislation discourages people from entering new and innovative export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bendigo said, `This legislation is all about cost recovery'. He gave illustrations of what he said were demonstrable savings, particularly to the dairy industry, as a result of the changed attitude to export inspection cost recovery. How thick does he think I am?</PARA>

In fact, as the honourable member for Wannon and the honourable member for Murray have clearly said, under this Government export inspection cost recovery has gone from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. I do not doubt what the honourable member for Bendigo says about the Export Inspection Service being more efficient. I simply make the point that cost recovery has gone from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, and that not all of that efficiency in cost saving has been felt by the producers, whose produce we desperately need to service growing export markets. No-one says that the concept of a fee for service is bad in itself. The question is: Who determines the appropriate level of service and who determines how efficiently that service is delivered?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn briefly to another aspect of this legislation. I represent industries that are enthusiastic about a level of self-control and self-regulation in the export industry. No-one expects the Government to back off from inspecting export products. Australia's reputation is at stake. But let us not lose sight of the fact that every producer who is in a long term-and most primary production industries are long term-productive industry has a commitment to exporting quality product. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate that point. An industry that I represent, the wine industry, has set up its own code of conduct in the last month or so in order to minimise the regulation that the Government would otherwise feel obliged to impose on it and in order to minimise the cost that it would face for export inspection. It has decided on a self-regulatory technique to measure quality control and to ensure that the label, the appellation, of Australian wines is accurate. I commend that industry and all other export industries for the effort they are making to be self-regulatory. Once again, I point out to the honourable member for Bendigo and to the Government that we do not oppose the concept of fee for service. We do not oppose the concept of some form of export inspection. The Opposition's second reading amendment stresses the point that, no matter what the honourable member for Bendigo or the Government says, cost recovery has gone from 50 to 60 per cent. The savings that the honourable member for Bendigo alleges have been made have not been channelled back to Australia's productive primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House is a further push towards a fee for service for exports inspection instead of a price per quantity. Of the 174 items now inspected for export, only dairy product and grain remain on a quantity charge basis. The Opposition does not oppose this legislation. It is concerned only that the Government has not been frank and honest in the way in which it has presented it to the House. I conclude by saying that I support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Murray which highlights the two-faced approach that the Government has taken to the export inspection of primary products. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) for breaking its commitment to recover not more than 50% of the cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) for its obvious policy to move to 100% recovery of the cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities, as evidenced by the dramatic increase in the maximum permissible levels of this Bill''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Export Inspection (Quality Charge) Amendment Bill and oppose the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). To put it mildly, the Opposition has taken an unbelievable position tonight. It was good to hear from the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. Therefore, that must mean that it does not oppose the fact that this Bill must be passed so that the 60 per cent cost recovery measure will be implemented. The Bill does not go beyond 60 per cent cost recovery. The Bill covers only a few items in regard to which the maximum charge limit is likely to be reached in the near future; that is, some rates of charge will exceed the maximum statutory limit because of normal inflationary movements, so we need to set down some ambit to avoid constant amending of the legislation. If this legislation were not passed, we would have to make adjustments at regular intervals in order to satisfy the intention of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill deletes a number of quantity based charges. It is important to understand that the industry has moved to beneficial fee for service arrangements. If one listened to Opposition members one would think that they are opposed to the fee for services concept, whereas in actual fact, for many years they have had a policy which is identical to that which the Government is implementing at present. In fact, for several years they had a policy for 50 per cent cost recovery. However, they were not capable in government of achieving that target, and the taxpayer had to subsidise their inability to collect. </PARA>
<PARA> Seventy per cent of 164 charges are already recovered on a fee for service basis. Notwithstanding the move from 50 per cent to 60 per cent, the amounts paid today are less than in previous years. The honourable member for Wakefield did not bother to cover some of the facts in relation to this matter. Other Opposition members have not done so, either. In real terms, charges for meat-which is one of our major export industries and two-thirds of all charges are made in this area-cost 18 per cent less now than they did in 1984-85. I understand why the Opposition is not opposing the legislation. It is facing reality. Opposition members are speaking for the sake of speaking tonight. This Government, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in particular, have put in place policies that will lead to a massive change for a major industry in Australia; that is, meat inspection. This is a big issue. Two-thirds of inspection charges stem from the meat industry, yet the costs are 18 per cent less today than they were in 1984-85. That is a truly remarkable performance in anyone's language. </PARA>
<PARA> In my State of Victoria the industry is paying $4.5m less this year in meat inspection charges. That is a massive improvement. For the Opposition to move a second reading amendment when, in all honesty, it could not oppose the legislation, shows that it does not have much to fly with in relation to policy. Many people would be interested to know that at the last election the Opposition went to the people with a policy for a zero per cent inspection charge. For many years its policy was for a 50 per cent charge. It has now returned to that policy for a 50 per cent charge. Because the Opposition does not oppose the legislation, we can assume from the speeches that have been made tonight by Opposition members that they are quite in favour of the legislation. No doubt their policy has been adjusted to reflect what the Government is doing. This shows that they do not have much to fly with in relation to policy. They certainly have nothing with which to go to the people in an election year in relation to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The public subsidy for all export inspection is still some $70m per year. It is a considerable amount because we still believe that the inspection of our export industries is vitally important to the nation as a whole. This Government has never backed away from that issue. We have always believed that some industries are quite capable of paying part of the inspection charges. The honourable member for Wakefield said that the Opposition would inherit what he called the problems of government-in the event of some unfortunate circumstances, and I doubt that that is a real possibility-and that this nation would need export income. It certainly did need export income when we came to power. We went through a period where even though we increased exports, we had a collapse in commodity prices, which, whilst we were exporting more goods, did not increase our income in any way. We inherited a situation in which exports were vital to Australia. Rural exports have always been the key to Australia's economy. However, the Opposition has always failed to support the export industries that Australia has had since it was first settled by white people. We have always relied upon wool, wheat, meat and, in later years, coal. But the Opposition did not put in place the manufacturing base support that we needed. In fact, the legacy it left to us was a manufacturing industry which had been absolutely destroyed. So it was very interesting to hear the honourable member for Wakefield talk about inheriting problems. We certainly have improved the situation for exports right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> A few years back when the commodity price collapse occurred and when I was chairing the rural task force for the Government, I witnessed first hand just how dramatic the effects were of a collapse in commodity prices on not just the farming sector but all those reliant upon the income from those commodities. Today we are dealing with the opposite problems. I can clearly remember in 1974, before I came near this Parliament when I was working a farm of my own, that it was under the Whitlam Government that I made the greatest income I ever made as a farmer. It was the year I paid the biggest taxes I ever paid as a farmer. I never begrudged paying those taxes for a moment, because if one is paying such taxes one is earning a good income. If honourable members ask Australian farmers whether they consider that the situation today is better than at any other time in Australia's history-except perhaps for the woolgrowers in 1951-52 after the Korean War when there was a wool boom-they will say that today's figures would match the wool boom of the 1950s. What we are dealing with is not the problem mentioned by the honourable member for Wakefield of the need for export income; we are dealing with the results of that export income pouring into Australia. That is the real issue in the economy. In that context there are not too many farmers who would begrudge the fact that they have to pay some of the inspection charges in order to ensure that the products which we keep putting on to the world markets are of top standard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy), who is at the table, has just come back from negotiations overseas. He would be able to tell this House about the importance of quality in our trade. Export inspection is vital to that. It is vital that industries pay their fair share of the costs of that. The taxpayers who are contributing $70m per year at present certainly are not dipping out on what they are prepared to put in. The Government is seeing that they are putting in their fair share. Opposition members say that they do not oppose the Bill. However, I cannot accept the Opposition's amendment, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It condemns the Government for allegedly breaking its commitment to recover not more than 50 per cent of the cost of export inspection charges. Let me remind the House once again where the Opposition has gone in relation to that policy. It had a 50 per cent inspection charge for years but never got to that point. It let the taxpayers pay it. When we came to office the Opposition had not even reached its own policy. I remind the House again that Opposition members went to the last election trying to win votes by abolishing export charges, yet here they are back in the Parliament saying that they support the Bill. Opposition members are willing to accept that the charge needs to go to 60 per cent, but they want to condemn the Government for breaking some commitment. No matter what industry rural people work in-except perhaps those in the wheat industry, where there is a great debate going on between the Liberals and the Nationals about what is the best policy; the fee for service, the free enterprise approach; less of this dogmatic, agrarian socialism which has been peddled in this country for so long, which even the farmers today will not give credibility to-they are firmly of the belief that this Government has done more to put agriculture on the correct footing on a trade basis. Not only that, but we are creating a basis of support within Australia for a manufacturing base so that if there is in the future another downturn in commodity prices we will not be reliant solely upon the agricultural industry. It is something we have neglected. What did we do with our wool for many years? We sent it overseas and let somebody else process it. What do we do with other products? We dig them out of the ground, send them overseas and then buy them back. This Government is working assiduously towards putting in place programs which will overcome those very issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join my colleagues the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in addressing the Export Inspection (Quality Charge) Amendment Bill and in supporting the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Murray, the Deputy Leader of the National Party. Before I proceed to some of the points I had intended to make, I would like to take up some of the issues that have been raised by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham). He started his contribution to the debate by saying that the Opposition has decided not to oppose this legislation but that it proposes an amendment which says that it condemns the Government `for breaking its commitment to recover not more than 50 per cent of the cost of export inspection charges for agricultural commodities'. That is the amendment we are moving in relation to this legislation tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for McMillan said that he thought it was an unbelievable decision-absolutely outrageous that we should be condemning the Government for breaking one of its election promises. This is indicative of the sense of values that Government members have in relation to campaign promises. In the last election campaign we had a firm commitment from Labor that it would not increase the cost of export inspection services from their then levels of 50 per cent. Tonight the House is dealing with an issue which directly breaks that firm commitment made by Labor during that last election campaign. We on the Liberal and National Party side of the House believe that the breaking of commitments and promises is important and should be highlighted to the people of Australia. We wish to highlight them by moving amendments to draw to the attention of the people in the rural industries of Australia, and people right throughout Australia, the utter hypocrisy they have to suffer from this Government, which continually breaks promises such as this one. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a retinue of other promises made by Labor over the last few years that have been broken in a similar cavalier fashion. In recent days we have heard the debate about child poverty. We were promised that there would be no child poverty by 1990. That is a promise we can throw out the window. We had the promise of no capital gains tax. So many promises have been broken. The amendment the Opposition is moving is designed to draw to the attention of the people of Australia the cavalier manner in which this Government goes about trying to fool people in the electorate with promises made at election time in order to win votes, with the full knowledge that later on down the track when it gets back into government it will break these promises and get on with the job of getting further and further into the pockets of the rural producers of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McMillan also said that this Government was responsible for improving our export income. I make the point that unless this Government has a great deal more control over events than I think it has, it would have to agree that improved weather circumstances have helped to improve Australia's export income. Indeed, improved worldwide commodity prices have helped to improve our export income dramatically. Neither of those events have been influenced by this Government. Neither the weather nor world prices for our commodities can be reasonably claimed to be the product of this Government's policies. It is purely and simply good fortune that the Government has been able to enjoy improved export income receipts as a result of our rural industries having these improved weather conditions and higher prices for their products. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the Bill before the House relates to the industry which is the backbone of Australia's economy. Historically, it is a fact that Australia has lived off the sheep's back, and we can broaden that term to include the rural industries as a group. Today that is no different. Today Australia still lives off the sweat, the hard work and the investment of the people in our rural industries. There is no more important a time than today for a government to be trying to encourage these industries to create more export income. Despite the improved commodity prices and better weather conditions we have had we still see our economy in a total shambles. We have had balance of payments deficits of $1.5 billion for the last month. This is an horrific record high level. It is this type of problem which Australia faces and it is this type of problem which can be addressed only by creating more export income. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Bill before us tonight is doing exactly the opposite to that. This Bill actually increases the costs of production for our exporters and as a result makes us less competitive on the international market. Because we are less competitive we have less opportunity to find markets for our products to bring back income for Australia. That is what this Bill is all about. That is why the Opposition is bringing these amendments before the House tonight. I think it is terribly important that the people of Australia understand that. We are doing this to highlight the hypocrisy of the Government in its broken promises and to highlight the urgent need to encourage our export industries rather than discourage them with additional costs of production. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a member of the National Party I have a rural electorate which produces a wide range of agricultural products. The meat industry is a very significant one. We also have a number of new and very exciting industries starting to develop at present. I speak particularly of the cherry industry, which over the last couple of years has been developing quite an extensive export industry. Young, of course, is the cherry capital of Australia. One of the things that has been of great concern to the exporters of cherries in that town is the high costs of export inspection services for the products they send overseas. In addition, there are difficulties with getting air freight at a reasonable price, and indeed with some certainty, in order to get their products overseas. This sort of industry is developing in my home town of Young, and there are other new and exciting export industries developing in the area. In Crookwell some people are trying to establish a seed potato industry so that they can compete in a worldwide market that is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, selling seed potatoes to the rest of the world. We have the purest seed potatoes in the world and we are trying to establish that market. All of these added export inspection costs will discourage the type of initiative and investment and income that can be generated from these new and exciting industries that are occurring in my area alone. </PARA>
<PARA> It is undeniable that this legislation will actually increase costs for producers. The cost of export inspection services is rising from 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the total cost. That is what this legislation does. We should make no bones about it. Despite all the fancy talk of those Government members who have spoken tonight, who try to tell us that it is going to be cheaper, we cannot deny the fact that if we increase the cost of export inspection services from 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the total cost it will actually increase the cost to producers. That is an undeniable fact. It is going to weigh very heavily on the shoulders of the industry in the years ahead when seasonal conditions are not as kind and when world commodity prices are not as good as they currently are. </PARA>
<PARA> I will highlight some of the changes that will occur to the cost of export inspection services. Bulk grain, which currently has a legislative maximum of 33c a tonne, will have its charge lifted to a maximum of $1 a tonne. Bagged grain has a legislative maximum of 33c a tonne and will rise to $1 as well. Containerised grain, which has a legislative maximum of $1.46 a tonne, will be lifted to $5 a tonne. Those are the sorts of maximum increases that we see being put by this Government in the legislation before us and undeniably they will be an extra cost to producers. Growers have had to suffer these sorts of increases over a long period under this Government, coupled with all sorts of extra cost inputs such as the cost of fuel. The excise this Government is imposing on fuel has increased from 6.155c per litre to 22.39c per litre. I might add that unfortunately very little of that goes towards road improvements these days. These cost increases, coupled with the export inspection charges under the Bill before the House, make life for our exporters very difficult indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Growers and rural industry people throughout this country have suffered incredible increases in the cost of services. At the same time in recent Budgets they have suffered incredible decreases in the schemes that encourage export growers and producers. We have seen the superphosphate bounty cut out, costing farmers $37m. We have seen the sugar industry suffer cuts of $8.4m. The wool promotion scheme has been cut by $10m. Depreciation allowances were reduced in 1983 in the first mini-Budget and in 1988 in the third mini-Budget. All these things are costing growers dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> All our concerns here today relate to this Government's breaking of promises made to rural producers throughout this country. We are concerned because we need to be encouraging export producers at a time when our balance of payments deficit is in dire straits. It comes at a time which is fortunate for us on this side of the House because it enables us to highlight to the rural producers of Australia that we, on this side of the House, will be able to deliver far better services at cheaper prices to producers with our policies than this Government is doing. Our commitment to keep export inspection service cost recovery to 50 per cent is indeed a far better deal than this Government is giving. This promise will be kept and will deliver substantial benefits to export producers and rural producers throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard all sorts of claims being made by the Labor Party tonight. Basically, it is trying to say that its promise was not really a promise-something not to be taken seriously-and that our amendment is not worthy of consideration. I treat that as it should be treated-with utter contempt. Government members have also tried to point out to us tonight that producers will save with these Bills before the House. In fact, producers will suffer increased costs as a result of this legislation. At the same time, the Government in so ignoring the amendment that the Opposition parties put to its legislation tonight, treats with disrespect and dishonour the industries which have carried this country from its pioneering days to its point of prosperity today and which will continue to carry our nation for the future; that is, the rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we have a government that is prepared to provide incentives and give encouragement and can reduce the cost of inputs to producers, Australia will continue to suffer the huge balance of payments deficit that it has suffered continuously over the last few years under a Labor government. Unless we get a change of government, we will not see those balance of payments figures reduced; we will not see the cost of inputs for farmers and rural producers throughout this country go down. At the end of the day, the people of Australia will be substantially worse off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I travel around my area of country Victoria one of the things I notice is that the people of the country are speaking more and more about the worthwhile initiatives being taken by this Government. Quite some time ago a considerable amount of antagonism was shown by people in the country towards the Australian Labor Party. Historically, there were probably reasons why this was the case. They were not necessarily justifiable, but they were there. As I travel around now I notice that people have recognised the things that this Government has undertaken. I notice that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is here. I welcome his presence in the House. The people are aware of the general state of the economy as the Government attempts to bring the rural industry into line with the rest of Australia by ensuring that the statutory marketing authorities are now set on a businesslike basis. The Government is ensuring that the information signals are going out to the rural communities. It is talking with bodies such as the National Farmers Federation to ensure that the NFF has a place in the forum of policy development, so that it at least understands the Government's policies and the reasons the Government is doing what it is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government realises that it has to look at matters such as cost recovery on inspection charges as part of this process of ensuring efficiency within primary industries. All of us on this side of the House and, I am sure, everybody else in the House recognise fully the contribution which primary industries have made and will continue to make to the economy of this country. Nobody questions that. We are particularly pleased to associate ourselves with the primary industry sector because it plays such an enormous role in our export revenue earnings. For so long the other sectors of our economy were placed in a thoroughly unbalanced situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Our reliance upon primary industry over the decades really has been to the detriment of this country as has now been shown. That does not mean for one moment that we do not believe that there is an extremely important part to be played by the primary industry sector. We know that. In the restructuring of the Australian economy we would like to see a place, for instance, for far more value-added to the primary products which for so long have simply been going out of this country in such vast quantities that some of the industries which were previously adding values have been destroyed. For instance, I can recall what happened quite some years ago when I used to live in Geelong. </PARA>

The value-added component is to the advantage of another nation and not this one. That is a scandal. It has been allowed to take place over many decades. People who claimed to be part of a business government allowed it to take place. It was the run-down of an industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation before the House is putting primary industry on a businesslike basis. It is ensuring a level of efficiency in that industry that we can be proud of. It is not propping up any inefficiencies. The movement towards fee for service will ensure that the primary industry sector is very conscious of the need for efficiencies. That is extremely important. It is quite interesting that the Opposition indicated in the last election campaign that it would cut out all inspection charges-a zero charge. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to note that the Opposition is today saying `Shock, horror' because we are ensuring that there is at least some market relationship between the cost recovery and what is being charged. The shock horror is now at a base of 50 per cent. That is what is in the Opposition's amendment. I can assure honourable members that if the Opposition moves as quickly as that-from zero to 50 per cent-it will bypass anything that we are putting into place at a very rapid rate. It will get to 100 per cent quick smart. What we are moving towards is something which is more realistic. We do not make any excuses for that and the industry recognises this. Sure, there will be some people who will say, `Is it not terrible that we are going to have to pay for this and the taxpayers of Australia are going to be relieved of that burden to ensure that our industry is efficient?'. That seems a rather odd kind of logic. It is inappropriate. I believe that those people in the industry who are serious about their industry will see this as a very appropriate direction in which to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does in fact build in the possibility for improved efficiencies; it makes all those farmers who perhaps currently would like to have someone else pay it all for them recognise that they have a responsibility; but it also enables them to take another hard look at what will be done in the inspection service to ensure that it is done properly. Those farmers now have a vested interest in ensuring that the best kind of inspection service is put in place. They also can rest assured that, because they have a good inspection service and they are paying for it, those who might be inefficient and who fall foul of the inspection service will be called to account. There is nothing wrong with that. That is very desirable. I know that, when I talk to my farmers and explain this to them, they are on side with this proposition. That is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting just to take a look at some of the figures of the rates that are currently being charged. The current legislative limits on butter, cheese and other dairy products is $5 per tonne. The proposed legislative limit is $10 per tonne. That means that we do not have to keep on bringing in amendments all the time, which would be very confusing. In 1987-88 the actual charges were $2.42 per tonne for butter, $4.48 per tonne for cheese and $3.79 per tonne for the other products. In 1988-89 the charges had been reduced, in the case of butter to $2.39 per tonne, cheese to $4.42 per tonne and the other products to $3.74 per tonne. The current legislative limit for grains is 33c per tonne; the proposed legislative limit is $1 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> This enables some flexibility in the program, again enabling us to make adjustments without constantly making reference to new pieces of legislation. In 1987-88 the charge was 16c per tonne, although the legislative limit was 33c per tonne. In 1988-89 it is 17c per tonne, which again is marginally different, but still only a percentage of that 33c per tonne. And so it goes on. It just indicates that the recovery rates that we have had have not been excessive. These new recovery rates will raise the amount to enable a more realistic set of figures to be charged. With these more realistic figures, again the emphasis is on the industry's levels of efficiency. It is to the industry's benefit. It ensures quality products for our markets overseas and it brings the industry in to it as a necessary partner. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not something in respect of which we are going to say, `The other Australian taxpayers will pay for it and we do not have to worry too much about quality'. It is a very businesslike approach. I do not see why business people should be concerned about someone else paying for it; it is the business people themselves, the farmers, who are the ones who will be the beneficiaries, and they will be the ones who will ensure the efficiencies in the industry. Because of this level of efficiency, the Australian economy will benefit in the long run as well. I do not accept the Opposition amendments. The amendments really and truly are an example of-</PARA>

Where will it all end? This is the highest taxing government this country has ever seen and this Bill represents yet another tax on the rural sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) expressed it all. He said that the rural sector has never had it so good. That was the excuse for this Labor Government imposing yet another tax, yet another charge, on the rural sector. It just shows how out of touch he is. He said that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) was baying like a sheep. That is a good rural term. It just shows how out of touch the Labor Party really is. He is saying that the rural sector has never had it so good. Let me tell him this: right now, I would say, fat lamb prices are probably 25 per cent lower than they were at this time last year; crossbred wool prices are probably 25 per cent lower than they were at this time last year. </PARA>
<PARA> But the honourable member for McMillan is saying that we have never had it so good. The Government has no idea. I have a feeling that that is why it is imposing all these new charges on the bush; Labor members reckon that things are pretty good in the bush. They see one article in the press that some Tasmanian woolgrower got a great price for his very fine wool, and they think everything is terrific in the bush. So they say, `We will slug them with a whole lot of new charges'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is exactly what this Bill is all about. It is all about increasing Government taxes, and it is not doing a bad job of it either. The current inspection charge for bulk grain is 17c a tonne. What is the Government going to do? It is increasing the maximum charge allowed to $1, which is a 488 per cent increase. That gives the Government plenty of leeway to increase the price over the next couple of years, does it not? It is lucky that it is not going to be there for that long. The Government wants to increase the maximum allowable charge for bagged grain from the current charge of 30c to $1, which is a 233 per cent increase in the allowable charge. The current charge for a container of grain is $1.46 and it wants to be able to increase it up to $5, which is a 242 per cent increase. These are enormous increases. This Government is just giving itself room to move, room to just edge that inspection charge up on the basis of the arguments put forward by the Labor Party that `We want full cost recovery from the rural sector, and when we have got full cost recovery, if things are not going badly, we will probably get a bit more as well. We will add on a few premiums to our cost recovery to cover some other charges in other areas, such as public transport. We are really going to get into the rural sector'. That is the sort of attitude that we have seen in this debate so far tonight from the Government side. </PARA>
<PARA> The export inspection charges that the Government is intending to impose on the rural sector and the grain industry in particular are very significant. The Government says that they are only cost recovery, but when one looks at the charges as to the actual value of the product being exported one sees that the increase in the cost of inspection that it is going to impose on bagged grain for example, means that the cost per bag is very significant. Let us say that we have got a buyer overseas who says, `I want to buy some bagged wheat'. The reporter says, `Well, wheat per tonne is around $200. At 12 1/2 bags to the tonne I can probably sell it at about $16 a bag. But wait a minute, I have got to add on the Government's inspection charge of 3 per cent'. The Government inspection charge on bagged barley is 4 1/2 per cent on the cost of the product. One would not even be in the race in relation to oats. This Government wants to charge 7 per cent of the value of the oats as an inspection charge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will get itchy all right. They will be itchy. The charges that this Government is imposing on rural exporters are unbelievable. In the next breath they will be saying, `We want our rural exporters to export more because we have got a bad balance of payments'. It is not surprising that we have a bad balance of payments with this Government in power. Whenever an industry starts to get back on its feet and starts exporting, this Government imposes a new tax or charge. All this follows the undertakings that the Government gave last year that the export inspection charge would remain at 50 per cent. Its word is not worth the paper it is written on. The Government is now moving to a 60 per cent recovery rate, and I have no doubt that it will continue to increase the rate, as the previous speaker said, until there is full cost recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the rural sector would not mind paying its fair share if it had control of the costs. The rural sector is not going to suffer the rorts that this Government allows within the inspection and other services. If we have a fair say in the costs that are incurred, then we are prepared to pay the costs as a legitimate cost of exporting, provided that the other sectors of our economy are also required to pay their fair share. One cannot continue to add lead to the saddlebags of the rural exporters without requiring the other sectors of the Australian economy to carry their fair share. We have had these significant increases in export inspection fees added to the cost of exporting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is adopting at the same time a high interest rate policy. Of course, that is attracting money into Australia in order to get the high interest rate here, thus forcing up the value of the Australian dollar, which is another burden imposed by this Government on exporters. The exporters suffer because of this Government's high Australian dollar policy. The Government similarly says that it believes that full cost recovery ought to be imposed on the rural sector, but at the same time the rural sector is still going to have to pay the tariffs on the imported goods that go to producing those rural exports. We are being asked to pay overnight full cost recovery. But are the tariffs being reduced overnight? Certainly not. So, on the one hand, the rural sector is being asked to pay but, on the other hand, its costs are not being reduced. There is a similar situation with the Government's industrial relations system. Will it deregulate the industrial relations system to allow a more reasonable wages system? Certainly not. So what happens? The rural exporters have to pay exorbitant prices to get their product across the wharves. There is an unbelievable situation on the Australian waterfront. What is this Government doing about it? Absolutely nothing. Who is having to pay? Australian exporters, the rural sector, and this Government does not care. It wants us to pay full cost recovery for export inspection fees. It is imposing on the rural exporter an unrealistically high Australian dollar. It is imposing on the rural exporter a stupid waterfront situation, about which it does absolutely nothing. It expects us to pay the tariffs on imported goods, which are inputs to the cost of rural production and exports. In all these ways it is expecting the rural sector to pay an unrealistically high burden without reducing the cost inputs to the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of areas where this Government has imposed additional taxes and charges that have significantly impacted on those industries' ability to export. This Bill is about increased inspection charges. It covers areas such as dairy and grain products. We had increased inspection charges recently imposed on horticultural products. We have got the ridiculous situation now where the Government has imposed minimum charges on horticultural exports to such an extent that many of the smaller horticultural exports are no longer viable. We have many instances of innovators trying to open up new export markets-cut flowers, fruit, vegetables, nursery stock and so on-and they are hit with this enormous minimum export inspection charge which undermines the viability of their operation. It is just ridiculous for this Government to call on exporters to increase their effort to export more rural products while at the same time imposing these high inspection charges which undermine the viability of such exports. We have just got to look at these industries and give them an opportunity to self-regulate. They know that if they do not deliver a product that meets the market demand overseas they will lose the sale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to return to a matter that I first raised in this chamber last night-the slander committed against a very fine individual and an excellent organisation by two members on the Government side. I refer specifically to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), who have both alleged at different times and in separate forums that the WWWW-Women Who Want to be Women, now known as Endeavour Forum-were actually allied with or fronts for the League of Rights. That was demonstrably shown to be false and we still await an apology from both of those honourable members. It would be the only decent, normal thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I notice also that the honourable member for Capricornia repeated his allegation on 2GB in Sydney on the John Tingle program late last year, following his speech in this Parliament on the League of Rights on 29 September. Sadly, neither the honourable member for Capricornia nor the honourable member for Robertson bothered to check with WWWW, now known as Endeavour Forum, as to the accuracy or otherwise of their scurrilous allegations. It is interesting to read the contribution from the honourable member for Capricornia to this place on the League of Rights on 29 September 1988 and what he said regarding the Fabian Society. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> People do not bother to check; they simply believe these things. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on, speaking of the League of Rights, he said that it `just picks on an enemy, targets someone'. It seems to me that that is precisely what the honourable member for Capricornia has done. The League of Rights is an insidious body that should be exposed for all of its evil, but to associate decent organisations and worthy individuals with that obnoxious group of renegades is utterly immoral. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter tonight not just to reinforce the points that I made last night but to advise the House that I have the privilege of chairing an evening to celebrate the tenth birthday of Endeavour Forum in the next two weeks. I am very proud to have been invited to chair an evening which will have a number of distinguished speakers and guests along with it. That is testimony to the longevity of that organisation and the determination of its members. I point out that at the conclusion of the evening I am to launch a book called Gizela by Rena Roth, which tells the story of a concentration camp survivor who lost her only child. Ms Roth is a member of the Endeavour Forum and has donated 50 copies to that organisation. The proceeds from the sales of her book will go to charities in Australia and Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> How the honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Robertson could accuse Endeavour Forum of being linked to the League of Rights, when they are publishing and selling a book dealing with the Holocaust and donating the proceeds to Israeli charities, is quite beyond me. We await the apology from both those gentlemen. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Endeavour Forum on the achievement of its tenth birthday and pay tribute to those individuals who have made it the respected and valuable organisation that it is, playing such an important role in promoting values and principles that I would think very many-if not all-members of this House would endorse. It basically is related to family values and the family as the most important and basic unit in society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to address the House on an issue of significant concern to the people of my electorate and to many people elsewhere in Queensland and Australia. I refer to the issue of a bridge to Russell Island, which is situated in my electorate. Russell Island is one of the many islands in Moreton Bay which fall within my Federal electorate and is well known throughout Australia. Although a lot has been said about some of the bad blocks of land that have been sold up there, the vast majority of the island is beautiful. There are drainage problems, but they are in the minority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear from the outset that I am neither pro nor against a bridge connection to Russell Island. Neither I, as the Federal member for the area, nor the Federal Government really have any jurisdiction in this area. Put simply, the issue is one which the State Government of Queensland should decide, in consultation with the people of the island and the Redlands Shire Council on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland State Government, however, has avoided making a decision on the question of a bridge to Russell Island for some 30 years. The reason I speak tonight on this matter is that some of my constituents from Russell Island, in complete desperation and frustration with the National Party State Government's inability to make a decision, have called on the Federal Government and, in particular, on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), to help fund a bridge linking Stradbroke Island with the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> The dithering on the part of the State Government-this is something for which the current temporary Premier of Queensland, Mr Ahern, is becoming renowned-has allowed speculators, property developers and real estate agents to tell the people wanting to buy land on the island what they have wanted to hear. In the case of the many people who want to live on a secluded island, land sellers are able to say that there will be no bridge. On the other hand, many people, particularly elderly people, have bought on the basis of assurances from the developers that access to the mainland would be provided in due course. This situation has led to successful speculation and rapidly rising prices which do not reflect the real value of the property, particularly considering the very poor state of the services provided by the local authority, the Redlands Shire Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who want a bridge to Russell Island are predominantly members of a group calling itself the Russell Island Development Association (RIDA). This Association recently held a meeting and, as I have mentioned, a call was made to the Federal Government to provide financial support for the construction of a bridge. Its argument is put in the context of the current expressed desire of the Federal Government to increase the supply of land suitable for housing. RIDA argues that there are potentially some 10,000 blocks of land on the island. </PARA>
<PARA> While I can appreciate this group's desire for a bridge, and can sympathise with its frustration at the inexcusable indecision displayed by the State Government, I am afraid that this is simply not a matter for the Federal Government. Even in cases where the Commonwealth is willing to sell land which it owns, it requires the States to provide the necessary infrastructure or, at the very least, enable development to be fast-tracked. I understand that the group has written to the Prime Minister, and he will no doubt provide a response in due course, but it would surprise me if the Prime Minister were willing to fund the building of a bridge to Russell Island because of the factors I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> As I previously stated, I can completely understand the frustration being experienced by the residents of the island, both those who are for and those who are against the bridge. Their frustration is heightened by the fact that they pay rates, the same as anyone else in the Redlands Shire, but receive only a fraction of the services they need from the Council. The issue came back on the agenda last year in May, when Deputy Premier Bill Gunn announced that the State Government supported, in principle, the construction of a bridge and that expressions of interest in its construction had been called for. This prompted the State National Party member and Queensland Attorney-General, Paul Clauson, to announce, via the front page of a local newspaper, the Bayside Bulletin, that a bridge would definitely be built. This was followed two weeks later by a statement from Mr Gunn that it was all a mistake and that expressions of interest for a bridge to Russell Island had not been called for. </PARA>
<PARA> To add to the confusion, the Premier said recently that the Government was not ready to issue a firm statement on the possibility of a bridge. The reality is that the Queensland State Government has been dithering on this matter for so long that it has been fraudulently deceptive in its approach to the whole question. Real estate agents have been selling land on the island for many years on the understanding that a bridge would be built. I call on the State Government to do the right thing and to make a decision once and for all, so that the people on Russell Island, whether they are for or against a bridge, will at least be able to carry on their normal lives knowing exactly where they stand. The whole thing is a disgrace, and something should be done about it quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speaking in this place in October 1988 the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) said of Medicare that it was a monster which, like a dinosaur, is eating itself out of existence, guzzling up public funds at an ever increasing rate, and yet still failing to give taxpayers value for their money. No better have these views been demonstrated than by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) in the national current affairs television program 60 Minutes last Sunday, 5 March. Not only did the Minister highlight the inadequacies of his Government's health services and its insatiable budgetary appetite but also, in the process, he showed his insensitivity towards Australian women in general and those affected by breast cancer in particular when he argued against a national scanning program to detect this cancer in its early stages. Over two and a half thousand women die from such cancer every year, a tragic statistic in anyone's language and one which we all need to work towards reducing as a matter of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the Minister's office received many telephone calls of protest at his demonstrably unsympathetic stance. This evening I would like to highlight the experience of one of my constituents, Mrs Rosemary Morley of Toowoomba, who has experienced personal family tragedy as a result of breast cancer and who telephoned the Minister's office to protest at his televised comments. Mrs Morley said:</PARA>
<PARA> I'm fuming . . . When I phoned his office, his personal secretary made some totally illogical statements on his behalf. First he disagreed that national mammogram programs are operating successfully in Sweden, Finland, the US and the UK. In fact 90% of Swedish and Finnish women have a mammogram every 18 months. I was told that there is a shortage of radiologists in Australia, and that radiologists cannot read mammograms anyway. I was told that women wouldn't use mammograms because they hurt. But the most astonishing thing I was told was that mammograms are a health hazard. After checking with the Queensland Cancer Fund and Brisbane Wesley Breast Clinic I found all of these statements to be totally untrue. It appears that Dr Blewett thinks 2500 women are expendable. What about those women who can't get to the clinic, or those who can't afford the service? Even if the Government agreed to cover the mammograms with Medicare, it would be a start. Finally, I was told `You clearly don't vote Labor, so it doesn't matter what you think anyway'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister owes the women of Australia, and in particular Mrs Morley, an apology and I hope that he will have the good grace to do so in the very near future. Furthermore, I suggest that he take positive steps to investigate and remedy the serious deficiencies that have been raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to relate to the House something which occurred two weeks ago and which unfortunately is becoming an event as rare as an Andrew Peacock press conference. I refer of course to the fact that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) actually had a win in a by-election. The by-election in fact was for an aldermanic position on the Wollongong City Council. One would suggest that in an area such as the Illawarra a win by the ALP was a foregone conclusion, but for a long time now we have seen that the incumbent so-called Independent Lord Mayor of the city has been able to get away with telling people that he is one of the all-time great economic managers, and he and his team of independents have been able to guide the destiny of the people of the City of Wollongong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His shortcomings were well and truly exposed prior to the by-election, but I am sure they had a great effect on the by-election result. As I have reported in this House previously, particularly in the lead-up to the last State election, the Lord Mayor, Frank Arkell, who is also the State member, and his independent control of the Wollongong City Council have plunged the ratepayers of Wollongong into a $7m deficit. That is quite horrendous at local government level. That has meant that massive rate hikes have occurred in the last couple of months. The rates that pensioners in the northern suburbs of Wollongong in my electorate have had to pay have actually trebled. Certainly, this was one of the factors which contributed to many pensioner groups actively coming out and lobbying for support for the Labor Party's candidate in the Council by-election. Our candidate was a young man by the name of Stephen Whitehead. He will bring a great deal of competence to the activities of the Wollongong City Council because, for one thing, he is a trained accountant. Having worked at the Council some years ago, he got his grounding in local government accounting and financing and has moved onto the area of health funding. He will bring a great deal of expert knowledge to local government, particularly in the accounting area which, sadly, will be so necessary in order to try to right the wrongs that the Arkell independents have inflicted on Wollongong's ratepayers for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA> This has meant that for the first time since the early 1980s the Labor Party now has the majority group on Wollongong City Council. I suspect that, when combining its vote with those of a couple of true independents, it will bring about some very radical changes in the area, which will be to the benefit of the citizens of Wollongong. It is interesting to note that, upon his defeat, Arkell made a comment along these lines: `Well, there is a lesson to be learnt here'. He had to say that because his candidate came in in third place. He went on, `Wollongong City Council will now have to get back to basics'. That is a very familiar tune to many of us here. What he really means is that the Council will have to concentrate on the things that local government should do-that is, providing an efficient and effective local government service for road repairs, mowing lawns and all the sorts of things that people expect from a council, rather than expending millions of dollars on work in the central business district and claiming the glory for what the Federal Government and the former State Labor Government have done for the city of Wollongong, particularly in terms of investment in massive infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also see once and for all the lie being shown for what it is in Arkell's claims that it was he and he alone who created about 8,000 jobs in the Illawarra district in the past five or six years. That is a total nonsense and the people of Wollongong have finally woken up to him. They are rejecting him for what he is-one of the all-time great frauds of local government. I am pleased to say that Stephen Whitehead will make a significant contribution. I congratulate him and wish him every success on Wollongong City Council in working with the other five Labor aldermen. I am sure that they will form a very effective team and will give back to the people of Wollongong something they have sadly lacked in the past; that is, good direction and good financial management at local government level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to bring to the attention of the House the plight of a husband and wife who live in my electorate and who have suffered enormous financial losses because of what is clearly an unsatisfactory system of arbitration of building contract disputes which can lead to biased and unfair decisions. In August 1984, Mr Joe and Mrs Irene Onorati, who live at Drummoyne in my electorate in Sydney's inner west, entered into an agreement with Phillips Construction Co. Pty Ltd to erect five home units on their land at Drummoyne. The contract was what is commonly referred to as a standard building contract BC3. Upon completion of the building Mr and Mrs Onorati received advice from architects, engineers and the Builders Licensing Board that there were many defects in the building, some of them quite serious. Understandably, Mr and Mrs Onorati withheld the final payment of $120,000 of the builder's final fees, demanding that he rectify the defects. Pursuant to a clause of the standard contract this gave the builder the right to take the matter to arbitration, which he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is where the problems really began. An arbitrator, Mr Donald Bruce Maxwell, was appointed to hear the dispute. Despite the comprehensive report from the Builders Licensing Board and other engineers', builders' and architects' reports specifying the defects and estimating the cost of rectification work at over $500,000, the arbitrator made an award, firstly, that the builder pay Mr and Mrs Onorati $84,000 to cover the cost of rectification, but that the Onoratis pay all the builder's legal costs, totalling some $280,000, the arbitrator's cost of $19,000 with interest at 15 per cent per annum over a three-year period and, on top of that, their own legal costs of some $300,000. Understandably, the Onoratis were astounded, because with the weight of evidence in their favour they had believed it would be an open and shut case. It is incomprehensible to them how the arbitrator on the evidence presented could come to his decision. It seemed to them that he had either failed to realise the significance of or had ignored the advice of independent building and construction experts. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there is effectively no appeal against this arbitration decision. Like dozens of other people who signed contracts that allow disputes to be heard by arbitration, they naively believed arbitration could be cheaper than a judicial hearing because it could be heard quicker, before a building expert who could see the technical issues, and despite the obligation to pay transcript costs, arbitrators' fees and expenses, in the long run it would be cheaper than taking the case to court. Some four years after first signing the contract and facing debts of almost $1m, Mr and Mrs Onorati have learnt the hard way that arbitration is not as straightforward as it seems. While the builder lost his licence, this is of little consolation to the Onoratis, and in fact the builder is now building again. </PARA>
<PARA> Of more concern to this House is what seems to be a growing suspicion amongst people who are the victims of some decisions of arbitrators that these arbitrators, as former builders, may often be in a position to be biased towards their former colleagues, as builders, and those whom consumers are seeking redress against. I gather that it may be possible that at one and the same time a builder may be the owner or director of a building company, the executive of a builders association, a graded arbitrator with the Institute of Arbitrators and, indeed, a director of the Building Services Corporation. So when consumers such as Mr and Mrs Onorati have a complaint to lodge and seek redress from one of these bodies, they may find there is a conflict of interest if one of the people dealing with the application is in fact the builder or, as is more common, one of his colleagues. Although justice may be being done, it is clearly important that it be seen to be done. This may not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also of concern that no formal qualifications are required of arbitrators. An undischarged bankrupt can be an arbitrator; a convicted criminal can be an arbitrator. There is no registry of any Commonwealth court which maintains a registry of arbitrators. On the basis of admissions tabled by the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mr Punch), consumers such as Mr and Mrs Onorati may have valid concerns because their case is not isolated. It seems that arbitration may lead to our jurisprudence being conducted by people who have no legal skills and who may be in a position where they may be biased towards builders, as former builders themselves. It seems very clear that a complete review of the arbitration system is long overdue and that a full inquiry into the Onoratis' case is justified to redress the apparent wrongs which seem to have been done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`I'm not going to do the spadework for them, but if they get their act together I'm prepared to lead them'. Members of this House may mistakenly believe that that is a quote from the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) which reflects his leadership ambitions, but of course it is nothing other than a claim by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen that he would be prepared to lead Grey Power at the next election. Of course Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen is clearly in the vanguard of National Party politics. It was only last week in this place that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), in an erudite contribution, suggested that the danger was that Grey Power would be hijacked by the coalition. According to the honourable member for Port Adelaide, in South Australia many former Liberal and National Party candidates were part of the Grey Power network. In my home State of Western Australia, the same story occurred at the recent State election. Preferences from Grey Power were directed against sitting Government members, while in the upper House they directed their preferences to the Liberal Party-clearly an expression of their political persuasion. Had they not directed their preferences in that way, had they shared them with the Australian Democrats, they probably would have had a seat in the upper House. That was an error in judgment by Grey Power. Again in Western Australia a large number of ex-Liberal candidates were members of Grey Power and in fact stood in the election for Grey Power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Elderly people in this country have legitimate concerns about their future, about their retirement incomes and the sorts of circumstances they will find themselves in in retirement. But we need to look at the facts here. Between March 1983 and December 1988 the consumer price index increased by 49.3 per cent. Average weekly earnings increased by a similar amount, 47.6 per cent, but we find that the pension increased by 60.8 per cent. In real terms there has been a real increase in the pension of 8.3 per cent over our time in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are pensioners so concerned? Clearly the main reason is disinformation and the hyperbolic commentary on the existing situation. It is the wild, unsubstantiated promises that we are hearing from people such as Grey Power and the Australian Pensioners Party that have led to concern and confusion among pensioners. To its credit, the Liberal Party has now modified the assets test proposals which for a time it was throwing around in this place. It now takes a much more sensible approach to the assets test and to many other reforms introduced by this Government. But that is not for Grey Power or for the Australian Pensioners Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the House a couple of examples. I have in my hand a pamphlet produced before the last election by a Grey Power candidate. He said that he intended to improve pensions by $50 a week. I asked the Parliamentary Library what it would cost to increase the age pension by $50 a week. The answer is that it would cost the Budget $3.5 billion. The second claim was that Grey Power would abolish the means test, the incomes and assets test, just for age pensioners-not for all pensioners, so there will be no equity. Such a proposal would cost $3.17 billion. The total cost of the first two claims-and there are a number of others-is $6.7 billion. The surplus which it has taken us 35 years in this country to establish would be wiped off in one fell swoop by introducing just two of Grey Power's proposals. Clearly it is economic lunacy to suggest that. </PARA>
<PARA> I give another example from the Eastern Suburbs Reporter. This is even more a matter of concern, particularly to elderly people in my electorate. The Eastern Suburbs Reporter is a local newspaper circulating in the north of my electorate. This is a claim from the Secretary of the Australian Pensioners Party, Mr Ray Lowe:</PARA>
<PARA>When a pensioner dies and his or her house is sold the money recovered goes towards paying back the government for the pension the person has been claiming . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading `Government Grave Robbing' that article appeared, with the suggestion by Mr Lowe that the Government was clawing back from pensioners who had died the pension that they had been paid during their lifetime. There were more claims. Mr Lowe said that the Government saw pensioners as an embarrassment and an encumbrance who were better off dead. Indeed, it is that sort of outlandish, dishonest, distorted and inaccurate suggestion from these people who purport to represent pensioners that has caused confusion and is unfair on pensioners and on this Government. The true story is that pensions have increased in real terms by 8.3 per cent. While the provision for one's retirement is an issue about which pensioners should be concerned, long-term solutions are the answer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of the House in the few moments that remain the fact that in southern New South Wales at present there is an abattoir strike, a meatworkers strike, taking place. This is not an unusual occurrence, but it is unusual, given the circumstances under which it is taking place. Abattoir workers have been given a flat $10 a week wage increase, a 4 per cent wage rise on top of the $10 a week increase, and a 3 per cent superannuation deal. In addition, they have been awarded a 38-hour week, which I think will work out as a 19-day month. All the added advantages awarded to these workers by the Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission have been rejected by the abattoir workers, and they have chosen to go on strike and have now entered their second week of strikes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is unusual is that today I had reports from a constituent that radio station 2MG, which broadcasts from Mudgee, New South Wales, was reporting a Department of Social Security officer as saying that the people who were on strike could obtain social security benefits for the time they are on strike. In later investigation my constituent had rung the Department of Social Security in Lithgow from which the gentleman concerned claimed to come. If a person claimed to be from the abattoir and was on strike, the question arose as to how he could get money when he was on strike. The person at the Social Security office said, `If you have a wife and she is no longer working, you can get her on unemployment benefit and she can get $160 a week. If you have a child under 13 you can claim $24 a week, and if you have a child between the ages of 13 and 15 you can get $31 a week'. That totals $215 a week from the taxpayer, paid to families who have the principal wage earner currently on strike. If that story proves to be correct, I believe that the practice should be stopped. If it is not correct, the Government should be admonishing the person who claimed to speak for the Department of Social Security in Lithgow. </PARA>
