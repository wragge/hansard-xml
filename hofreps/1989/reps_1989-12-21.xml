<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not refuse leave for the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to move this motion, but at the outset I want to give an indication of the protest of the Opposition in relation to how the business of this House is being organised. For example, the first matter to be dealt with this morning is a matter of privilege. At this moment as I speak in the House of Representatives I do not have a copy of the motion to be moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A matter of privilege is an important matter. A member of the Opposition is under some kind of censure, under some kind of cloud, as a result of actions of the Government. There has been a minority report that has received very little publicity, and we will come to that in another debate later this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that we have not received a copy of any motion that the Government proposes to move. I spoke to the Leader of the House very briefly before you entered the chamber, Mr Speaker. He indicated to me that there was a motion. Over the past few years, and in particular over the past few weeks, the Government has been treating this House with absolute contempt. Inherent in what the Minister has said this morning is that the House will sit late tonight. We have no objection to that. We are happy to stay here until 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning if that is the only way the Government of Australia can get its business through the House of Representatives. We are prepared to sit here right up until Christmas. We would have sat for the last two weeks if the Government could have got its business in order. This is an incompetent Government in every respect and certainly in relation to the way it conducts the business of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Just recently I was in the House of Commons watching Question Time. The Prime Minister came in for only 15 minutes. I thought at first that it was a travesty of justice that the Prime Minister was in the House at Question Time for only 15 minutes. But I was pleasantly surprised. During that 15 minutes the Prime Minister answered more questions than this Government answers in 50 minutes during an ordinary Question Time in the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the House says that the Government provides details. What a lot of nonsense! One cannot get details out of this Government; one cannot get answers to questions. If one asks a short question that requires a brief, factual answer, those opposite go on and on with something that, with great respect, is irrelevant. Mr Speaker, from time to time we seek your assistance under the rules of relevance to bring the Ministers back to the subject of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will not oppose the suspension of Standing Orders and the change in the sitting pattern for today and tomorrow. But I do give notice that this Opposition will oppose and protest at every available opportunity at the way the Government is treating this House. It is treating it with contempt. It is nothing more than a charade. If it did not have to come here to conduct the business of the government of Australia, it would not come at all. We are sitting for fewer days each year. There is less opportunity for private members to raise matters of importance to the public. There are fewer opportunities to ask questions. In 1984 the Government increased the size of the House for no reason other than for party political purposes. It believed that the increase would give it an electoral advantage. Now with additional members in the House what does the Government do? It arranges for us to sit for fewer days, it gives us less opportunity for members to ask questions and so on. On one sitting day towards the end of the last sitting period the Opposition was given the opportunity to ask only four questions in a 50-minute Question Time. This is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 this Parliament sat for 84 days whereas the Canadian and the United Kingdom parliaments sat for 167 days each and the United States Congress sat for 170 days. I call on the Government to rearrange its program for next year and to ensure--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment; the Government Whip should not get too excited about what I am saying. I ask the Government to rearrange its program for the first part of next year to ensure that we sit earlier than is presently proposed and that more time is allocated for the Opposition, and indeed, for Government members, to raise matters of great national importance. Surely every person in this House agrees that our system provides for governments to govern; in other words, for the majority view to prevail, and for the minority view to be heard. But this Government does not want the minority view to be heard. As a result, the minority view is very rapidly becoming the majority view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want the Leader of the House to indicate clearly whether this House will reassemble on 20 February as scheduled, or whether the Government intends to run with its tail between its legs and not face this House again before the election. I want the Leader of the House to give us an assurance one way or the other. Will the House of Representatives be recalled on 20 February, or does the Government intend to go to the people before meeting the House again. If it is the Government's intention to come back on 20 February, I ask the Leader of the House to reconsider that timetable and to come back early next year so that there will not be a bunching of legislation. During 1989 Bill after Bill went through with absolutely no discussion and only five or 10 minutes were allocated to other pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in this place is an absolute disgrace. It is time that the Government changed its ways and provided a better opportunity for people to discuss matters of great national importance in the chamber and also to demonstrate to the Australian public that this is a democracy. We are all hailing what is going on in Eastern Europe. At last people in Eastern Europe are being given an opportunity to speak their minds, though not all of them yet have the opportunity to vote. In this country, particularly in the House of Representatives, thankfully we still have the opportunity to vote, but we have fewer and fewer opportunities to speak. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Opposition for its support of this motion, as expressed in the remarks of the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife). He directed a couple of questions to me and there are one or two other points that I would quite like to take up. His first question was: Will the Parliament reconvene on 20 February? The answer to that is that it depends on whether there is an election before that date or in the few weeks after that date; it is as simple as that. If there is not an election, the Parliament will reconvene on 20 February. If there is an election, the Parliament will not reconvene. So there we are; that is the answer to that question. I rather suspect that that is the answer the honourable member expected. It is the only answer that commonsense could provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter he referred to was the imposition of time limits on private members in this place. I do not think there can be any doubt at all that the changes supported by the Government to the Standing Orders for this Parliament and which largely, even for this day of sitting, hand over Thursday mornings to private members for consideration of private members' business, are the most substantial advance for the rights of private members in this House for a considerable period. Private members in the House of Representatives now have a meaningful role. In addition, the Government has provided for a series of committees capable of monitoring Government policy in the House of Representatives to give more meaning to the Parliament's role of checking the Executive. Again, that is a position which was not permitted by our predecessors when they were in office. In so far as the advance of the rights of private members is concerned, we have a reputation and a record of achievement second to none in regard to the operations of this House. But it has to be said that we did not have much to beat. In the period when honourable members opposite ran this House-which was for most of the time of this Federation-private members, at least in the House of Representatives, had few rights at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hume made the point that we do not meet often enough. That is a matter for debate. It may or may not be true. But it is absolutely indisputable, if we take our period in office and the seven years when the Fraser Government was in office, that essentially there is no difference. Basically, the Fraser Government had more sittings in a particular year compared with the sittings of the Hawke Government but, averaged out, effectively this Parliament has sat for the same amount of time over the last couple of decades. If there is an error in that regard it is an error that all governments have perpetrated in the operation of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are different from the House of Commons, both in Britain and in Canada. The House of Commons in either of those places does not operate with the same level of party discipline as we do in this place. It does not operate on the basis that Ministers are available in the House for questioning on every day of the week. In the United Kingdom, Ministers, apart from the Prime Minister, are available for questioning about once a fortnight and junior Ministers are scarcely available at all. In the House of Commons Ministers are not constantly on call to answer for the administration of their portfolios. Obviously, there are swings and roundabouts. The opportunity for more extensive questioning at Question Time is exchanged for the opportunity of having available, on a daily basis, Ministers for questioning. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition does not like that situation, it should raise it with the Standing Committee on Procedure. The Opposition has members on that Committee who can raise, if it wishes, alternative methods of conducting Question Time. The fact is that whenever Question Time has been seriously looked at-and a member of this place can ask questions without notice but that position does not apply in either Canada or the United Kingdom-we have always said that we would rather keep the practice of asking questions without notice rather than having to place them on notice which one has to do in Canada and the United Kingdom. We have always said that we would rather have the Ministers available for questioning on every day that Parliament sits rather than have them available once a fortnight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all members would prefer to keep maximum flexibility tomorrow so that we can get out of this place and get back home for Christmas, no matter what obfuscation may be presented by the Manager of Opposition Business in this place. When Government members and, more generally, members of this House have analysed Question Time, they have in the end come back to the view that the way in which we conduct Question Time is better than the way in which it is done in the House of Commons. Personally, I think that is highly arguable. Nevertheless, that is the point at which we have always arrived and I cannot see that being likely to change in the foreseeable future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume, also spoke at some length about the fact that we have not been sitting for the last couple of weeks. I think a development has been taking place in parliamentary politics since 1986 that requires the serious attention of members of this House in terms of finding some way of altering it. It is appalling that we are now placed in the situation where, at the end of the legislative session in the House of Representatives, we are obliged to guillotine through this place huge amounts of legislation, go off for a couple of weeks and then either come back for a couple of days to deal with that legislation or not deal with it in this session. That is a discipline which has been imposed on this House by the Senate since 1986, ever since the carriage of the Macklin motion by the Australian Democrats and the Opposition in the Senate in which a date was placed on the consideration by the Senate of legislation that passes through this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in a situation where I believe, in practical terms, the rights of the House of Representatives have been monumentally trampled upon. The Senate says to the Government of the day, `If you do not have all the business that you wish to have started by 1 January-that is, all your Budget and related material and all the other legislation in respect of which there are fairly serious implications if they do not start on 1 January in the forthcoming year; this is the way governments do business in this country-in place by date X, the Senate simply will not consider it'. Date X in this case happened to be 23 November, some one month ago. The Senate said to us in the House of Representatives one month ago, `Any further material that you pass will simply not be considered by us in this session'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a very damaging proposition to the conduct of government. I would also have thought that it is a rather stupid position for the Opposition to adopt. Whatever we might think about the Senate and its role in the party process as a forum for debate, the articulation of public policy in this country and the presentation of Government and Opposition views on the issues of the day, we unquestionably maintain that the House of Representatives is the focus of public attention. I would have thought that a competent and sensible Opposition in the Senate would never support a proposition such as the Macklin resolution because it is always in the interests of the Opposition to have the House of Representatives sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives does not sit if there is not Government Business to be considered. There may be a load of other business to consider; but it would be totally unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth were we to decide to hand over the House of Representatives for a month-which is effectively what is being asked for-to enable anybody to get up and to raise anything he or she likes. There are other things to be done. If Opposition members had not supported that fatuous proposition and had not sustained their support for it for the last two or three years, we would have had the House of Representatives sitting; we would not have had the situation where we are called back at the end of a sitting period to consider our legislation and we would have been in a position to do things much more sensibly. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members take a look at the record of closure debates versus guillotine, they will notice an interesting thing: the Opposition in office, by a factor of about 70 per cent, moved closure motions as opposed to the way in which we have chosen to do business. We very rarely close debates in that way; the Opposition frequently did. We have had far more frequent recourse to the guillotine since 1986 than the Opposition ever did. Honourable members can see in that an explanation as to the impact of that Macklin resolution. It forces the House of Representatives to rapidly conclude its business. In the situation when the Opposition was in government the House of Representatives still had to conclude its business but it was able to do it in a much more leisurely fashion by recourse to closure motions. </PARA>

The Opposition has failed to understand the political implications for itself as an opposition of persisting in its support of the Macklin resolution. Opposition members have put themselves at a disadvantage by effectively bringing the House of Representatives to a point where, at the end of every session when it may have been meeting for a month, it does so no longer. The Opposition has also effectively allowed its senators to offend against the right of this House by allowing them to place on the record a statement saying that they will not consider business by the House of Representatives after a particular date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is incompetent handling of business by Opposition members. It is an incompetence which entirely comes back on them and their capacity to be an opposition in this country. This particular set of sittings happens to be a consequence of the Opposition's failure to understand what is an effective role for the Opposition in the Senate. Opposition members have only themselves to blame if they feel that this House, out of necessity, gets badly treated. </PARA>

<PARA>We have now had some considerable time to view both the report of the Committee of Privileges and minority reports and to study the minutes of the Committee of Privileges since that very unfortunate day-23 November-when one of the members of this House, without due resolution, effectively tabled a series of allegations of a most serious nature. The Committee has not gone into those allegations. It has simply gone into the issue of what should have been the state of the honourable member's knowledge as to how he might proceed with those matters. The Committee evidently sought to ascertain from the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) whether or not he understood what the processes were which he would be obliged to follow in order to have such matters considered by the House of Representatives. Quite clearly he should, and did, understand the processes he ought to have gone through. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bruce makes a fetish of a willingness to make bizarre allegations under privilege in this place. If we go back over his record over the years, he at least ought to be as competent as any member of this House in understanding exactly what he ought to be doing in placing matters before the House. Over the years he has made bizarre allegations about industry leaders, trade union officials, politicians and police and their alleged involvement in drug trafficking which, when investigated by the Australian Federal Police, were found to be unfounded and based on rumour and conjecture. At various times he has also managed to describe the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as being linked to organised crime. Over the years he has managed to find spies in all sorts of locations and whenever--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. While I understand that the motion before the House relates to a report from the Privileges Committee, I suggest that the Leader of the House at the moment is digressing from the content of that report. In that he is criticising the honourable member for Bruce for matters that are not pertinent to the report of the Privileges Committee, I suggest that it is entirely out of order. Under our Standing Orders, if a member is to be condemned, that must be done by substantive motion. The matters to which the Leader of the House is referring are not in the Privileges Committee report.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have, in fact, made the points I wanted to make in that regard which, as you say, go to the point of whether or not the honourable member for Bruce ought to be familiar with the procedures of this House and the way in which allegations of substance are made. In this particular matter the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) was the victim of a two-pronged assault-one in the other place, which we cannot deal with here, and one in this place that went to the very heart of his integrity. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) in the debate in which this matter was considered, those allegations, if substantiated on the basis of a resolution in this place, would go very much to the heart of whether or not the honourable member for Hotham ought to hold tenure in this place. They were allegations of a very serious nature and they are allegations, I might say when looking at it, which were presented without any substantial proof at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the conclusion of the Committee? The Committee concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whilst acting on the basis of information presented to him, the honourable Member for Bruce, if of the view that the allegation should have been brought before the House, should also have been alert to the requirement that such a matter ought to be put forward by means of a substantive motion open to debate and which would admit of a distinct vote of the House;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) as a matter of urgency the attention of all Members should be drawn to the requirements of the standing orders and practices of the House which govern the matter of reflections on and charges against Members; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the great privilege of freedom of speech carries with it a heavy obligation that it be exercised with great care and responsibility and that the misuse of this privilege in making charges against other persons, whether Members or not, could be held by the House to be not only an abuse but a contempt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Having regard to the experience of the honourable Member for Bruce the Committee finds that the honourable member has offended against the rules of the House. Accordingly the Committee recommends that the honourable Member should, at the first parliamentary opportunity, be required to apologise to the House for his serious breach and recommends that the House requires him to withdraw the allegation. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence the motion that I have put before the House. That is a serious set of findings, a set of findings in a limited area which do not go to the substance of what the honourable member for Bruce has had to say, which I think the House would wisely treat like the substance of just about everything the honourable member for Bruce has had to say of this sort of nature in the past-totally unfounded. But by the way in which he handled himself in this place, the processes this House ought to enforce should ensure the protection of its members and ensure that all members are effectively capable of exercising the privilege that they have in this place. So the Committee narrowed itself to a consideration of how that procedure ought to have been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I note one or two oddball elements of objections to this that come out of the minority report. One of the objections is to the way in which this process arrived before the Committee for consideration. All I can say in answer to that proposition is that the Opposition supported the way in which this matter was placed before the Privileges Committee when the matter was considered by the House. Mr Speaker outlined to us that there are two ways in which a matter might be placed before the Privileges Committee-one on his recommendation, the other on a recommendation of the House; and any sensible reading of the Standing Orders would show that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> As to whether or not the opportunity was available for the honourable member for Bruce to address himself on the issues raised against him at the Privileges Committee, I believe five meetings of that Committee, which went for a substantial period of time over a period of a week, were held. There were plenty of opportunities for the honourable member for Bruce to explain himself and the course of action that he undertook to that Committee. If he feels that he has not had ample opportunity to explain himself, then that may in some way relate to the way in which he chose to conduct himself at those Committee hearings. But that is for members of the Committee to discuss; I was not present at those meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> However, what is obvious to me, and ought to be obvious to every other member of the House, is that the processes which ought to have been followed in placing these sorts of allegations made by the honourable member for Bruce before this place were simply not followed by the honourable member for Bruce. Whereas in some circumstances failing to observe the privileges of this place might be excused-either by ignorance if a member happens to be a new member and not used to doing the sort of thing that caused the offence or because the matters to be considered in a way in which they were raised were relatively trivial-that sort of defence does not happen to be available in this case. Firstly, the honourable member for Bruce, at least as much as any other member of this House, as he is a longstanding member and a member given to this type of allegation, ought to be thoroughly aware of the processes by which he should place his views before the chamber. Secondly, what was presented were very serious allegations indeed. The build-up which occurred outside this place, in the other chamber and, finally, in this place itself was, by any fair-minded view or reading by any member of this chamber, meant to create the impression that the honourable member for Hotham was a traitor to this country and as such a person not fit to hold office in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> These are serious statements which can only be dealt with in this House by recourse to the Standing Orders as to the norms of this House. The honourable member for Bruce failed to observe those. That is all the Committee has found on. The Committee, of course, did not consider the substance of the allegations. The Committee has sensibly, therefore, asked the honourable member for Bruce to withdraw and apologise, and that is a proposition with which all fair-minded members of this House ought to agree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes this motion. Within that context, I say at the outset that the Opposition has been given no notice of this motion whatsoever. One would have thought, especially given the pompous tone of the speech we have just heard, with all those lofty references to decency and high principle, that at the very least in that context a motion calling upon a member of this House to withdraw an allegation and apologise, and a motion that goes on to say that if he does not he is to have that mark against his career of being suspended for two sitting days, the Government could have given the Opposition notice that it intended to move such a serious motion. But no-no such notice has been given. The second instalment of the ambush that has coloured this matter from beginning to end has just been visited upon this House. We regard that conduct as utterly reprehensible in every respect. The very least the Government could have done is give notice of the fact that it intended to move this motion which is, in effect, a form of proposed punishment on the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report of the Committee of Privileges is not one of which this House can be proud. I invite all honourable members to read the Committee's report. I venture to say that, if any fair-minded observers read the evidence, the minutes and the report itself they would come to exactly the same conclusion, namely, that the report is not one of which this House can be proud. In fact, the House should be ashamed of it. This is a report of an inquiry which was unsatisfactory from beginning to end in virtually every respect. It was conducted without any jurisdiction whatsoever; it never clarified exactly what it was inquiring into; it never decided what the real issues were and it was conducted in a manner that was a complete denial of natural justice to the honourable member for Bruce. It was a shambles from beginning to end. It was the ultimate Star Chamber, set up with the clear intention of convicting, of proceeding through an empty charade to its inevitable conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell the House why I reject the majority report, and why I say the House should be thoroughly dissatisfied with the job done by the Committee. Firstly-this is hard to believe, but it is true-the Committee never formulated the alleged matter of privilege which was before it. This was despite the fact that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and I asked the Committee, at the very beginning of the proceedings, to do exactly that. One would have thought that the obvious and first thing for the Committee to do would be to clarify exactly what it was inquiring into, but that was never done. </PARA>
<PARA> Every member of the House who heard the debate on the matter being referred to the Privileges Committee knew that an alleged matter of privilege of some sort was to be examined. Some members, I presume, thought it had been alleged that the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) had infringed his privilege as a member. Other members, presumably, thought it was being said that the honourable member for Bruce had broken privilege because of the speech he made in the grievance debate on 23 November. Never in the course of the proceedings did the Privileges Committee formulate the matter of privilege into which it was supposed to be inquiring. The only attempt at such a formulation was when the Committee decided:</PARA>
<PARA>That the allegation referred to it comprise the address made to the House by the Member for Bruce on 23 November 1989, recorded at Hansard page 2804-6. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in my minority report, that tells us exactly nothing about the head of privilege that it is said this matter comes under, and tells us nothing at all about who was supposed to have committed the breach of privilege. Nor does it tell us how it was thought there had been a breach of privilege committed by the honourable member for Bruce, or anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee started off in a fog, and remained in a fog for the whole of the inquiry. It almost beggars belief, but the harsh reality is that from the moment of the reference being made to the Committee until today, there has never been any statement of what the alleged breach of privilege is. This is not just a flaw in the Committee's deliberation which has existed from the beginning; it is doubly bad because the honourable member for Bruce was expected to defend himself against a charge when not only did he not know what the charge was but also the Committee that was trying him was never able to tell itself what the charge was. If that is not a travesty of justice, I do not know what is. The whole proceedings were flawed from the beginning and, in my view, remain flawed. That is the reason why the House should reject this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why the inquiry was completely unsatisfactory is that the way in which the Committee conducted its inquiry was a complete and absolute denial of the most elementary principles of justice and fairness to the honourable member for Bruce. I have already said that the honourable member was never given the substance of the charge against him. Furthermore, his trial was conducted by a committee whose first failing was its own composition. As is known, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is entitled to nominate a member to the Committee. The Leader of the House nominated the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding). What is extraordinary about this is that it was the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories who raised the alleged matter of privilege in the House on the first occasion. The Minister said that the honourable member for Bruce's remarks that are said to have given rise to the matter of privilege were the vilest of allegations. Not content with this, he added:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I have never heard a more serious allegation than this. </PARA>
<PARA>We cannot, of course, ask members of the Privileges Committee to be judges in the strictest sense but what we can ask for-and what the rules of natural justice obviously call for-is that those who sit on the Privileges Committee, especially when they are to pass judgment on the conduct of one of their colleagues, should come to that Committee with an open mind and without prejudice. It cannot conceivably, by any stretch of the imagination, be said that a member who has contributed to a debate about referring a matter to the Privileges Committee and who, in the course of that debate, has said that the person to be brought before the Committee has been guilty of the vilest of allegations, can have an open mind when he comes to exercise his role as a member of the Privileges Committee. It is fanciful to suggest that he can. I have no hesitation at all in saying that the composition of this Committee was tainted from the beginning and was utterly illegitimate because of its composition. That is particularly so because the Minister was given an opportunity to withdraw from the Committee but declined to do so. Yet unblushingly the Committee went on and passed judgment on the honourable member for Bruce. That is the first denial of natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The second clear denial of natural justice is, I believe, simply this: the honourable member for Bruce asked for the opportunity to obtain legal representation; and he asked for this indulgence on two occasions. As I have said in my minority report, he should have been given a reasonable opportunity to obtain advice before being expected to answer questions and defend himself. Yet he was denied this opportunity. He did not ask for a permanent or, indeed, a lengthy adjournment. I, for one, would never have granted him that. But I would have granted-and I proposed, in fact, that he should be granted-a reasonable adjournment to enable him to obtain advice and representation. But that was denied. This was a serious and substantial denial of natural justice.</PARA>
<PARA> But there was a third and far more serious breach of natural justice. The honourable member for Bruce came before us twice. Before he appeared the second time a resolution had been prepared and circulated which, in effect, found him guilty. A majority of the Committee decided the matter and reached its conclusions before the honourable member for Bruce had been heard, before he had completed his evidence and before he could call his witnesses, whom he indicated he wanted to call, before the Committee. I regard this as offensive in the extreme. It is nothing more than exactly what it was intended to be-a prejudging of the issue and a prejudging of the honourable member for Bruce. </PARA>
<PARA> But it gets worse because the majority report does not even say whether a breach of privilege has been committed or not. In fact, the Committee in its deliberations decided that there was no breach of privilege. The basic fact about this matter that must be understood before the Government tries to hang the honourable member for Bruce is that the Privileges Committee decided that there was no breach of privilege. Let us get that fact firmly and clearly in our heads. The situation is simply this: one would think, at the very least, that the Committee would conclude on the matter of breach of privilege and say so in its majority report. One would think that it could say whether a breach of privilege had been committed. That was the obligation the Committee had to this House, no more and no less. Yet the report is silent on this most basic of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is even worse than that because the Committee, as I have said, very early in the proceedings reached the conclusion that it was obvious that there was no breach of privilege. If that was said, of course, the honourable member for Bruce would be cleared because this was the Privileges Committee and the matter was clearly sent to the Committee with the intention of having him examined to see what strength there was in the allegations that had been made not by him but in the statutory declaration. When the Committee concluded that there was no breach of privilege, that should have been the end of the matter. But no, the Committee has chosen to deal with the complaint on the basis that there was a breach of the rules of this House. The House should think very carefully before accepting this report and acting on it, bypassing this motion. It means that the Committee of Privileges is allowed to pass judgment on whether a member has broken the Standing Orders or the rules of procedure of this House. That was never the function of the Privileges Committee and it is not its function now. I therefore put to the House very seriously that the Committee has gone widely astray and has absolutely no authority to pass judgment on whether any member of this House has departed from the rules of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The final defect of this appallingly slack procedure is that it is very doubtful indeed whether the honourable member for Bruce did commit a breach of the Standing Orders or the rules of the House. Let me remind the House of exactly what happened in the grievance debate. The honourable member tabled a statutory declaration. He did not make allegations, as the Minister has said this morning. The honourable member who tabled the statutory declaration, the honourable member for Bruce, made no allegations of his own. It goes without saying that the statutory declaration, as honourable members will see when they read it, did not say anything of the hysterical sort attributed to him by the Leader of the House or by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories in his contribution to the earlier debate. The honourable member for Bruce asked for leave to table the statutory declaration and was granted it. He was granted leave by a Minister who read it. There was no objection made by any member of this House. There was no objection taken by the Acting Speaker, who was in the chair at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is said in the report that the honourable member created difficulties for the Chair. What difficulties did he create? Is the situation we are now to be left with as a result of this report and as a result of the motion that has now been put up by the Government that a member of this House is to have his freedom of speech denied because he runs the risk of being pilloried simply because he asks for leave to table a document and that leave is granted by a Minister and no objection is taken by any honourable member and no objection is taken by the Chair? They are the basic facts of the matter. A member asked for leave to table a statutory declaration. The Minister examined the document and gave that leave. No-one-no member, neither the Acting Speaker nor anyone else-took any objection whatsoever to the tabling of the statutory declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> Now it is said that on the basis of his tabling a statutory declaration-not on the honourable member's allegations-he is hauled before the Privileges Committee, convicted as a result of a kangaroo court of the worst order, breaching natural justice at every opportunity, and then, in effect, censured by this House. The honourable member for Hume, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) and myself-and I am sure the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) would associate himself with these remarks but unfortunately he is not here-believe this was a travesty of justice from beginning to end. It would be a considerable denial of the rights of free speech of members of this House, guaranteed under the Bill of Rights of 1689, if a member were to be punished in the way that is proposed simply for exercising his rights of freedom of speech in this House. That is what the Government is doing and it should be ashamed. The House should indicate its rejection of this motion in no uncertain terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present a copy of the proof transcript of evidence taken during the inquiry, which the Committee has authorised for publication, and a copy of the minutes of the Committee's meetings on 30 November 1989. As Chairman of the Committee of Privileges it would not be appropriate for me to argue the merits of the matter now before the House. Nevertheless, it may help the House if I recount to it the substance of the Committee's report. In the report I presented on 30 November the Committee noted that the allegation contained in the speech by the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) during the grievance debate on 23 November amounted to a serious imputation against and personal reflection on the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) but that the circumstances of the speech created difficulties for the Chair in the application of the rules of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee noted that there is often an inclination on the part of members to bypass the correct forms of the House in the making of the charges and allegations. The Committee believed that it had not been charged with the responsibility of making a determination of the substance or otherwise of the statements in the statutory declaration which contained the allegation against the honourable member for Hotham. It noted that in the ultimate it did not have the capacity to conduct an authoritative investigation into the allegation itself. The Committee reported to the House its conclusions as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whilst acting on the basis of information presented to him, the honourable member for Bruce, if of the view that the allegation should have been brought before the House, should also have been alert to the requirement that such a matter ought to be put forward by means of a substantive motion open to debate and which would admit of a distinct vote of the House;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) as a matter of urgency the attention of all members should be drawn to the requirements of the Standing Orders and practices of the House which govern the matter of reflections on and charges against members; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the great privilege of freedom of speech carries with it a heavy obligation that it be exercised with great care and responsibility and that the misuse of this privilege in making charges against other persons, whether Members or not, could be held by the House to be not only an abuse but a contempt. </PARA>
<PARA>Having regard to the experience of the honourable member for Bruce the Committee finds that the honourable member has offended against the rules of the House. Accordingly the Committee recommends that the honourable Member should, at the first parliamentary opportunity, be required to apologise to the House for this serious breach and recommends that the House require him to withdraw the allegation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's report was accompanied by two dissenting reports. Those who have read the report and the dissenting reports will recognise that there was a measure of disagreement on the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to go into the detail of the Committee's operations now, but I would say that this case illustrates how difficult it can be for members of the House to make judgments about their fellow members. I wish also to emphasise the point made by the Committee about the great privilege of freedom of speech. This privilege carries with it a very great responsibility. As members we must be careful in our use of this privilege and in our use of the forms of the House. Freedom of speech is essential to the Parliament, and I do not think any member would deny this. Nevertheless, the community is entitled to expect a very high degree of responsibility and care in the raising of serious matters, whether about members or other people. I do not wish to argue the merits of the present matter but have sought only to recount the substance of the main report for the information of honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not have escaped the attention of the House that my name is listed amongst those who supported the majority report of the Committee of Privileges to the Parliament. For that reason alone I think it is appropriate that I say something. I move beyond that to express my disenchantment because the presentation by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) might well be described as that sort of presentation that would be given by a learned man of the law on behalf of a client, at considerable cost, not necessarily to secure him justice but to ensure that he escaped it. What are the simple facts of the matter? I am conscious that my friend the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred), is sitting virtually at arm's length, or just beyond it, which might be a happy circumstance. He knows, as we know-over seven Parliaments we get to know each other-that he came into this House with the firm intention of-to use the vernacular-tipping a bucket on the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). Does any honourable member in this House, including the honourable member for Bruce, suggest for one moment that that was not the case. It goes without saying: he came to tip a bucket on the honourable member for Hotham, notwithstanding the fact that standing order 76 clearly states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Bruce, wittingly, knowingly, deliberately came into the House to defy that standing order which, as a cardinal standing order, should be firmly imprinted in the mind of every honourable member coming into this House. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is need to raise a matter which impugns, directly or indirectly, another honourable member, there are forms of the House by which this might be done. But on this occasion the honourable member for Bruce decided that he would treat the forms of the House-dare I say it?-with contempt. His particular mission was of greater importance than the forms of this House. So he embarked on an exercise which was characterised by a duplicity. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges, in its report to the House, pointed out that it was difficult for the Presiding Officer to deal with the emerging contempt or defiance of Standing Orders because the honourable member for Bruce, with almost an admirable cunning, knew that the way to get around that particular problem was to use a statutory declaration which damned another honourable member of this House but with a delightful degree of anonymity-no names, no pack drill. Then in the final seconds of his address, he said, with a retrospectivity to which this House is no stranger, that the public figure referred to was the honourable member for Hotham. That was just as damning and just as telling as if he had started his delivery with the very statement that he was about to pour a bucket on the honourable member for Hotham. There can be no mistake about the intent and the effect. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been put by the honourable member for Menzies that there were a number of technical points, legal points, which should subvert the determination of the Committee. For example, he said that the Speaker did not retire and give thought to the matter. I, as acting Speaker, had to do that very thing-and I did retire and give thought to whether there had been a breach of privilege, because it was a rather delicate and sensitive matter which was not of a proportion to be regaled by the description `a breach of privilege'. My colleague in the rear seat was involved in that. I came to the conclusion that the House was best served by consulting its dignity, and I think that was the best course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> But, on the other end of the spectrum, there could be a breach which could instantly be recognised by all in the House and the Chair, the Speaker, as a breach of privilege or containing the elements, the characteristics, of a breach of privilege and the Speaker need not have occasion to retire; his approval, endorsement, of a referral to the Privileges Committee would be instant and automatic. That is what was done in this case. There was no particular problem in having it referred to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegation is made that the Committee did not deal with the alleged breach of privilege. It did. There was a complaint that we did not say in our report that there was no breach of privilege. For heaven's sake, that was implicit in the report. We are a privileges committee; we had addressed it. We did not report to the House that there had been a breach of privilege but that we had dealt with another abuse of the forms of the House, which was clearly implying-perhaps in hindsight we should have been more specific-that whilst there was not a breach of privilege, there was a misuse of the forms of the House. How nonsensical for the Committee to go away and study this in very tight terms and simply come back and say, `There's no breach of privilege'. By inference-and it was contained in the remarks of the honourable member for Menzies-if we had come back here and said that there was no breach of privilege, that would tacitly endorse every subsequent abuse of the same nature. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Committee assumed the responsibility to point out to the House that this course of action could not be tolerated by the House and should not be supported by any honourable member. Therefore it behoved us to address ourselves again to the Standing Orders to ensure that there was no abuse on another member of this House other than by the forms provided for it. That, of course, is not necessarily seen in the first instance as an abuse but as an imputation or reflection. In the ultimate there may be substance, but it is for the House to determine, by way of vote, whether the motion carries substance. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of suggestions that a minority of the Committee had been derelict. Yes, the Committee had been derelict. I am at the end of my seventh Parliament-my final Parliament-and I go back to whence I came. I have tried to be an upright parliamentarian, to concern myself with the truth. A reporter descended on me after the report had been furnished to the Parliament and he asked, `Why, Mr Millar, did you align yourself with the Government position?'. That offended me-not in a personal way, but the very suggestion offended me. I said to him, `In the Privileges Committee there should be no alignment with anything other than the facts and the truth'. That is the only alignment I would accept. </PARA>
<PARA> It grieves me to have to say to this House that, for the first time in a privileges committee, I was far from convinced that there was not a political motivation or a misplaced loyalty within that Committee to bring about a divided conclusion. The House would be well served, and my friend the honourable member for Bruce would be well served, to acknowledge that he had misused the forms of the House-not breached privilege; misused the forms of the House-and to dignify this place by withdrawing and apologising for his breach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) on the speech he has just made. In fact, it is a very difficult speech to follow. He has said much that we in this House would all agree with, irrespective of what side we sit on, but which, because of partisan politics, is often not said. A fair degree of partisan politics entered into the deliberations and findings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges. Allegations are being made by some members of that Committee that it was a stacked committee; that natural justice was denied; and that the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) did not get a fair hearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it strange that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), a Queen's Counsel of the Victorian Bar, who sat on the Committee, should say that natural justice was denied when he has, in his capacity as a Queen's Counsel and a member of this House, just given a professional defence of the honourable gentleman. I find it strange that he would say that natural justice was denied when the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), a solicitor from Victoria, also sat on that Committee and, in his dissenting report, gave a spirited defence of the honourable gentleman. I find it even stranger that one would say that natural justice was denied when the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), who is a lawyer, was given permission to appear before the Committee, and did appear, to advise the honourable member for Bruce on how he should respond to questions. One would assume that he was there as an adviser. And yet today the honourable member for Menzies said that the honourable member for Bruce was denied natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three competent, qualified lawyers, I would assume, who would have been in a position to put a defence to assist the honourable member for Bruce. Yet we are told in this House that he was denied natural justice. Frankly, that must be only partisan politics speaking; it cannot be any commonsense approach to this difficult question. In reality, in the evidence that was given to the Committee the honourable member for Bruce, in his opening statement, said on oath:</PARA>
<PARA>I am somewhat at a loss to understand how Mr Holding came to believe that I raised allegations that the honourable member for Hotham was an agent of a foreign power and a traitor. I made no such allegations. Mr Holding's representation of what I said during the Grievance Debate of 23 November 1989 is a total misrepresentation of what I, in fact, said. </PARA>
<PARA>That was sworn evidence given to the Committee by the honourable gentleman. I, as a member of that Committee, took the opportunity to ask him this question:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I could ask a question despite that answer, Mr Chairman. In your statement, Mr Aldred, you have just said that you are at a loss to understand how it can be said that you made any allegations that the member for Hotham, Lewis Kent, was in the service of a foreign power. I draw your attention to the newspaper reports in the Sydney Morning Herald of 24 November 1989, the Canberra Times of 24 November 1989, the Age of 24 November 1989, of the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 24 November, and the Australian of 24 November 1989. All of those newspaper reports say that you alleged those facts in the House and you have not sought to make a personal explanation in the Parliament to deny those newspaper reports. Why have you not denied in the House those reports alleging that that was what you said in the House?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Aldred replied, on oath:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I have made my position perfectly clear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By invitation, extended by the honourable gentleman; that is right-reported in the newspapers that the honourable member for Bruce made those allegations. We know that the forms of this House are such that, if an incorrect report is given, we make a personal explanation in this House at the first available opportunity and we deny those reports. To this day the honourable member for Bruce has not stood up in this House and denied that those newspaper reports were accurate and reflected what he said in the House. If any member of this House has been totally condemned by his own actions, or lack of them, it is the honourable member for Bruce. If we look at his evidence-and every honourable member should read the transcript-we see that it cannot be said that the honourable gentleman comes into this debate with clean hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said that he did not get a fair hearing and that the Committee put him in this position, yet this is consistent with the honourable member's approach in the past. It is appropriate that I, as a member of this House and of this Committee, put to this House what that evidence is because it is relevant to his actions before the Committee, to the evidence he gave to the Committee and to his actions up to this date. In March 1980 the honourable member, together with a member of the Victorian Parliament, Don Saltmarsh, produced what was called a confidential report. It named people involved in drug trafficking, racketeering, gambling, prostitution and other activities and it named industry leaders, trade union officials, politicians-never Liberal Party politicians, mind you, but Labor Party politicians-and members of the police force. The report was made available to the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police and their finding was that it was totally unsubstantiated rumour mongering. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1983, under parliamentary privilege, the honourable member for Bruce asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) why the Prime Minister was involved in organised crime with casinos. He had no proof and no evidence but he asked this question under privilege-the coward's act. In November 1983 he alleged, again in a similar vein, that when the Prime Minister was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions he and Mr David Combe held a secret meeting in New York with a mafia boss. That so-called mafia boss, Mr Sam Amarena, the proprietor of a coffee shop in the city, was approached by the Australian leader and he was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a coupla guys walked in and had coffee . . . I didn't know 'em . . . whoever dose guys were, dey sure didn't look like no Prime Ministers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But that was the basis of the allegation that the honourable member for Bruce was prepared to put to this House. In October 1983 he claimed that he had ironclad evidence of a pending backbench revolt against the Government that would result in the overthrowing of the Prime Minister. He said that he had leaked documents. These documents were never produced. They never saw the light of day; they were never substantiated. Again he said all this in this place-the coward's castle. In early 1986 he claimed to have evidence that Soviet spies were operating in southern Sweden and were active in gathering information on the Swedish submarine at Kockums. </PARA>

I suggest that this is a very serious matter; not one that should now be denigrated by a personal attack on the honourable member for Bruce.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Bruce claimed that the Soviet spies were active in gathering information on the Swedish submarine built at Kockums. Again he used an undocumented, unsubstantiated rumour-if it was a rumour; he probably made it up himself-to call for the re-opening of Defence Department tenders for the then proposal to build submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. He further claimed that Kockums was mounting a disinformation campaign with the aim of discrediting anyone raising those criticisms against its dockyards. Can honourable members imagine a major international company not embarking upon some kind of public relations exercise when the claims of the honourable member for Bruce could have cost it billions of dollars? The honourable member's claims were never substantiated, they were treated by this Parliament as a joke, but that did not prevent him from making those outrageous, unproved and unsubstantiated claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In June 1986, again under privilege, the honourable gentleman made allegations that the late Mr Justice Lionel Murphy had a secret meeting, for unknown and unstated reasons, with crime tsar Abe Saffron. Murphy denied the allegations, as did Saffron. We never saw any evidence and the honourable member's claims were never substantiated. We saw nothing that would prove that allegation, yet it did not prevent this gentleman from standing in this House and making that claim under privilege. In May 1986, in a triumph of distortion and misinformation, the honourable gentleman alleged that a commander of the Australian Federal Police had issued an instruction to staff not to pursue investigations into illegal migrants. Apparently, in the view of the honourable gentleman, this issue became translated into the claim that the Government was leaving the way open for Australia to become a haven for Chinese Triad groups. In fact, the honourable gentleman had misread or misinterpreted a directive which had been issued and which said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . drug trafficking and organised crime were to be the Australian Federal Police's major priorities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr CLEELAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that the honourable member for Bruce should not come into this House and he should not give evidence to a parliamentary committee claiming that he does not know what he is doing. He cannot, with any honesty or any integrity, claim that he either has a distorted view of the world-a conspiracy theory that everyone is out to get everyone else-or, frankly, he just does not understand the expression `relevance'. Bearing in mind the history of the honourable member for Bruce-and I am not finished with that-one would have to question the integrity of anyone who believed anything the honourable member says. Knowing that history, how can we believe his sworn evidence to the Privileges Committee that he did not make those claims against the honourable member concerned. If there is to be any integrity at all and if we are to ever get to the stage where honourable members stop tipping buckets over each other, the House has to make some stand itself. It is not difficult to tip buckets over each other. It would not be difficult for me to make allegations against the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) that he is involved in a cherry-picking scheme. It would not be difficult for me to make similar allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have no files on people from information given to me. I could stand up and tip buckets, but I will not. As a member of this House, I find it offensive that it is so easy for some other members to use the privilege that they have of free speech to do just that. As the Leader of the House said, that privilege did not come easily to the Parliament. It was fought for in the Bill of Rights in the 1600s and it should not be abused. If the House abuses that right of free speech, ultimately the importance and value of this Parliament will diminish. I strongly support the motion. I urge the honourable member to comply with the forms of the House and withdraw the allegation. I would respect him if he did so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Paragraph (c) of the report of the Committee of Privileges states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (c) the great privilege of freedom of speech carries with it a heavy obligation that it be exercised with great care and responsibility and that the misuse of this privilege in making charges against other persons, whether Members or not, could be held by the House to be not only an abuse but a contempt. </PARA>
<PARA>It is proper to refer to the fact that the Privileges Committee did not find that there had been a contempt. Paragraph (c) alludes to the reality that a reflection on members of this place and people outside this place can command the same gravity of seriousness if improperly directed. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) in his comments earlier asserted that the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) had come into this place for the purpose of tipping a bucket on the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). During the cross-examination of the honourable member for Bruce I made an observation by way of a question that I did not believe that the honourable member for Bruce had actually come into this place on that day to enhance the reputation of the honourable member for Hotham. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Holding" NAMEID="CH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9F4">Mr DONALD CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made that comment; I recall it well. I have known the honourable member for Hotham since he entered this place in about 1980 and I have known the honourable member for Bruce since he entered this place in the 1970s. It is always difficult when one is placed in a position of having to make a judgment on the content of either direct or indirect allegations. There is always that danger of one allowing personal associations to cloud judgment. In this instance, I am not without respect for the honourable member for Bruce and I am not without respect for the honourable member for Hotham.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The vast majority of Australians have little understanding of the power that they place in our hands when they elect representatives to this place. We have the power to make or break people in terms of what we say in this place. We can build a reputation and we can destroy a reputation. It behoves each and every one of us never to forget that we possess a power which is held by the rest of the community only for a passing moment. People in a court situation can say what they feel or like before the court judges their veracity. We have that power all the time. Therefore, we have an obligation never to improperly use it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been a member of this place for a period in excess of 20 years. I have rarely used the mechanism that was used by the honourable member for Bruce in respect of the statutory declaration that he read into this place. In about May 1978 I named an honourable member at the end of a speech. The last two words I uttered were that person's name. I used that mechanism to say what I felt. I am absolutely positive that had I used the mechanism of a substantive motion, the government of the day would have clouted me and gagged me. These mechanisms exist to allow people to come into this place and make such statements. As long as they honestly hold a view, as long as they believe in what they are saying, as long as they have discharged a responsibility of doing as much checking of the facts as they possibly can and as long as they genuinely and honestly believe in what they are saying, I see nothing wrong with members using the privilege that the people of this nation, our electors, have given to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek to make a judgment on the allegations which were contained in that statutory declaration. I have a view, perhaps, but I am in no position, nor was the Privileges Committee in a position, to judge the truth of it all. We walked away from that quite happily and judged ourselves as not having the competence to make judgments. Not having made that judgment, we have put ourselves in the position of finding against the honourable member for Bruce. </PARA>
<PARA> I inform this House that in many ways I was happy to go along with reminding members of this Parliament of their obligations in terms of the use of the procedures of this place. But when we reach the stage of demanding that the honourable member for Bruce apologise to the House for his serious breach, of recommending that the House require him to withdraw the allegation and debating whether he be suspended from the service of the House for two sitting days, including today, if he does not fulfil the requirements, I wonder whether we have gone truly overboard. I saw time and time again some members of the present Government-and I am not saying that the misuse of any procedure belongs to any side of the House-sully the reputations of people from the outside world, particularly in relation to taxation matters, and get away with it. People outside have squirmed and called for an opportunity to clear their name. Yet this Parliament did not see a reason for references to the Privileges Committee or a reason to make judgments on a particular member who, in those days, sat on this side of the House. Suddenly, there is great indignation; suddenly, it is terrible; and, suddenly, the honourable member for Bruce has to be brought to account for his actions. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the Committee could not find that a breach of privilege actually existed. Yet here today the Government with its motion is making a recommendation that the honourable member for Bruce be subjected to banishment from this place for two days unless he says he is sorry. I take the view that if the honourable member for Bruce misuses, abuses or carelessly uses the forms of this House his jury lies back in his electorate. There is a second unofficial jury. It consists of the members of his Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, who subject him to pre-selection. If the honourable member for Bruce genuinely and honestly believes that there is a matter to be pursued in this place in the name of the nation's security or in the name of the security of an ethnic group in this country, he can do so as long as he has fulfilled the obligation of properly researching it-not carelessly researching it. Only the test of time will give us the answer as to whether he has fulfilled his obligation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hotham is unlike the victims-so many people from outside this place-whose reputations have been sullied by attacks in this place. The honourable member for Hotham sits here with the same privileges as I and every other individual in this place possess: the right to stand up and defend. That is something which we are very privileged to possess; something which, as I have already said, does not belong to the vast majority of the people. We listened earlier to the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland)-one of the jury-who could not help himself from digging the knife into the honourable member for Bruce a couple of times during his speech. He referred to what he called a rumour that the honourable member for Bruce had raised in previous years and then said that the honourable member for Bruce had `probably made it up'. He then cast some aspersion about cherry picking, and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), that I have never heard of.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the nature of this place. We are being asked to condemn a member of this place for using a mechanism, for uttering a form of words, that has now been judged as an imputation, without that imputation having been subjected to analysis by those who are making the recommendations in the original report. Here we are setting ourselves up as judges while some of us who were also on the jury cannot even resist repeating in part what we are about or what this House, by virtue of political numbers, on Christmas Eve will probably condemn the honourable member for Bruce for having done. I say those words, and the member from Western Australia, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), may sit and laugh; but the reality is that today we are saying, `Tut, tut; naughty, naughty; evil, evil' to a member who has done something that is being judged as being more serious, than what other people have done on so many previous occasions simply because of the implications for the honourable member for Hotham. </PARA>
<PARA> All I ask for is absolute consistency. The Speaker of the day, or the Deputy Speaker of the day-there is no excusing this by a form of words which refers to the Deputy Speaker having found himself or herself in a situation of difficulty-should have dealt with this matter. If, under the Rules of this House, the actions of the honourable member for Bruce were such that they should have been expunged or withdrawn, the Speaker of the day should have cut in, either then or later, and said, `You must withdraw that' or, `I call upon the honourable member for Bruce to withdraw those words or that document which has been tabled but which should never have been tabled'. I do not say this disrespectfully for one moment: we cannot excuse an oversight on the part of the Chair by saying that it was made difficult by the honourable member for Bruce. It is germane to the issue that the Chair, whether then or later, should have stood up in this place and said, `This is judged as a contravention of standing order 76 and therefore I require you to withdraw it'. If mistakes were made on the day, they do not belong solely to the honourable member for Bruce. There is a shared responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying that years ago people such as the late Kevin Hooper, a Labor man from Queensland, stood in the Queensland Parliament making allegations that there was corruption in certain elements in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many things have been said in the course of this debate which I do not intend to go over. I would like to raise a number of matters which I think are important for each and every individual member of this House to consider. I preface my remarks in those terms because it seems to me that this is a debate very much about the role of the Parliament, and each and every one of us as a parliamentarian has to decide the stand that we will take on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was a matter of some concern that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) rose in his place at the commencement of this debate and said that the Opposition opposes this motion. I cannot believe that this is a matter that has been caucused on by the Opposition at this date. I cannot believe that the parliamentarians on the Opposition benches, of whom there is a considerable number and among whom the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) stands pre-eminent, will in some mindless way raise their hands in support of the views that have been put by the honourable member for Menzies, because they are not true as a matter of fact and nor do they have any moral foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> The report that has been brought down by the Privileges Committee is only two pages. It is not a weighty document. It is not a report that seeks to vilify the member who is the subject of the allegation. It is not a report that seeks to impose some draconian penalty on the honourable member. It is a report which is moderate and balanced, but which seeks to uphold the pre-eminent position of the Parliament and the Standing Orders and practices of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I briefly remind honourable members of the three elements of that report. The first one is:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) ought to have been alert to the requirement that such a matter ought to be put forward by means of a substantive motion, open to debate, and which would admit of a distinct vote of the House;</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) has been a member of the House of Representatives for approximately 10 years. He is not a new or an inexperienced member and, as we have heard from some of the remarks that have been made in the course of this debate, he is well versed in parliamentary techniques. It is a long-standing practice of this House, based on the practices of the House of Commons and on long parliamentary traditions, that that standing order be observed. Furthermore, standing order 76 of the House of Representatives is crystal clear. It is probably the most quoted standing order in the Parliament. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Wide Bay has told, far better than I am able to do, the sequence of events that led to the honourable member raising these matters in the House and the fact that the naming of the honourable member occurred in almost the last sentence of his speech. On any reason- able interpretation of what occurred, I believe that it is open to view the method of delivering that speech as a calculated attempt effectively to ambush whoever might have been in the chair at that particular time. It is also a matter of fact, of which this House is entitled to take notice, that within 15 minutes of the honourable member making his contribution in the House of Representatives attacking the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) substantially the same matters were raised in the Senate. That may be purely a matter of coincidence. It happened that it was raised by a senator of the same political party and from the same State. The second matter in the majority report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>as a matter of urgency the attention of all Members should be drawn to the requirements of the standing orders and practices of the House which govern the matter of reflections on and charges against members. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Committee sought to raise the tenor of debate and recognise the importance of proper debate within this parliamentary chamber. The third matter in the majority report, to which I was a party, states:</PARA>
<PARA>the great privilege of freedom of speech carries with it a heavy obligation that it be exercised with great care and responsibility . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Having regard to the experience of the honourable Member for Bruce the Committee finds that the honourable Member has offended against the rules of the House. Accordingly the Committee recommends that the honourable Member should, at the first parliamentary opportunity, be required to apologise to the House for his serious breach and recommends that the House requires him to withdraw the allegation. </PARA>
<PARA>As honourable members can see, this is a moderate, balanced report, one which seeks to do justice in this case and one which I believe the House ought to adopt. By way of comparison, there are two minority reports which, in their totality, are nine pages in length as compared with the majority report of only two pages. Honourable members can search, read and re-read the dissenting reports by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the honourable member for Menzies and not find one single word that in any way, to any degree, is mildly critical of the actions of the honourable member for Bruce. The minority reports are all about a political attack on the majority of members of that Committee, which included the honourable member for Wide Bay. I do not believe that any parliamentarian on any rational reading of both the majority and minority reports could support the minority view. </PARA>
<PARA> I, together with many other members in the course of questions asked of the honourable member for Bruce, focused on the question of whether or not there had been imputations of improper motives or personal reflections. The honourable member said he did not believe that the Standing Orders had been breached. I again refer to matters that have been raised by the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland): just about every major newspaper in this country took the view that the import of the speech of the honourable member for Bruce was to accuse the honourable member for Hotham of links with spies, links with Yugoslav secret police-and so it goes on. I ask every member of this House to put himself or herself in the position of the honourable member for Hotham. I have a view that most people who come into this chamber-in fact, almost all-are basically fairly committed people of integrity. All of us make mistakes from time to time. We go overboard; we make errors of judgment. I ask all honourable members to put themselves in the position of the honourable member for Hotham. Can honourable members imagine picking up the morning newspapers and finding what is, by any interpretation, an attempt to blacken and besmirch their names and tear down their reputations? Can they imagine the consequences of that in their electorates, with their families and their friends? Can they imagine what happens to a person who has been subject to that abuse? The honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) can. In a very dispassionate and reasoned contribution in this House, he reminded us of the hurt that such unsubstantiated and damaging allegations can do to a person. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I believe the majority report is quite balanced and for that reason I urge the House to support it. However, I alert the House to two precedents where the attention of the House has been drawn to a breach of the Standing Orders subsequent to the occurrence of the breach. As I said before, we on this side of the chamber are not immune from having people tip buckets. Bert James and Eddie Ward were pre-eminent in that role and developed it to an art form. On two occasions when the Speaker was alerted to the fact that there had been a breach of the Standing Orders, even though that had occurred on a prior occasion, he quite properly intervened and insisted that there was a withdrawal of those matters. In this case the House is taking that initiative. It is an initiative based on precedent, morality and the traditions of this Parliament. I hope that all parliamentarians on the Opposition benches will vote according to their consciences and not according to party dictates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this chamber on 23 November last at 12.30 p.m. I spoke in the grievance debate. On the same day the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) some 2 1/2 hours later raised a matter of privilege concerning my speech in the grievance debate. As a result of the matter of privilege raised, the House resolved to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges. In the very late hours of 27 November 1989 I received a letter, dated that day, from the Chairman of the Committee of Privileges, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear). The letter stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ``The Committee has agreed to the following resolutions with regard to the reference:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the allegation referred to it comprise the address made to the House by the member for Bruce on 23 November 1989, recorded at Hansard page 2804-6. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the allegation by the honourable member for Bruce concerns the character and conduct of the honourable member for Hotham in his capacity as a member of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) That Mr Aldred be invited to address the Committee at the earliest opportunity.''</PARA>
<PARA>Four o'clock on 28 November 1989, the following day and less than 24 hours after receiving the letter, was suggested as the time for me to first appear before the Committee of Privileges. With regard to the resolutions spelt out in the Chairman's letter, it is important for me at the outset to draw to the attention of the House the gross misrepresentations made by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories when he raised the matter of privilege. I should add that I also brought this very same matter to the attention of the Committee of Privileges during my first appearance before it. At Hansard page 2837 of 23 November 1989 the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested, by innuendo and by direct statement, that the honourable member for Hotham is virtually an agent of a foreign power. That is the allegation. It is as simple and direct as that. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for the Arts, on the same page of Hansard, says:</PARA>
<PARA>What more prima facie case can one have than someone saying that a member of this Parliament is a traitor not merely to this institution but also to his country. That is the allegation. </PARA>
<PARA>As I told the Committee during my first appearance, I am at a loss to understand how the Minister for the Arts came to believe that I raised allegations that the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) was an agent of a foreign power and a traitor. I made no such allegations. The representation of the Minister for the Arts of what I said during the grievance debate on 23 November is a total and gross misrepresentation of what I in fact said. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my remarks to the Committee of Privileges during my appearance before it on 28 November, I also asked the Committee whether the Minister for the Arts should disqualify himself from the Committee for the purposes of the inquiry in view of the fact that it was he who raised the matter of privilege and because of the manner in which he had raised it. The question of whether the Minister for the Arts was an appropriate person to serve on the Committee and whether in fact his presence on the Committee was properly constitutional, given that he was appointed by the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), after the inquiry had already started, is addressed in some detail by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in his dissenting report of 30 November. </PARA>
<PARA> On 29 November 1989 I received a further letter from the Chairman of the Committee of Privileges. I noted from the letter that the Committee had, the day before, passed a resolution in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>That Mr Aldred be invited to appear before the Committee at 8.30 a.m. tomorrow to make any further statement and to answer any questions in respect of his use of the procedures of this House during the Grievance debate on 23rd November. </PARA>
<PARA>It was the substance of the matters dealt with by me in my address of 23 November which were referred to the Committee of Privileges for consideration and not the procedures of the House during the address referred to. As I said to the Committee during my second appearance on 30 November, it is my submission that my use of the procedures of the House is a matter for the Speaker and not one which was referred to the Committee of Privileges by the House when it resolved `that the allegation against the honourable member for Hotham be referred to the Committee of Privileges'. Furthermore, during my second appearance I also brought to the attention of the Committee the findings of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege-that is, the final report of October 1984 as contained in recommendation 21. As I said to the Committee at the time, though this recommendation has not yet been adopted by the House it-or the version adopted by the Senate-should in practice be followed by the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges. In particular, I drew to the notice of the Committee recommendations 21 (c), (d), (f), (g) and (i). Recommendation 21 (c) says:</PARA>
<PARA>Issues before the Committee should be adequately defined so that a person or organisation against whom a complaint has been made is reasonably apprised of the nature of the complaint he has to meet;</PARA>
<PARA>At no stage did the Committee precisely define the matters it proposed to deliberate on, thus denying me the basic right to be informed of the Committee's concerns. Recommendation 21 (d) says:</PARA>
<PARA> A person or organisation against whom a complaint is made should have a reasonable time for the preparation of an answer to that complaint;</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation raised two points: firstly, as per recommendation 21 (c), the complaint was never precisely defined; and, secondly, I was certainly not given a reasonable time to answer anything. Recommendation 21 (f) says:</PARA>
<PARA> A person or organisation against whom a complaint is made should have the right to adduce evidence relevant to the issues;</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 21 (g) says:</PARA>
<PARA> A person or organisation against whom a complaint is made should have the right to cross examine witnesses subject to a discretion in the committee to exclude cross examination on matters it thinks ought fairly to be excluded such as matters of a scandalous, improper, peripheral or prejudicial nature;</PARA>
<PARA>It is sufficient to say that the Committee denied me both these rights. Finally, recommendation 21 (i) says</PARA>
<PARA> A person or organisation against whom a complaint has been made shall be entitled to full legal representation and to examine or to cross examine witnesses through such representation and to present submissions to the committee through such representation;</PARA>
<PARA>This right was also denied me, despite my asking the Committee on two separate occasions for time to retain and brief counsel on a full professional basis. </PARA>
<PARA> One utterance made by the Minister for the Arts on 23 November was at least correct. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is much learning on the whole question of privileges; most of it is to be found not in this House but in the House of Commons</PARA>
<PARA>-and on this rare occasion I find myself in agreement with the Minister. However, despite this House lacking any detailed learning on the matter of privilege, it will be apparent to you, Mr Speaker, and any others who have read the Committee's report that I did not commit a breach of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of serious matters emanating from the report of the Committee of Privileges that the House needs to address. Given that you, Mr Speaker, are the protector of the rights of members, I ask for your advice on the following matters. However, before I do, I would ask all honourable members to also carefully consider the matters I am about to raise as they are indeed serious. First, was the motion of reference valid or invalid? Second, was the Committee properly constituted? Third, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) at paragraph 11 in his dissenting report says, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Majority Report reaches no conclusions on whether a breach of privilege has been committed. As such, it has failed to discharge its responsibility to the House. </PARA>
<PARA>This point is one that all members need to personally address. It is my contention that on reading the majority report no breach of privilege was found to have occurred and that, therefore, the Committee has in fact failed to discharge its responsibility to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourth, the honourable member for Menzies, at paragraph 12 in his dissenting report, also raised the matter of whether the Committee of Privileges has any jurisdiction to deal with a breach of the rules of the House, as it has done in its report. I therefore ask: does the Committee of Privileges have the authority to deal with an alleged breach of the rules of the House or anything else other than the actual matter referred to it by the House? Fifth, did the Committee of Privileges precisely define the matters which it proposed to deliberate on and, if so, do you consider that I was informed of those matters? Sixth, is it the usual practice of the Committee to obtain legal advice from the Clerk of the House? Mr Speaker, I ask you to address that question particularly. </PARA>
<PARA> Seventh, given that Committee members intermittently left the room whilst I was giving evidence, do you consider that those Committee members that did so were in a position to actively participate in the Committee's final decision? In considering this point, let me inform the House that at times when I was giving evidence the Committee room was as busy as Flinders Street railway station in the rush hour. I am sure that all members would agree that anyone appearing to give evidence before a court of law is entitled to a fair hearing-that is, after all, what natural justice is all about. How would it be, for instance, if a judge of the Federal Court were to absent himself from the courtroom whilst the subject of the hearing was giving evidence, to then reappear to deliver a verdict? It would make an absolute mockery of our whole system of justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Eighth, Mr Speaker, are you satisfied that the Committee was competent to conduct the inquiry in the terms agreed by the House given the matters raised by the honourable member for Flinders in his dissenting report at paragraph 3, subparagraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e)?</PARA>

<PARA> Tenth, are you concerned at the matter raised by the honourable member for Flinders in his dissenting report at paragraph 3, subparagraph (i) that the majority were not prepared to give adequate time to those members of the Committee who indicated that they wished to lodge a minority report? Eleventh, is it the usual practice of the Committee of Privileges to prepare and circulate the outline and substance of the Committee's majority report prior to the subject of the Committee's inquiry completing his or her evidence? In reaching a position on this point, Mr Speaker, you and honourable members might like to consider the consequences for the principle for a fair hearing and natural justice if such a practice were to occur in our court system. Thankfully, it does not occur here-only in places like Romania would such practice be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> My last point is, given the very serious matters raised in the dissenting reports and the points I have just raised, I ask you, Mr Speaker, and all honourable members: Do you sincerely believe I was accorded natural justice?</PARA>
<PARA> At the completion of my grievance speech on 23 November I sought, and was granted, leave to table the statutory declaration from which I read. At the time of tabling no point of order was taken against me. Furthermore, no point of order was taken, or other objection made, during my speech or the tabling of the document, by the Minister in charge of the House at the time or, for that matter, by any other member present. In addition, the Deputy Speaker in the Chair at the time could have examined the document and ruled on whether it could be tabled. However, the Deputy Speaker did not prevent me tabling the document. Therefore, saying that I created difficulties for the Chair is not an argument that can be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the gross misrepresentation of what I said on 23 November 1989 by the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories. Mr Speaker, I seek your advice on this matter: Were the gross misrepresentations of my speech by the Minister for the Arts a breach of privilege? Finally, the Committee of Privileges has said that it does not have the capacity to conduct an authoritative investigation into the allegation and I wish to inform the House that, as a result, I will be handing in a notice of motion that will address the issue of the activities of the Yugoslav secret service in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is probably no more difficult role for any member of this House-or of any house of parliament-than to sit upon a Committee of Privileges. Although such committees, fortunately, meet rarely they are entrusted with very difficult tasks. In this particular case the Committee had to face the difficult task of judging one of its colleagues, affording him the benefit of the doubt and trying to fulfil the obligations which the House, by a deliberative vote, had referred to it. It is a matter of deep regret for me that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) chose, when describing the activities of the Committee, to use the term `Star Chamber'. In my view that was not merely jaundiced, but essentially an intemperate exercise in legal obfuscation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us go to the issues of the day. Let us see how these matters arose, and what the matters are which the House now has to determine. I find it strange, and indeed difficult to comprehend, that the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred) now says that I have not only misrepresented, but obviously grievously misrepresented, his allegations in the House concerning the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). Let us look at the statements made by the honourable member for Bruce to see whether one could reasonably deduce that I, either innocently or deliberately, misrepresented his position. At page 2805 of Hansard the honourable gentleman speaks of the activities of the Yugoslav secret service in Melbourne. He says he will quote from an affidavit, and states:</PARA>
<PARA>I have interviewed both--</PARA>
<PARA>-there is then a reference to the person who had sworn the affidavit-</PARA>
<PARA>and his informant at length about the contents of the document that I am about to read. </PARA>
<PARA>One should weigh that statement heavily. This is not a statement by an honourable member saying, `Look, I have found an affidavit, it fell off a truck, and I am not certain whether it is true or false. Nevertheless, as a matter of public interest I feel I ought to read it out.' We were assured by the honourable gentleman that he had spoken to both the informants, and he was satisfied of their veracity. He referred to the person who swore the affidavit as `a prominent and respected identity in the Melbourne Croatian community'. So one is entitled to ask: Does the honourable member for Bruce adopt the statements as being true or false? If they are false he should not have adopted them. But he proceeded to read them out. What does the affidavit say? It says that the activities of the SDB-the Yugoslav secret service-are apparent, and talks of people living in fear of physical violence and, indeed, death. The allegation is that a certain official of the Yugoslav embassy was an agent of the Yugoslav secret service. Then, at the very last moment-at the point at which the honourable gentleman resumed his seat-he made the specific allegation that the person who was connected with that Yugoslav agent was the honourable member for Hotham. </PARA>
<PARA> I was the duty Minister during the early part of the honourable member's speech, when he was making allegations about some Yugoslav organisations, and I then left the House. I believe that what then occurred, when there were difficulties for the Chair, was because of the change of Ministers on duty. The honourable member had not reached this part of his speech-he says he tabled the document yet he had already read it out and the damage had been done. It has been suggested, and properly so, that there are ample precedents where the House or the Chair may be in error by virtue of a set of circumstances that occurs in the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, it is open to the House to correct such errors. Approximately 2 1/2 hours later, when I raised the nature of the allegations made by the honourable gentleman-and I repeat the basis of the head of privilege under which I raised it-I said that if they were true the honourable member for Hotham could not adequately and properly discharge his duties as a member of this House. That is clearly a head of privilege, and that argument was accepted unanimously by the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I misrepresented the honourable member for Bruce why did he not rise, on that occasion, to say that I had misrepresented him, a mistake was being made and he had never intended to suggest what was implied? I made it quite clear he was clearly indicating that, in his view, the honourable member for Hotham was involved in activities with the Yugoslav secret police. The honourable member for Bruce spoke in the House, but did he rise to say that I had misrepresented his position? Not a bit of it. If one looks at Hansard one will see that he rose in order to see whether he could lodge another affidavit. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal now with the proceedings of the Committee and the intemperate statement that somehow it acted as a Star Chamber. I believe the majority of the members of this Committee who wrote this report gave it a great deal of time-probably a great deal more time than it deserved, having regard to the general attitude that the honourable member for Bruce adopted towards the members of the Committee. If honourable members examine the transcript they will see-they might not be aware of it-that the Committee decided, as it was open to it to do, as a matter of discretion, and not because it was a right of the honourable member for Bruce, that if he wanted the assistance of his legally trained colleague, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), it would be available to him. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we now saying that we must adopt the processes of our courts? The honourable member is very keen on the processes as they occur in our courts. I have spent approximately 17 years in various courts in this land, and I have never seen a process where, when someone is asked, as the Committee asked the honourable member for Bruce, `How long have you been a member of this House?', there is wink, wink, nod, nod, a conversation with his legal adviser and, after approximately 30 seconds or three-quarters of a minute the person proceeds to tell us. The honourable member was asked a fairly simple question. I would have thought any honourable member would have given a candid response to his parliamentary colleagues who were trying to resolve the matter. When one says to him, `Do you understand the Standing Orders?', it is wink, wink, nod, nod. There is more consultation and, after about another 30 seconds, the answer is `Yes'. Then when one asks the honourable member-and it is absolutely germane-`What was your intention when you came in with this affidavit? Did you intend to damage the honourable member for Hotham?', we could have got a candid yes or no but it was wink, wink, nod, nod. The answer then comes: `No'. Then when one says, `What did you intend to do?', one gets wink, wink, nod, nod. There is a much longer period of consultation and the answer then is: `I don't believe I should answer that question'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though this Committee did not give the honourable gentleman every opportunity. It is not just the honourable gentleman on trial here today. He is not on trial; he is being asked to comply with the Standing Orders. He is being asked if he will behave with some sort of honour in terms of this Parliament and this institution. It is this institution that is on trial. Members of the Opposition as much as members of the Government are on trial. People who want to support the honourable member for Bruce in his suggestion that somehow he has been grievously misunderstood and badly treated, that he did not really intend to say all these things, must first ask themselves, as intelligent politicians-and there are a few of them in this chamber-whether it was an accident that on the very same day, in a matter of hours, his parliamentary colleague from Victoria, Senator Short, made precisely the same allegation in the other place and could not proceed with it because it was contrary to the Standing Orders of the Senate. Honourable members should look at the Senate debate and the attempt that was made there. We are invited to believe that that was somehow a political coincidence. </PARA>
<PARA> In case we should have misjudged the honourable member by not giving him an opportunity, it was suggested to members of the Committee-there are not many secrets in this parliamentary institution-that members of the press gallery had been informed, prior to this honourable gentleman making his speech, that they ought to be present because he was really going to give the treatment to the honourable member for Hotham. Is that a fact or not? It goes to the question of intent. If it was never his intent to do damage to the honourable member for Hotham it could not possibly be true that he would approach a member of the press gallery to suggest that he would, to use the term of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar), drop a bucket. What more can one do to try to establish the innocence or otherwise of this honourable gentleman. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is put very simply and directly at page 50 of the transcript. I put the question on the basis that the answer might be to the honourable member's benefit. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be to your benefit, would it not, if it were totally untrue that you had approached a member of the press, or members of the press, prior to making your speech to inform them that you were going to attack the member for Hotham. Would it not be to your benefit, if that were totally untrue to deny it here and now?</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members opposite that if in fact it was totally untrue, and was just one of the rumours that run around this place, would it not have been of advantage to the honourable member to say, `There is not a skerrick of truth in it'? But have a look at the honourable gentleman's answer. He was not prepared to deny on oath the veracity of that allegation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the conclusion that was reached and I condemn the statement of the honourable member for Menzies that a member of the Committee had drafted a resolution virtually to prejudge the matter. He forgot to say that the person who drafted that resolution was not a member or a supporter of the Government; he was one of the most highly respected members of this House and the candidate of the Opposition for the position of Deputy Chairman of this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a House of parliament, not a court of law. Over the last hour we have heard attacks on the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) and the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Aldred). I suggest to all of those participating in this debate that this is not the function of this House. Issues that reflect against the integrity of an individual cannot be resolved by this House. If they are resolved here, they will be resolved on a political basis. I suggest, therefore, that the first thing we need to do is set aside some of the hypocrisy and pomposity we have just heard from the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) and address the question of what are the significant powers and responsibilities of the Parliament when it comes to a matter of privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find myself totally opposed to the report of the Privileges Committee in this matter. I am opposed on three bases. The first is that I believe that this finding, were it to be agreed to, could relate to the Speaker of the House or a person who acts on his behalf. If it were to be accepted by this House, it would be almost a reflection against the Chair in that the Chair has not acted in the way provided for under the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> As my friend and colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) said, the nature of the findings is that the honourable member for Bruce has in fact abused the forms of the House. The custodian of the forms of the House is you, Mr Speaker. If the Committee has found that there has been a breach of the forms of the House, it is saying that you are derelict in your duty. The Committee has said there was no breach of privilege. What it is doing is saying that you are not fulfilling your responsibility, that it is you who is at fault and not the Parliament itself. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The third concern I have relates to this reference. In the first paragraph of the report we see that the motion for the reference was passed on 23 November in this place. What we should have done at that stage, as I said when I raised a point of order at the time, was to allow you, Mr Speaker, to consider the matter rather than rush straight into the motion. Had we done so you might have come out with a report that we would now be considering. Had you done so that would have been on a different basis altogether. It concerns me that what has happened instead, as has been properly identified in the two dissenting reports, is that the Committee has been called on to examine matters which, while in your hands, Mr Speaker, are matters that I can well understand might cause concern, and are matters that have been distorted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the findings themselves, I also have problems with the way they have been reached. I find that the nature of the abuse of the forms of the House seems to be that there has been a statutory declaration tabled. I am not too sure whether statutory declarations have any great consequence, although they are attested. The people who make them normally accept the consequences of not only having put their names to a statutory declaration but also having their names attested, sometimes by a Justice of the Peace and sometimes by some authority or other. What we are really saying-I think my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay was suggesting this-is that apparently statutory declarations, in some way, should not be used, and certainly should not be used in this place. If they are used they can be used only if they are tabled by consent. We know that one has to seek leave and we know that in this instance the Minister who was at the table at the time gave leave. It concerns me that apparently his action in giving leave has not been considered by the Committee of Privileges. </PARA>
<PARA> If somebody has abused the forms of the House then the person who is standing in place of the Prime Minister at any time, the Minister in charge of the House, is the person who should care for the Government's interests. In this instance, while it was possible for him to disagree he did not do so. I disagree with the honourable member for Bruce in suggesting that the Deputy Speaker could have looked at the document. It is not for the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker to determine whether there is something in the statutory declaration, at least in the first instance, against the forms of the House until it is read. When it is read he has a capacity to identify it. In the normal course of events, once somebody in the Parliament seeks to table something it is up to the Minister in charge of the House at the time to determine whether it is acceptable. When it is read it is then the responsibility of the Speaker. My concern is very much that within the nature of the proceedings of this place action should have been taken at the time. It is not peculiarly the honourable member for Bruce who has transcended the Standing Orders of this place, it is the Minister, and we should query whether in the Committee's findings there has not been a reflection on the person sitting in the Speaker's chair who, when the matters were read, did not identify the factors requiring a substantive motion. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke prior to the motion being moved in the Parliament I said, as I do again now, that privilege is a very important function of this House. It concerns me that in accepting the findings-there is no doubt on the basis of the Government's endorsement of this report that it will-this House will give the Committee of Privileges powers that certainly were not thought to be the powers of the Committee of Privileges when the matter was debated and the parliamentary privileges legislation was passed through this House. As I recall it, there was quite a significant debate in this House. The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 codified our requirements as to how privilege should be debated and how the Committee should be concerned. I suspect that the nature of this finding, which will go on record, will extend the power of the Privileges Committee in a way that I do not think the Act itself envisaged, nor do I think it is in the best interests of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that we understand that as far as the findings of the report are concerned there have been very serious allegations made about some aspects relating to the Committee's deliberations. As I am not a member of the Committee I cannot speak to them, but I certainly express my concern that, in the dissenting report of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), paragraph (h) seems to raise very serious matters as to the conduct of the affairs of the Committee of Privileges. It seems to me that this again reiterates the fact that if there is to be a reference on privilege it must be done very seriously and after proper consideration. I suggest it would have been far better had the conclusions that are now presented to us come from the Speaker rather than the Committee, certainly in circumstances where the deliberations of the Committee are in question. </PARA>
<PARA> I find quite remarkable some of the contributions we have had today-for example, from the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland)-attacking the honourable member for Bruce. I do not believe this is a forum where the honourable member for Bruce is under attack for his views in the past. The findings of the report relate to his abuse of the forms of the House. We heard from the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories how it was all a matter of intent. Once we get down to a matter of intent I suggest that we are really getting down to the legal processes. Because this is not a place where the legal processes should be pursued, I suggest that that was all irrelevant. Indeed, I thought for a while that the Minister had got a bit locked up in reading Enid Blyton to his children, with his wink wink, nod nod, and all that went with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of this report which I want to address for a moment concerns the penalty. I suppose of all the findings of this place, the Parliament of Australia, the one that had as much notoriety as any other was the conclusion reached against Browne and Fitzpatrick so long ago. I do not want this deliberation today to finish in the same order. It might well be that the honourable member for Bruce should be reprimanded; it might well be that the conclusion in the last part of paragraph (c) of the Committee's report, which recommends that the honourable member apologise, is the appropriate course; but that is not really what we are talking about now. We are talking about a suspension for two days. I find it quite incredible that this non-legal forum is finding itself in a position where arbitrarily, at the whim of the Government, we are to have a penalty imposed on one of our members and not after proper consideration. How did we reach two days? Why was it not 20 days or 20 months? There are all sorts of prejudices that I know would emerge about other members of this place and for how long people should be suspended. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the nature of the penalty and the recommendations of the Committee reflect to the discredit of this House. I do not see that we are capable of deciding that it is an appropriate penalty, that a two-day suspension is a proper conclusion to the honourable member failing to apologise. I find that totally unrelated to the nature of the alleged crime. Sure, there has been an abuse of the forms of the House but, as I have suggested, the Minister at the table was party to that. I suggest, with due respect, Mr Speaker, that in the findings of the Committee there is an implication that the Chair itself in some way might have been involved. How can it be that one of those three participants, the honourable member himself, is to be suspended for two days and everybody else gets off scot-free?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McEwen was referring a while ago to the publicity accorded this matter in the Melbourne news- papers. As I recall it, the publicity was really for the statement of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories rather than for the honourable member for Bruce. If we are going to start looking at who said what and who is reported where, the Minister for the Arts is culpable, for it was his comments as much as any others that were reported in the media. Let us be honest with ourselves. We are talking of a two-day suspension. What is the basis for coming to this sort of penalty? We are really having ourselves on, with all this false piety and sudden judicial merit in being able to determine that somebody has been nasty and said terrible things to somebody. For goodness sake, this is a political forum. We are in the rundown to an election and the Australian Labor Party is going to be defeated. We are going to say horrific things about each other in the next few months. We all know that. Let us not carry on and believe that somehow, because we are in government, we know that this man is a terrible fellow, we do not agree with all those things he said, and we are going to give him a two-day suspension. </PARA>
<PARA> This is arrant nonsense. It brings this Parliament into disrepute. That is the reason why, when the matter was first canvassed, I raised a point of order and suggested that it would be a very good idea if the Speaker considered the issue. Privilege is not something that should be just cast lightly aside. It is not a matter where we are or can be in a position to judge right or wrong. I make no judgment whatsoever about the individual attitudes of members of this place on a whole range of issues on which I have very strong views contrary to theirs. We are all the same. But here we are not only coming to the conclusion that Standing Orders have not been followed; we are going to suspend one-and only one-of the parties responsible for two days from this place because of it. </PARA>
<PARA> It really reflects against this House when we come to a conclusion that is a non sequitur, that shows that although we purport to be a house of law, somehow we will reach a judgment beyond our capacity. I do not find that the punishment fits the crime. Were Gilbert and Sullivan alive, I am sure they would make a tremendous musical opera of the whole jolly scene. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3385" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latest information available to the Government suggest that hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of Romanians were killed at the weekend following the violent suppression of demonstrations in Timisoara. The regime's tanks on Monday mowed down a group protesting in Timisoara against the Government's refusal to allow them to bury those killed earlier. According to reports, tanks ploughed through the demonstrators, rolling over the living and the dead and splashing their blood on nearby buildings. As a result of this horror, between 50,000 and 100,000 people took to the town streets again yesterday. Further demonstrations have since taken place throughout the country and have spread beyond ethnic Hungarian areas. In the past few hours troops have been pulled out of Timisoara, but major cities remain encircled by tanks. Ceausescu has blamed recent events on `international terrorism' and remains unrepentant, so the danger of further brutality and more deaths remains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are witnessing in Romania is ageing rulers trying to protect an outdated and undemocratic system by turning their tanks upon their own people. The bloody suppression of dissent and the slaughter of demonstrators may work for a time, but 1989s great lesson to the world has been that repression in the end cannot prevail against the innate and simple human desire to live a decent life in freedom. That is why the dissidents in Romania will finally win and it is why those who have murdered their own people will find no peace.</PARA>
<PARA> Australians join all the civilised world in condemning these atrocities. We have protested in the strongest terms to the Romanian authorities. We are consulting our friends in both east and west Europe and elsewhere to examine what other options might be available to register our outrage at these events. We are continuing to monitor events in Romania very closely. In conclusion, I am sure all members of this House and all Australians will join me in offering our profound sympathy to the relatives of those Romanians who have died as a result of their peaceful protests against a tyrannical regime and our admiration for those who are continuing to struggle.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Having noted the massive increase in the year 12 retention rate in Australian schools for some seven years now, I ask the Minister to report on the reasons for this phenomenon.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3386" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the chairperson of the Caucus committee which examines these matters of employment, education and training, the honourable member would be well aware of the spectacular improvements in retention rates in Australia since 1983. It is a matter which I have referred to before and it is a matter which the Prime Minister has referred to as well. We now know that we have achieved a figure of 61 per cent this year in terms of retention to year 12. The major reasons relate to the fact that more young Australians are keen to remain in the schooling system, recognising that it gives them the opportunity to get the best kind of employment once they have left school and also equips them fully to participate in society as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also worth looking at the particular contribution the Commonwealth has made over the last few years to the support of schools and school students. If we look at the funding of schools for all school programs, we find that in 1990 there will have been a 15.5 per cent real increase in what was provided before we came to office. In relation to government schools, the grants will be 26 per cent higher and in relation to non-government schools they are estimated to be 44.8 per cent higher in real terms. So that is very clear evidence of the additional funds that we are now providing to support both government and non-government schools in trying to provide higher quality education for a larger number of Australian students. In addition, there has been the major overhaul and expansion of Austudy. We now find that the number of students receiving Austudy has doubled between 1983 and 1989. Of course, that has come at a very great cost, because the cost of Austudy in total has gone up from $268m to $774m-a massive increased investment in young Australians in terms of their future.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only has there been an increase in the amount of money going to non-government schools, but as a result of the new schools policy which came in in 1986 we find that 189 new non-government schools have been established, 118 schools extended and 103 have had relocations approved by the new schools committee. The cost of these new schools operating at their maximum enrolment represents an increased cost of $81m in Federal contributions to non-government schools. This is all part of the context in which this Government has been able to support all schools. We have been able to settle the otherwise divisive state aid debate. We have provided security and certainty of funding for the non-government schools system, and that is a policy which we intend to support into the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the Commonwealth is concerned about equity and to provide equality of opportunity for all Australian kids, regardless of whether they go to government or non-government schools. We want to see more and more of them completing the full 12 years of schooling and then as many of them as possible continuing to some form of post-secondary education and training. This is not only good for the young people themselves in terms of providing a better future for them, but it is also very much in the interests of the country, as we need to have more modern skills and a greater degree of skills generally as we confront the changes going on in our economy, which changes, of course, will continue into the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Defence advise the House what support the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) provided to the Australian public during Operation Immune? What was the cost of the support, and will those costs be recovered?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3387" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since this Parliament last met, between the beginning of December and now, the Government, in consultation with the airlines, determined that a sufficient level of service had been reached for us to no longer need the excellent service that had been provided by the RAAF and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) under Operation Immune. Therefore, the Prime Minister was able to welcome home the last flight on 15 December and preside over the sending of the pilots and air crew and maintenance people to a well deserved Christmas holiday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I can speak on behalf of all the Government in thanking the RAAF and the RAN for the excellent services that they provided over those several months when they were in operation. Some 224,000 seats were provided-3,071 on its highest day. The RAAF and RAN carried 175,000 passengers. They serviced 17 locations, in particular maintaining air links between Tasmania and the mainland. Up to 300 RAAF and 32 Navy air crew were involved, and over 600 maintenance personnel. The RAAF squadrons concerned were 32nd, 33rd, 36th and 37th, the maintenance squadrons at East Sale and 486 Squadron, RAAF Richmond, and the RAN HC723 squadron. They provided a very effective service for our people in that period.</PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the public service the Australian Defence Force (ADF) was providing, the Government decided that the airlines would not be charged any of the ADF's fixed costs, such as salary, capital depreciation and overheads. The marginal costs of spares and contractor maintenance were largely dependent upon the hours flown by the aircraft involved. For this reason, actual marginal costs could not be determined with any precision until the end of the ADF assistance when hours flown were known. The difference between the ADF's actual marginal costs and cost recoveries from the airlines amounts to $816,884. Defence will be seeking supplementation for this amount in the 1989-90 additional Estimates review. One can see from those statistics that, very nearly, the costs of the operations of the aircraft were in fact obtained via the payments made by the airlines to the RAAF. As I said and foreshadowed in this House, when we knew the actual costs of the operation at the conclusion of the operation, we would be putting that additional amount to government and that, of course, will be raised with government next year.</PARA>
<PARA> By and large, the activities of the RAAF and the RAN have been welcomed in our community and well supported by our community. They have been provided with an opportunity to show what all of us involved in the defence forces one way or another have known for a very long time, and that is that the defence forces of this country provide a dedicated service to this country and can be relied upon in all circumstances where assistance is required to provide that assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to note that a number of members of the Opposition were able to find it within themselves to congratulate the RAAF in the final analysis, after the conclusion of those flights, on the work that it had done. But one cannot help commenting on one or two of these particular comments that an element of hypocrisy can be seen in what was said. For example, the Leader of the National Party issued those words of thanks to the RAAF when those flights concluded, but only a few weeks previously he was joining the late and totally unlamented then Premier of Queensland in taking on the RAAF for allegedly unsafe operations and calling into question in detail their professionalism. That is a standard that nobody on this side of the House could agree with, and if the statement of the Leader of the National Party represents in some shape or form a mea culpa for his efforts in that regard, we can only welcome that.</PARA>
<PARA> I think that our armed services have covered themselves with a degree of public regard over the last few months that should stand them in good stead for a very long time. Our people now know of the professionalism of our armed services and their capabilities, and we on this side of the House do thank them all very much for the tasks they have performed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. A deputy secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Michael Costello, has discussed our proposals in Hanoi, Beijing, and Phnom Penh, and with Prince Sihanouk and other interested parties in Bangkok, and he will discuss them tomorrow in Jakarta. This is not the time for me to give the House a detailed account of Mr Costello's discussions. I believe honourable members will understand the sensitivities involved in exploratory discussions of this sort. Also, the Government will want to take stock of the situation when Mr Costello returns and gives us a detailed report at the weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can say at this stage that we have been very encouraged by the interest that has been shown in our proposals by all the parties principal to the dispute and, of course, by those outside countries which have been involved over a period of time in a search for a settlement to the tragic situation in Cambodia. The interest that has been shown is certainly sufficient to encourage us to proceed with further consultations, and I expect Australian Ministers and officials to continue these discussions in the New Year.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Government has said before, it does not pretend to have all the answers to a Cambodia settlement. It would be absurd to make any such suggestion. We certainly do not expect a solution to this so far intractable conflict to be easily or quickly achieved, but we are in a position to say that the Government's latest initiative has opened up important new avenues for negotiations. As I have said, we will continue to pursue them. I can assure the honourable gentleman who asked this question-who, we all know, has a particular interest in these affairs-and I also assure all honourable members, that we will continue with these discussions, for as long as they seem useful, to try to find a workable end to the suffering which I think all Australians agree the Cambodia people have already endured for far too long.</PARA>

<PARA> It is a narrow economistic perspective and does not purport to represent welfare or quality of life.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Data shown here excludes the value of government provided services-the social wage.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important, when seeking to analyse a subject like the quality of life or living standards, to take a broader perspective. One does not simply look, as this paper does, to particular budgets and the results of budgets. For example, the April statement this year showed a remarkable improvement in terms of living standards as a result of tax cuts and wages. Nor does one simply look, as this paper does, at particular types of families such as the model family of a male breadwinner, a dependant spouse and two dependant children. Such a break-up represents only 9 per cent of Australian families. We have no argument with the paper in the sense that its author suggests the need to take a broad view rather than such a narrow, economistic perspective.</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that while the honourable member is making statements and assertions in this particular area he might, for example, refer to the work of Bradbury, Doyle and Whiteford, of the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. They point out that real household disposable income per capita has risen since 1983. They point out that the median income of all families has risen by about 5 per cent in real terms during that time. Also, they point out the very marked improvement in the incomes of sole parents, low income families and farming families, under the Labor Government. They point out that, allowing for a higher labour force participation by women, the real increase in median income for families is around 6.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has to deal with the difficulties of real families working hard to bring up their children. That is why we have delivered the largest increase in family allowance in this country's history. It is why we have implemented the family allowance supplement, providing increases in real disposable income for the lowest quartiles in terms of the Australian income-50 to 75 per cent-of around 20 per cent. That is why we have indexed the family allowance, the dependant spouse rebate and the sole parent rebate and entrenched our benchmarks for the family allowance supplement.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of social reform one will look to this period as the period in which the social wage has never played a more important role in the maintenance of real living standards. The indexation of those payments and tax allowances is a crucial element in those reforms, which is one of the reasons why one finds the Opposition-and certainly the honourable member for Wentworth and Senator Stone-staying very silent on the indexation of family allowances. I mention in passing, in conclusion, that Australian families understand Labor's commitment and recognise the importance of these payments.

As the Prime Minister has asserted that the advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board was that there were no reasons why the takeover of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd by News Ltd should not proceed, will he now release to the public-who are so obviously and vitally affected by the takeover-the advice that was given to the Government by the FIRB?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is no. The advice to the Government on all of these many takeovers that affect the public, obviously, is the Government's advice. I notice that the honourable member for Goldstein has been beating a drum about this matter now for the time that has elapsed since News Ltd took over the bulk of the Herald and Weekly Times newspapers. We now have a constant parroting of the statistic that News Ltd has 58 per cent or 56 per cent, from memory, of the print media interests of this country. But we never heard from the honourable gentleman when he was a Minister-or since-the statistic in relation to the Herald and Weekly Times group when it held 52 per cent or 54 per cent, from memory, of the print media in this country. Fifty-four per cent in the hands of the Herald and Weekly Times was, of course, not even worthy of mention but 56 per cent or 58 per cent in the hands of Murdoch is a national tragedy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was coming to that-plus television. Of course, in those days the Herald and Weekly Times had HSV7 in Melbourne and another television station in Adelaide plus a group of country radio stations and a stack of provincial newspapers, naturally with the capital city press. In terms of national concentration-and we have heard much about that-there is not now a print owner who owns any television. Television is divorced entirely from print and both are divorced from radio. But that was not the case when the Herald and Weekly Times ran the show for all those years. Of course, the Liberal Party of Australia was then the very happy and quiet recipient of the joy coming from the Herald and Weekly Times in Melbourne. The matter only became an issue when Rupert Murdoch had the temerity, in what was basically a transfer of assets from one company to another, to buy it but, in doing so, shed the television interests which were held by that group.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since then we have had all these people taking umbrage at the state of the media. The honourable member for Goldstein did nothing about the concentrations when he was the Minister and was silent about the matter. I interpose that the one that really makes me giggle is the former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, David Bowman, who is now talking about plurality of the media and a sensible and balanced media. He was the dreariest, most conservative right wing editor in the country when he ran the Sydney Morning Herald into the ground in those years. All of a sudden this conservative, boorish right wing ideologue decides he is now some sort of media libertarian arguing for a free, moderate and plural press. What a joke. That is all right for people who do not have any memory. In those days I used to run the New South Wales Labor Party and occasionally I used to talk to Mr Bowman about the state of the Sydney Morning Herald.

Given the fact that the West Australian is an important newspaper, particularly in the State of Western Australia-and Western Australia happens to be one of the Australian States, if those opposite have not noticed-the character of the 50-odd per cent in the hands of the Murdoch group is nothing like it was in the hands of the Herald and Weekly Times. The Liberal Party had a nice thing going for it for a couple of decades.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member laughs but finding $450m is no easy business. Finding $450m in terms of the Social Security portfolio would mean making some politically pretty tough decisions. If the Opposition said up-front that it wanted to take from the Social Security portfolio the $450m that it needs to find because of the abolition of the capital gains tax in order to look after its friends, the easiest place to look would be indexation itself. I am not talking just about the age pensions. The cost of indexation overall is of the order of $1,300m a year and the cost of indexation of age pensions would exceed $450m. The Opposition targeted indexation when it was in government. It had no concern and suspended indexation for a year. It could suspend it again, and at least for that year it would save $450m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, that is not the only way the Opposition could save $450m. Let me refer to some of the other areas that one could look at. The Opposition could, for example, dismember income support for people with disabilities. It could look at abolishing the sheltered employment allowance, the rehabilitation allowance, the mobility allowance or the child disability allowance. If that did not give enough savings, the Opposition could also throw in the double orphans pension and abolition of income support for people under the age of eighteen. By that kind of clustering it is possible to achieve very significant savings indeed. From time to time we have heard concern expressed by the Opposition about what might be saved in relation to sole parent pensions. Widows over the age of 50 were able to make significant savings when we moved to a qualifying age of 16. If one were simply trying to look after the $17m that is to be directed the way of John Elliott, then by denying over 4,000 widows any income at all one could simply fix up John Elliott alone; or one could deny 21,000 young Australians any income support.</PARA>

After all, the honourable member for Wentworth indicated that the savings he thought he might be able to make through the so-called Economic Action Plan were only the beginning of savings that would flow from the economic policies of the Opposition. The fact of the matter is that to save $450m requires laying open to question the security of the millions of people who in one way or another are dependent on the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We cannot avoid the question of indexation. That is why whenever the question of indexation is raised we get three or four different answers from the Opposition. Only the other day in the Senate Senator Chaney made it clear that his position on indexation was right across the board, absolutely rock solid, even given commitments made by the Government that were not legislated. That is a very different position from that put forward by the honourable member for Wentworth. The reason the Opposition is obfuscating and is not prepared to come out and indicate where its savings are is that those savings affect people in sensitive interest groups.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had drawn to my attention the rather extraordinary statement made by the Leader of the Opposition about his problem of costings. It seems to me to be the latest in a long series of excuses as to why the most awaited health policy in this country's history is still not before us. I point out that those figures that relate to the Government's costings appear in the Budget Papers. They appear in my Department's explanatory notes. They appear in the departmental annual report and in the annual report of the Health Insurance Commission (HIC). If we put all of those documents together-it does require a little work-we can be very clear about the costing of the Government's Medicare program. It is extraordinarily open. Not only has the Opposition that resource, but quite constantly departmental and HIC officers appear before the Senate Estimates committees, where they have regularly answered questions about the costing of the Medicare program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that, despite the claim by the Leader of the Opposition that the Government's refusal to assist with costings is delaying his scheme somewhat, the Opposition has certainly never approached us for any costings. We would be extremely willing to comply. I know that the statement of the Leader of the Opposition, as usual, is open to several interpretations, but certainly I can say that nobody from the Opposition side has approached the Government for help in relation to costings. We would be prepared to help the Opposition. Clearly it needs help and we would be quite eager to supply it. When all that is put together all one can say is that either the statement of the Leader of the Opposition means that he has not read the Budget and has not read those papers or he is providing simply another excuse for the non-release of this policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has already had five health shadow spokesmen and six health policies. We have been waiting for its seventh health policy for some 18 months. We have had the good news that it is likely to be released in February or March, though I have to say that the honourable member for Tangney, the shadow spokesman for health, did cast some doubt on that when he told the West Australian newspaper on 21 November: `My own view is that it will be released before the next election campaign'. Though we are given this promise of February or March, there is a remaining sense of uncertainty in the statement made by the shadow spokesman.</PARA>
<PARA> It is becoming very clear to the Australian people that the real reason that the policy has not been released is that there is significant division within the Opposition ranks over the health policy between the economic rationalists, who know that one cannot sell a soft policy, and the wet shadow Minister for health, who wants that kind of policy.</PARA>

<PARA> The basic reason that this policy has great problems in being released is that it is obvious to the Australian public that if the ideas leaked by the shadow Minister were to be carried through, lower and middle income earners would pay more, even if it is possible, as it may well be possible, to reduce some of the costs to the better off. It is exactly the same policy as that of the capital gains tax. It will have exactly the same effects-an opposite form of redistribution; that is, easing the burden on some of the better off and increasing the burden on the middle income earners and less well off in our community. All I can say in response to that is that I am perfectly willing to provide all of those documents to the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow health Minister. To facilitate their task I am even prepared to mark in red all the immediately relevant pieces.</PARA>

<PARA>3.26 Deadlines for payment of the charge varied from institution to institution, ranging from late January to mid-May. 37 of the institutions which have replied to the Commission's letter to date-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, at the date of publication of this report payment of the charge was a precondition of formal enrolment. It then goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>3.27 The legislation provides that each institution will determine the date by which a student shall be formally enrolled. This acknowledges the variation in enrolment dates and procedures in various institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state in relation to refund arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA>3.28 Almost all institutions indicated that they had made provision for refunds, although under strict guidelines. Most would only refund if the student withdrew before the deadline for payment or commencement of the semester, while some stated that they would only refund the charge if the student accepted a place at another institution.</PARA>
<PARA>The report confirms what I said, and that is that the matter of the particular arrangements for payment and the particular arrangements for refunds were matters for institutions. When students approached me as Minister seeking a refund, I referred them back to their institution because that is where the matter lay.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member referred to the circumstances of a particular student. I do not know of the circumstances of every student around Australia.

<PARA>I will substantiate with just one quotation the matter of public importance that we have put forward.

This person, this section and this institution are respected by all, save and except for the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), who came in here today and bagged it. Why? Let me read just one salient quotation from it. Referring to Australia's performance, in terms of living standards, the Statistics Group of the Legislative Research Service says the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Our performance in the mid and late 1980s has been especially poor for wage and salary earners-after-tax average weekly earnings in 1988-89-</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to listen to this-</PARA>
<PARA>bought less than they did at any time since 1973-74. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in seven years we have gone back 17 years. As I say, this document from which I have quoted was prepared by the most respected institution in the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have gone back 17 years to what we inherited in the Whitlam years. The Parliamentary Library's analysis on living standards indicates the effect of high interest rates, high taxes and high inflation. If we take a line through that to what our future will be under Labor, we see that our future will be bleak indeed. This Government is out of ideas; it is out of integrity; it is out of touch; and, unquestionably, it is out of time.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will soon be out of office, as the honourable member says. The reality is that, since this Government has come into office, it has quadrupled our net foreign debt to approximately $110 billion; it has raised the home loan interest rate to 17 per cent and above; and it has delivered a rate of inflation which has been stuck at about 8 per cent. It is the highest taxing government in postwar history and the research bears out just how it has crushed the living standards of Australian families. All this and more. When we ask honourable members opposite what their economic policies are for the future they only indicate more of the same. This overt reliance on monetary policy and high interest rates is in marked contrast to the coordinated program brought down by the Opposition in its Economic Action Plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to come back to living standards, which is the essence of the matter before us. Of course, much of it relates to the sorts of things that were touched upon by some Ministers in the Parliament today. The Minister for Social Security was talking about Labor's capital gains tax. Honourable members will recall that this was the tax that the Government was never going to introduce. Honourable members will recall the words, `There will be no capital gains tax'. An interesting journal-the United States Journal of Accountancy, published in December this year-has done a comparative chart on capital gains taxes around the world. The longest line, indicating the heaviest impost of any capital gains tax in the world, is attributed to none other than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government seeks to represent-and it vowed never to introduce the capital gains tax-our undertaking to abolish the capital gains tax as having some effect on the so-called social wage. Honourable members should have a look at the most recent figures that are available for the financial years 1987-88 and they will see who paid that capital gains tax under Labor. Did the wealthy pay this capital gains tax? Let me tell honourable members what the figures show, firstly, for individuals and, secondly, for companies that paid the capital gains tax. Eight-five per cent-a pretty high percentage-of the individuals who paid capital gains tax in 1987-88 earned less than $50,000 in income but, more to the point, nearly 70 per cent had an income of less than $35,000. Of the companies that paid capital gains tax, 87 per cent had a taxable income under $100,000 and 65 per cent of those companies earned less than $50,000. So the Government can tell the 750,000 small businesses why it wants to levy this impost on them. If it starts raining like hell under this Government's economic policies the working man, who has a small amount to invest, perhaps for a rainy day, will be forced to liquidate his assets and to pay the capital gains tax that this Government has imposed. Honourable members opposite know that small business is so under-capitalised that it is constantly forgoing much of its profit just to put it back into the business to keep going, in the case of many in the hope that at some point there will be a reasonable capital gain which will provide their reward for all the effort and the investment that they have put in. That is why we will abolish the capital gains tax. We will have a speculative gains tax instead of the levy that this Government has been imposing and continues to impose. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is why this Government has been forced to attack us on this issue of the capital gains tax. It has not been able to grapple with the other sorts of measures contained in the Opposition's tax and expenditure statement in its Economic Action Plan. I will be quite frank with honourable members. I think just about everyone on my side of the House would agree that, when we looked at many of the areas in which to cut back expenditure, we expected that day after day we would be belted about on some of those massive savings that we were making. We showed a fair amount of guts in approving in the Party room $2.7 billion in expenditure savings. We thought that honourable members opposite would be up each day attacking us. Do honourable members know why they have not? They cannot, because the overwhelming majority of Australian people realise what they will save on the unemployment relief scheme. We have said to Australians, `If you have the capacity to work you damn well ought to get out and work'. In the fair policies that we are pursuing we are seeking to be fair to all those people in the work force who are paying taxes to provide those sorts of payments. We have executed our duty compassionately by saying to those who cannot get a job after nine months, `There are special provisions for you and a training scheme will be attached to the unemployment relief plan'. Where have honourable members opposite been? They have not been in here day after day attacking us on that. They cannot, because they know we are right. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to listen to their hypocrisy on living standards and I do not want to hear the Minister for Social Security saying that, because the coalition is going to abolish the capital gains tax, the social wage will go down. Although he hates this report which has been produced by the Parliamentary Library he was unable to dispute the figures in the paper relating to living standards. Honourable members should remember, when they hear this waffle about a social wage that the Minister was going on with, that that social wage is paid for by the high taxes which are paid by the great bulk of Australians out in the work force-certain fundamental points that have to be remembered. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that we have been called back here but we have spent most of the morning discussing a travesty of justice and the way in which the Standing Committee on Privileges has operated. At the same time, the Government has come in here and talked about things such as the capital gains tax and the like. What is the reaction in the community to the way in which this Government is handling the economy? Let me just read from two foreign exchange polls which were carried out by the Business Review Weekly. In the Business Review Weekly published earlier this month there is an article about the forex poll that it does annually, which states:</PARA>

<PARA> With this year coming to a conclusion, I remind honourable members that I said to them that I felt there were five steps behind the policy paralysis of this Government. One was the politics of the big lie, the second was the politics of the quick fix, the third was the politics of the personal abuse, the fourth was the politics of hypocrisy and the fifth was the politics of confusion. We substantiate these with the following: firstly, the politics of the big lie-`There will be no capital gains tax'; `No child will live in poverty by 1990'; `Interest rates will fall'; and the classic of them all, `The pilots dispute is over'. That is the politics of the big lie. We have the politics of the quick fix: Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd; Coronation Hill; and the bank interest subsidy. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) comes in here and asks, `What will we do if we lose $400m?' I will tell the House what we will do. We will not have to pay Kodak. We will not have to pay compensation to the banks, and we will not have to do that deal on bank interest, for starters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is most interesting to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) make a cynical and transparent attempt to portray a veneer of concern for Australian families. It is extraordinary to hear him speak about disarray and confusion when we have in today's Australian the heading, `Coalition: Disarray on interest rates deepens'. Where do we stand; what is the Opposition's policy; who do we believe; and what is going to happen? The only people we can believe are our own people. It is also extraordinary to hear the Leader of the Opposition express concern for Australian families when he and the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), presided over a doubling of unemployment in 1982-83. What was their concern for the families of the 600,000 breadwinners who were thrown out of work?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition again today told us that people should go out and get jobs, that a coalition government would not pay them if they are unemployed. It is the same kind of treatment which he dealt out to the 600,000 families in 1982-83. Let me assure the Leader of the Opposition that those families have not forgotten that and they know that when he says he will cut off their benefits that is exactly what he will do. They also acknowledge that the work this Government has done in creating 1 1/2 million jobs means that they will not have to make that kind of decision. Those Australians and their families have been given dignity, the opportunity to work and, I might add, the opportunity to participate in the economic life of this country. That is what caring for families is about; that is what giving families part of the Australian way of life is about. It is not simply throwing them on the economic scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA> Life for families in Australia is also about having a home. After hearing the Leader of the Opposition speak today, we must ask: What about those thousands of Australian families who were denied the opportunity to build a house? In 1982-83 the number of houses built in Australia fell to a mere 105,000. We may also ask: How many families had to struggle to make ends meet when their teenage children were put on the unemployment heap? They were denied a start in life. They were denied the opportunity to remain at school until year 12 and so enter our expanded tertiary institutions. The kind of bleating we hear from the Leader of the Opposition is simply that-it has no substance. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we heard about the so-called Economic Action Plan, which describes absolutely and explicitly that a coalition government would use high interest rates as its chief economic weapon. We must ask: What will it do in order to ensure that Australian families will not be hurt? We know, of course, that they will be. The Economic Action Plan is decidedly anti-family. It cites all sorts of families. For a start, migrant families, unemployed families and Aboriginal families are not counted as families under the guise of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. In total contrast to this, the Government has consistently implemented pro-family policies. I have mentioned the 1 1/2 million new jobs that have given breadwinners an opportunity to provide for their families. We have halved the rate of teenage unemployment which has removed stress on families whose teenagers are not on the unemployment benefit but are participating in the educational and economic life of this country. They are entitled to a real chance in life. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the school retention rate has doubled from one-third to two-thirds is a very real demonstration of this Government's commitment to our young people. Increased family allowances have been indexed for the very first time in our history. We have also seen a landmark family allowance supplement which lifts children from poverty. Also, 930,000 homes have been constructed since March 1983-50 per cent more than previously. We have ensured that 150,000 families a year have the opportunity to own their own home. Indeed, home ownership has gone up from 71 to 73.4 per cent. We have also expanded the number of child-care places from 46,000 to 114,000, with a further 30,000 places promised. That is about treating families in total. That is about recognising the needs of all families in Australia, not simply the rich families. Small business and farmers have also benefited from these advances. In particular, the small business tax rate, which was a prohibitive 78c in the dollar, is now 47c in the dollar. We are always interested to hear the Opposition members speak about our high taxes because it was the Opposition, when in government, that had and maintained that very high 78c in the dollar tax. Surely, that is anti-small business. This Government has brought down those taxes to 47c in the dollar. That is what we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Commentators on the Economic Action Plan see it simply as a recipe for slow growth, weak investment, rising unemployment, falling real wages, high interest rates and an overvalued dollar. The Australian people, however, will not be misled. They recognise the Opposition parties for what they are, in the same way as they were recognised in the recent Queensland election. The Australian people understand exactly what the Opposition parties stand for. They have no capacity to deal with the issues of Australian families or to deal effectively with interest rates. It seems that all we hear from the Opposition are statements and scaremongering in an irresponsible way. </PARA>
<PARA> We see from our Government a new fair deal for all families which has been placed on record and is part of the process already. Tax cuts, brought in under the April statement and adjusted to make a more progressive delivery for families, mean that families now have a system of taxation which is acknowledged to be fair and to be just. The Australian Institute of Family Studies suggests that the package appears to redress the erosion of family incomes since 1976. The indexation of family benefits is an historically significant feature which will ensure that these payments will not be eroded in the future. The Institute's analysis indicates that 70 per cent of families will gain and are gaining more than $1,000 per annum under the current tax scales, as instituted under the April statement. Of course, 48 per cent of the cost of this package goes to the 30 per cent of households which have dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> This new fair deal for Australian families is implemented as part of an agreement between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions on wages and taxes. We hear the derision of the Opposition in terms of our ability to work within the wages accord. We also hear derision from the Opposition members in terms of the social wage. But let me assure them that very many of our Australian families understand exactly what is meant by the social wage. They know because they are living in the community and are enjoying the benefits of the social wage, which is not limited to those people who are or who hope to be rich and powerful in our community. The social wage is for all families in our community. While the Government's strategy has been to assist low income families, there is a whole series or range of programs which address all issues for all families. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to mention the historic Medicare. Without Medicare all members of Australian families would not have access to health care in our community. We see it as the right of all Australians to have proper health care. As we have heard the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) say on a number of occasions, Australians now recognise and value that program for what it is: a fair and just program of health for all Australians-one not just for people who can afford private health insurance and who have an ability to pay but one which provides quality medical services regardless of means. Let me assure the Opposition that any attempt to tamper with Medicare is striking right at the fabric of our Australian families and children. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also seen the housing industry revived so that housing is now at a record level. We have talked about child-care and the way in which child care places have been created so that people who are working have quality, affordable child-care. We have also created opportunities for the excluded and disadvantaged. Figures show that we have doubled the school retention rate, which means that very many of those people who were our poorest and most disadvantaged are now part of the system. Only recently I was at a graduation as part of a program which acknowledged those people who were disadvantaged and which gave them the benefit of 12 months study at a higher education institution to enable them to move in to the tertiary sector, which is the right of every Australian, not simply the right of those people who happen to have money. </PARA>
<PARA> The days of the Opposition members believing that they are born to rule are well and truly gone. At the heart of this Economic Action Plan is a return to the privilege of the 1950s, a return to the kind of society in which the rich had and the poor had nothing. Australia will not now or ever buy that kind of process. The Economic Action Plan and the bleatings we hear for families are known and recognised for what they are: a demand for a return to privilege. It is not happening and it will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Sole parents represent another group in our community whose needs have been addressed. Not only has the sole parent's benefit been indexed, but also there are a number of programs which have ensured that sole parents have an opportunity to get back into the work force through the provision of training, the provision of child-care and also now, the provision of child support. This is one of the most dramatic reforms within Australian society. We as a government have challenged the community to pay and to accept financial responsibility for those children with one parent. Surely it is not asking too much of the community at large to suggest and to acknowledge that we must accept financial responsibility for our own children. That is what child support has done and that has meant that a quarter of a million of our children are now receiving maintenance for the first time in their lives and at a level which is meaningful, which does not involve long and costly court cases and battles but is part of their right and their heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> A whole range of family allowances and family assistance packages have all been part of our program. In January next year we will see a further rise in indexation for the family allowance which will continue to be indexed. That indexation covers not just family allowance but also the mothers guardians allowance, the child disability allowance, multiple birth payment and the double orphans pension. These benefits are part of this Government's total program in recognising the needs of a whole range of individual families. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as in terms of the tax measures and the reforms within the Australian Taxation Office whereby we have taken money and ensured that those people who were not previously paying tax are now paying tax, we have redistributed that money to families through the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and other benefits. That is what this Government is about in caring for families: it is a commitment which is pro-family, which ensures that all families in Australia are part of and share in the economic growth, vitality and development of this country as a right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me begin in a bipartisan spirit and congratulate the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) for the style of what will be her final address in this Parliament-not on the substance of that address, of course, but on the style. I felt sorry for Mary because she had to make a desperate attempt to defend the indefensible. The matter of public importance today states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Hawke Government's economic policy which is having a devastating effect on the living standards of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no way the honourable member could defend that, no matter how hard she tried. It is a despicable and grossly inadequate record of economic management over the last few years. I will not concentrate too much on that record. In the final Parliament of the 1980s we should focus on where we are going over the next five to 10 years or so. We really should have had a debate today on alternative visions for this country going into the 1990s and beyond the year 2000. As is so typical of this Government, those who ought to be here-the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-are nowhere to be seen. One has probably gone back to his holiday at Kirribilli House and the other is probably still studying Economics 1. There has been no contribution by the leaders of this Government about where they would like to see this country go in the course of the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia will have a very clear choice in the early part of next year between two quite different economies. On the one hand, we can continue down the path we have seen this Government follow towards what Rod Carnegie has described as becoming the white trash of Asia, or we can look forward to this country emerging as a major economic and political force in the Asia-Pacific region over the course of the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the run of the last two Labor governments it is disturbing to see that there is an important similarity in their attitude to economic policy and economic management. In both cases they developed what could be described only as a hand-out mentality. In the first period under Whitlam, thousands and thousands of people in this country were introduced to the welfare mentality-a concept where a person came along and put his hand out rather than determined what contribution he could or should make. People started to act as if the country owed them a living before they asked themselves the question, `What sort of living should I be making on behalf of this country?'. Under the Hawke Government we have had the internationalisation of that hand-out mentality. We have now taken the view that we should borrow, and borrow incessantly, to sustain our domestic lifestyle, to put our hand out in the international community and act like the world owes us a living before we ask ourselves the question, `What sort of weight should we be pulling in the international economy?'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that Labor governments traditionally have some similar features: they always end up in debt, they always end up with high interest rates, and they offer no way out of the mire-no hope, just more of the same. These days we observe the Treasurer and the Prime Minister wandering around this country in their own fictional world. It is a world where there are no economic problems. We do not have any debt problems; they are all private sector problems. The Treasurer goes as far as to say that it is a good thing that some of these entrepreneurs are getting into trouble because it will reduce our debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer think that they are living in a fictional world with no balance of payments problems-they will duck the one coming on Friday-and no inflation problems. We do not suffer from any lack of exports or lack of productivity. It does not matter that our credit rating has been downgraded twice in the last three years by both major international rating agencies. They say that we are not excessively exposed or vulnerable to the international economy. We are not subject to falling commodity prices, slowing world growth or a flight in the debt markets. There are no children living in poverty in Australia-we have a week to go before we can determine whether that commitment was met. Australia's chemists are just a greedy and stupid bunch; they have nothing to contribute to this country. The pilots dispute is over; it ended some weeks or months ago. The business community has no reason to complain. It has done very well under this Government, they say. And so they go on. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, under this Government interest rates are always about to fall. The fact that they have gone up so massively over the last 20 months or so gets buried in the argument that they are always about to fall. I am fascinated that in recent days the media have asked what will happen to interest rates under us. They forget to focus on the fact that it is this crowd that has put them up massively in recent months as an outright admission of total policy failure. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister are now running around the country trying to create the impression that if interest rates come down they have been successful, their policy is working. What arrant nonsense that is. Of course interest rates will come down because the level to which the Government has put them will stop this pace. This country will slow down dramatically in the course of the next few months and interest rates will come off; they will fall under the weight of a very significant slowing of activity and the possibility of a recession. What else is there to offer beyond that? What hope does the Government offer beyond that point? The answer is nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says, `We have to sedate the economy to slow demand and to get interest rates down'. Then what? What do we do next? How do we get the economy to pick up again without interest rates going back up? The Government has not solved any of the basic problems: the debt problem is still there, the balance of payments problem is still there, and the inflation problem is still there. There is this fiction going on around the place that the Government will get interest rates down and therefore its strategy is working. Nobody out there will believe that because everybody knows that the Government has no policy solution to keep them down and to keep them going down in a sustainable way over the course of the next several years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am fascinated that in recent days the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have both sought to mock me as I have suggested that there is a clear-cut alternative that would see this country emerge as a major economic and political force in the course of the next few years. We can do it: we can boost our production, our productivity and our exports. We can start to save more and build the right sort of country. It will take some decisions-decisions which the Government has consistently refused to take, principally because members of the Government have turned up to see Bill Kelty and he has said no in every single case. We will need to make decisions about smaller government. We will have to cut government expenditure and reduce government regulation of business. We will have to lower tax significantly, change the capital gains tax, and develop a simpler and flatter tax system. We have to have a system where fewer business enterprises will be run by government and many more business enterprises run by the private sector. We will have to have a policy of privatisation. The process of wage determination will have to be shifted from the smoky back rooms of Canberra at meetings between Kelty and Keating and others setting wage rates to where those negotiations can take place at the workplace level on an enterprise basis, where wages can move more in line with productivity rather than simply in response to the exercise of industrial muscle. </PARA>
<PARA> We can build a world where there will be much more stable and lower interest rates than has been a feature of this Government and we can have a world where there will be much more stable exchange rates, lower protection, lower input costs to business and, importantly, significant changes in the nature of our transportation, communications and other parts of our infrastructure that will give significantly lower costs in most of those areas. If we clean up the waterfront, we can get significantly lower waterfront costs. If we inject foreign competition into coastal shipping, we can get significantly lower shipping costs around the coastline of Australia. If we inject competition into the airline industry now, for example, and allow interlining, there will be significantly lower air fares. We could have significantly lower rail costs and more efficient road and rail systems, significantly lower telephone charges, and I could go on. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a different world. There is a world that will give this country a chance of emerging as a major economic and political force in the Asia-Pacific region by the end of the forthcoming decade, but it will require those decisions to be taken. It will be a world where there will be lower inflation, lower interest rates, lower tax, more sustainable growth and higher wages through higher productivity. The Prime Minister has said many times that it cannot be done. Look around the world. The story is that we have been the exception of the 1980s. For example, in the early 1980s the United States got much stronger growth, lower inflation, lower interest rates, and no increase-indeed a fall-in unemployment, and moved into the longest period of sustained growth in the post-war period. Everyone else has been working towards this different sort of world. This is the only country which has been out of step in the 1980s. It is not going to be in the 1990s because we are going to make sure that that is the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has raised a matter of public importance today which goes to the question of living standards. It seems to me that there are a number of components in this construct called living standards. For instance, wages are an important part of determining anyone's living standards; interest rates may at the same time impose a burden or cost on a family, but, of course, for those who save and invest high interest rates can be advantageous to an income; and there are those public goods and services and transfer payments that we on this side of the House call the social wage-Medicare, family allowance, family allowance supplement and so on. I do not think one can have an intelligent debate on living standards unless one canvasses all parts that make up the living standard-wages, interest rates and transfer payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pose one simple question to the Opposition: If wages are such a large component of Australians' living standards, why does the Opposition consistently argue before the Industrial Relations Commission that there should be no real wage increases amongst the work force? Why is it that for the last six years the Opposition has said at every national wage case, `Do not raise wages'? is the Opposition suggesting in that instance that wages have nothing to do with living standards? No, it is not; it argues before the Industrial Relations Commission that the real wages of Australian workers should be lowered-and, by implication, lowering real wages lowers living standards. So it is a nonsense to suggest that the Opposition has any prescription or, indeed, any desire to raise living standards, at least with regard to wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The same is true of interest rates. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) has got into all sorts of muddles recently by being unable to explain how he believes interest rates will vary in the life of the next government-and I will go into that point in a moment. The point is that the Opposition does not have a sufficient prescription to bring about a sustained fall in interest rates, which are currently a real burden especially on young families and home owners. We understand that. It is not a question of flicking a switch to bring interest rates down; it is how we manage to get them down. The Opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), described another world where all was wonderful. This is a serious debate, not something that is put up on a blackboard in a schoolroom to say, `Would you not like this shopping list of things-high wages, low interest rates, no industrial conflict?'. That is terrific, but the question is: How do we get it? We have already delivered most of it, but in the context of this country earning its living, we have to have a process to deliver these things.</PARA>
<PARA> The wages accord-that is, the agreement that the Government and trade unions have held for the last six to seven years-has delivered these sorts of things; we have delivered a trade-off. It is true that nominal wages have fallen behind inflation. There is no doubt in the world and no-one would suggest that that is not true. But what are the trade-offs? The trade-offs have been an enormous increase in the number of people with jobs. Studies suggest that today something like 300,000 Australian wage earners would not be in the work force if we did not have a social agreement between the trade union movement and the Labor Government that would hold down nominal wages-not massively reduce them, as the Opposition would wish, but hold them down to reasonable levels so that we might compete with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the outcomes of that prescription on our part has been 300,000 more jobs than would otherwise have been the case created in the last six years. Those 300,000 earners, main breadwinners, their partners and the children they support, perhaps one million Australians today, would be in much poorer circumstances had we not had an agreement with the trade union movement over the setting of nominal wages. That is one of the greatest outcomes of the accord. Of course, the accord brings to government a whole new instrument of government. If there were no agreement between the trade union movement and the Government, other measures would have to be relied upon in order to control the general level of wages and costs in this country, and those other measures are government expenditure or monetary policy-the cost of borrowing; interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> So if we do not have a wages accord which is able to deliver lower nominal wages and an extremely high level of job creation, what is the alternative? The alternative is that demand has to be cut back in the economy, in the current circumstances through only the public sector. It is pretty difficult to cut demand more severely than both the Opposition and the Government would wish, because one then has to go to the moneys that make up the substantial income of pensioners and low income families who receive income from family allowance and family allowance supplement. So we have to decide, do we not? It is not all win or all lose; it is not a zero sum. We have to decide: Do we keep as many people in work as possible and give them a reasonable income and a reasonable chance to get a house and educate their children; or should we simply throw a large swathe of people out of the work force, take the demand pressures off the economy and let the rest get on down the road? That is not fair. </PARA>
<PARA>We have been able to keep the highest proportion of people in work and at the same time look after those people who are either unemployed or beyond work-that is, have retired. So the people who are on pensions in this country are receiving, in historic terms, their highest real income ever, because we have been able to devote sufficient resources to the public sector to pay for those pensions and also to pay for the children's payments-the family allowance and family allowance supplement. So, in essence, we have reached a historic agreement that is able to deliver all round a better deal for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative is to suggest that we will screw a great deal more out of the work force-that is, we will only give wage rises according to increases in productivity that the work force can generate. That is good in theory, but it is very difficult, for instance, if in one factory workers are represented by six or seven different trade unions and may work on different machinery. If they are lucky enough to be assigned to a certain machine that increases the productivity and output of the factory, the deal is that some workers in the factory will be assigned higher real wages-in effect, because of the investment by the boss in a new machine-but not all can share in that. That is simply an unrealistic suggestion in the real world where workers are unionised according to their skills and where some workers in a factory can be paid for higher productivity and not others. We exist in the real world. We are attempting through this thing we call award restructuring, firstly, to recognise that workers of different skills do work together on the same factory floor and, secondly, to recognise the improvement in their skills and productivity, but not totally out of line, out of hand, with their fellow workers. </PARA>
<PARA> So we come to a situation where the airline pilots in this country saw themselves as being different and beyond all other workers in the same industry. There are 21 different unions in the airline industry, but only one wanted to be treated differently and wanted a 30 per cent increase in income with no productivity trade-offs. It is a nonsense. But they could have received, as did the Qantas pilots, a 12 per cent to 15 per cent increase in money income if they had stayed within a system which said, `We are prepared to award you for productivity increases provided that you can show the trade-offs in productivity and provided that you do not overstep the mark, so that other unions in the same industry can also seek to gain some of the productivity increases'. So, by and large, almost in a shuffling way, the accord can deliver to all workers in this country the ability to receive real increases in wages through productivity rises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments came into my hands only about an hour and a half ago, and we are taking things completely on trust. It appears to us that what has been put forward achieves the objectives of the amendments presented to the House in the earlier debate and also to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two things which have come to our notice from our reading of these amendments. We envisage that this will be a fresh procedure which has never before been adopted within the Australian Commonwealth Parliament. The system we had before was one of disallowable resolutions. In other words, motions could be put to this House and they had to be disallowed in full, not in part. We are now proposing to set the guidelines for the charter, the contract and the principles. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the amendments indicate that matters can be raised by way of notice of motion. In other words, if they are laid before the House for 15 days, a notice of motion can be given. I wonder whether there is sufficient provision in the Standing Orders for that. Within those 15 sitting days the Opposition can raise a notice of motion, and I wonder what the form might be. Also, if it is to be debated, particularly within the 15-day period, will precedence be given by the Parliament so that it is actually debated within the 15-day span? While the Minister may not have the answer now, I would be happy if he could give an indication on this before it goes to the Senate. I realise there is a need for action, and we do not intend to delay the matter at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments take over from the amendments we proposed. We went into our amendments in a great deal of detail, and we understood them to be constitutionally correct. I hope that the amendments we are debating now-and will be agreeing to-have the same constitutional effect as the earlier ones. This Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill has been dogged by a certain amount of rush, haste and cobbling together and, as I understand it, there might have been other aspects of it which the Minister wanted to amend himself. We want to be given the assurance that, while these amendments seem to follow our amendments very closely, they have not been given the same rush treatment in their preparation over the last 24 hours as the Bill had before its introduction. We are prepared to accept these amendments on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> We appreciate the efforts made by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples)-even though the amendments came a little late-in approving what are, basically, our amendments in an area in which there is a lot of concern outside this chamber. The initial press releases after the Senate debate caused a lot of concern amongst aged people. The Australian Democrats have been lobbied rather heavily for indicating we are not in favour of the basic thrust of this legislation. I now put on record that the Opposition has never opposed this Bill. We submitted the amendments on the basis that there would be full consultation with the industry and that they would be brought back before this chamber so that Parliament could eventually approve the contract, principles and charter. We are quite happy to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we would like an assurance that these are all the amendments the Government is proposing at this stage. I mention one other amendment which might be necessary. It appears that while the provisions in the Bill concerning community visitors apply to nursing homes, hostels are omitted. We thought it was the Government's intention to have those visitor provisions apply to hostels as well as nursing homes. We would like an assurance that there will be no further amendments at this time and that any future amendments deemed necessary will be the subject of plenty of consultation with the industry and the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, let me say that I appreciate the spirit in which the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has approached this stage of the legislation. While I cannot speak for the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), it is evident from the fact that the Government is committed to this Bill going through in this session that we have every intention of moving as rapidly as possible in terms of consultation which will be required, particularly during the parliamentary break, to ensure that, while respecting as much as possible the extensive need for further consultation with industry-both management and worker-as well as with the consumer, we can act as quickly as possible so the legislation is not delayed in any way, shape or form. That has been our intention all along. I think the processes of this House-and, I would hope, the Senate-would facilitate that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has no intention of proposing any further amendments to the Bill at this stage. I can assure the honourable member for Dawson that, should there be amendments to the Bill, there will be plenty of opportunity for them to be taken into account in the normal way. As far as community visitors are concerned, we are becoming involved in this new area of the aged care process. For that reason, the Government has decided to initiate and evaluate it in two States on a trial basis to make sure that we get it right. We want to make sure that any potential problems can be addressed on a relatively small scale rather than having to address them right across the nation. For that reason, there will be a pilot process in two States. That is one of the major reasons why the scheme has been restricted to the nursing home area at this stage. In future, subject to budget and other aspects of its operation, there will not necessarily be restriction on the operation of the community visitors scheme, subject to those conditions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise just one point in relation to the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), and that is the question of the new definition of the term `proprietor' of a pathology laboratory. On several occasions, both in this House and in the Senate, we have asked the Government for clarification on this matter. If the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) is not able to respond to me immediately, perhaps he could take my question on notice and drop me a short line this afternoon. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill argues that the corporate structure of some pathology laboratories currently makes it difficult to identify who is the operator of the service. This amendment is said to be intended to overcome this problem. However, in spite of this explanation, it is still not clear to the Opposition and the industry what the amendment can be expected to achieve. In cases where a laboratory is operated by a corporation or a number of equal partners, it is difficult to see how any one person can be made more responsible than another person for the operation of that laboratory. Therefore, I ask the Minister to explain precisely what the Government intends to achieve by this amendment and how it will deal with a situation in which a pathology laboratory is operated by equal partners or by a corporate identity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is pleased that the Government has accepted a considerable number of amendments which we believe improve legislation which we basically support-that is, setting up an omnibus-type general structure for research and development corporations for primary industry, in particular, the dairy industry and the grain industry. We are also pleased that the Government acknowledges that its attempted inclusion of the coal industry in a similar type of structure was not appropriate because, unlike the primary industries where there is a dollar for dollar industry and government contribution for research and development, there is no government allocation for coal. Therefore, the coal industry believes that it was completely inappropriate to have this type of structure forced upon it. I seek an acknowledgment from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) in respect of comments made in the Senate by the Minister for Resources (Senator Cook) on Tuesday, when the Bill was debated for the first time and, on Wednesday, when the committee stage debate took place. On the first occasion he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>However, what we are proposing-and what I now categorically state-is that these amendments be carried-</PARA>
<PARA>he means there, the amendments to include coal within the general structure-</PARA>
<PARA>If they are, we will not act on them until such time as we have had further consultations with the coal industry and obtained agreement that we should proceed with this corporation for the coal industry. I will say more of that later, but I can give that assurance to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>He did repeat that same assurance in even greater detail on the following day-that is, yesterday-when this came up in the committee stage. On that basis the Opposition would not want to continue with the amendments to delete the coal industry from these arrangements. If that assurance is given in good faith-I accept that it was given in good faith by the Minister on two occasions-the coal industry would be included only if it gave the indication. I think the Minister indicated that he would use the Coal Industry Association as the determining body for that inclusion and until such time as he obtained that approval then nothing would happen. That is an important point, in our view. It means we will not try to proceed with those amendments again. On that basis I believe that is a sensible attitude to have. If an industry really does not want to be included and if it does not have the requirement to be included because there is no government dollar for dollar money, then it should not be. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased that the Government has accepted the amendment to include the cooperative dairy companies in the dairy arrangement in a way whereby any contribution made by those diary companies is considered for the purposes of dollar for dollar money-the matching contribution between the industry and the Government-as if it were the contribution of the farmers. I think that is sensible because the cooperatives are owned by the diary farmers, who are the suppliers. If a company was not putting money forward for research that would be money available to be returned to the farmers. It does strengthen the overall coordinated approach to dairy industry research. There is a precedent with the horticultural corporation, where certain cooperative factories have been included for the same reason. I believe that is a sensible arrangement. I acknowledge that those dairy companies cannot have it both ways. They cannot have the 150 per cent deductability for provisions they make for research if the Government is taking their money into account for the matching grants from the general budgetary contributions. In the discussions I have had with the dairy industry there is the belief that it is better to have that incentive and to have an overall coordinated approach to dairy industry research. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other amendments have also been accepted. On some occasions the Government has used its own wording, and if that is the more appropriate wording the Opposition has no problem in relation to that. In all of them there is a positive attempt-I believe that has been accepted in good faith by the Government-to improve the accountability of the expenditure of that research money and plans for expenditure with the industries concerned. After all, they are the ones that have put forward half of the total research finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The discussions that took place over many hours following the passage of the legislation through this House-discussions between the Minister's office, my office, Senator Lewis's office, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Dairy Industry Council and the Grains Council-have ebbed and flowed as to what would be accepted and what would not. The overall result is positive. I commend the Government for accepting most of the amendments. I commend all those people who have been involved. In particular, I want to commend Senator Lewis and his office for the work they had to undertake on behalf of the Opposition in the presentation of this legislation and its debate in the Senate. </PARA>

I too want to pay a word of commendation to Senator Lewis and to the staff of the honourable member for Murray for the work that was done in ensuring that these amendments were presented to the Senate and adequately negotiated. The amendments currently being considered by the Committee largely, but not entirely, reflect what was sought by the Opposition when this legislation was first considered in this chamber.

<PARA> The amendments we have before us are largely the result of diligent work-I say that without any sense of self-congratulation because I cannot claim to have been directly involved, the Opposition spokesman, Senator Lewis and representatives of the dairy industry, the Grains Council and the National Farmers Federation. I am particularly concerned that agriculture ought to see in place adequate research and development facilities. I am very much aware that, of all the Australian export industries, it has been the agricultural industry that has pioneered efficiency in export production. If we look at the number of people currently employed in agriculture relative to the number of people who were employed and at the production of agricultural produce, then we see that the point I make is graphically illustrated. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer briefly to yesterday's Australian newspaper where on the front page Mr Paul Downie, a rural writer, referred to the fact that farmers in Australia are facing a bleak future with a predicted 33 per cent fall in the net value of rural production in this financial year. I think that in itself underscores the need for further diligent research and development funding and work by government and industry alike. I thank Senator Lewis for his work in ensuring that the amendments this chamber is now considering are amendments the Opposition can largely endorse. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Collection Act 1979 to enable payment of the overseas students charge to be made in two equal instalments each year from the beginning of the 1990 academic year. The charge is payable by overseas students enrolled in Australian Education institutions under the subsidised program to which the Act relates. The overseas students charge was expected to raise $51.449m in 1989-90 based on the full payment being made by 1 May 1990. With the second of the two instalments due for payment after 30 June 1990, revenue in 1989-90 is expected to be reduced by up to half. In addition, administrative costs associated with the collection of the charge may increase by up to $30,000. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition agrees to give the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill 1989 and the Overseas Students (Instalment Payments) Charge Bill 1989 speedy passage. Earlier in this session we debated a number of education Bills, including the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1989, which was passed by the House of Representatives. When this Bill was being debated in the Senate, Senator Baden Teague drew to the attention of the Senate the fact that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) had not met an undertaking that he had given 12 months earlier that students affected by this Bill be able to pay their fees in two instalments. The right to pay fees in education by instalment is one which is essentially available to all other students in whatever category that charge may be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter of extending the opportunity to overseas students of paying their fees in two equal instalments had previously been raised. Twelve months ago the Minister gave an undertaking to provide for that ability in legislation. However, it was overlooked or some other matter arose and Senator Teague subsequently pursued it with the Minister. Senator Teague, when debating this matter in the Senate, read some correspondence that he had had with the Minister. I refer in particular to a letter to Senator Teague from the Minister dated 7 December, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I undertook that payment by instalments would be introduced in 1990, when additional resources and new administrative and computer systems were expected to be available to deal with the considerable extra administrative burden that instalment payments will impose on my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> My Department has already arranged administratively for payment to be made in instalments by students whose payments were found to be in arrears because the OSC liability had only recently come to my Department's notice. Most of these students are temporary residents or their dependants. These students have been permitted to pay the arrears by instalments, but have been required to pay the OSC for a course taken in 1989 in one payment. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, it appears that only OSC liabilities in arrears can be paid by instalments under administrative arrangements. The Attorney-General's Department advises that, because of the particular wording of the relevant provisions in the OSC legislation, current OSC liabilities cannot be discharged by instalments. The legislation must therefore be amended if payment by instalments is to be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> By the time that advice was received, it was too late to have the appropriate legislative amendments drafted and passed by both Houses of Parliament in the 1989 Budget sittings. I therefore propose to have a Bill prepared for introduction to the Parliament in the Autumn sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>The undertaking of 12 months earlier was thereby going to be avoided. However, the Opposition was not satisfied with that. Whilst not denying the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill a second reading, it has been delayed in the Senate pending this legislation, which enables the Government's undertaking to be put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the two Bills. We are informed that two Bills are necessary for the following reasons. The payment by instalments means that the Commonwealth forgoes a little revenue and also extra administrative costs are incurred. So it is proposed that there be an extra charge levied for those who choose the route of paying by instalment. The Opposition is not opposing that charge being imposed. If the first instalment is not paid by the first payment date, the right to pay by instalment is forfeited. For the time being the Opposition accepts that arrangement but assumes that the Department of Employment, Education and Training will be sympathetic where there may be unusual or unavoidable delays-for example, in transfer of money from overseas to students, which might slightly delay a payment, provided a payment is made reasonably expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take the opportunity to extend a little further a concern that the Opposition has already expressed about payment of fees by overseas students. In the second reading debate on the original Bill on 1 November, the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), raised the question of payment of charges for primary school education. I want to put on the record here in the House that these charges to overseas students can cause considerable difficulties in a way that I do not think has been paid attention to. The Government ought to be paying some attention to this. In my electorate it has arisen for a very particular reason: Bond University is attracting quite a large number of postgraduate overseas students. That university is aiming to provide courses and training that are not available at other universities in Australia. Difficulties are being created and will be created not only in Bond University but also for many overseas postgraduate students, in particular. They tend to be older, married and have families. They come here on scholarships and on a very low income. The requirement to pay full school fees for their children is actually deterring a number of overseas students from undertaking post-graduate training in this country. I consider that to be extremely unfortunate. It may be that when diplomats are posted here the governments which those diplomats represent understand that the schooling of the children of those diplomats and the diplomatic staff will have to be paid for and what government is prepared to accept that as a cost in this country, as undoubtedly is the case in other countries. However, if it has this effect I think it should be given urgent attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The availability of education in Australia to people from overseas, particularly people from underdeveloped countries, is very important to those countries, to those students and to this country. Education and training made available in Australia, albeit with the payment of a fee, has generated a lot of goodwill for Australia and very valuable relationships with people, many of whom become key people when they return to their own countries. These students are now facing the prospect either of leaving their families behind for two years or more and being separated from their families while they are undertaking their overseas course, or of simply not coming at all because the cost, with the imposition of school fees, has become prohibitive for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The fees are high. They seek to recover the full cost of educating a school student, and they have added enormously to the cost for families. Not surprisingly, many people or organisations who provide scholarships for students from those countries to come here are not prepared to pay the very high cost that is entailed. It is a cost that they would not have taken into account when embarking on whatever policy they embarked upon in giving their scholarships. For example, it is quite common for postgraduate students from underdeveloped countries to be studying in Australia on scholarships provided by private enterprise in other countries. Of course, one of the great risks is that if those scholarships are to continue and the training is to continue to be undertaken here, those who provide the scholarships will deliberately avoid selecting students who have children of school age so that they avoid the difficulties that that could create. I urge the Government to think again about this policy of imposing school fees on overseas students, particularly where it involves the children of a student undertaking study at one of our institutions of learning. As I understand it, the imposition of the fees was fairly unexpected. Whilst it might have had some sort of announcement, certainly a number of people intending to come here have been caught by it because they were unaware that it would be imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to congratulate Senator Teague for the tenacity that he has shown in this matter. It has been largely through his considerable exertions that we have been able to reach a satisfactory conclusion of this matter for the overseas students affected this year. The Government is now in a position to keep a promise that it made some time ago to that effect. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Opposition supports, and indeed welcomes, the arrangements made under these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to be able to support the implementation of the legislation under discussion-the Overseas Students Charge Collection Amendment Bill 1989 and the Overseas Students (Instalment Payments) Charge Bill 1989. As has already been indicated, the purpose of the Bills is to amend the original Act to enable payment of the overseas student charge by two equal instalments each year from the beginning of 1990 and to provide for an instalment payment fee where an overseas student chooses to pay the OSC by instalment. I feel that this will alleviate the problems for students sometimes placed in uncomfortable circumstances and it will extend to overseas students the right to pay fees by instalments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In speaking to the legislation I want to put the topic in its social and ideological context. It is very easy to criticise various aspects of an individual program. In fact the original Bill attracted such criticism in a minor number of cases but, in the national sphere, it is most important that our comments are set in a comparative context and that we are cognisant of the human implications of our policies at home and abroad. The basis from which this Government views the overseas student program (OSP) is that it bears an important relationship to our vision of a multicultural Australia and to our policies on foreign aid for developing nations. In this context, while welcoming the valuable economic contribution the overseas student program is making to Australia, we also embrace, to at least as great an extent, the immense social, cultural and economic benefits flowing through, not only to overseas students but also to Australian students, Australian education institutions and the entire community. </PARA>
<PARA> Support for a program, no matter how great, should not be so unthinking as to become blind support. A government which takes no cognisance of changing social and economic situations and priorities is a bad government. The Hawke Government has taken note and it has introduced changes to ensure that this important program, against a backdrop of turning a domestic deficit into a domestic surplus, is both cost-effective and targeted to need. It is this aspect which some honourable members appear to overlook. This Government's changes to the subsidised student segment of the overseas student program do not denote reduced support for, or lack of compassion towards, overseas students in need; they denote that a long and thoughtful look at the guidelines has revealed that an equity and merit scheme, based on the educational promise and economic need of students from developing countries, would tap a deeper and broader area of need than that which is now being met by the program. For this reason the Government is now phasing out that segment of the program-effected by the amendment before the House today-and channelling that funding into another program which we believe will be more cost-effective and reach more people who really need it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is introducing the equity and merit scholarship scheme, which will commence in 1990. To understand the transition it is necessary to understand the structure of the overseas student program. The Federal Government's OSP comprises three major segments. One segment sponsors students from developing countries funded through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB). Another segment is the full fee segment where students actually study full time in Australia and meet the full cost of their education. This Federal Government responded to growing demand from overseas students for Australian education courses by introducing the full fee overseas student program in 1986. Foreign exchange earnings have been estimated at about $240m in 1988, with the possibility of growth to $500m in the near future. This means that Australia's education export industry is becoming one of the nation's biggest export earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The third segment, which we have also seen as most important, concerns subsidised students, the cost of whose educational place in Australia is shared by the Australian Government and the students. It is in this last area of subsidised students that the Government has made a major change. The last intake of subsidised students was in 1989-this year. In fact, the Government is phasing out the segment between 1990 and 1993 in order to channel that funding into the segment which helps students from developing countries funded through AIDAB. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make it clear today that the Government is not killing off the subsidised student program but, rather, it is exchanging it for something which we think is better. The equity and merit scholarship scheme for students from developing nations and a smaller scholarship scheme for overseas post-graduate research students from developing countries, will commence from 1990. All of the money recouped from the phase-out of the subsidised student segment of the OSP will be used for the equity and merit scholarship scheme. There will also be funding from the Government. So it is not a backdown; it is a buildup in a most important area. These scholarships will be targeted at priority countries, with individual country locations, which will provide tuition fees and, in most cases, travel expenses, living and other allowances. It is going to be administered by AIDAB as a major part of Australia's aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important initiative and one which, in promoting human resource development in relevant countries by focusing on individual need, with emphasis on awarding scholarships on the basis of individual merit, is getting the most of the tax dollar and is assisting those who really need it. That is what we, on this side of the House, are all about. I also note the concern of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) for the plight of women in developing countries and the situation in which they are placed. We will hold that in mind for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The third segment, that of subsidised students, is the basis of the Bill we are debating today. The Bill is offering options for subsidised students to pay their share of the cost of the educational place by instalments. The OSC was expected to raise $51.449m in 1989-90 based on the full payment being made by 1 May 1990. With the second of the two instalments due for payment after 30 June 1990, revenue in 1989-90 is expected to be reduced by half. The instalment payment rate arrangements for the OSC would result in a loss of public debt interest revenue of about $1m in 1990. The instalment fee will recoup the public debt interest forgone. Administrative costs associated with the collection of the charge may increase by up to $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important aspect of this Bill is clause 5 which provides for the payment of the charge to be made in two equal instalments. The right to pay by instalment is forfeited if the first instalment is not paid by the first payment date. I accept the honourable member for Moncrieff's support of that clause. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a certain amount of mythology attaching to the overseas student program. Quite a large amount of misinformation-or rather no information-has been circulating. I have heard questions such as `Who is the program really assisting?', `Are foreign students taking the places of Australian students?', `Are Australian taxpayers assisting overseas student to the detriment of Australians?' and `Should the Government be looking after our own backyard?'. I have also heard the question, `Are overseas students getting a raw deal?'. Certainly, such question should be answered. But interested members of the public should ensure that they have information on the program from the Department of Employment, Education and Training or from their local member so that when they speak it is from an informed base. The program is a major way in which a nation such as Australia can assist people of less fortunate societies through offering educational processes and training. The Government's overseas student program, in association with other grants and programs from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has partially fulfilled the need for skills training and education within developing nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only the Labor Government but also conservative governments have had an overseas student program which has made a valuable contribution to people within developing nations. But this is not all. Immense social, cultural and economic benefits have flowed through to Australian students and to the entire community. While Australia has recently strengthened its overseas student program, it has tapped into a burgeoning demand for educational services, courses and expertise. It is no secret that the Australian Government has been dealing in recent years with an economy which requires spending cuts in the short term in order to maintain economic viability in the long term. With this background, any reasonable, thoughtful government must look closely at expenditure on programs to see that they are meeting the desired need. In this context, the Government has looked at the OSP and has decided that within our financial constraints, and given our ideological commitments, it is important for us to make certain changes. I think these changes have been very practical. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been under this Government that a program, which needed tightening up in different areas, which needed channelling off to see that the money expended was meeting the real needs of overseas students and at the same time was recouping and tapping into a potential export industry in Australia, was developed. We certainly have broken new ground and I, as a government member, am very proud of the achievements of this Government. For instance, the introduction of a code of conduct for institutions made this program, and the expansions to it made by us, not only effective but also accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the Australian Education Council, a national code of conduct for the overseas marketing of Australian educational services has been introduced. This was done to safeguard the interest of overseas students and to maintain the sound reputation that Australian education services now have. A code of ethical practice has also been adopted by higher educational institutions. In August this year, the Government announced new entry criteria for overseas students wishing to undertake short English language courses in Australia. The new measures will help to ensure that overseas students comply with the terms and conditions of their visas and protect the reputation and viability of Australia's burgeoning education export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Another fine initiative is that of the Australian education centres. The Government has appointed a joint industry-government panel to consider proposals to set up and manage Australian education centres in a number of overseas locations. The centres, which will provide an identifiable Australian education presence in up to 10 countries in the region, are filling a very strong need. The centres will offer information, counselling and advisory services to overseas students. It is expected that the first centres will be in operation by early 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The effectiveness of programs for overseas students and the changes made by this Government are governed by the people affected. I was very pleased to see the report Exporting Australia's Tertiary Education Services, which comments on research carried out into the effects on students, institutions, and our society of the programs and, specifically, the extensions and improvements to educational services which have been made by this Government. I mentioned that tertiary services have become a major export industry. This report sets the base for further planning and policies regarding this export industry. The report attempts to provide some statistical evidence concerning the extent of economic benefits of the export of Australia's tertiary education services and an assessment of the impairments facing tertiary institutions and expanding such export activities. The report is based on an in-depth study of the tertiary industry and its purpose was to investigate the factors affecting the demand for and the supply of Australian educational services in overseas markets. The report gives some interesting answers to the questions asked and it gives them from a primary basis. For instance, the survey finds that the two most frequently cited reasons for overseas students choosing to study in Australia were the acceptance by Australian institutions and the comparatively low cost of studying and living in Australia. Most respondents stated that their decision to study here was correct. They were answering this question at the conclusion of their study course. Looking back, about half of the respondents claimed that the cost of living and studying here was about the same as or lower than the cost in other countries. On this basis they felt that they had done the right thing in coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey found that the average expenditure incurred by overseas students in 1987 was almost $10,000. Full fee paying students spent an average of nearly $14,000, while the average expenditure for full fee paying students enrolled in short courses was about $5,600. The facts speak for themselves. The changes made to this program by a government that is giving equal billing to cost effectiveness and to extending those educational skills, that training expertise which we most definitely have in Australia to the developing world, particularly in our region, have shown that the targeting is spot on and that Australian institutions and people from the developed nations will be advantaged by the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The new equity and merit scholarships are designed to strengthen the quality and delivery of educational aid to overseas students as well as improving the export competitiveness of Australian higher education institutions. Equity and merit scholarships will be awarded to higher education students from the countries in our region. Half of the scholarships will be awarded to women. Equity scholarships will be awarded to students in the country specific equity criteria; that is, to students who are disadvantaged in some way. Merit scholarships will be awarded on the basis of academic merit alone. As we look to the future of this scheme we are not merely extending to students now in Australia the ability to pay their sector of a subsidised program in instalments. We want to go further than that. This scheme will ease the situation over the next year or two of people who are now studying. For the future there will be an expansion which will mean that our neighbours-those who have the promise and those who have the need-will be up front in acceptance into our institutions. Doing that will also put into this country the benefits of having people from overseas and dollars in the form of a new export industry. </PARA>

<PARA> One observation that we should make about this modest contribution to Australia's balance of payments difficulties is that we have seen over the last seven years our gross external indebtedness, as a result of the Government's mismanagement of our economy, rise from about $30,000m to about $130,000m. We are selling less to the world than we are buying from the world. Later this week we will have another example of the economic difficulties in which Australia finds itself with the publication of the balance of payments figures for November. Our external indebtedness situation which has been growing apace under this Government-as I say, quadrupling during the period that the Government has been in office-has given us a very serious economic problem. Until this Government introduces policies that do something to overcome that difficulty, Australia will drift increasingly into a situation where more and more of its exports will be needed to pay the the interest and the capital repayments which fall due on our external debt. This situation is unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's external indebtedness as a percentage of its gross domestic product is one of the highest, if not the highest, in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. It is simply a situation that has to be faced up to if we are to regain our place as a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world. Endemic inflation is another problem in Australia that prevents us from being more externally competitive and more productive. The Government has to face up to all the problems that are associated with an inflation rate which on average is twice that of our major trading competitors and which now seems to be on the rise again rather than falling, as it should be in the current situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all know that the Government is trying to force a recession on Australia in order to slow down its imports. There are those around who would point to the fact that a fall in interest rates would mean that the Government's policies are working. In fact, any policy that has the deliberate objective of inducing a recession cannot be a policy that is working. Against that background, I think we see the the importance of making sure that we do something to boost our exports. To the extent that overseas students pay for their education in Australia, some contribution is being made. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills have been a long time coming. My colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has paid tribute to the work of Senator Baden Teague in the Senate on this matter. Senator Teague extracted an undertaking from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) 12 months ago to provide legislation for the ability to pay the overseas student charge in two instalments. The fact that this Bill has been a long time coming indicates that this Government is tired, inefficient, arrogant, lazy, out of touch--</PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The schedule of amendments passed proposes a total of 15 amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) as originally introduced into this chamber on 2 November 1989. The proposed changes retain the bulk of the existing scheme for granting commercial tariff concession orders as set out in Part 15a of the Customs Act 1901 whilst allowing for some reforms in areas such as the refusal of commercial tariff concession orders on national interest grounds and the granting of specified period concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, whilst opposing in the other chamber the amendments made to the Bill, is prepared to accept them on the grounds that certain other reforms in the commercial tariff concession scheme which the Bill proposed have been accepted and on the grounds that the other substantive elements of the Bill, notably the termination of manufacture inbond and the new requirement that imported spirits be packaged in licensed premises prior to entry for home consumption, for which there was no opposition, will therefore be able to be implemented. I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>That amendments Nos 2 and 3 be disagreed to, but that, in place thereof, the following amendment be made: Clause 3, page 3, at the end of proposed item 60 add the following sub-item:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) For the purposes of sub-item (1), the cardboard or paper in goods is to be taken to be recycled if, and only if, all the fibre in the cardboard or paper has previously been used, as fibre, in the manufacture of other goods.';''. </PARA>
<PARA>The object of the first and third amendments of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) made by the Senate was, first, to make clear that the proposed exemption for certain paper products applies to goods only if all the paper in the goods is wholly recycled paper and, second, to define what is meant by the term `recycled' in relation to recycled paper and cardboard. The second amendment made by the Senate was intended to extend the proposed exemption so that the use of recycled fibre, and not just recycled paper, would qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in now not accepting the second and third amendments made by the Senate, is not disagreeing with the principles behind those amendments. The amendment that the Government is now moving, to replace those two amendments, will re-express the Senate's amendments and, in so doing, and consistent with the definition of `recycled' in relation to recycled paper and cardboard accepted by the Senate, will extend that definition to fibre. This new definition specifies that for the purposes of the proposed exemption the recycled test will be satisfied only where all the fibre in the cardboard or paper has previously been used as fibre in the manufacture of other goods-for example, cotton lint from shirting material and hemp fibre from rope. I commend the proposed amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> (d) a video cassette player;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) a video cassette recorder;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) another electronic device prescribed by the regulations.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that the Sales Tax Laws (Computer Programs) Amendment Bill proposes the removal of sales tax on all computer programs other than those on microchips. The Bill, as introduced, would have resulted in sales tax continuing to apply to games and educational programs on microchips which were placed inside cartridges for use with basic personal computers, or games consoles such as the Atari video computer system and the Nintendo home entertainment system. However, in some cases the same program is also available on floppy disc, and the Government moved an amendment in the Senate to remove this distortion. The Senate agreed to that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the passing of the Senate amendment, the Government has received suggestions for improving it, and has had time to give it more detailed consideration. The amendment now put forward is a result of that consideration. The new amendment which I have just moved differs from that made by the Senate in a number of significant ways. Firstly, the nature of the programs which qualify for sales tax exemption has been extended to include those marketed as being exclusively for both educational and entertainment use. Secondly, a similar change has been made to the cartridges affected, extending the range of cartridges to those marketed as being exclusively for use with either a personal computer or an acceptable home electronic device. </PARA>
<PARA> The third significant change is to replace the term `visual display unit' with the description `a computer monitor or a television screen'. This will remove any uncertainty as to what is a visual display unit. It is possible that a television screen falls outside the current concept of a visual display unit, although the Government intended that such a screen should be included. On the other hand, the term `visual display unit' in the Bill could have resulted in any liquid crystal display or liquid electronic display, no matter how small or how limited its display capabilities, being classed as a visual display unit, contrary to the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA> The inclusion test in the Senate amendment could have opened up the exemptions sought to be granted to a wider range of devices than the Government intended. Therefore, a further change will ensure that the home electronic devices that include a computer monitor or television screen will be excluded from the range of acceptable devices. However, personal computers which include a screen will remain acceptable. Finally, the substituted amendment, in specifying what are unacceptable home electronic devices, includes articles that are a combination of a number of devices and that include one or more of the specified devices. This will reduce the frequency with which regulations may otherwise need to be made to extend the list of specified devices. I commend the amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is just another example of exactly what we talked about in relation to the other piece of sales tax legislation, that is, a capacity on the part of this Government to rush things into this Parliament before they have been thought through. In his own words, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) said that with the passage of more time the Government has come up with a better way of specifying the amendment. The mind boggles at how many more versions of the amendment the Government might have come up with had it taken a reasonable amount of time to consider it in the first place. I am fascinated at the way in which, in the drafting of this amendment, the Government is able to come up with what is not included under the heading of `home electronic devices'. Given the pace of technological development in this area, it will not be long before that list is an awful lot longer than from (a) to (e) as specified.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>I will take a few moments of the Committee's time because it is not often that the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), and I get the opportunity to talk about our portfolios here in this Parliament. However, it would be remiss of me not to repeat a couple of points concerning this legislation and the reasons why these amendments have been accepted by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>They were put by the government in the Senate at the specific request of the Northern Territory Government in line with the memorandum of agreement between the Federal Government in Canberra and the Northern Territory Government. The memorandum was signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Northern Territory Chief Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The acceptance of these amendments is an example of the desire of this Government, led by our Prime Minister, to facilitate and reach agreement with the Northern Territory Government on this legislation. The legislation deals with the provision of land for Aboriginal people, the most deprived people in this country. These people live in the most appalling conditions on pastoral properties, stock routes, excisions and reserves that, as a result of this legislation, will be handed over to them.</PARA>
<PARA> This is very historic legislation. Time precludes me from addressing some of the more outrageous comments that were made in the Senate but it would be remiss of me not to refer to one or two points. Firstly, I would like to place on record the cooperation that I have had in this whole exercise from officers of my Department and the Land Councils, who have worked tirelessly; officers of both governments in the discussions that followed the meeting of the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister and myself; and the shadow Minister at the table.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for one of his colleagues in the Senate, Senator Tambling. I have never before met a person who has the ability to distort the truth in the way in which Senator Tambling has during the course of this debate. I know he does not reflect the views of the overwhelming majority of those in his party. It goes without saying that his attempts to denigrate people who have worked very hard to try to reach settlement on this legislation are rejected by the overwhelming majority of members of both sides of the chamber. He has constantly misrepresented the Government's position and interfered in this whole area and he will be judged by the words that he has uttered out of his own mouth which are recorded in the Senate Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> I was going to address each and every one of his comments. However, I suggest to the Northern Territory Government that it could not have a worse advocate in this place than Senator Tambling. The people of the Northern Territory would do well to look at his performance. He has made many comments about this policy and Aboriginal affairs but I get more representations from members of the Opposition who represent areas that are not necessarily known for their numbers of Aboriginal constituents than I do from him. He seems to be interested less in the welfare of Aboriginal people than in point scoring against the Government or some well-known Aboriginal people. For that reason, I condemn him for his comments. </PARA>
<PARA> This historic legislation will go a long way towards silencing a number of our international critics who have constantly pointed the finger at Australia for not being able to provide proper living conditions for Aboriginal people. The legislation arises out of the work done since 1971 by all governments, and it would do well for the House to reflect that we now have an historic opportunity to provide living areas and associated facilities for Aboriginal people to enjoy the sort of life that most Australians have become accustomed to expect. We have had a philosophy of and a commitment to achieving that goal. I say, on behalf of this Government, that I am very proud that we have fulfilled one of the most far reaching pieces of legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament for a long time. I ask people to reflect on the period of the Whitlam Government and the follow-up work done by the Fraser Government on land rights in the Northern Territory. This proposal has picked up that work and provides an opportunity for people who were bypassed-through no one's fault but perhaps through an oversight-and have not been able to gain proper areas in which to live. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure honourable members that I will be having proper discussions with the pastoralists concerned. That was always my intention. The pastoralists were aware of it. I repeat, however, for the record, that it was the pastoralists who withdraw from the discussions set up by Chief Minister Hatton and me back in 1987. I have bent over backwards to involve them and give them the opportunity to discuss these matters. I say to them publicly on the record that I intend to make myself available to discuss with them again their issues of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding consideration is that we are providing areas for Aboriginal people to live in. Our overriding concern is that they should have proper living conditions and infrastructure. I understand that that is also the overriding concern of the overwhelming majority of honourable members opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that there are basically three amendments to clauses 5, 9 and 14 of the Bill. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) knows, the Opposition in the Senate accepted the amendments that have been moved by the Government as they, in effect, had already been agreed to between the Government and the Northern Territory Government in the historic agreement that was reached some time ago between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Marshall Perron, in respect of the issue of living areas for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. When I spoke in this debate some time ago-if I recall, it was very early in the morning-I indicated that the Opposition supported this legislation and that we were pleased to see it finally come to the Parliament in its final form. At that time we had pleasure in endorsing the legislation, and I do so again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This historic legislation has had an extremely long gestation period. Of all the legislation that is before the Parliament today, and possibly tomorrow, this legislation, in my view, would have to rate first in historical importance. Any thinking person who knows the history of this legislation would come to the same conclusion. In that sense, I join the Minister in recognising the importance of the legislation. It reflects well on the Parliament that the legislation has finally got here. The legislation has had a tortuous path and much of it has been subject to heated political debate. The Minister has made reference to that but I do not make any apology, and neither should anyone. These are contentious issues. I am sure they will continue to be contentious but progress has been made with this legislation and these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention two points. The first is that we proposed some amendments in the Senate which were not successful and did not enjoy the support of the Australian Democrats. They were quite straightforward amendments and details were given to the Minister well in advance. The first was to give effect to legislation which was proposed by the former Minister and which awaited proclamation in the hope that the stock routes and reserves would be excluded. I understand from the speech by the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) in the other place, on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, that that will take place in any event. I certainly hope that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point relates to the contentious issue of the scheduling of areas in the Bill as that affects the rights and interests of pastoralists. The pastoralists have agreed in the main that this legislation should come forward. They have been represented in part by the Northern Territory Government. But they have had-and still do have-the view that their rights and interests need to be protected. The Minister has again said today-and I am pleased to hear him say it-that he will be consulting with them. That is a fundamental requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment sought to set in place a formal mechanism for review so that people whose interests are affected have a right to have decisions reviewed under judicial processes. I am grateful for the intervention during the Senate debate by my colleague Senator Alston, who I thought put forward a principled position in support of our amendment-that is, that there needed to be an arm's length judicial review mechanism. Unfortunately, that provision did not go forward. That is to be regretted but it was put forward, as the Minister knows, in a sense to try to achieve something that could be broadly accepted and I think it had merit. </PARA>
<PARA> With those words I want to conclude my remarks. Perhaps the Minister would not be surprised that I want to defend my colleague Senator Tambling. Senator Tambling is from the Northern Territory. He deals with these issues on a day to day basis. He took the debate for the Opposition in the Senate. In my view he did a good job. He canvassed the issues broadly. He has had a very active interest in Aboriginal affairs. I feel that he is constructive in his contributions. Whilst the Minister might disagree, and I can accept that, Senator Tambling has a job to do and he does it well. Perhaps the Minister ought to be a little less sensitive in the intensity of the remarks he makes. </PARA>

It does achieve something for the most disadvantaged people in this nation, the Aboriginals, those who are in remote areas in living areas where they need to have title. This legislation achieves that. I welcome it on behalf of the Opposition. As I have said, each and every member of this House, if he or she fully understands the implications of what is being achieved here, would also welcome it. I make the plea to the Minister that, when other senators and members are critical, he be not quite as sensitive and look at the end result. The end result is what is important in this area and I think we have achieved something today. I support the amendments proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share the pride of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) in the fact that the Government was able to successfully address this legislation after what was, as the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) quite rightly pointed out, a very tortuous path. I do not concur with the comments the honourable member for Bass has made about the contribution of Senator Tambling in the other place. I want to concentrate very briefly on the historic nature of this legislation and, in turn, the amendments that have been put up. The negotiations which took place around this legislation were extremely important, not only because they showed the goodwill of this Government in being able to reach compromise positions with people but because at last the Northern Territory Government came to its senses and recognised that it had within its power the capacity to negotiate with this Government a reasonable outcome for up to 6,000 people who live on or around pastoral leases in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have done previously in this place, I congratulate the Minister for the work he put in in ensuring that this legislation came to fruition. I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for his initiative in talking to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Perron, and Mr Perron for the response he made in the first instance to that initiative. It is an issue which is extremely close to me because, prior to coming to this place, I worked on this legislation for the Central Land Council and was involved in putting solutions both to the Northern Territory Government and to the pastoralists around this issue, solutions which could have been reached some years ago had this been the intent of the Northern Territory Government. Unfortunately, that was not the case. One can only hope that we do not see a repeat of the negative attitudes that have been perpetuated previously by the Northern Territory administrations in relation to advancing the interests of the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, but that the conservative parties join in advancing the interests of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the support of the honourable member for Bass for this legislation. I hope he is able to ensure that those people on the Opposition benches, both in this place and in the Senate, who have made quite derogatory and outrageous remarks about prominent Aboriginal people desist from doing so and that they see the goodwill in the way this Government has approached this legislation and support it in its entirety and, indeed, support any initiatives which are taken by this Government to ameliorate the poor living conditions of Aboriginal people in Australia. </PARA>

I thank Senator Collins, who is in the gallery, and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) for their contributions. In regard to the comments of the shadow spokesman for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), about the good senator in the other place, I have here a speech well prepared by a hard-working person which yet again I will probably not get to use but rather will file away for future reference. Honourable members should read it because it gives the Opposition's mate over there a decent rave up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tragedy of this debate is that since 1971 Aboriginal people have been living in car bodies and in all sorts of appalling conditions while people down here have carried on and argued about whether they ought to get a few acres or a few square miles of land on which to build a house or place of living. They have lived in these terrible conditions, and I suspect have died in these terrible conditions, while we have carried on like that. This legislation is historic. I am sure I speak for both my colleagues from the Northern Territory, Senator Collins and the honourable member for the Northern Territory, in saying that it is my joy that we are now able to get on with the job of delivering the services which are needed. The tragedy is that people such as Senator Tambling expressed no outrage when the Northern Territory Government withdrew from the discussions at one stage and when the cattlemen withdrew. There were further attacks on land councils or any prominent Aboriginal person who stuck his head up and said anything. That is my argument with him. I have the thickest hide in the caper in terms of people having a go at me, because a few have had a go. That does not worry me at all. I only ask people to tell the truth. The problem with our colleague in the Senate is that he cannot tell the truth. I ought not to spoil the day by getting into that scrap with him and I will not. </PARA>
<PARA> This is historic legislation. My colleagues from the Northern Territory and the shadow Minister have worked hard to bring this about. We have been successful. It is a proud day for this Government that we were able to overcome what was a very difficult situation. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory said, it could not have been done without the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the involvement of the Chief Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I might take the opportunity to say a few words about the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1989. It comes back to this place to give effect to amendments that have been moved in the Senate. As was indicated by my colleague the shadow spokesman for the environment, Senator Puplick, we support the amendments. As spokesman for environment matters in this place I have pleasure in doing so here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the legislation came to this place it enjoyed the support of the Opposition. It is significant legislation. Those who go back to the debate will see that this legislation did have a long gestation period. It gives effect to reports of this Parliament from some considerable time ago involving members such as the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and the former member for Petrie, but more particularly it gives effect to the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-Boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which was finalised this year in Switzerland. The point that needs to be made is that once this legislation does take effect it will pick up a significant environmental issue: that of the movement of hazardous waste.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent times we have seen the movement of hazardous wastes across boundaries with what I would call the immoral dumping of wastes in poor Third World countries. People have taken advantage of the economic circumstances of those Third World countries to foist such wastes upon them. We do not want that to happen in Australia. Certainly, we do not need that to happen in the rest of the world. The motivation behind putting in place such a convention was to put controls on it. The motivation, the aim of policy and the energy expended in the removal and disposal of hazardous waste, ought to be directed towards finding sensible mechanisms and processes to deal with this problem. That will require a greater utilisation of scientific knowledge, with which we can then deal with these problems, which are world problems and go beyond national boundaries. All of us want this to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> This piece of legislation, not unlike the last, is significant and enjoys the support of all honourable members in this House and of the other place. It is the product of the work of both sides of the Parliament over a long period and gives effect to the United Nations Environment Program. In that sense, to elaborate on what we are actually doing here so that people can understand what is happening, even though everything has been truncated and pushed through very quickly, we ought to take the opportunity to point out exactly what is happening with legislation as it comes before the Parliament on whatever occasion that is.

<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 7 March 1989 an election was conducted for the first self-governing Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Many features of the election were unique in Australian electoral history. A unique electoral system known as `modified d'Hondt' was devised by the Federal Parliament for the conduct of the ACT election. The Australian Electoral Commission described it-accurately in my opinion-as `an electoral system unknown to man'. Some of its unique features include the following. First, there were 117 candidates nominated for the single territory-wide electorate. Secondly, the ballot paper was more than one metre wide. Thirdly, a significant number of candidates and parties were opposed to the establishment of any self-governing assembly. Fourthly, a number of candidates and parties were described by commentators as frivolous candidates-the most famous being the Sun Ripened Warm Tomato Party. Finally, the Australian Electoral Commission required more than nine weeks to complete the count and declare the result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate referred these matters and others for inquiry to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in May of this year. Our first task was to obtain instruction from the Electoral Commission on the operation of the modified d'Hondt system and the eight stages involved in determining the result. A video explaining the difficulties associated with counting the one metre ballot papers and the intricacies of the modified d'Hondt system was very helpful to the Committee. After advertising for public comment, the Committee conducted public hearings during September and October this year. The Committee reviewed evidence covering allegations that the Australian Electoral Commission had been inefficient or dilatory in the conduct of the count and had failed in its education campaign to give voters sufficient understanding of the ACT electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that, given the circumstances of the election, the complexity of the electoral system devised by Parliament and an agreement reached with the ACT Administration, criticism of the Australian Electoral Commission was unwarranted. The Committee also found that the level of candidate deposit was too low, and the conditions for party registration in the ACT too loose, to discourage the involvement of frivolous candidates and parties in the Assembly elections. Accordingly, it recommends the raising of the nomination deposit from $100 to $250, the same as is now required for the House of Representatives. In addition, it recommends that, for the purpose of gaining registration for the ACT elections, political parties be required to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100. The modified d'Hondt electoral system was strongly criticised in the evidence before the Committee, particularly because of its complexity and because it lacks any underlying rationale. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of the ACT may well ask why the Parliament inflicted upon them a unique and untried electoral system. The report explains in detail the many proposals, counter-proposals and compromises which led to the birth of `modified d'Hondt'. The Labor Government, having a majority in the House of Representatives, wanted single-member electorates. The Opposition and the Australian Democrats, having a majority in the Senate, were committed to proportional representation and multi-member electorates. The Government, being unable to have its preferred position adopted by the Senate, put forward a form of proportional representation based on the d'Hondt electoral system, which is used in a number of European countries. In Europe, the pure d'Hondt system is a party list system and operates fairly and equitably in the allocation of seats to parties. Individual candidates are elected according to their position on the party list. The Government proposed a d'Hondt system where electors would be able to vote for candidates as well as parties. D'Hondt was further modified in the Senate by the Hill amendments. These Opposition amendments basically allowed the preferences of eliminated candidates to be taken into account over the eight stages of the count. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most complex features of the legislation is the deeming provisions, which can result in a person's vote being interpreted and counted other than in the way intended. The Committee has recommended that, where possible, the Senate formality rules and deeming provisions serve as a model for any new electoral system. Very few of the submissions received by the Committee supported the retention of the modified d'Hondt system in its current possession. Many changes were recommended. I point out that the Australian Capital Territory Liberal Party recommended the adoption of proportional representation based on three electorates of seven members, the Residents Rally wanted to remove the wrinkles from the d'Hondt system-whatever that means-and the No Self-Government Party was quite happy for the current d'Hondt system to be modified in some way but for the basic philosophy of d'Hondt to be retained. The Australian Labor Party was arguing for single member electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has considered at length-I stress `at length'-whether it was possible to find some version of the d'Hondt system which could now be considered acceptable to all parties. In the final outcome we were unable to achieve that result. The Labor members of this Committee believe that the best electoral system for an ACT Assembly is one based on single member electorates. Other members of the Committee formed a different opinion. The Chairman of the Subcommittee which dealt with this report will expand on that in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Labor members of the Committee had the numbers to bring down a majority report we thought it was much better to operate in a spirit of compromise. The Committee remains divided over our preferred alternatives-that is, single member electorates on the one hand, the Labor preferred position, or a proportional representation system on the other-but we believe that it is preferable to allow the people of Canberra to choose between these two alternatives in a referendum. The Committee has, therefore, recommended that the Commonwealth fund a referendum offering these two alternatives. The Committee has recommended that all parties agree to introduce, as quickly as possible, that system preferred by a majority of the ACT electors. </PARA>
<PARA> This inquiry was undertaken by a Subcommittee chaired very ably by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). I would like to thank him in particular and other members of the Subcommittee for their efforts. Thanks are also due to other members of the Committee, to the inquiry secretariat, headed by Mr Alan Kelly, and the staff involved in the Subcommittee inquiry, run by Dr Robyn Seth-Purdie, and Mrs Helen Misa; I thank them for their excellent assistance. Once again I would like to thank members of the Committee for their cooperation in allowing the adoption of this unanimous report today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-When I accepted the task of chairing the inquiry of the Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters I did so quite enthusiastically. I was surprised, then, that whenever I mentioned this to any of my colleagues they looked at me and said, `What on earth have you done to deserve something like that?'. I guess their concern came home to me after the first two days of our public inquiry when 12 people appeared before us and presented 12 different ways of fixing the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) electoral system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we went through the evidence two things became very obvious. The first was that there was overwhelming community opinion that the modified d'Hondt system was unworkable and had to go. The modified d'Hondt system will be remembered for two things. Firstly, in the words of the Deputy Electoral Commissioner, it will go down in the record books as being a system unknown to mankind and, secondly, it will be remembered for the fact that it produced the second largest ballot paper in history, surpassed only by what was called the orange blanket in an Illinois election in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pertinent to ask ourselves why we got the modified d'Hondt system. Evidence before the Subcommittee shows that the ACT administration section of the Department of Arts, Tourism and Territories was aware that the system was unworkable prior to the legislation passing through the Parliament. In fact, the Australian Electoral Commission wrote twice to the Department and the Department passed those letters on to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding) and received no reply. It appears that it was the decision to have self-government at any cost and to impose an unworkable system on the ACT. I guess that history will decide whether that was worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that was obvious to all of us was that the ACT should not be used as a further experiment. This limited us somewhat. While we had some novel and well thought out proposals that might have worked, we were concerned not to make the ACT another experiment. So that really limited us to the possibility of single member electorates, a Senate type system, or the Hare-Clark system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end the whole Committee was not able to agree on just one system, but too much should not be made of that because we did propose a method of resolving the situation where there were two preferred options. Also, on a difficult and political issue like this, to have representatives of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the National Party of Australia, the Australian Democrats and an Independent senator on the Committee all agreeing to one report is quite an achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has extolled the virtues of single member electorates as he sees them. I will not say too much about the Hare-Clark system as I believe that that has been done admirably in the report. However, I want to make two points. Firstly, on the balance of the evidence presented to the Committee it is the overwhelming wish of the people who came before us that there be some form of proportional representation in the ACT. Secondly, the Hare-Clark system is misunderstood. Certainly, the Minister, in his speeches at the time, referred to it as a system specifically designed for a house of review, which is a bit hard to understand considering that the Tasmanian lower House has used it since 1907 and the Irish Parliament since 1920. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank Dr Robyn Seth-Purdie, who worked tirelessly and tenaciously to get this report out; Alan Kelly and Helen Misa on the Committee secretariat; and also my colleagues on the Subcommittee-the honourable member for Dobell, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) and Senator Schacht. We worked very hard, and in a bipartisan manner, to produce something worthwhile. We hope that it will be a lead to our colleagues in the Parliament and we commend it to the people of the ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I have presented two reports of the Committee. One report is entitled Work in progress. It examines aspects of industry training and award restructuring in three industries-the motor vehicle manufacturing industry, the tourism industry and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. The second report I wish to present is entitled Postgraduate awards. It deals with the administration of the Commonwealth's postgraduate research awards. These very different reports touch upon the three subject areas of specific interest to my Committee-employment and training in the case of the Work in progress report, and education in the case of the Postgraduate awards report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now briefly talk about each report in turn, commencing with the Work in Progress report. The title of this report is an apt one. Award restructuring is an essential feature of the progress which needs to be made to increase exports to make Australia more competitive and hence improve our standard of living. But the changes encompassed by award restructuring will take many years to put into effect and the process has only just begun. My Committee's report is about the achievements which have been made so far, particularly in the three industries that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> From our visits and discussions with representatives in the industries it was apparent that a number of positive changes have been made to the ways in which work is organised in industries across Australia. In particular, we were keen to see examples where multi-skilling has been put into effect, where arrangements such as profit sharing have been introduced. Changes in work organisation and training arrangements which are part of the award restructuring process will certainly further improve the working environment. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Committee's clear findings was that if award restructuring is to be successful, those directly involved must have a full understanding of its rationale, the general process involved and its detailed application in the workplace. They must be kept informed, consulted and encouraged to participate fully in the process. However, some of the management and union representatives with whom we met to a degree were apprehensive about translating the general agreements on award restructuring reached at peak level into practical details at the enterprise level. We found that the level of understanding about award restructuring, and the degree of commitment to it, appeared to decline the further removed the participants were from peak level negotiations. In general, the level of awareness also declined the smaller the firm and the further it was from the capital cities. The Committee makes several recommendations to improve the consultative process and the flow of information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also in its studies of these industries made a number of other observations about the award restructuring process. As I have said, we believe that it has enormous potential to improve substantially the working arrangements in place in Australian industry and to improve substantially Australia's competitiveness and standard of living. The Committee makes a number of observations about industry versus enterprise bargaining. It makes further observations in relation to training arrangements and the need for a paid training package to be developed. We also make some observations about absenteeism and labour turnover in those three industries which, as many honourable members of this House might be aware, run at considerably high levels-some 20 per cent per day for production-line workers in some of the industries we visited. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is short, and I also wish to comment on the second report entitled Postgraduate awards. This report follows up the finding of the Auditor-General earlier this year that the Department of Employment, Education and Training had not rigorously applied the procedures which ensure that postgraduate awards are granted only to those eligible to receive them. In particular, the Department had not taken steps to verify whether award holders had appropriate citizenship or residency status or whether they were receiving any other Commonwealth financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The timing of this inquiry, therefore, is opportune. As of next year, administration of the postgraduate awards scheme will no longer fall under the Student Assistance Act but will be devolved to tertiary institutions. It will then become the responsibility of the tertiary institutions to ensure that award holders meet the eligibility criteria. The Committee's recommendations have been framed with these changes in mind. From the outset, I should stress that the Committee has no wish to impose cumbersome administrative procedures on the operation of the postgraduate award scheme. We strongly support the scheme and commend its significant contribution to Australia's research effort. It would be disappointing, however, if instances of maladministration were to detract from the value of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The report's recommendations involve only minor administrative procedures but they are, nonetheless, procedures which we believe will provide greater safeguards against erroneous payment of Commonwealth funds and against deliberate fraud. The Committee proposes that all applicants for Australian postgraduate research awards be required to furnish evidence of their citizenship of residency status. Under the devolved arrangements it should be a simple matter for students to present their evidence-be it a certificate of citizenship or birth certificate-in person to the tertiary institution upon taking up the award. </PARA>
<PARA> We also recommend that all award holders should be required to provide their tax file number upon the approved application form for postgraduate awards. Such a requirement is consistent with verification procedures which are in place in other government programs. For instance, all students in higher education courses, all applicants for Austudy and most recipients of other government benefits must also provide a tax file number. Therefore, we believe that this recommendation is consistent with other Government programs. We believe that our recommendations will improve the administrative efficiency of the Australian postgraduate awards scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to thank the many people in large and small organisations who assisted the Committee in the compilation of both of these reports. I also express my gratitude to my Committee colleagues for their participation in these inquiries and to members of the Committee secretariat for their research and organisational support while putting these reports together. I particularly thank Rod Pickette, the specialist adviser, for his work on the Work in progress: Award restructuring and industry training report, and the secretariat staff member, Anne Cronin. In relation to the report on postgraduate awards, I thank Gillian Gould. I also thank my other Committee staff and the secretary, Lindy Smith, for the great assistance they have provided over this Parliament in the preparation of five parliamentary committee reports. I commend these reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I also would like to speak briefly on the report Work in progress: Award restructuring and industry training. I would like to join my colleague on the opposite side of the House, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby), in expressing my thanks to the secretariat of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. They greatly assisted us in the drafting of this report and in the conduct of the inquiry. I would also like to express my thanks to the business people who welcomed us on to their factory sites and business premises and gave up their time to meet with us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee was asked to study industry training and award restructuring, giving particular attention to training, government training schemes, work force flexibility and the development of career paths. We chose to direct our investigation towards three industries: vehicle manufacturing, the textile, clothing and footwear sector, and tourism. Today, I would like to confine my comments to one particular area of investigation-the tourism sector. The sites we visited in this component of the investigation were very impressive. The operators whom we met within the tourism industry constantly pointed out to the Committee the difficulties resulting from national awards established by a central body. They argued that these awards did not take into account the different operating conditions of each resort-for example, the hours of opening, the location of resorts and the resulting difficulties such as attracting labour to isolated areas and seasonal conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the operators within the tourism sector pointed to voluntary enterprise agreements as being a more appropriate and effective way of operating their businesses. Under the coalition's voluntary enterprise agreements, conditions of employment would be determined in the workplace by employees and employers. Both parties would be able to take into consideration factors which impact only on themselves-factors such as regional employment conditions, the availability of labour and, importantly, the recognition of skills. </PARA>
<PARA> One large tourist operator with whom the Committee met accurately illustrated the effectiveness of this policy. He is currently required to deal with 15 unions, numerous awards and a multiplicity of classifications. His company favoured an enterprise agreement as it would enable him and his employees to take account of conditions that are unique to their enterprise and would be administratively simple. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point which came through as a result of our discussions and which I would like to comment on is that workplace negotiations and award restructuring is not a simple task. It is time consuming and demands commitment in the workplace by unions, employees and employers. It also involves a commitment from government to see through the reorientation of our education institutions and training schemes. I commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be said at the outset that in many respects, the procedure which has been embarked upon and which we are proceeding to embark upon again with respect to the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 is wholly unsatisfactory. This is a very curious situation. A Bill, called the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill passed through this House and went along to the Senate. After the House of Representatives had adjourned, what was in effect a new Bill was introduced by the Government in the Senate. It is another batch of stodge, with no notice, no consultation, introduced as a voluminous amendment in the Senate which has now come back to the House for consideration. So, there are two vices in the returned Bill. The first is that that procedure was followed and the second is that we will not find in the Senate Hansard any explanation of these amendments-or this new Bill, as I call it. We now have the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) moving that the amendments be, in effect, incorporated into the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It really is a very unsatisfactory situation when we do not have in either House anything approximating a sustained explanation for the introduction of very substantial amendments to a Bill. So substantial are they that they really amount to a new Bill. We are now, in the committee stage in the House, debating, in content and in length, in effect a new Bill without there having been a second reading speech here or in the Senate. Not only that, but there has been no opportunity for the Opposition to engage in a second reading debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, it is a variation of the corporations legislation. It is entirely unsatisfactory that voluminous amendments of this nature should be put to the Parliament in this manner and at such short notice. I have only limited time and I therefore will not go in that vein because the harsh reality is that, no matter what criticisms we have of the procedures adopted by the Government-which really are indefensible-the House and this Committee at this stage have to grapple with the amendments and we have to do our duty to the Australian Parliament by deciding whether or not to pass them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I had more time I would explain in more detail what this batch of amendments is concerned with. We will not get any explanation from the Government; we did not in the Senate; we will not in the House or anywhere else. It is up to the Opposition to give to the readers of Hansard and members of the public at large at least some explanation of what this is all about. In effect, it is all about amending the Australian Federal Police (AFP) Act 1979 so that there is some legal basis for the use of listening devices. The second proposal is to amend the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act to exempt the transfer of personal information from Commonwealth bodies to ASIO from the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988. The second amendment that I am speaking about means that Commonwealth agencies may provide information to ASIO without infringing the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group of amendments are to the Customs Act and will alter in several ways the provisions of that Act dealing with the use of listening devices. I have time to mention only the first of them; that is, to allow the use of listening devices in the investigation of all narcotic offences committed in all premises, even ships and aircraft. We can see that that is a substantial-although, I hasten to add, desirable-amendment. The next amendment is to the Judiciary Act and relates to the Australian Government Solicitor and whether that body can act for two government parties in the same matter. I will say a little more in detail about that at a later stage. Then there are some amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act which make minor amendments to terminology. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn in more detail to the amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. We should note that the Government is proposing to insert into the Act a new division which will regulate the use of listening devices by the AFP in the investigation of non-narcotic offences. The proposed amendments are in the same terms as the provision of the Customs Act that deal with the use of those devices in the investigation of narcotic offences. We note that the Government says, curiously enough, that these amendments are an interim measure only, pending a comprehensive review of legislation dealing with listening devices and phone tapping devices. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we take the Bill to be an interim measure; but we have to say that this is, as I have said already, a curious statement from the Government. The fact is that several reviews of the use of listening devices have already been undertaken. The issues of listening devices, illegally obtained evidence and infringements to privacy-all very major matters that deserve more serious treatment than the Government has given them in this legislation-have been considered in a number of reports. Let me mention three of them: the Report of the Joint Select Committee on Telecommunications Interceptions; the Australian Law Reform Commission Reports into Privacy and Criminal Investigation; and the Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Alleged Telephone Interceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that it is curious to note that the Government has chosen to select some of the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission in its Privacy Report but has chosen to ignore others, without any explanation. I repeat, because they deserve to be repeated, the comments made by my colleague Senator Hill in the Senate only a couple of days ago. Senator Hill asked the question, `Why is this the case?'. We have what the Government says is an interim measure. It says that it needs more time to look at the law on the use of listening devices and bugging devices despite the fact that the subject has virtually been done to death by the Law Reform Commission and other bodies. The Government comes up and, without any explanation, seeks to implement in legislation some recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and to ignore others. We just do not know why the Government has done that. I could go on at great length about this and would if I had time to do so. I simply say that some of the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission-for instance, that secret surveillance should be prohibited and strictly regulated but that participatory monitoring, as it is called, should not be regulated-remain silent. And so one can go on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very unfortunate that one does not have time to deal with these things. But we can say that it is strange that, with the history of this matter, the best that the Government can do is to come along in the twilight hours of this Parliament-and, from what I hear, the twilight hours of the Government-with what it calls an interim measure. We emphasise that the Opposition takes the view that it is quite inappropriate that legislation which deals with matters of such substance should be introduced in this way, at such a late hour, without consultation and without any explanatory of why some of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and other bodies have apparently been accepted and others have not. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter arises as to the offences for which listening devices may be used by the Australian Federal Police. This is a major area of the amendments that have been inserted by the Senate and it is an area which is the subject of an amendment that I propose to move. The Bill authorises a Federal judge to issue a warrant for the use of listening devices in the investigation of what are described as class 1 general offences and class 2 general offences. Those offences are described in the following way. Class 1 general offences are specific Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory crimes such as murder, kidnapping and offences of aiding, abetting or conspiring to commit these offences. The definition goes on to deal with class 2 general offences and sets out a series of specified crimes, specified by reference to the Acts of Parliament and specific sections. The problem arises with the rest of the definition. It must be remembered that this is an important matter to the extent that what is being approved--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will quickly reply to one point. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) made the point that he had not had any prior notice or had not been adequately consulted. I could understand that being said in the terms that Parliament was in session. But I am reminded that on 23 November he was written to and informed of the content of the proposed Government amendments and an offer was put forward to make departmental officers available for briefing. Following that, his colleague Senator Hill moved amendments which related to those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just make the point that we do not want to have an ambush. We proceeded on the basis that we had to do something. As a former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies would know that it was for the very reason that advice was given that there was no adequate protection or entitlement for the Australian Federal Police to be using listening devices because there was no protection for that in the law. It is a gap in the law that has been there for some time. It would be appropriate to try to cover that gap now rather than wait for a lengthy period. We are dealing with serious offences. The Committee should bear in mind that we usually comply with State law, but certain States do not have any law on this at all. The advice to us, after the debate was concluded, was that we should do something about this matter because there appeared to be a gap in the law. For that reason the legislation was introduced into the Senate, rather than waiting until the autumn sittings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the 10-minute period allocated to me came to an end I was dealing with the clause of the Bill which deals with those offences the investigation of which by the Australian Federal Police may be assisted by the use of listening devices. I was making the point that there are some offences for which loose listening devices may be used when there is an investigation by the Australian Federal Police. Those offences are quite specifically known by reference to Acts of Parliament and sections, so that everyone knows exactly what the offences are. The problem is that there is then in the Bill, as amended by the Senate, an attempt to describe other offences in a generic sense. That is what we have an objection to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We want to make it perfectly plain that we are not opposed to the use of listening devices for the investigation of serious crimes; in fact, we support it. It must be said that it is now accepted as a legitimate and effective means of crime detection and prevention. We are in favour of that and support the use of it for additional offences if it is known what those offences are and if a case is made out as to why it is necessary to use listening devices in the investigation of those crimes. We are concerned about the attempt to describe those offences in this generic way so that the precise and specific crimes are not specified. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate we moved an amendment, in the case of proposed new section 12b and the definition of class 2 general offences, to leave out proposed new paragraph (b), which would remove the generic description that I am talking about at this stage. That has not been completely successful-there was a partial amendment made in the Senate-but we want to persist with it. If this amendment is successful, we want the Government to go away and to come back when it is in a position to say what are the specific crimes for which the use of listening devices is to be authorised. I seek leave to move my amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 together. </PARA>

<PARA> Part 1a-Amendments of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979-SB106</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Proposed section 12b, definition of ``class 2 general offence'', omit proposed paragraph (b). </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Proposed section 12b, definition of ``class 2 general offence'', proposed paragraph (c), omit ``or (b)''. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Proposed subsection 12j (3), omit, ``, using''. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I have moved the third amendment is so that technical officers employed by the Australian Federal Police will be able to install listening devices, because that is what the Bill proposes, and will be able to take part in the incidental work associated with the effective utilisation of listening devices. Taking out the word `using' will ensure that they are not able to use them in the strict sense of the word because that, clearly, is the responsibility of the police. The work of technical officers should not go as far as enabling them to use listening devices, but simply assist in the installing and the other incidental activities involved in the use of listening devices. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to use some of my remaining time to elaborate on some of those matters. The point has been made that the use of listening devices constitutes a serious infringement of privacy, albeit a necessary one. Because of that, the situations in which listening devices are available for use we believe should be expressed very carefully. As I have said, the problem is that the description of class 2 general offences, describing those offences for which listening devices may be used when the police are investigating the commission of those offences, is really, as the legislation is presently drafted, open-ended and ill-defined. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the half amendment made to this in the Senate-an amendment made to the original Government amendments-the generic description that is still there gives us concern. We feel uncomfortable about giving surveillance powers for the investigation of unspecified offences which are defined only in this broad generic manner. We know that the Government will say in reply to this, `Yes, but there are safeguards, because the judge granting the warrant will still have to satisfy himself that everything is fair, square and above board and that there is no danger of infringing on civil liberties' and all of the other matters that Senator Tate referred to in the Senate. We know that that will be the answer, but it is not an answer. We believe that the answer is one that can only be that the Bill is amended so that it is quite specific as to what offences are to be the subject of the use of listening devices. It is not an answer because the citizen is entitled to know what are the restrictions on the citizen's liberty. The public is entitled to know what offences are to be the subject of this quite new, and it is new, and quite extensive, and it is extensive, intrusion on the rights of the citizen. That is not to say that criminals are to have an open go and are to be free from the danger of having listening devices used to detect their criminal activities; we would be strongly opposed to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not seem to realise that what it is doing here is new and, therefore, there is an obligation on it to explain itself. The Government does not seem to appreciate the point that if we are going to enter into this new field, then we must do it specifically so that everyone knows-both the police force and others-what are the limits of this quite substantial invasion of privacy and liberty. We will be the first and the most ardent advocates of the use of listening devices where they are necessary to be used for the detection and the prevention of serious crime when it is known precisely what the offences are. We are not going to stand back and allow amendments of this sort to be made where we are going to allow offences like stealing postal articles and failing to renew an export or import licence to be subject to bugging without some explanation from the Government as to why that is necessary. Damaging data in Commonwealth computers is to be subject to the use of listening devices. It may well be that it is justified and necessary, but there should be some explanation given for it and the law should say precisely what the offences are where listening devices are to be used. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have run out of time, it is not possible for me to elaborate upon these arguments in this particular area of the amendment any further. That is unfortunate, but it is really no defence for the Government to say, `Look, we wrote you a letter at the end of November; you should be up to scratch by now on this'. That is no defence at all. It is no way to legislate, and I assure the Government that, to the best of my ability, a future and alternative government will not act in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) put the arguments, before the dinner break, in support of amendments that the Opposition moved in the Senate with which we are unable to agree. I want to make the point that the reason why they were introduced into the Senate was the obvious defect in the legislation which has been there for some time-namely, that the Australian Federal Police were apparently using listening devices without proper legal authority. That may be a matter for argument, but it is the reason why the amendments were introduced, and opinion was given on that basis. We could not ignore that opinion or say we would wait until the Autumn, or some other time, to regularise the position because we are dealing with crime detection in a number of ways and it is important to remedy any defect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was on that basis that I wrote to the honourable member for Menzies advising him of the amendments, and he was good enough to reply on 4 December saying he would give consideration to them and asking whether we would let him have a copy of them. I am advised we did that on 4 December. It followed from that that his colleague, Senator Hill, being aware of those amendments that we intended to move, moved amendments to them in the Senate. That is the present position. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with three amendments which relate to the paragraph which concerns the description of offences. The honourable gentleman made the point that they ought not to be in this generic form, but we make the point that we are making the issue very clear when we talk about offences which are punishable by life imprisonment or a maximum of at least seven years. In other words, these are not minor offences; they are major offences. We do not accept the view that we need to identify all those offences wherever they may be in all the Acts; we do not need to be that specific about them. We feel it is adequate-in fact, fair-to identify offences as being very serious by their being punishable by at least seven years imprisonment. It would be virtually impossible to identify every particular offence. It is for that reason that amendments (1) and (2) are not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to section 12j (3), to leave out the word `using', encourages some discussion as to what is meant by `using'. It should be borne in mind that we are talking about a technical operation. We are talking about a police officer needing a warrant to listen to whatever conversation is taking place but, because it is a technical operation, the Bill provides for technical assistance. That technical assistance relates to the installation, maintenance, testing, using or recovery of a listening device. In other words, without being disparaging about the competence of police officers, they cannot be expected to be fully competent to handle such equipment. Their duty is to listen and make a recording, but they need technical assistance to put the equipment in place. That is basically what this is about. It in no way authorises technical officers to use the device for listening for the purpose for which the warrant would be issued. The word `using' is necessary because, if there was not that capacity to use the equipment, to make it available for the authorised officer, there would be a limitation on its use. It is for those reasons that the amendments are not accepted. That explanation was given to the Senate, and it was rejected there. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the position is that there was a need to introduce these amendments because of advice given that listening devices were being used without proper authority. In some cases State laws govern listening devices, but in other States there are no laws, and that includes the Australian Capital Territory. The honourable member for Menzies, who is a former Attorney-General, may be surprised to find that that is the position because listening devices would have been used in his time without authority. That was a gap which we had to close. I understand the argument against that explanation, but it is not valid in terms of what we are about here. We feel there has been an adequate description of the offences and it could not be any better. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had to accept reluctantly Opposition amendments which deleted the ability to use listening devices in cases involving serious fraud or serious loss to the revenue of the Commonwealth or the Australian Capital Territory. We cannot press that here because we were not successful in the Senate. But `serious crime' should pick up fraud, in my view. The Senate thinks otherwise. That description should certainly pick up the serious loss of revenue, because everybody else in the marketplace would ask why we would let criminal activity go undetected. The fear is that perhaps the police would be listening to somebody who is engaged in an innocent operation, and they should not do it. The need for a warrant is a safeguard in that regard, in that there has to be at least a substantive allegation relating to fraud or serious loss of revenue for one to be issued. The Government has lost that argument, and I will not press it here. This position was forced on us in the Senate. For the reasons I have mentioned I am unable to accept amendments (1) to (3) moved by the honourable gentleman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply wish to put on record, concerning the Senate's amendment No. 3, that the definitions of `prescribed offence' and `premises' have been expanded in the manner set out in the Senate's amendment. Some concern has been expressed about the open-ended nature of warrants that are used for secret surveillance powers with respect to premises, because the definition of `premises' is new. Normally one would exercise surveillance over persons but there is now a new definition of `premises' inserted and the surveillance will be able to be exercised over premises which are very widely defined as including structure, building, aircraft, ship, vehicle or other carriage, land whether it is enclosed or not, and any part of premises. That is a very wide definition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although we are not opposing the amendment, the Committee really should take notice of the fact, in terms of future scrutiny, that electronic surveillance in the broad sense will now be able to be conducted over a very wide range indeed-a wide description of premises of the sort that I have just read out. That is an expansion of surveillance so wide that I wonder whether members of the Australian Labor Party, in particular, realise what they are doing. But that is not my problem; it is the Government's problem. We say that, first of all, we should note the extent of the electronic surveillance that is being allowed and, second, recognise that that is a new area of surveillance which has not previously been allowed. We are not opposing it but we draw attention to the extent of it and say that it is something that should be noted in the future in terms of monitoring how it is conducted. These are powers given under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act. Usually members of the Labor Party go into orbit about the very mention of that organisation, let alone the expansion of the area of surveillance itself. Perhaps a new peace has descended upon the Labor Party and we are not to have those arguments on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of amendment No. 3 to which I wish to draw attention is the provision relating to the immunity of judges. The new clause will provide that the judge, when he or she is exercising the function or power conferred on him or her by this division-namely, to issue warrants-will have the same protection or immunity as a justice of the High Court of Australia in relation to proceedings in the High Court. Because of the exigencies of time and not being able to discuss this in a second reading debate, I trust that I might be given some indulgence when I make some remarks about both this clause and an earlier clause relating to the question of judicial immunity. </PARA>
<PARA> It emerges that the amendments give to Federal judges the power to issue warrants for the use of listening devices. As we have seen, the specific clause before us at the moment deals with the immunity of judges who are exercising powers to issue warrants under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act. In effect what we have here and under the provision contained in proposed section 12d is the conferring of a non-judicial or administrative function upon a judicial officer. On the surface, some people would say this would seem to be contrary to the separation of powers principle which is contained in the Constitution. However, it is, we must say, desirable that this power be vested in a person who is impartial and beyond the influence of political processes. For that reason the provision relating to immunity of judges is contained in the Bill in several places. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with the separation of powers principle is apparently overcome-and I say apparently-in the Government's view by proposed sections 12d (1) and (2), which allow judges to consent to being nominated to issue those warrants. Therefore the power to issue warrants is said to be vested in a judge personally rather than in a judicial officer. The amendments also provide that in exercising this function the judge is to be given the same protection and immunity that a High Court justice has. This would make a judge immune from both civil action and direct judicial review. However, as the task of issuing a warrant is an administrative one, and theoretically, as a result of that, should be subject to judicial review, it is curious that there are no built-in review procedures in the amendments that are before the Committee now. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that the Attorney-General and the Government have been moved by the High Court decision in Hilton v. Wells where there was a split decision on whether section 20 of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act was valid constitutionally for conferring a non-judicial power upon Federal Court judges, the non-judicial power being the issue of warrants for phone tapping. We simply draw attention to the fact because these sections are often the subject of interpretation in the courts, and the courts these days have regard to what we say in the Parliament on these matters-or, in the case of the Government, what we do not say. I simply record here that it is not mentioned in the explanatory memorandum and one would not have made this observation without having to research the relevant law. If amendments are being made because of judicial decisions like Hilton v. Wells it would be sensible for the Government to acknowledge that fact so that we all know what the law is now trying to provide, whether or not, in fact, it does provide it. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the effect of Hilton v. Wells, I want to raise the further point that decisions to issue warrants under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act are exempt from review because of the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. We would like to know why no such similar exemption is proposed here. I do not want to take this any further. I simply wish to draw attention to the issues concerning the immunity of judges performing the administrative functions given to them by these substantial amendments in relation to issuing warrants. That is something that may have to be interpreted later on. That is all I have to say with respect to amendment No. 3. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) raised the issue of Customs provisions in the definition of premises in respect of amendment No. 3. I am advised that there has been no adequate definition of `premises' and that this amendment was inserted for that reason. There is a further argument that the word `premises' related only to buildings and that, therefore, it was necessary to talk about them also being aircraft, ships or vehicles. In other words, the amendment was intended to give a definition to premises that has not applied until now even though there is reference to them in the Customs Act which has been in force for some time. Honourable members will notice that there is a provision in that legislation which talks about `reasonable grounds' for suspecting that the premises have been or are likely to be used in connection with the commission of a narcotics offence. The argument then concerns whether the term `premises' includes only buildings or whether it also includes the places I mentioned, namely mobile circumstances. Therefore, this definition picks that up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies correctly identified the problem of the division of powers of judges. The immunity of judges comes into this issue. The doubt as to whether a judge could exercise such powers without being properly designated as being able to do so created that difficulty and therefore judges are nominated on that basis. I did not think Hilton v. Wells was an issue in that sense; it was more a question of using information that was gathered by an intercept. The honourable member will recall that that was a matter which the High Court of Australia was going to consider on appeal but in the finish the case did not proceed. But the issue certainly was that there was virtually an unauthorised intercept which was then published. The question was whether that was an offence. On that basis we do not have the problem that the honourable member for Menzies feels is the case with Hilton v. Wells. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see any difficulty at all about giving judges an immunity in this sense. There needs to be some definition as to who is going to use the power in respect of the warrant. Further, we do not want to have the difficulty of the judges being themselves cross-examined as to whether, when issuing a warrant, they had actually carried out procedures. Perhaps a person who would want to challenge that would want to put the judge in the witness box and go through all those procedures. It is for that reason that we have to try to avoid the issue. It is the same as with contempt; we do not want to have members of the judiciary all the time having to go through cross-examinations as to whether they have followed the law. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that explanation because it has been effective in guaranteeing that in ensuring that there are no listening devices or intercepts without proper judicial authority the judge concerned will examine the issue in terms of how it appears in the law, namely, is the offence serious, and be able to exercise a discretion. I have no doubt that in some cases a judge will exercise a discretion that the warrant should not be issued. That is the safety measure that we have. </PARA>

<PARA> (4) Part 10a-Amendment to the Judiciary Act 1903-proposed section 28b inserting proposed subsection 55e (9a), omit ``that are not the subject of litigation,'', substitute:</PARA>
<PARA> ``that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) are not the subject of litigation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) are not reasonably expected to give rise to litigation;''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment was discussed in the Senate. There is no need to talk excessively about it. The effect of proposed section 55e (9a) will be to provide that when the Australian Government Solicitor gives advice to two or more government bodies in non-litigious matters the AGS will not be acting in a conflict of interest situation. For the practical administration of government, the proposed amendment should be supported. However, we wish to move, as I have now, an amendment to cover those matters which at the time of giving the advice could be reasonably contemplated as matters in which litigation may arise. The amendment therefore is to add some words so that the Australian Government Solicitor will be able to act for both sides not only in matters involving litigation but also in matters which may reasonably be expected to give rise to litigation. That is the rule that applies to the private legal profession and it should apply to the Australian Government Solicitor. The only result is that the government body involved will have to retain an outside firm of solicitors to act for it. If there is a reasonable expectation of litigation, we say that the Government will have to engage a private solicitor. That would be a useful step towards privatisation in any event and therefore should be supported for that reason alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Our view is that guidelines of this type apply to all members of the legal profession, who well know that a matter is likely to give rise to litigation and they then do not act for both sides. It was suggested in the Senate by some senators that this additional guideline would be oppressive in the sense that members of the AGS may not appreciate when a non-litigious matter is likely to lead to litigation. In the first place I believe that they would appreciate that. If this is the case in fact, which I doubt, then frankly one really would be concerned about whatever professional standard people are being told to comply with. We believe that it is only sensible to amend the Senate amendment in the way in which I have described. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, because of the problems with this debate, and not having any second reading debate-the amendments having been introduced into the Senate-we are restricted. I trust therefore that, with some indulgence, I might have one or two minutes simply to refer to a matter that is affected by the Bill which is not specifically within the ambit of the clauses under discussion at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always think that if one comes clean at the beginning perhaps one might get a better run. My concern is with respect to privileged evidence. There was a Supreme Court decision in Queensland-the decision of Reichelt and Lewis-which raised the conflict between legal professional privilege and material obtained by phone tapping conversations which take place between solicitor and client. I mention this because this matter has arisen recently in the Winchester inquest. To quote from the editorial in the Canberra Times of 20 December might be the briefest way of describing these events. It is really very hard to believe. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sordid suggestion that police have been eavesdropping on private conversations between a prime suspect and his lawyer raises as many legislative questions as it does moral ones. The allegation, raised this week during the inquest into the murder of Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester, is that police bugged, recorded and then transcribed conversations between the prime police suspect in the murder investigation, David Eastman, and other people, including his lawyer, Warren Donald. The moral implications are obvious: professional privilege exists in dealings between lawyer and client and there is a clear danger that if police obtained information from bugged conversations, they would be tempted to use it, or be tempted to change their evidence as a result of it. </PARA>
<PARA>It really would seem to be a horrendous and monstrous situation if this activity is being engaged in. I would hope that the Attorney-General could give us a guarantee that this is not happening or, if it is not known whether it has happened, whether he could give a guarantee that there will be an inquiry into it. It is something that clearly calls for an inquiry. We cannot simply have the police force or anyone else intercepting phone calls between solicitor and client. We simply cannot have the police or anyone else using listening devices in a clear breach of legal professional privilege. It acts very much to the prejudice of people who are presumed to be innocent. It would be an outrage if that conduct were being engaged in, and I hope that the Attorney-General can clarify the matter for us. </PARA>
<PARA> It raises questions in the first place such as whether a warrant can be used authorising this type of phone tapping. Secondly, such evidence having been obtained under a warrant, will it be admissible, notwithstanding a possible claim for privilege? One could ask the question: will it be possible for secondary or indirect evidence to be given concerning information that is obtained by this means? Thirdly, for our part we would suggest that there is at least a prima facie case for preserving this privilege by first of all stating that warrants cannot be used to obtain evidence in situations where to do so would conflict with statutory or common law heads of evidentiary privilege or, secondly, by prohibiting the admissibility of such evidence. Our case simply is that we do not believe that this issue should be left up in the air. As we have seen from the Winchester matter, as described-as I have said it is a quite disgraceful situation if it has occurred-it is not just an academic situation. It is apparently a real case which has arisen. We do not believe that the Government can leave this sort of issue up in the air. </PARA>
<PARA> We can understand that there was a need for urgent legislation because it was felt that the Australian Federal Police were using listening devices without there being a legislative authority to do so. That is why this Bill is here as an urgent measure and it is why presumably the Government says that it is an interim measure. It is all very well to say that it is an interim measure. These major issues have to be addressed. The Government is not doing its job while it leaves them unresolved. It is an important civil liberties issue, it is an important police issue, and it should be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am unable to discuss, nor do I want to, any aspects of the Winchester case that the press has been reporting as the matter is still before the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) courts. It could well be that a number of members of parliament had an interest in that case; I do not know. I can understand the concern about the matter of privilege. I agree with the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). It would be horrendous to think that conversations between a client and his legal adviser could be the subject of an unauthorised listening device. The honourable member properly adverted to the fact that there is some urgency because at present there is no law in the ACT that prevents this. That is an extraordinary situation. It has existed for all time. We have just come to the point at which we ought to do something about it. That is the reason why we moved those amendments which related to the particular offences which ought to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not see how a judge could even consider allowing a listening device to be used on the basis of a suggestion that it could be used between a legal practitioner-I would think that that is where the device would be-and clients. If it were used thus, the evidence would not be admissible and, in my view, it would be an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall follow the outcome. I recall that Commissioner McAulay said-I think I am right in saying this; Senator Tate would be better advised than I on the matter-that he was having an inquiry made into the allegations that the honourable gentleman mentioned. When the findings of that inquiry are available I will provide the honourable gentleman with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendment relates to the Australian Government Solicitor having to advise a number of government departments. The convention is that that is not to be done where the matters are the subject of litigation. The Opposition is not satisfied with that and wants to expand the amendment by adding, `are not reasonably expected to give rise to litigation'. We cannot accept it for that purpose because, even though legal advice does not always lead to litigation, we would not even start giving advice because a view might be taken that litigation may come about. One cannot form any opinion at all as to whether litigation is likely to occur until such time as the issues are looked at. One has to get a fair way into the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment allows the Australian Government Solicitor to give advice to a number of parties in relation to the same matter. As honourable members know, the Commonwealth is one entity but has a number of separate parts, whether they be the Department of Taxation or the Customs Department, and so on. Technically, some of those departments may seek advice on the same matter, such as whether they are liable to the fringe benefits tax. At that stage they would certainly not be able to form the view that the matter would lead to litigation. If the Opposition's amendment were accepted, a matter may not even be started if a party is faced with the prospect of litigation occurring. We would be depriving the Commonwealth of receiving advice on matters that could be of real value. </PARA>
<PARA> It is different when one is dealing in private practice in which the individual parties have separate practitioners. There is no question of running into conflicts of interest. To place us in a position where we could not give any advice in relation to a matter because it might give rise to litigation would be an unfair restriction on us. For that reason, as has been explained before, we are not able to accept the proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to speak very briefly on this motion. The Opposition will not divide the House on it, but I wish to advise the House that we do not support it. We do not believe that this matter should be put off to the next day of sitting which in effect will be next year. The Government should deal with it tonight-now. The Government should accept the National Health Amendment Bill as amended by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sticking point that the Government has with this Bill is the Senate's insistence on the acceptance of its amendment which revokes the 28 August determination of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. From the outset of what is known as the pharmacy crisis-the crisis over pharmacy remuneration-the Liberal and National parties and the Opposition in this place and in the other place have argued that the only solution is to go back to square one and start again. We are therefore pleased that the Senate has agreed with this position, not just on one occasion but on a number of occasions. We are not alone in our view. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Tribunal's statement of 4 December it offered to conduct a further inquiry into pharmaceutical dispensing costs subject to the agreement of all relevant parties. This is the point I want to emphasise here. It also offered to return to the status quo existing prior to the August determination with effect from 1 January 1990. Clearly, it is now only the Government which refuses to accept the logic of overturning the 28 August determination. The Minister responsible for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), the Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples), issued a statement on 4 December saying that the Government supports the conditions laid down by the Tribunal in relation to a further inquiry including the return to the former level of remuneration. So, in the light of this, it is hard to understand why the Government will not accept this amendment which is designed to return pharmacy remuneration to the status quo to the situation which existed prior to 28 August. One of the conditions which the Tribunal has set in relation to the further inquiry-and I quote from its 4 December statement-is:</PARA>
<PARA>that each of the parties undertakes to take such steps as are necessary to allow the survey and subsequent consequential review to be undertaken free of duress and in a calm and proper atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA>The revoking of the 28 August determination by the Parliament would, in our view, make a significant contribution towards achieving a climate which is really free of duress. Without this step, the Tribunal would simply administratively lift the 28 August determination and have the right to reimpose it at any time in the future. Such a situation will only aggravate the instability and uncertainty which has plagued the PBS over recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is anxious to see stability return to the PBS in the interests of the welfare of patients who have been caused a great deal of anxiety during the past couple of months. We therefore urge the Government to back its own words with action and to support this amendment so that pharmacy remuneration can be returned to the status quo which existed prior to 28 August and any further inquiries conducted by the Tribunal can then proceed with the full cooperation and confidence of all parties. The adoption of this amendment will ensure that the community continues to receive the best possible services under the PBS and overcome the problems of supply which have occurred since 1 November. Finally, it will also allow the Government to proceed with its plans to raise the maximum general patient contribution from $11 to $12. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept this amendment from the Senate. If one creates a tribunal for the purpose of hearing argument, judicially weighing the merits of that argument and then making a decision, one does not interfere with that process. Initially, the chemists opted to go to a tribunal; they received a decision with which they are not happy and a long and painful process has flowed from that. But to say to any tribunal, `Although you will hear it again, the Government proposes to intervene', is an exercise by the Opposition which is not related to the merits of the dispute, which is not related to the issues that are involved and which is in no way relevant to the level of services which have been provided to the community by many pharmacists. The great majority of pharmacists have not diluted the level of service to their customers. They have been prepared to be critical of the Government, as is their right, but I do not believe there has been any dilution of the services being provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the motivation of the Opposition in this matter is not related to the merits of the dispute; it is not related to their concern that there is any deterioration in the quality of services currently provided by pharmacists; it is related to a cheap exercise in political vote gathering. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) knows it and we know it. The fact that the Opposition has the numbers in the Senate to produce this amendment does not give it any more merit.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce into the review process the power of the Minister to substitute a favourable decision after the first tier of review. These amendments augment section 64u in the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. That provision allows the Minister to set aside a decision of the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) and substitute a decision more favourable to the applicant if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's power to substitute a more favourable decision can occur only if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. The term `public interest' is not limited solely to public issues. Consideration of the public interest could involve consideration of the circumstances of the particular case having regard to unusual, unforseen or other features that are deserving of a favourable response against the background of Australia being a compassionate and humane society. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed at the time it will take for a case to proceed through each tier of review before the Minister can use the power contained in section 64u. The parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations raised this point specifically. These amendments will meet those concerns and enable such cases to be decided by the Minister at an earlier stage of the process. The exercise of the power will be subject to an obligation to report to Parliament twice each year within 15 sitting days of 1 January and 1 July. Where the Minister has exercised the power under the proposed provision, no review by the Immigration Review Tribunal will be available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will keep under review those cases where the Minister's decision is more favourable than the first tier review decision-but not the most favourable-with a view to determining whether review by the IRT should be available in some circumstances. To remove confusion as to the operation of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 in relation to the Minister's powers after each tier of review, provisions have been inserted which provide that there is no duty on the Minister to exercise the power in individual cases. The Bill provides that the Minister's powers cannot be exercised to grant an entry permit where the grant of a visa under section 11d or temporary entry permit under section 11p is conditional upon the holder not being granted an entry permit while he or she remains in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With some familiarity with this subject I sat here tonight listening in fear and trepidation to the second reading speech of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding). I thought of all those people at home listening to that speech wondering what it was that we were discussing. In relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Act, we have a number of issues to raise relating to migration law, one of which is being addressed in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 that we have received from the Senate. To understand this Bill it is not a matter of listening to the Minister's speech, of reading the explanatory memorandum or looking at the Bill itself; it is a matter of understanding what the Government is doing at this time, and I intend in my comments to put this Bill in context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The government has been about codifying migration law, ensuring that the Parliament puts down the rules in legislation that will apply for those seeking to enter Australia. It is doing so in two ways: by general principles outlined in the principal Act, the Migration Legislation Amendment Act, and by regulations made pursuant to that Act. The Act was passed last May, completed its passage through the Senate in June and was proclaimed law on 19 June. In accordance with Senate practice-largely unknown to us in this House-the date for the commencement of the legislation was fixed at six months after the date of royal assent. That means that this legislation was to commence operation on 19 December. The Government had to prepare regulations to give effect to the total legislative framework within that time. </PARA>
<PARA> There were a number of issues that arose while the legislation was being first debated. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when that legislation was before the Parliament its passage was problematical. It was unlikely that the Senate would agree to it becoming law because there were issues between the Opposition and the Government to be solved. Amongst those issues were: Who should determine migration policy in Australia? Should it be government officials, the bureaucracy, or should the government of the day determine, ultimately, who should enter Australia? Some might argue that the government of the day can do that simply by passing legislation as we have here, and then it is up to the Public Service to apply it; others, such as myself and certainly those members on this side of the House, are of the view that in particular circumstances it may be appropriate for the government of the day to be able to make decisions in individual cases, and I will come to that matter in a little while. That was a major issue between the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other issues at that time. We had no idea of the nature of the regulations that were to be introduced into the Parliament. As every honourable member knows, regulations are largely produced almost as Immaculate Conceptions. We do not see them before they are laid on the table of the Parliament and we are able to consider, retrospectively, whether we want them to be law. We can disallow them. But, in the main, Parliament is not involved in determining the detail of the delegated legislation. In this instance the Parliament wanted to have an idea about the nature of the total legislative scheme that the Government was desirous of putting in place. There was established a joint select committee comprising members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate to consider the detail. It was in the context of the committee review of the detail that the question arose of the way in which particular and difficult cases, where compassionate circumstances may be involved which are not covered by the general law-that is, the Act or the regulations made pursuant to the Act-might be dealt with. There was a good deal of discussion before the Bill, which we are now debating, was ultimately settled as an appropriate method to introduce circumstances where a Minister might well consider particular cases. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the discussions that took place, Opposition members were particularly mindful that Ministers had always had discretion under the framework of law that had operated before this and that that discretion was very wideranging, as the Minister himself pointed out in the Senate debate. In the context of that particular power that Ministers had in the past, where Ministers were able to make decisions, we had seen the development of administrative law where decisions of Ministers might be reviewed under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The matters that Ministers were required to determine in exercising their discretion were considerably widened over time while matters were deliberated on before administrative review tribunals and the Federal Court. I know that the Minister and the Government were very concerned that this had taken out of the hands of the Parliament and put in the hands of the courts and administrative tribunals the question of determining, broadly, migration entry, and that the whole thrust of the Government's program might well be jeopardised unless this matter was addressed. It was in the context of determining a way in which to resolve this difficult problem-which, at first instance, we thought might have been able to be addressed in regulations that the Joint Select Committee on Migration Legislation was looking at-that the discussion turned to a proposal whereby particular provisions in the Migration Legislation Amendment Act might be modified to provide an avenue whereby the Minister could, in a limited way, exercise in special cases discretion to take into account compassionate circumstances that might be put before him. </PARA>
<PARA> I also had a strong concern that under the arrangements that were put in place originally in section 64A of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act, the Minister previously was only able to look at the question of an individual case after a particular matter had been considered by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, by officers who were required to undertake a first-tier review and, later, by the Immigration Review Tribunal. There were provisions whereby the Minister could, in certain circumstances, where public interest was involved, substitute with a more favourable decision a decision taken in that process that I have outlined. In many cases that process could take months or years. Yet the compassionate circumstances that might be raised could involve severe illness-they could involve somebody with cancer; they could involve a situation where there was death or disability. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) had no capacity under the original legislation to intervene to ensure that a proper remedy was put in place. We now have a further compromise. I think it is in the spirit of the way in which this Parliament operates that in this very sensitive area the Government has been minded to accept suggestions which the Opposition has very strongly pressed upon it to amend the Act to provide for a situation whereby a Minister can intervene in the process before reviews are undertaken by the Immigration Review Tribunal and take quickly, where compassionate circumstances may be involved, a decision which is different from that which officers were able to take under the specific letter of the law that we have passed. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at this Bill we find that we have a Bill that introduces into the review process the power for the Minister to substitute a decision-that is, his decision-after the first tier of review has been undertaken by departmental officers. Where the Minister comes to that opinion, he may set aside the decision and put in his own. Similarly, after the more lengthy process has been determined, the former process under section 64u will remain. The legislation that we have before us asserts that once more. It is important that Ministers be able to deal with such cases quickly, that there be provision for the fast tracking which is not possible under the Immigration Review Tribunal. The Minister, rightly, came to the view that it would have been inappropriate, so far as the integrity of the Immigration Review Tribunal is concerned, were he to try to press-gang the Tribunal to speed up its own processes in order to expedite its decision so that the Minister could review it. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously in cases such as this it was proper that the Minister also came to the view that, in putting in place this amendment, people would have only two options-certainly not both options. The two options were that if people wanted to have their case reviewed they could have it reviewed at the first tier and then follow the route of the Immigration Review Tribunal, which would review the matter on law and questions of fact, or, if there were special circumstances in need of consideration, they could apply separately to the Minister for him to undertake the review we are placing in the legislation tonight. But people would not be in a position to avail themselves of both routes. That was part of the compromise that was reached. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his second reading speech canvassed a number of other questions which it is important in the context of this legislation that I discuss. Firstly, the Minister has clarified what is meant by `public interest'. Under section 64u as it was in place previously and as it is being re-enacted in the Bill which we are considering, the Minister may set aside a decision and substitute his own only where a public interest is involved. The section clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Minister thinks that it is in the public interest to do so, the Minister may . . . set aside a decision reviewed by a review officer . . . and substitute a decision that is more favourable to the applicant than the decision recommended by the review officer. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note what the Minister said in his second reading speech, because it clarifies very clearly what is meant by public interest. It makes it clear that the public interest also enables the Minister to consider the individual interest of the applicant as a factor in reaching his decision. I want to set out these words again. It is important that they be understood. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister's power to substitute a more favourable decision can only occur if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so. The term `public interest' is not limited solely to public issues. Consideration of the public interest could involve consideration of the circumstances of the particular case having regard to unusual, unforseen or other features that are deserving of a favourable response against the background of Australia being a compassionate and humane society. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to thank the Minister for making that position clear. It was one of the very important issues that needed to be addressed to ensure he did have an adequate discretion to deal with all appropriate circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to deal with is the way in which people are able to approach the Minister. Clearly, matters that are reviewable by the Minister, the review officers and the Tribunal are only decisions which are reached in relation to applications under one of the grounds set out in the Act and regulations. If a person's circumstances fall outside any of the categories that are provided in the regulations under the Act, then, on the face of it, that person cannot go before a review tribunal or a review officer and does not have a reviewable position. The Minister has made it clear in correspondence that in situations where cases may not be dealt with under a particular criteria for migrant entry-where their claim is on humanitarian or compassionate grounds and there is no existing category for entry-it is possible that people will put forward a sham proposal, a proposal that is for a category into which the person clearly does not fit. The person might claim to be a spouse even though the relationship was one of a homosexual partner, for instance. In that instance the person might seek ministerial involvement because the officer could not grant a place that was clearly outside the defined category-and the Minister would be in a position to review a non-reviewable case. The Minister would be in a position to invoke his power because the application had been rejected as falling outside the prescribed criteria of a particular class. I use those words because those are the words used by the Minister in explaining to me and my colleagues who wanted to know how, in cases where no class exists, people would be able to get the Minister to look at those situations. That is a separate question but a very important question that the Minister has clarified. I welcome his cooperation in ensuring that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter that I want to address in relation to this subject is the fact that the Minister did have a concern-he outlined it in the Senate-that Ministers in the past may have exercised the discretion that they have had irresponsibly. He gave two examples. One was of a Minister who admitted over 100,000 people, using his discretion. I find it extraordinary that that could have happened. I do not know who the Minister is referring to. I am certain that it was not a Minister from this side of the House. Obviously it is important that the Parliament be aware of the way in which a power of this sort is exercised. We do have requirements for public reporting. There is a specific provision for public reporting in relation to the new power that is being introduced: the Minister will report six-monthly on the way in which he has exercised this power in particular circumstances. I hope that, in the form in which it is put, it will not be an unreasonable fetter in terms of the Minister properly exercising this power, but I do regard it as important that the Parliament and the people of Australia be aware of the way in which the provisions are being exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> I have covered at length the nature of the legislation we are dealing with tonight because it is an important part of the compromises that have been reached to ensure that the Government's Migration Legislation Act is able to operate with regulations in place. I do not want it to be thought that our willingness to carry legislation of this sort, and the concern we had that the Parliament ought to be involved in reviewing regulations, in any way condones the way in which this legislation has been handled by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of simple points I would like to make. This is a major exercise of law making. It is of momentous proportion. The original legislation was complex and difficult. The Government could not show us regulations six months ago and, as a result of hard work by undoubtedly competent and diligent officers, regulations have been produced which run to something of the order of 195 clauses in one case, together with schedules, and in other cases equally complex and difficult regulations dealing with a whole range of other issues. Having been trained in the law, having some experience in the area of migration, and having had more notice of these regulations than most other people have, I must say-this is now law; it is now in place-that I have little real comprehension of the way in which this law operates. Having regard to the amount of time I have spent on it-there are people who have had one-day courses, such as my secretary, or half-day courses, and staff members in the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, who are getting documents thrust upon them day by day-I just sit here in awe at their capacity if they are to have any competence in dealing with these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you may detect from my cynicism that the legislation is so complex that I do not believe, having regard to the timetable that is pursued, that it can be properly and competently administered and that people will have justice in considering the outcomes of their applications. In fact, the Minister recognises that these documents may be flawed and that they may have to be amended day after day and month after month as the detail is addressed. I want to make it clear and make sure that everybody understands that the Opposition did not agree with that procedure. We have tried to cooperate with the Government. We went to the Government and said, `We know that this legislation has to operate within six months. We know the regulations have to apply by 19 December'. On 24 November I wrote to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. This Parliament was still sitting; it sat until 30 November. The Minister had time. He tried to suggest in the Senate that he did not have time and that if amendments were to be dealt with by both Houses of Parliament they could not have been dealt with until after the commencement date of 19 December. He was clearly wrong. I hope he will admit his error on that matter. I wrote to him on 24 November on that very issue. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless I believe that for more abundant precaution it might be appropriate that you give consideration to an amendment to section 4 to enable the proclamation-</PARA>
<PARA>that is of the Act and the regulations-</PARA>
<PARA>to be deferred for a further period by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In that way the matter would still be in your hands but it would mean that if for any reason the new administrative arrangements you contemplate are unable to be put in place you would then be in a position to ensure that existing administrative arrangements remain in place and our immigration program is not interrupted. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that this decision should be made and the judgment formed at a point closer to a date for implementation of the new administrative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> These comments are not meant as any reflection on the competence of your professional officers who I believe have endeavoured to draft the regulations on very tight deadlines. However it is a pity that a good deal more work had not commenced on the regulations before the Migration Legislation Amendment Act came before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern still remains that the range of possible defects in this new regulatory framework is such that a good deal more public exposure for comment would be a more desirable way to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>He had that pledge of cooperation from the Opposition that if he wanted to alter the commencement date it could have been postponed. We have seen editorials from newspapers and comments from interested organisations. We know of their concerns; we know that there are possible defects. All these matters were clearly in the Government's contemplation. It could have postponed the implementation of this law. The problem we have is that there may well be complex legal challenges. As a result of the haste with which this law has been implemented, there may well be a significant number of injustices to individuals. I am concerned that it brings the whole immigration law into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it needs to be clearly understood that this matter has been dealt with in this way because of the Government's desire, the Government's intention. The Government had another route available to it and spurned it. The Minister said that it was not within his purpose. He was concerned that a lot of work had been done, officers had been briefed, some costs were involved and some printing had been undertaken. These were the sorts of matters that were of concern to him. I think he runs the risk that the costs of postponing the implementation of this legislation may well be minuscule in comparison to the greater costs that will be incurred in litigation, the greater costs that will be incurred by uncertainty. I say to the Minister: `It is on your head; it is on the Government's head'. There was another route; there was another way. Those people who are interested in this question, who believe that greater public consultation could have delivered regulations that were more workable, more just and more appropriate, should know that the Government forwent the opportunity of dealing with this matter in a more leisurely but appropriate way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am in a slightly difficult position in replying to some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) because, as he knows, I am the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations and the Joint Select Committee's deliberations are at this stage confidential. However, he did refer to a number of matters, including the issue before us, which is to amend the Act to allow for greater discretion by the Minister, and I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I address myself first to the concluding comments of the honourable member in relation to the process. It is very easy to learn about things after the event, but the process that was determined in June was agreed to by all parties. That process was that the draft regulations-not the final recommendations-would be considered on a confidential basis. We do not even have the final regulations now, because the regulations are to be added to and amended in the future, as has been made perfectly clear by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray). I will come back to that point in a moment as well. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems strange for the Opposition to raise on 24 November the issue concerning the process when it agreed to the process way back in June. We have to go back to the way this has evolved. The Committee was formed because the Opposition insisted on something which does not normally take place in this Parliament-namely, the scrutiny of regulations before they are gazetted. These regulations are the only major regulations that we are aware of put before the Parliament that have actually been scrutinised by a parliamentary committee before they were gazetted. No provisions applying after the regulations are gazetted have been taken away. First of all, the parliamentary committee will make a public parliamentary report after five sitting days and, as everyone knows, that means in February. So the Joint Committee has until February to make its observations public in relation to the regulations as gazetted. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, because of this public process, we will be able to overcome the problem which the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas, referred to-namely, the complaints from people that there has been insufficient public consultation. It was very difficult to have public consultation when the Committee's terms of reference had been set down for a confidential process. After the regulations are gazetted, there is nothing to prevent a public consultation process, and the Committee has determined-and honourable members on the Committee from the Opposition know that the Committee has determined-to go into a public consultation and submission process in relation to the regulations. That will happen when the parliamentary report is brought down. So it is not correct to say, as some critics out in the community have said, that these regulations were brought out purely in secret and that there is going to be no public consultation; in fact, there will be. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee went beyond the original terms of reference and actually received confidential submissions from the major organisations concerned with this area. Some of the organisations that have made criticisms are the very same organisations that were provided with the draft regulations on which to comment on a confidential basis, and they provided submissions to the Committee. It is true that there was not enough time-because of the time span involved-for them to make major submissions. It would have been better to have had more time, but the organisations will now be able to make public submissions in this second stage. After the parliamentary report comes down, the Parliament has 15 sitting days in which to make a determination as to whether to accept or reject the regulations, as it does with all regulations. So we now have very much a transformation from a confidential process into a public process. I give the assurance to the public and to those organisations that are concerned that we will be doing that and looking at that public process of consultation and submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, no matter how much of a public process takes place, the fundamental point made by the Minister in his response to the honourable member for Dundas is correct. Unless the regulations are actually put down and we see how they operate and see where errors may inadvertently occur, the process will never get going. It is a fact that we were under pressure not merely because of the deadline set down in the legislation but also from all the people who wanted to see how a new migration system would operate in full bloom. The fact is that the Minister has accepted the vast majority of the recommendations in the first report of the Joint Select Committee. Not only has he accepted the recommendations in relation to changes to the regulations, but he has also accepted-and this is very important-that the problem of discretion and compassion, which was pointed out by the Committee in a whole chapter of the report, needed to be dealt with by changes in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister seemed to suggest that the changes came as a result of representations from the Opposition. That is only partly the case. As the Minister states in his second reading speech, the changes came as a result of the concern expressed, in particular, by the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. So the Committee's report was significant in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) being debated now. I made the point earlier that it is important for the system to be put in place, for us to see how it operates and if there are problems to iron them out. That is when public discussion and submissions can be very useful, because we can then see, in the actual operation of the system, those problems which may arise. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important point is that the media has emphasised that it is the area of illegal migrants, and people who wish to change status if they come here as visitors and tourists, in which there are harsh and difficult regulations. In my view, it is a disgrace that the media has ignored the fact that the new system is going to be much fairer and has already demonstrated itself to be much fairer for the biggest and most important section of the migration program-that is, family reunion. There is no doubt that the new system will be fairer and has already demonstrated itself to be fairer in relation to family reunion. To everyone's surprise, the new pool mark-no one has commented on this-for the family reunion system is 85 points. That compares to 80 points under the previous system. But the difference is that under the previous system one could only get 10 points for the family relationship and now one can get up to 35 points for the family relationship. In other words, the 1989-90 family program-the key immigration program-will be fairer and easier than the tough program of 1988-89. This point has been ignored by the media and, to their shame, by some of the critics from the ethnic communities, who were the very people insisting on a program. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the House that the recommendation of FitzGerald was that the family and independent categories be merged into one, whereas the Government has accepted an alternative suggestion and has kept the categories separate. This means that the family category has a pass mark of 85 and the independent category has a pass mark of 100. There is no doubt that the system now is much fairer than it has been for many years, enabling Australian citizens and residents to sponsor and reunite with their families. In addition, the fact that the English language requirement has been taken out of the family reunion program has made that program fair internationally. There is no doubt that we have before us a very fair system indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the regulations are complex. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said, `This is all too complex for me'. I think he is understating his capacity for understanding. After all-and I can reveal this about the parliamentary committee-he certainly did not show a lack of understanding when the Committee was going through the regulations tirelessly, one at a time, for so many hours. Nevertheless, I believe that while the system of new regulations will be difficult initially, it has the great advantage that it guarantees entry to people once they have fulfilled the criteria of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> This system takes immigration out of the realm of subjectivity, and makes it much more objective. For example, in addition to the large category of family reunion that I referred to before, there are certain special categories such as the last remaining relative, or a special needs relative. All of these people will be able to come in. It will not be a matter of subjectivity, it will be a matter of objective criteria; that is, whether or not they meet those conditions. The 190 pages, or whatever it is, are needed to specify those rules; nevertheless, the result will be much greater objectivity in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it will take time for people to get used to this system. That is one reason why I have argued that in some ways it is better to bring it in to see how it operates. If we come across any unintentional or excessively harsh consequences, we can fix them up, and we can make submissions to the parliamentary committee in relation to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the crux of the legislation which, as I say, came from the recommendations of the joint parliamentary committee. The crux is that under section 64u-namely the Minister's discretionary power, as it existed under the Act that was brought in in June-the Minister's power was seen to be too limited to deal with a certain problem that arose in relation to the regulations. What was the problem? The problem was, what would happen in cases where there were compassionate circumstances and it could be argued that a person should be admitted, notwithstanding the fact that he had failed to meet a requirement within a particular category?</PARA>
<PARA> In the Act, as it was brought in, the position was that the Minister could look at those compassionate circumstances after that person had been rejected in the first review by the Department, and rejected in the second review by the Immigration Review Tribunal. It was argued that what was needed was a mechanism to deal with urgent and important cases; cases where it is important to deal with a matter quickly rather than have the delays which would occur if people had to go through the whole system before they could appeal to the Minister on compassionate grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached an agreement on how to deal with this problem, and the honourable member for Dundas has commended the Government for reaching this agreement. In future, if people are rejected in the first tier, they will be able to appeal immediately to the Minister if there are urgent circumstances. That means that the Minister can come into the process much earlier and consider the case at that point. This is important in cases where there are additional compassionate circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important in another case which was concerning us, and that is the case where a person does not fit into any category. People may want to apply but cannot apply under a particular category, or if they applied under a particular category that category might not really take account of the real reasons why they were applying to come to Australia. In that case, one way to go would have been to create a special category to deal with such people. That approach has not been accepted and, instead, what has been accepted is the approach which allows the Minister-under the expanded section 64u-to deal with the matter in the way in which I have explained; that is, after the person has been rejected at the first tier that person can appeal to the Minister and be dealt with under that special discretionary power. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dundas raised a problem with this. He asked why should people who cannot apply under these categories be expected to apply in a bogus way under a particular category? He used the example of a homosexual who wanted to be with his partner having to apply under the category of spouse when he was clearly not a spouse. A person in that situation can apply under a number of categories. He does not have to apply as a spouse, he could apply under the category of independent migration. If he has relatives in Australia he could apply under the family reunion category. He could apply under a number of other categories which are established. In fact, there are nearly 60 categories under which people can apply in the new immigration system. Therefore, in that case, that person would apply under one of those categories-the one that he considers best suited for his purposes-and could then be considered because of the additional compassionate circumstances which he might want to bring to the attention of the Minister. That is the way in which the system will proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, much depends on the Minister's desire to exercise the amendments to section 64u. If a Minister does not feel like exercising that power very much, that Minister will look at only a small number of cases. On the other hand, a Minister who feels like exercising that power comprehensively may desire to look at a very large number of cases. The situation is left in the hands of the Minister. There is no requirement-and this is very important-for the Minister to look at cases if he does not feel that the compassionate circumstances warrant anything more than a cursory glance. In other words, the Minister can decide to use his own system for determining which of those cases will come to his attention and how to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> That is as it should be. The matters that should come to the attention of the Minister in relation to immigration laws are those which will be determined by the government of the day. That principle is important. The government can consult Parliament comprehensively but, ultimately, the responsibility for the final decisions on immigration must lie with the government of the day, and this is embedded in the new discretionary power. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the extension of this discretionary power, I welcome this Bill and I welcome the changes that have taken place. I say to the honourable member for Dundas: let the system operate and let us see if it operates in the best possible way. Where there are problems, the parliamentary committee can deal with them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that if people are listening to the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 they would be surprised that, although both the Government and the Opposition are giving their wholehearted support to the legislation, there seems to be an enormous amount of disputation in the chamber. That probably bears a little of explanation. I was quite fascinated by some of the things that the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said in his speech. Amongst other things, a number of times he contradicted what the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) is on record as saying about the Bill as well as a couple of other areas. I am very pleased to have the honourable member for Calwell to refer to when having further discussions with the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The essence of the dispute is not the actual Bill, although the Opposition is certainly not 100 per cent happy about it and thinks this matter could have been handled in a more satisfactory way. Nevertheless, the Opposition is pleased that this much movement has taken place. The essence of the dispute is that the legislation is inextricably bound up with the regulations which were gazetted on just Monday this week. It is because of the consideration of those regulations that this amendment is before Parliament at all. This is not an afterthought that the Minister had last week about a Bill that passed the Parliament last June. This amendment relates to ministerial discretion and it has come about because of discussions that have taken place in relation to, as the honourable member for Calwell said, some confidential documents, which limits me in what I can say. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the greatest difficulty with part of the central thesis of the honourable member's argument. We have something which is totally unprecedented in my 16 years of experience of Parliament. This is an entire change in our migration system. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) pointed out how voluminous are the regulations that have been gazetted this week. They are not all the regulations that are necessary for the operation of the system: some regulations have not been written; there are transitional regulations; and modification of existing regulations is required. It should be borne in mind that the reference the honourable member made to the number of regulations concerned only one section of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never before encountered a rewriting of a system to the extent that the Migration Legislation Amendment Act does. In addition, these enormous number of regulations have an enormous effect. This is landmark legislation and a landmark way of going about something. A system that has operated in a certain way for decades-namely, essentially on statements of ministerial policy and instruction-has become codified. This is a very radical departure from the previous system. Under those circumstances, it would not have been at all unusual for the Government to have made fully publicly available its draft regulations, or most of them. Enforcement or policy reasons may have meant that a few could not have been made available, and I concede that. Governments commonly make available discussion drafts of Bills when something major is going to happen. I have seen Bills lie before this Parliament for a couple of years while there is comment and inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA> I have to take issue with the Minister in relation to some of the things he said about the timing of this legislation. Senator Jenkins, the Australian Democrat spokesperson on immigration, made some comments in the Senate. I would like to read the Minister's reply. In response to the assertion that seemed to be gathering some strength that the Democrats were to blame for the fact that the regulations had to be in place by 19 December, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government's own drafting instructions state that although it is the Government's preference for legislation to be proclaimed no later than six months after passing through the Parliament, nonetheless the Minister has the option of a later date provided there is a suitable reason. I would have thought that very complex legislation which depends on very complex and numerous regulations would provide such a reason. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister, of course, had an indication of that before the regulations were proclaimed. He had the offer of support from the Opposition and he had a detailed way of doing it. Nevertheless, the Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA>We were asked at one stage to defer the Bill. There was a practical problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA>He then ran through the dates and said:</PARA>
<PARA>A fresh Bill on 28 November was a possibility, but all these things have to go through some sort of process, through party rooms, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA>If that was the reason that the Government did not take up the suggestion made to it by the Opposition-and specifically by the honourable member for Dundas-what procedures have been followed with the Bill before us tonight? I was the acting shadow Minister when this Bill first saw the light of day last Thursday. The House of Representatives was not sitting. I heard over the telephone that it existed. That was the first the Opposition knew about it. It was introduced into the Senate, debated and voted on that day. There was not too much concern about party rooms. The detailed amendment had not been shown to anyone in the Opposition prior to that. There was no worry about Government Caucus. It shows that the procedure that the Minister himself has followed is possible if the need is there. I take the strongest possible objection to the suggestion that somehow the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations has played some sort of role in the delay. I want to cite something the Minister said on that subject in the Senate last week:</PARA>
<PARA>I make it quite clear that the agreed process was that the Committee was to give me its observations by 21 November. That did not prove possible. I did not kick up at all. I extended the deadline even though the Parliament had dictated otherwise, and waited. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the Minister had had the situation explained to him, he gave the regulations to the Committee on the worst possible date. There was a flaw which had not been detected in the resolution which appointed the Committee. As acting Chairman I had pointed out to the Minister as soon as the flaw was detected that he should avoid giving the regulations to us on 31 October because there were provisions for how the Committee had to proceed if given them before or after 31 October, but not on that day. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of the generosity of its collective heart, the Committee decided to treat the regulations as though it had received them before 31 October in order to try to meet the 21 November reporting date. It was under no obligation to do so. It tried to cooperate with the Minister. Nevertheless, there were inevitably delays in getting some advice. We were provided several days later with one set of review regulations which we considered essential to consideration of the legislation. We worked very hard indeed to try to get the reports in. Under those circumstances, I will not sit still in this chamber on any occasion that it is suggested that somehow the Select Committee has delayed things or added to the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred to something headed `policy control instruction' from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. This refers to procedures advice manuals which have been published and are being issued to guide those involved in advising people what they must do under the new regulations and legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is described as being used as a companion to the Act and regulations to aid decision making for applications lodged on and from 19 December 1989. A number of these policy control instructions start with the heading `Corrigendum and Supplementation to PAM subject'. The booklets have been printed and already the corrigenda are going out. There is a standard paragraph that appears in the advice that relates to corrigenda. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> The PAM contains relevant extracts from the Migration Regulations, however because of printing deadlines the contents were, of necessity, prepared prior to the outcome of the extended timetable provided to the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations. The PAM content has, in places, therefore been somewhat affected by the outcome of the Committee's consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make two points. The Committee did not actually have an extended timetable. It had a truncated timetable because of the date on which the Minister gave the regulations to it. Secondly, that statement that the content has been somewhat affected by the outcome of the Committee's consideration appears as a covering note on matters on which the Committee did not make any recommendation for change. So it is being used as an excuse for putting out corrigenda when that was not the reason on some occasions. I am not going to allow that assertion to become standard wisdom either. There is something else that I am not going to allow to happen. I am not going to allow the Minister to try to have people think that he should be a legend in his own lifetime. In his reply to the second reading of this Bill in the Senate he said some pretty extraordinary stuff. An amendment was moved by Senator Jenkins which added these words to the motion for the second reading of the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Senate condemns the Government for setting in motion the process of making complex and weighty Migration Amendment Legislation which depends heavily on Regulations, which are themselves equally complex and weighty, without first giving the Parliament a proper opportunity to scrutinise and approve those Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>In his response the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>For the first time ever we circulate the regulations to a select committee to look into them. It in turn circulates them publicly--</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Teague interjected `Not publicly'. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Not publicly? They went to only 20 or 30 different groups. They are only in the possession of about 50,000 Australians at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>One suspects that the Minister was a little emotional when he made that assertion. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot find one person involved in immigration who does not have a copy of them. </PARA>
<PARA>I can find lots of people involved in immigration who still do not have a copy of them. They cannot afford them. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We have gone through all that process for the first time in history and probably for the first time in history I get a motion canning me for doing it. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I say `No; we will bring you all into the process. We will set up a select committee; we will let you examine the regulations; we will go through a series of negotiations and all that'. So what do we end up with? We end up with an amendment condemning us for doing that. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins, a Government senator, interjected, `You're a mug'. Senator Ray said:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins says that I am a mug. I would have to agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA>At that point one could hear the tears rolling down the Minister's cheek. The Minister did not set up the Committee. The Chairman of the Committee, a Government member, told us tonight why the Government set up the Committee. It was because the Opposition was not going to let the Minister have his Migration Legislation Amendment Bill if he did not agree to it: the Bill that changed the whole procedure. It was a condition of passage of that Bill that Parliament have an input into scrutiny of the regulations. It was stated in debate here that we would not agree to a move like this that was going to put so much into regulations, including Government policy, which would be restricting rights that existed, unless Parliament got a look at them, the way Parliament can look at legislation. I am sorry, but the Minister is not going to take credit for setting up the Committee-absolutely not. He has been very cooperative with the Committee. He is a cooperative Minister to deal with. Sometimes he is a fairly tough Minister to deal with. I do not want him to get too carried away with how golden hearted he was because he really did not want the Committee. There would not have been a Committee if he could have helped it, but he could not help it. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the circulation of the draft regulations is concerned, since I was the Acting Chairman at the time that happened I will place on the record the circumstances under which it happened. The Committee felt in advance that it needed some expert advice. How right it was. Thousands of people are going to need expert advice, now that the regulations are public, on what the devil they mean. The Committee drew up a list of peak organisations. It wrote to them and said it was going to have available some draft regulations. It would be looking at them on an extremely tight timetable. They were confidential and would remain confidential until the regulations were published by the Government. However, we said we would appreciate the opportunity for some outside input. Provided those organisations agreed to accept the regulations on the clear understanding they were to be kept totally confidential, they could have a copy but we were not going to give them one otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Every organisation which received a copy of the draft regulations through the Committee had given a prior undertaking that it understood that and it would abide by the confidentiality. It appears that one, two, three or more broke the confidentiality, although not very badly. The issue surfaced only a couple of times. Interestingly, it was in Melbourne on both occasions, once in a small report in the Age and once in a radio report. It is really amazing when we think of it that there were not more breaches of confidentiality. There was very little, and I would like to put on record my thanks to those people who did abide by the undertaking of confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing I would like to do is refer to some statements that have been made in this debate and quote from an editorial in the Australian. The honourable member for Calwell, who spoke before me, told us the way to do it, as the Minister has. He says that we should put these regulations into effect and then find out what is wrong with them. What a horror. There are so many things in those regulations that are going to cause trouble. They are going to have to be changed. It could have been pointed out before people's positions were prejudiced and before we all started to get much older than we needed to do before our time. The editorial in today's Australian states:</PARA>
<PARA> The new immigration regulations are a textbook example of the worst way of making and promulgating laws in a highly sensitive area. </PARA>
<PARA> That intent of the regulations-to be tough on illegal immigrants-is laudable. Indeed, it is essential. But the execution has been clumsy and unfair. </PARA>
<PARA>... ... ... </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration, Senator Ray, has admitted the rules may be too harsh, especially as they apply to the spouses of Australian citizens. They will need still further amendment. He justifies this approach by saying it is better to start off by being harsh and then become more lenient. This is a silly assertion. It is much better to get it right the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Immigration Department, which traditionally has been lax in enforcing the law against illegal immigrants, has now over-reacted. </PARA>
<PARA>I distance myself a little from that statement. I do not think that is entirely fair. The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The regulations have the air of a Public Service operating in its most thoroughly bureaucratic manner. They show little understanding of how people actually live their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Administrative trial and error is no way to proceed in an area which so affects the lives of Australians, the lives of those who would like to become Australians and the future composition of our population. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not have said it better myself. It is a fact that in immigration we are talking about individual lives and individual cases. We have this amendment before us tonight. It is essential that there be a capacity for ministerial discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I must distance myself from a statement the Minister made-he has made it more than once in Parliament-about how ministerial discretion operates. On 30 May he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a parliamentarian comes up to me and says, `Please let so and so's brother stay, he has a lot of votes'. </PARA>
<PARA>This is in relation to a change of status. He said it in another case about members saying, `Look, I have a marginal seat. If you'll approve this one for me it will help me'. He is a Labor Minister. No Liberals are going to him and saying, `I hold a marginal seat which the Labor Party might be winning. Will you give me this decision, Minister?'. That is not happening. It is a sad indictment of what is going on behind the scenes. In 16 years I have seen a Minister three times and asked him to exercise his discretion. I have asked for a Minister's discretion more often, but I have seen a Minister on the subject three times. On one occasion it was because an allegation had been made to me about corruption in one of our overseas posts. I wanted to pass on the allegation. I did not know whether it was right but I wanted him to know about it. On one other occasion the Minister rang me and asked for further explanation of an aspect of a case. The third situation was so wild that if it was put in writing no one would have believed it. I knew it to be true and I simply wanted to assure the Minister that I was not writing a fairy tale and that it was right. It is not overused but in every case when I have used it it has been essential. The case has been deserving of very compassionate consideration. There is no way, when we are talking about individuals, that we can cover them all in a just way in regulations. That use of ministerial discretion in extremely compassionate cases is essential. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments to the Family Law Act will clarify the rights and obligations of parents and the rights of their children after separation. While the major impact of the amendments will be to provide force to orders, the Family Law Amendment Bill also provides a mechanism to ensure that the parties and the courts will address underlying problems in the difficult area of access to ensure that the needs of all parties to a dispute are met in the most appropriate way. The amendments will also provide a range of sanctions which are more appropriate to the particular problems created when an order concerning the parent-child relationship has been breached. In most cases where the parent's relationship has broken down, the welfare of a child will be best secured by the child retaining contact with each parent. This legislation has the objective of promoting a climate in which such contact can be maintained notwithstanding the failure of parents to communicate or agree on other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In early 1983 the Australian Law Reform Commission was requested to investigate and report on the law of contempt. The Commission provided a lengthy report in 1987 in which it gave some particular attention to the problems posed by family law matters. In its report the Commission described the relationship between the Family Court's role as a `helping' court in which conciliation was emphasised and the penalties available for contempt of court as a `central paradox'. The maintenance of traditional concepts of rights and their enforcement by penalty can only preserve the existence of that paradox. The problem that is posed for some parents in enforcing orders that they have access to their children was also addressed in 1987 by the Family Law Council. The Government has been assisted greatly by the reports provided by the Law Reform Commission and the Family Law Council. In addition to those reports we have also sought and received public comment on the issues addressed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act now provides courts with the power to punish a person for contempt or for so-called `Quasi-contempt'. There are two contempt and two `Quasi-contempt' provisions. To some extent they overlap and there is no clear guide to the circumstances to which each offence will apply. The `Quasi contempt' provisions are to be repealed and replaced with a single non-compliance provision. This will clarify the law in relation to acts and omissions which amount to non-compliance with a court order and define the boundary between what is and what is not a contempt of court. Where a court is satisfied that a person has failed to comply with an order and had no reasonable cause for not complying, the court may impose a penalty. The penalties available include those now available for `Quasi-contempt' such as fines, imprisonment, the placing of a person on a bond, delivery of documents or a document such as a passport to a court officer, or sequestration of property. Two significant additions are to be made to the range of penalty options which are available to a court. </PARA>
<PARA> A major addition to the range of sentencing options is the inclusion of community based corrections such as community service orders. There are a range of such penalties now available to the courts when sentencing a person for offences under the criminal law. The amendments will make such sanctions available in response to civil offences for the first time. The novel use of such sanctions in the civil area was recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission, and has the support of the Family Law Council. The practical availability of community based sanctions will depend on negotiations with the States and Territories. Those negotiations have commenced in the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, where there has been a favourable response to a proposal that further negotiations occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The negotiations will deal with three major topics. First, it must be determined which of the sanctions referred to in the amending Bill will be made available by each State and Territory. Secondly, there is the issue of the number of hours which a person may be required to attend under such an order. In the criminal area, in which we apply State or Territory law, the maximum limit of a community based sentence varies from State to State. For instance, in Tasmania the maximum limit is 240 hours while in Victoria the maximum limit is 500 hours. The Bill provides a mechanism to fix a common maximum penalty. It is important that the penalty which is imposed by a court should not be dependent on where one lives in Australia. Thirdly, there is the issue of payment to States and Territories for the use of their facilities. In the criminal law area the Commonwealth does not make any direct payment for the provision of such facilities. An indirect payment is made through the revenue sharing arrangements but States have a constitutional responsibility to provide facilities where a person has been convicted of an offence against the Commonwealth. A person found to have contravened a family law order will not be convicted of an offence against the Commonwealth and accordingly it is appropriate that the Commonwealth meet the reasonable cost of provision of facilities by States and Territories in an area of Commonwealth responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> An important issue for the courts to consider in determining whether to impose an alternative sentencing option will be whether such a sanction should be an alternative to imprisonment or an alternative to other options. In the Bill no attempt has been made to fetter the discretion of courts in this area. However, the Government will monitor the use of alternative sentencing alternatives carefully as there could be significant resource implications if an expectation were developed that sanctions such as community service orders were the standard sanction for non-compliance. In the Government's view such a sanction should be sparingly used. </PARA>
<PARA> The second addition to the range of sanctions which a court may impose is that a court may order compensatory access. This power is one which courts now possess but the absence of a specific provision to make clear the possibility of compensatory access has had the effect of limiting the claims of those who have been denied access unreasonably. While the provision will make a previously little used course of action more likely to be used in the future, it should by no means be assumed that compensatory access will be granted every time access is withheld. As in all matters affecting children, the welfare of a child will be the paramount consideration and, accordingly, compensatory access may not be ordered if there are circumstances which rule such an order. </PARA>
<PARA> The other sanctions which may be imposed under new subsection 112ad are sanctions of a type now found in the existing contempt and quasi-contempt provisions. However, even in relation to the existing sanctions some important changes have been made. It will no longer be open to a court to imprison a person for an unlimited term in order to coerce compliance with an earlier order. An order that a person go to goal until he or she has complied with an order can be of value only for a limited time. After that time, the order fails to achieve its purpose and can no longer be justified. The Bill provides that the maximum period for which a person may be imprisoned for failure to comply with an order is 12 months. That limitation is, in one respect, an expansion of some existing penalties available under the Act. At present the maximum term of imprisonment for contravening a custody or access order or for breaching an injunction is three months. However there is no maximum term of imprisonment if a contravention is dealt with as a contempt of court. The maximum term of 12 months is subject to an important caveat. New subsections 112ae (2), (3) and (4) provide an obligation for courts considering the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment to consider other options and to state the reasons for rejecting the other options, including the additional sentencing alternatives previously mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Sequestration of the property of a person who has contravened an order remains a sanction but may be addressed to an individual as well as a corporation. The removal of a limitation on sequestration to the assets of a company merely removes an anomaly which has restricted the coercive powers of the courts. Sequestration is, of course, a traditional method of securing compliance with an order. </PARA>
<PARA>Child Agreements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The 1987 amendments to the Family Law Act introduced the concept of child agreements, whereby parents simply file their agreement at a court registry thus avoiding the expense of a court hearing. Child agreements have been a valuable means for parties to obtain the benefit of the provisions of the Act to enforce or vary their agreement. To date, such agreements have been limited to matters affecting custody, guardianship, or access. Any agreement in relation to child maintenance has been dealt with under section 86 of the Act, which has been well understood and used since 1976 and is not to be amended. However, that section applies only to agreements made by the parties to a marriage. The 1987 amendments did not include any provision for parents to register an agreement as to a child's maintenance if they had not been married. The amendments made by clauses 4, 7 and 8 will allow the parents of ex-nuptial children, in relation to whom four States have referred power to the Commonwealth, to register their agreement and thereby avoid unnecessary and costly proceedings for an order. </PARA>
<PARA>Information as to the Whereabouts</PARA>
<PARA>of a Child</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Clauses 5 and 6 of this Bill revise existing sections 64 (11a) and (11b) of the Family Law Act. The amendment will ensure that information as to the whereabouts of a child is provided during a period of 12 months rather than only relating to information held by the person at the time the order is served. Because a broader obligation to provide information has been created there is provision made to ensure that an unnecessarily onerous duty is not placed on information holders. Accordingly, if a child is located and returned to its parent the parent is to be required to advise any person who is required to provide information as to the whereabouts of the child that the information is no longer required. A government department or instrumentality will not be required to search its records more frequently than each three months. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Institute of Family Studies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Clause 24 of the Bill will enable a transfer of ministerial responsibility in relation to the Australian Institute of Family Studies from the Attorney-General to the Minister for Social Security. The Government has carefully considered the most appropriate placement of those organisations established under the Act which provide advice in relation to family issues. Advice is provided by the Institute, in relation to broad social and economic issues affecting family life, and by the Family Law Council, in relation to the operation of family law and legal aid legislation. The Institute's work is in an area which has considerable impact on the social security system and it is more appropriate that the existing links between the work of the Institute and the social security system be strengthened. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From time to time the Family Law Act, since it was passed in 1975, has been amended. It is probably inevitable that, in view of the sensitive subject matter of the Act, it will continue to be amended as community needs and perceptions change. However, it should be noted that the Opposition's law and justice policy proposes what we believe to be a much better way of tackling proposed amendments to the Family Law Act rather than the piecemeal method which has been adopted from time to time. I say that because the Opposition's law and justice policy proposes a complete review by a parliamentary committee of both the Family Law Act and the Family Court. We really firmly believe that, until that review takes place, individual proposals for further amendments will have to be judged on their individual merits. But what we can almost guarantee is that, until there is such a wide-ranging review, piecemeal amendments will continue to be brought up from time to time and that will not solve the basic problems that there may be in the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, it is often said when a suggestion is made that there should be a parliamentary committee that that is an abrogation of responsibility; that it is just putting off a difficult problem. We believe that that is not the case. We believe it is particularly not the case in the area of the Family Law Act and the Family Court. There are several reasons why what I say is the case. When we come to consider it, members of parliament are one of those very valuable repositories of experience in the community. Many people come to members of parliament with problems that either they have experienced themselves or which they have heard of concerning the Family Law Act and its effect and concerning the Family Court and the effect of some of its orders. That often happens in the case of members of parliament. So members of parliament are really a vast repository of accumulated experience of those problems, perceived or real, which have arisen and will continue to arise so far as the Family Law Act and the Family Court are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, amongst others, we believe that it would be very useful to bring that experience together and for members of parliament who have accumulated that experience to sit on a committee, bring their expertise to bear on those problems and fashion solutions, which one hopes could be solutions that would probably lead to one batch of amendments to the family law system, which would enable the system to settle down without this continued piecemeal amending process that goes on. That is the reason why we have proposed a parliamentary committee to look at the Family Law Act and the Family Court. We believe that it is a very good policy and one which will be endorsed by the Australian people at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I know, the Family Law Amendment Bill 1989, which we have before us, is the fourth group of amendments since 1983. Some of the amendments come from deliberations of the Law Reform Commission and the Family Law Council of Australia, some of them come from government decisions, and some of them are more technical amendments which have been found to be necessary as the system has proceeded along. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just heard the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and, therefore, it is not necessary for me go into these proposed amendments to the Family Law Act in any detail at all. We support the Bill, although it is a free vote so far as members on this side of the Parliament are concerned. With the exception of one amendment, the disposition of Opposition members in general would be to support the legislation. That one amendment relates to the transfer of the Australian Institute of Family Studies from the Attorney-General to the Minister for Social Security, and I will come to that later. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address a few brief remarks to some of the most significant changes contained in this Bill. My first remarks relate to orders made by the court. The Family Court, like all courts, makes orders to enforce what it has judged to be right. It makes orders on things such as the custody of children and the payment of maintenance. But the Family Court has had more trouble in enforcing its orders than most courts have. The ultimate penalty is imprisonment and, because judges are reluctant to impose that penalty when people do not comply with their orders, as a result some court orders have gone unenforced. It has been felt, therefore, that in addition to the traditional forms of penalty an order for community work service may be effective, and the Bill will give this additional power to the Family Court. The Law Reform Commission and the Family Law Council support this proposal, and we support it likewise. At the very least we think it is a power worthwhile giving to the Family Court and we will be very interested to see the sorts of orders made, the frequency with which they are made and the effectiveness of those orders after they are carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to refer to is imprisonment because, at the same time, the Government has admitted, or asserted, that permanent or open-ended imprisonment as a penalty really does not work in matrimonial causes. Of course, this is now to be amended to allow a maximum of only 12 months imprisonment. Perhaps some people might say that that will not work for only 12 months rather than not working permanently and, therefore, is an improvement. But in any event, it is a desirable amendment. Again, it is one of those things which really should be monitored to see how it is put into practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area relates to access. An additional form of access to children is to be allowed and it is to be called `compensatory access'. In summary, if one party fails to give access to a child on the day that that party is ordered to give access to the child, the court will be able to compensate the other party by ordering additional or compensatory access. This is an important change to the law because, I suppose, of all those day to day problems that arise in the family law area, problems of access lead all others in terms of controversy and friction. One parent can allegedly refuse to give access or can put on such an act or a turn that the smooth implementation of access is not possible to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of those problems brought to our notice are problems of access. There are endless arguments about whether one party arrived at 3 o'clock in the afternoon when access was to commence or whether the party was one minute late or 10 minutes early, and it gives rise to no end of friction and argument. This often leads to a denial or a refusal of access and, of course, the children suffer. It might satisfy the ego of one or other of the parents but the result is that the children suffer because they lose contact with one or other of the parents. It is, therefore, appropriate that this additional form of access, or compensatory access, can be granted by the court. One hopes that it will bring recalcitrant parties into line, especially when it is brought to their notice that some additional access may be awarded against them. So we support that amendment also. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter relates to child agreements. Under the present law, parties to a marriage may lodge an agreement on the maintenance of a child of a marriage which, of course, avoids a contest in court. One likes to see more settlements, more agreements in this area to avoid the nerve-racking tension of contested hearings in the court with the inevitable costs involved both to the parties and to the public through the legal aid system. However, at present the parents of ex-nuptial children are not able to lodge an agreement. The Bill will allow them to lodge such agreements, but only in the four States that have referred power over ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter is counselling. A further amendment to the Act will apply to judicial registrars and registrars of the Family Court. The same obligations will apply as there are on judges and magistrates to consider whether the parties can be reconciled and to refer them to counselling where it is appropriate to do that. We support all of those amendments. It seems to us that they are worthwhile. However, it is important that they be monitored and watched to see whether they result in substantial improvements to the family law system. </PARA>
<PARA> The one amendment to the Act contained in this Bill which we really do not like is the proposal, by way of amendments, to transfer responsibility for the Australian Institute of Family Studies from the Attorney-General to the Minister for Social Security. We are told that this is a desirable move because reports of the Institute of Family Studies have an impact on the social security system and it is therefore appropriate that the Minister for Social Security should be able to have a good look at what they do. Of course, the real reason is that the Institute of Family Studies has been critical of the Government. It has drawn attention to the fact that the living standards of Australian families have suffered under the present Government because of inflation, interest rates, increased poverty-despite the absurd protestations of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-and the overall economic decay of the smoking ruin which we call the Australian economy. Families have suffered as a result of all this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute of Family Studies has put the spotlight on the increasing financial and, therefore, social, psychological and emotional burden on families. There are people in the Government who do not like this. Probably those people extend into the ranks of the Ministry of the Hawke Government. I must say that we are a bit suspicious as to why this change is needed. Surely the Institute operates efficiently under the Attorney-General and no case has been made out as to why the Institute should be transferred to the responsibility of the Minister for Social Security. It leaves one with the lingering suspicion that the Minister for Social Security feels that he may be able to knock it into shape. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been changes to the personnel of the board of that Institute. Perhaps there will be more if the present Government gets the opportunity to do so. There is a danger that what was a robust, independent body, which was constructively critical of the Government, may turn out to be something of a toothless tiger which no longer puts the spotlight on those economic and social problems facing Australian families. We will be watching that very closely. However, I must say that we are opposed to this change. I have already said that there is a free vote on this side of the Parliament on family law matters. That has always been the case on this side, and it should be the case. However, our disposition is that the amendments, with the exception of the one to which I have referred last, are acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be said while we are talking about the Family Court that although it is subjected to criticism, it has a very difficult job. I think some critics underestimate the difficulty of the job that it does. Some critics underestimate or perhaps do not know of that vast quantity of work which is done by the court. It is a very large court and it has an enormous workload which continues to impose a daily strain on the people who are responsible for making the system work and who work within the system-not just on the judges but also on the registrars, deputy registrars and other officials and counsellors and the like. It must be said that in recent times there have been improvements in that court. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Nicholson in particular is universally regarded as a very competent and able person to preside over the Family Court in the capacity of Chief Judge. He does a very good job. He has introduced a number of practical reforms. He is very concerned about what one might call-without diminishing its importance-the administrative aspects of the court in the sense of making the court run smoothly and efficiently, in ensuring that the best people are available where they are really needed, and in experimenting with new means of getting the cases through the list. Whatever the formula may be, it certainly has met with a considerable degree of success. An opportunity like this should not be passed without acknowledging the tremendously valuable and successful work of Mr Justice Nicholson and the effective and very commendable work by other judges and officials in the Family Court. I believe that there is a new spirit in the court. Work is proceeding and the court is steadily progressing through the vast number of cases which are brought before it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important-and this is the last point I wish to make-that that court is properly resourced. If it is not, it runs the risk of slipping backwards and of gains achieved being lost. That means adequate numbers of judges. It means proper facilities and buildings. It means that the judges should have proper salaries. On occasions, one hears from various sources concerns about judicial salaries. Of course, those salaries are about twice those which we receive, in many cases. Nevertheless, judges must receive adequate salaries to attract really good people continually to the Bench. It is important that the remuneration be adequate. It is important that there be adequate numbers of judges. It is important that there be adequate numbers of other officials whose work is so important to the successful operation of the Family Court. As I have said, it is important that the physical facilities should be in place for litigants, judges and members of the public at large. There is no need for me to go into the detail tonight, but I know that work is being done in that area. It is important that that should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> We are saying that there are still problems. The Opposition's policy is to look at these problems on an all-embracing basis by establishing a parliamentary committee where the collective experience of members of parliament can be brought to bear and we can have a thorough-going look at the Act and the court and any problems that there are in the family law system. I conclude by saying that we support the amendments to the Act which have been proposed, with the one exception that I have mentioned. It will be very interesting to see, as time goes on, just how successful those amendments turn out to be, which we hope they will be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just listened to the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), which gave us a very clear and full run-down on the amendments to the Family Law Act. Although many reasons for certain things were put forward, the last item with regard to the Institute of Family Studies, which I will mention later, was not given the full explanatory treatment that maybe it ought to have been given. It was very good to hear the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), speak about the coalition's law and justice policy which has very clearly stated-as he said in his speech-that a full parliamentary committee will be set up very soon after we take over government in 1990 to fully investigate this Family Law Act and all the activities associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we all know, there are many good features of the Family Law Act which was brought in under the Fraser Government; but we all know also that there has been a great deal of grief, agony, anger and frustration, as well as death threats-even deaths-that have been associated with decisions that have been made in the Family Court-or decisions that have not been made, sadly, in many cases. I agree with the shadow Attorney-General's comments with regard to Mr Justice Nicholson and the excellent work that he has engaged in in terms of this Act. In particular, I am reminded of one of his calls to this Parliament that we in this Parliament, as members representing the people, must come to grips, for example, with the rights of the unborn, which is something that everyone is running away from at a great rate at this time. Mr Justice Nicholson mentioned that factor. It is very important that we as a Parliament take very special note of what he says. We acknowledge all the other good things that he says. This is one of the things that he is also saying with equal emphasis, and we need to take note of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to make, before I comment briefly on these amendments to the Act is that the cost of marriage breakdown, which is dealt with by this court and which these amendments are relevant to, is enormous. We, on both sides of the House, talk often about the need to cut Government expenditure. The House needs to be reminded that every year relentlessly we spend the equivalent-I have said this before-of two almost fully furnished new Parliament Houses to support families as a result of marriage breakdown. That is the equivalent of about $500 for each of Australia's 4.1 million families. Yet, the Government still spends only about 30c per family per year to stop that from happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point in the coalition's law and justice policy is that there will be substantial increases in funding towards marriage education and marriage counselling; marriage education in particular because that is the education that takes place before the marriage breaks down. Research has told us over and over again that three-quarters of all marriages fail because of benign neglect, not through malicious intent. An extensive education program will be of great benefit to the institution of marriage and to the family law. It will reduce the need to go to court and a great deal of money will be saved. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment briefly on two aspects of this Family Law Amendment Bill that is before the House tonight. First, I wish to indicate my total support, as did the shadow Attorney-General, for those provisions of the Bill which will provide force to court orders in access matters and workable sanctions against contempt of the Family Court. Most honourable members will be aware of cases involving the non-compliance of a family with Family Court orders. I come to this debate tonight familiar with one case in particular, but one case among many. As the Attorney-General said, most members of parliament have quite a bit of experience in this area. I am very familiar with one case involving a woman who has consistently flouted the court's authority and gotten away with her contempt of the court by calling, almost as it were, the bluff of judges reluctant to gaol parents. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that I am in favour of women or parents being gaoled. It is probably the very last resort. But even as a a last resort it is not being done and there are great and very sad and tragic consequences as a result of this non-compliance. The case that I am referring to involves access for the father to the children of the now dissolved marriage. The woman has simply refused to accept the court decision on the matter and has been found guilty of contempt on at least two occasions. The court, however, has refused to punish the woman for her behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> We might ask, `Why?'. On one occasion the reason given by the judge was that if the woman had been a man he would have sent her to gaol; but because she was a woman, and presumably a mother, he would not. As the result of an unwillingness to punish this illegal behaviour, justice has been denied and the reputation of the court has been seriously damaged. One of the tragic results of an action such as this is that the access of a particular parent-in this case the father-to the children has become so prolonged from one visit to the next, and since the last visit occurred, that the often used reason now to prevent any contact is the fact that the separation has been so long that it would be quite detrimental for the children to link up with the other parent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us tonight will provide the court with an option which will be more attractive to judges who would hesitate to gaol a parent over non-compliance with an access order. In the future judges will be able to punish contempt of court in family law matters with community service orders. I think that is a very commendable additional aspect of this Bill. I commend the Government for its decision to legislate in this way. As the shadow Attorney-General has said, the coalition totally supports this move. I believe that it will benefit both those before the Family Court and the court itself. It is not an exaggeration to say that unless the court begins to sanction manipulation and contempt of its authority confidence in the court will continue to decline. I also wish to indicate my support for that section of the Bill which makes quite clear the power of the court to order compensatory access. There has been an unfortunate swing from justice to compromise and convenience in an attempt to make family law less formal and less adversarial. The Bill before us tonight, in terms of provisions for compensatory access and community service orders as punishment for contempt, goes some way towards establishing justice as overriding concerns of the court. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise in this debate is the relocation by this legislation of the Institute of Family Studies from the Attorney-General's Department to the Department of Social Security. The Institute is an internationally respected body doing absolutely crucial research on the family and its environment in Australia. Unfortunately, this Government has been inconsistent in its support for the Institute, as a study of the Institute's funding over the last seven years would indicate. This year the funding that was taken away last year has been restored, but there has been no consistency.</PARA>
<PARA> A clear indication of the Government's lukewarm support for the Institute is the way the decision to move the Institute from one portfolio to another was taken. I understand that the decision was taken without consultation with the Institute director, who found out about the decision whilst overseas at a conference. I further understand that the Government was not quite clear who should receive the Institute. The Attorney-General's Department no longer wanted it and the Department of Community Services and Health was offered it, considered it, and declined. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), recognising the worth of the Institute and the value of its research, offered to accept the Institute into his portfolio. Knowing the way the Minister has promoted the social security review and its excellent research, I must say that the final decision could be a happy ending to a sad story. I hope it is. I am also hopeful that the Institute will now get greater interest and support than it has received over the past seven years. I will certainly monitor its progress, as will the shadow Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, as I have said, the Institute does fine and significant research and policy analysis. It needs greater political support, more funds and better computer resources than it has received of late. I urge the Minister for Social Security to expedite its portfolio relocation so that the incoming coalition Social Security Minister will be able to give the Institute, originally set up by the Fraser Government, the support and recognition it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable members for their contribution and for their support of the amendments to the Family Law Amendment Bill. A couple of comments are worthy of reply. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) was very supportive of most of the matters in the Bill. He went on to make the point, as did the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), that there is come concern that the Institute of Family Studies has been transferred to the portfolio of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe). I would like to dispel any concern as to the reason for the transfer. What we are talking about in legal terms in respect of this legislation is divorce, the separation of the family. The Institute quite validly has shown very clearly in its previous studies that this is the most disastrous result for the family, particularly the children, from the point of view of how all members of the family feel about it and in economic terms. One would not like to think that the study of families is limited to divorce, and I emphasise that. I think it is wrong to take the attitude that it is detrimental to transfer the Institute to the area of social welfare. In fact, some of the most effective work done by the Institute has been for the family in respect of social security and welfare needs. Under that portfolio the Minister has access to substantial funds by way of Budget for the welfare of children and women who need support. It would be a very weak need if women had to rely on the Family Court to do that. The honourable member ought to understand that. The Institute of Family Studies has made it very clear that once parties are divorced both suffer an economic loss and are likely to live in poverty. Once parties are divorced, the unhappiest are the children, who would prefer them to remain together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Institute has conducted studies. We are talking about how to do more effective work to prevent divorce and how to provide adequate remuneration. I take issue with the honourable member for Menzies when he suggested that poverty has increased under the Labor Government. Far from it: one and a half million jobs have been created under this Government. There has been a substantial increase in the family allowance, well above what was given when the Fraser Government was in office. The honourable member should look at that in terms of poverty. If parents are unemployed, rest assured that the family will be in trouble. Those opposite should look at what they paid as the supporting mothers' benefit. What did they do about trying to enforce maintenance orders? Only 25 per cent of people adhered to those orders. What did they do about enforcing payment? At least this Government has brought in the child support scheme. The previous Government did not think of implementing any of these measures and it was in office for years-from 1976 to 1983. What did they do about it? Nothing. That is the issue we face tonight. The economy is in much better shape now than when the previous Government was in office. Those opposite lost government because of their ineptitude and economic mismanagement. That is the issue here. They should not drag in a side issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Institute of Family Studies should be maintained and has a role to play. It will do it effectively in conjunction with welfare and social security aspects. I welcome the support given to Mr Justice Nicholson and the judges of the court; in fact to all members of the court. It is a most difficult administration. The parties are never happy. The parties, naturally, hold the view that they are the best judges. We can understand that, but judges have to make judgments. Fortunately, only 7 per cent of cases go to final judgment. Most cases are settled by the parties themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macquarie raised a good point about marriage counselling. In the period since 1983, when we were elected, we have increased the funding for marriage counselling by 40 per cent. If the honourable member wants to look at the increase during the terms of the Fraser Government, he will find that it was less than 10 per cent. I do not think we ought to be drawing those comparisons. There is never enough money for counselling, but the honourable member should not say that in government those opposite will do better. They were in office for a period of seven years and they were not able to do it. These are the issues that we should be focusing on. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the court costs $32m to run. In terms of legal aid, lawyers are not doing too badly. They are probably getting about $50m in legal aid. The issue is how to get the parties to talk about their differences without too much litigation. That is the big challenge. Mr Justice Nicholson and the judges of the court are looking at ways of getting the parties to conciliate. Perhaps one of the best methods of dealing with this might be for the judges themselves not to judge the issues but to act as conciliators and advisers on an indirect basis. Maybe the parties would take the advice of experienced judges who were not sitting on the action. We need to stop parties being in combat. Whilst it is good for the boys at the Bar, and they do very well at it-I should say the women at the Bar as well-we have to talk about what is best in terms of administration. We are spending a fair amount of money now on marriage counselling. It is very clear that once the parties have separated, counselling has little hope of success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once it gets into the court it has no hope of success because it is the divorce court. One has got to understand that, and that is where the problems are. One has to understand how people can be helped when they get to the stage where they realise there has been a breakdown. I think that mediation is another way to go. So all those issues have been tried.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The court was established in 1976 without any suitable premises anywhere. The court in Sydney is in three leased premises, and that is an indictment of bad planning. Judicial premises cannot be put in tenanted property because of all the problems of insecurity of tenure. We have had all the difficulties of murder, threats and all these issues, because people do get very concerned about the issues and want to be their own judges. So we have spent a fair bit on security. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank all honourable members for praising the work of the court and the judges. It is the Government that increased judges' salaries, and it is we who are talking about how we might make that a court which is not deemed to be something of a pariah and not part of the judicial system. The title `Family Court' builds up false expectations that there is going to be something beneficial there for the family. The answer is no, there is nothing beneficial there for the family except a rigid judicial determination as to rights on separation, which is a very contradiction of the concept of family unity, of being together. It is trying to work out rights when there has been a division, a dissolution. Nobody can really enjoy it, and it costs the community a lot. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank honourable members for their valuable contributions on what they feel ought to be done. Honourable members are welcome to talk about the issue of a parliamentary committee. We had one under the previous Fraser Government. I was a member of that committee. We went through all these issues. But it is very clear that the most successful people who came and gave evidence about the family issue were those who did not believe in divorce. They are the most successful people. But we are going to have a big challenge in society if we expect that to be accepted as a norm.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government recently looked at the legal position of companies incorporated abroad which do business in Australia, whether through a branch, local subsidiary or otherwise. One finding was that an Australian court may be called upon to make a decision on a dispute involving such companies by referring to foreign laws, and may well find itself in a situation where it has to choose between conflicting laws of two or more foreign jurisdictions. For example, the court may have to address such questions as the validity of the incorporation of a foreign company, the ownership of shares of such a company or, more generally, the rights and obligations of a foreign company. As a result of the examination, the Government concluded that in some circumstances there were no clear and predictable statutory rules which would overcome the uncertainties relating to claims of corporations of unrecognised states and governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the policy of the Australian Government to encourage foreign investment which it judges to be in the national interest. The Government wishes to ensure that investors can make important decisions in the confidence that their legal rights in Australia will not be adversely affected by extraneous considerations such as the legal status of the territory in which their business is incorporated. The Australian legal system clearly meets this objective in most cases and obviously provides impartial legal services of high quality. However, it has become apparent that the traditional common law approach to the position of foreign corporations under Australian law may not, in some cases, adequately take account of the changes in the international trading system and foreign investment patterns in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Within Australia, there are now corporate entities from diverse political and legal systems and with various ownership arrangements. The sums involved in investment are often large and it is understandable that in such circumstances, investors require certainty as to their legal status. In some countries-for example, the United States-the courts have clarified the legal status of companies incorporated in unrecognised entities. However, this is not the case in Australia and the approach an Australian court would take in dealing with a case involving the rights of foreign corporations from some parts of the world remains unclear. The Foreign Corporations (Application of Laws) Bill 1989 seeks to address these issues. It deals in general terms with the situation where an Australian court has to determine the legal rights of a foreign corporation by reference to foreign law. Thus, when the ordinary rules of private international law require that a rights of a foreign company be determined by reference to a foreign law, the Bill will ensure that the law to be applied will be determined by the place of incorporation of the company, without regard to the political circumstances, questions of official recognition or otherwise of the government authorities there, or the legal status of the place of incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill's approach takes into account the Government's change in recognition policy announced by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 19 January 1988. Under that policy, Australia no longer takes a position on the recognition or non-recognition of particular governments. Australia recognises states only. The Government considers that it would now be appropriate to provide for protection of the legal rights of companies incorporated in unrecognised entities. Australian courts, when confronted with cases in which foreign relations questions are raised, traditionally have attached considerable importance to the attitude of the Executive Government. The Australian Government's view is that as a matter of public policy, the foreign relations considerations should not normally be the overriding factor in the determination of private legal rights, particularly those involving commercial transactions. The Government considers that Australia's public policy interests can be preserved on the one hand, while on the other hand normal commercial relations between private parties can be determined by reference, where relevant, to the law in fact in operation in the place of incorporation.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no financial cost to the Commonwealth. I note, however, that passage of the Bill is likely to attract additional foreign investment into Australia. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Foreign Corporations (Applications of Laws) Bill 1989, which is before the House. As a consequence, I will not take long in dealing with it. As the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) pointed out, it does clear up an area where there has been a gap in commercial practice in Australia for some considerable time, and this Bill is well overdue in being brought forward. This Bill proposes new legislation to ensure that certain questions arising under Australian law in relation to foreign corporations will be determined in accordance with the law applied in the place of incorporation. This is particularly important, as the Minister has just pointed out, in non-recognised countries. This is designed to protect the status and rights of foreign corporations and, in particular, those corporations in states and under governments not recognised by Australia. As a result of that, the Bill has come forward, and we support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the most pertinent point is really our relationship with Taiwan, which is a very substantial trader with Australia. I point to the very impressive growth record of a rather small island-to which I have not been but about which I have read from time to time-and the very impressive economic record that it has been able to put together. Twenty-five years ago Taiwan was an aid recipient. Today, and with virtually no resources, it has $75 billion-worth of foreign exchange, second only to Japan. It was the thirteenth largest trading nation in the world in 1988 and is expected to be the twelfth largest this year. It has had an average growth rate of almost 9 per cent a year for the last two decades. It had a trade surplus of $12 billion in 1988. That is not bad, and Australia should think a bit about it. It had a per capita income of $US6,053 in 1988. This is not far from the formal prosperity cut-off of $8,500 per capita of gross domestic product. Taiwan's per capita income in 1989 is expected to be above the $US7,000 mark and it would rank in the top 25 per cent in the United Nations, were it a member. It is now the most affluent country in Asia, apart from Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw this brief record to the notice of the House because the type of legislation before us gives some protection to investors based in that country-corporations, shareholders, and those with certain contractual obligations-bearing in mind the prospect of substantial investment coming from that area to Australia in the next few years. That country cannot run the surpluses it is without looking for foreign investment. For a country which has very few natural resources, as I understand it, it is obvious that the Taiwanese will be looking for areas outside that country in which to invest. One of which I have read about recently is the China Steel company, which is a very substantial operation. Any company investing that amount of money, and employing that number of people, would seek a legal base in Australia, and that opportunity is afforded to it under this Bill. I will not detain the House. The Opposition supports the Bill and I look forward to continuing investment opportunities for those countries which are now afforded recognition under this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), I will not take up a great deal of the time of the House in dealing with the Foreign Corporations (Application of Laws) Bill. Probably one of the most significant parts of this Bill was mentioned by the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) in his second reading speech, when he said that the passage of this Bill is likely to attract additional foreign investment into Australia. I am sure that the lawyers in this place can deal with the legal niceties, but that part of the legislation and its effect is what greatly appeals to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ryan made some comments about Taiwan and what that country might mean for Australia in the future, in particular China Steel and its proposals for expansion-perhaps even into this country. I have been to Taiwan and seen the operations of China Steel and have held discussions with people within ministries dealing with the economy there, and appreciate the concerns that he has raised. Of course, it is not just Taiwan of which we should take note. We are inextricably linked to Asia and must continue to press for a trading relationship with countries like Taiwan. More importantly, we should look to our traditional trading partners-Japan, China itself, Thailand and others. Over the next few years each of these countries in our geographic region will be more and more important to us. The fact that this legislation removes any difficulties in the interpretation of the application of commercial law between Australia and foreign entities goes some way towards removing possible impediments to future investment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a misconception or fear in Australia that investment in this country should be shied away from, particularly if it comes from our near neighbours rather than from the United States of America, Great Britain or elsewhere. That is absolute nonsense. The fact is that Australia will always be dependent upon foreign investment to develop. We certainly have our own entrepreneurial class in this country. In recent months the quality of that entrepreneurial class has been called into question to some degree but, notwithstanding that, there are people who have invested in Australia and created employment opportunities. However, Australia will more and more need people from foreign countries who are prepared to put money into Australia and create jobs in this country. Certainly profits will flow back to those countries but, notwithstanding that, without that investment and productivity and the other investment within Australia that comes from it, this nation will not prosper. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this legislation is removing any concern about political circumstances is equally important. As the Minister indicated in his second reading speech, this applies to certain nations more than others. To that extent, the fact that many of these nations have considerable sums of money available-running major surpluses as they do today-and are looking for opportunities to invest means that this Government should be in a position to encourage such investment here, and we should welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to know that the Opposition will not oppose the legislation. There is nothing in it to oppose. As I have indicated, the lawyers on both sides of this place would take a great deal of time to argue the merits or otherwise of some of the provisions of the Bill if there were a problem. With those few words, and in keeping with the spirit of the debate as entered into by the honourable member for Ryan I, like the Minister, commend this legislation to the House. It will overcome a problem which has existed for some time but the Government-always willing to look at opportunities for advancing commercial relationships between Australia and overseas countries-has done the right thing in the introducting this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add my support to the words of the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). The Foreign Corporations (Application of Laws) Bill is particularly significant. It will go through the House with the bipartisan support of both sides of politics. It is about Taiwan. It is particularly significant that the China steel project has already been mentioned. We would all like to see that project proceed in Australia if possible. There are employment benefits to be gained. Many unionists have spoken out publicly about their desire to see it proceed. The broader issue that is being debated tonight about Taiwan is, where do we go from here?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is but a first step with regard to a policy that we established in 1972 under Mr Whitlam. Speaking personally, perhaps our policy is due for review. The economic advancement of Taiwan makes it now our sixth largest trading partner, and in 1972 it was about our fourteenth. We have a healthy trade with Taiwan in commodities ranging from uranium and aluminium ingots to wool and beef, and we import a range of manufactured products from Taiwan. Taiwan has the second highest level of reserves after Japan. It is now one of the economic powerhouses in Asia, and will become even more significant as time goes by. Its population is equivalent to that of New Zealand and Australia combined-some 20 million people. I do not believe a country that is performing economically as well as it is can be ignored. It is our folly if we do. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of Australia, it is trade or perish. I make the point quite strongly that I believe that the underlying thrust of our policies now ought to be promoting trade in all sorts of areas, particularly within the Pacific Rim. Australia's other competitors-notably the Canadians-are heavily involved with Taiwan, and we will be giving away markets unless we pursue trade policies more vigorously. We adopt a fig-leaf approach with Taiwan-we trade with that country but will not diplomatically recognise it. This Bill is a step towards the recognition of Taiwan which is long overdue. I admit there are very complex issues that need to be dealt with of a diplomatic nature with regard to the People's Republic of China. With imaginative policies available to us, that have been adopted by other countries in the region, we will see the opening up of more trade opportunities and airline links, and I think that Australia will be the richer if we take that more pragmatic approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the days of diplomatic niceties should be behind Australia. It is trade or perish for us over the next little while. We need to be part of Asia. The Garnaut report, which was released recently, makes that point very strongly. Dr Fitzgerald, the former ambassador to the People's Republic of China, also made that point in his Morrison lecture. The winds of change are about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a significant one and enjoys the bipartisan support of this Parliament. We are sending a message to Asia that we want to be part of Asia in that trade. I urge the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Mr Duffy) to accelerate the Government's attention in respect of Taiwan. If I can declare an interest, I have been to that country and I was particularly impressed with the frankness with which people there deal with the complex issues of diplomatic recognition. But I think we need to increase that dialogue. That would be to our mutual benefit and, more particularly, to the benefit of the whole region. </PARA>

<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In the report I have just presented the Committee has recommended complete refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia, 60 Collins Street, Melbourne, at an estimated cost of $25m at June 1989 prices. In recommending that the work proceed, the Committee has drawn attention to a number of matters. It is concerned that staff will be occupying floors while asbestos is actually being removed from them. The Committee has recommended that the Reserve Bank examine the need for this and also that strict safety measures are adhered to during the asbestos removal. The Committee has questioned the need for modifications to the ground floor facade at an estimated cost of $800,000 and has recommended that the Reserve Bank re-examine the need for this expenditure. Finally, the Committee has recommended that the Reserve Bank give consideration to the provision of additional toilets for the disabled. The Committee does not believe that the provision of only one toilet for the disabled in a building of 17 storeys is adequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The year 1989 has been an extremely busy year for the Public Works Committee. It has tabled 26 reports and held public hearings and inspections in all capital cities except Adelaide and also in many regional centres. The Committee held 66 meetings during the year, made up of public hearings, inspections and private meetings. In total during 1989 the Committee recommended the expenditure of $1,100m on public works proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Public Works Committee, I wish to express my appreciation to all Committee members, in particular to my deputy, the honourable member for Wide Bay, Clarrie Millar, for their dedication to the work of the Committee in what proved to be a very demanding year. Apart from 1972, when 35 reports were presented, including projects in Papua New Guinea and local Northern Territory projects, this is the highest number of reports the Committee has presented on purely domestic projects. I also wish to place on record my appreciation to the secretariat staff, especially the Secretary, Mr Peter Roberts, for their work and support often under trying circumstances through the past year. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Oakleigh Multi-User Army Reserve Depot, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the construction of a multi-user depot at Oakleigh, Victoria, for use by various Army Reserve units. The construction of the new depot is primarily the result of a request from the Victorian State Government that the site of an existing depot in Batman Avenue, East Melbourne, adjacent to the National Tennis Centre, be vacated for use as open space. The Commonwealth agreed to make the land available to the Victorian State Government as part of a wider Commonwealth-State land transfer agreement involving various properties in Melbourne. In relation to the Batman Avenue depot, Defence relocation costs were to be met and the Commonwealth was not to be financially disadvantaged overall. The construction of a new depot will also allow rationalisation and co-location of like Army Reserve functions, which is consistent with this Government's policy of rationalising and upgrading defence facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> A suitable 3.17 hectare site for the construction of the new depot has been purchased at Oakleigh, some 16 kilometres from the Melbourne central business district. The site, which was previously an abattoir, includes disused and derelict buildings which are unsuitable to form part of the depot complex. Australian Construction Services, with approval from the Public Works Committee, has commenced demolition of these buildings, which is expected to be complete by February 1990. The proposed work, in addition to the demolition work, includes construction of office, administrative and storage facilities, training facilities, a vehicle compound, a parade ground, recreational and some food preparation facilities as well as car parking and security fencing. Landscaping and engineering services for the site will also be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Once complete, the depot will provide a home for the Army Reserve headquarters and units of the Royal Australian Engineers, the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps. The provision of multi-user or shared accommodation for various units of the Reserve Army is current defence policy and is considered to be a cost efficient approach to defence accommodation. The new depot at Oakleigh will be constructed along these lines. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit of the cost estimate for the project, including demolition work, is $9m at November 1989 prices. As stated earlier, demolition work is expected to be complete in February 1990 and construction of the depot is planned for commencement in mid-1990, with completion expected in late 1991. The impact of the proposed work on the environment has been determined as minimal and the site at Oakleigh is appropriately zoned as general industrial. Construction of the new depot will provide in the order of 20 to 25 jobs on site, as well as opportunities for local contractors and suppliers of building materials and equipment. I table selected drawings of this proposed work and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports this reference to the Public Works Committee. I notice that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has left us; he was here a few moments ago. Might I say that it is quite hard for the Opposition to respond adequately to proposals from the Government because, although there have been two weeks recess of the House of Representatives, it still does not seem to be possible for the Government to follow the normal processes.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs might take this matter seriously. This morning we had a severe lecture from the Leader of the House on the management of Government business. He was blaming the Senate for its rule of setting a deadline for when matters should be considered by the House of Representatives before they went to the Senate. I think it is quite sensible for the Senate to set some sort of deadline if the Government does not exert any discipline over itself. The Government has had two weeks of recess to prepare all the matters for this two-day sitting, yet the two-day sitting is an absolute shambles. We simply do not know what is going to come up next and we do not have adequate warning of it. Nonetheless, we do our best to consider these matters rationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case we have a proposal to be referred to the Public Works Committee to move a defence facility from East Melbourne to Oakleigh. That seems to be a rational proposal. It releases some land in East Melbourne for free space and it unifies a number of reserve facilities within Oakleigh. That seems to be a perfectly sensible proposal. I was a little disappointed that the Minister in his introduction did not indicate that this might in some way be helpful to the Melbourne bid for the 1996 Olympic Games on the grounds that it would provide further open space in East Melbourne. This is one of the main positive arguments for Melbourne becoming the site of the Olympic Games, and one which the Opposition fully supports. As a Sydneysider I say to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and honourable member for Melbourne, who is at the table, that we firmly support this bid. I thought it was remiss of the Minister for Administrative Services, even though he does come from the Wollongong area, not to mention that this might be another positive argument in favour of the Games for Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> These proposals, which might appear to be of a pedestrian nature when they come before the House, are very important for the armed services. They represent quite considerable expenditures on the defence vote. The honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) would agree with me, because he has military facilities in his electorate, that these proposals are of great importance to the armed forces. Over a period the facilities are gradually upgraded. In many cases-I have visited them one by one over the last few months-the facilities are quite decrepit. In this particular case there is the additional advantage of amalgamating a number of facilities for the Reserves. I am sure that we share a concern with members opposite about the Reserves. The Minister himself admitted in a debate on the 7.30 Report recently that the Government had not got the Reserves right, that there is a concern about how the Reserves are managed. We hope that this new multi-user Army reserve depot in Oakleigh will assist the improvement of facilities for the Reserves and make the Reserves more attractive to recruits, which is an important objective. In that sense, the Opposition support this reference. </PARA>

All you need to do is to be assured that we will make available to you another piece of land. If you give this to us we will arrange for something to be given to you'. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) is involved in this. I will get to him in a minute. This is another one of those grubby little deals. I was closely involved in this because the Commonwealth has some land at Nunawading, where the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is located. There was a proposal to relocate this depot at Nunawading but the local residents objected very strongly to all this. This is a typical Labor fix. We all know that Cain is on the nose. It is no wonder the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) is in the House; he is fussed about it. Cain is on the nose in Victoria.

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: stage 1 Redevelopment, Puckapunyal, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important project. The Puckapunyal military area is situated in Victoria, approximately 11 kilometres west of the town of Seymour and 100 kilometres north of Melbourne. It was originally established as an Army training centre for new recruits prior to and during World War II. Puckapunyal has been the main training centre for the armoured corps since 1972.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have investigated the statements and allegations made by the shadow Minister concerning the time at which he received these speeches today. It has always been my practice to extend the utmost courtesy to my counterparts in the Opposition, as I have already done with the material for the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill which will be debated tomorrow. I have ascertained that it was intended to deliver these three speeches to the honourable member for Deakin this afternoon but he was nowhere to be found. The Parliamentary Liaison Officer has indicated to me that the speeches were delivered to the Opposition Whip's office at 3 p.m. As these allegations were made at about 11.30 p.m., it seems incredible to me that the Opposition spokesperson should come into this place and criticise me for belatedly giving him a 4 1/2 minute speech when it was given to the Opposition Whip 8 1/2 hours earlier this day because he could not be found anywhere. I trust that we will hear no more talk about me not extending courtesies to members of the Opposition when the protocol is that they should get speeches not more than 2 hours before they are delivered. I tried to give these speeches to the honourable member for Deakin 8 1/2 hours ago but he was nowhere to be found and they were conscientiously delivered to the Opposition Whip. Let us have no more nonsense about this sort of thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Puckapunyal military area is currently home to three major operational units, two of which are part of the operational deployment force; a newly formed logistic battalion; three major training establishments; and various minor units. It is considered to be a significant defence base by the Australian Defence Force, employing approximately 2,000 service men and women. The area consists of three distinct and special purpose zones. The range complex, covering 42,500 hectares of forested and open spaces and including weapon ranges, is used for training, and is capable of brigade size exercises and live deployment of all major weapons deployed by the Army. Puckapunyal is the only training area in the third military district permitted to conduct field firing manoeuvres without external restrictions, with the exception of fire bans. </PARA>
<PARA> The military cantonment, or soldier accommodation, is located in the south-east corner of the range complex and includes accommodation for Army Reserve soldiers participating in training camps or courses at Puckapunyal. The third zone is the Puckapunyal village which includes married quarters for service personnel and dependants which, at present, total approximately 2,200. A number of sporting and recreational facilities are also present on the base to assist defence personnel maintain a high level of physical fitness. Environmental effects of the planned redevelopment work have been determined to be minimal as the work is restricted to buildings and facilities within the confines of the Puckapunyal military area and an environmental certificate of compliance has been issued. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of community needs, Puckapunyal does have some shortfalls. However, Defence is taking positive steps to improve facilities and a study being conducted by the Australian Defence Families and Information Liaison Staff is aimed at identifying shortfalls through liaison with the Puckapunyal community. The redevelopment of Puckapunyal is directly in line with the Government's commitment to improving existing living in accommodation and rationalising and modernising working accommodation and facilities as stated in the defence policy information paper titled The Defence of Australia 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed work currently before the House is the first part of a two-stage redevelopment program for the area and will basically involve replacing substandard living in accommodation, upgrading engineering services and replacing and refurbishing working accommodation to house the newly formed Puckapunyal Logistic Battalion. Specifically, some of the accommodation at the base was constructed in the 1960s as temporary accommodation for the then national service training battalions. This accommodation is now below scale and standard and has become a maintenance liability. The proposed work will include replacing the substandard accommodation and constructing additional bedspaces for rank and file and senior non-commissioned officers. Upgrading of the rank and file kitchen and dining facilities and construction of a new mess for senior non-commissioned officers also form part of these proposed works. </PARA>
<PARA> Present facilities cannot adequately accommodate the various systems and equipment that have evolved over the years to keep pace with defence technological advancements. Increases in occupational health and safety requirements and the Services' scales and standards of accommodation have meant that deficiencies now exist in working accommodation at Puckapunyal. These deficiencies have had detrimental effects on some functions at the base. Replacement and refurbishment of existing buildings will be undertaken in order to provide purpose designed working accommodation for the Puckapunyal logistic battalion. Engineering services at Puckapunyal were originally designed with a much smaller military population to support. These services are now inadequate and are becoming a costly maintenance exercise. Refurbishment of services such as water reticulation, waste water systems and road and drainage structures will ensure that necessary systems are kept operational and ongoing maintenance costs are reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed stage 1 redevelopment work will be undertaken in two phases with work to commence on phase A in the latter half of 1990-91. Phase B is not expected to begin until after 1994. The second, and final, stage of redevelopment at Puckapunyal will address less urgent requirements as well as include any improvements to community facilities as identified by the study currently under way and which I outlined earlier. The limit of cost for the proposed stage 1 work, at July 1989 prices, is estimated at $31.5m. This figure consists of $9.5m for phase A and $22m for phase B. The redevelopment work at the Puckapunyal military area will provide opportunities for businesses in surrounding country areas for the supply of building materials and equipment and provide up to 55 jobs on site. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I concur with your remarks and I will not comment further. I think I have made my point in response to what the Minister said in his address on this matter. These works are similar, in a way, to those in the earlier referral motion. They are the important underbelly of defence operations. The House should certainly support projects which, although quite expensive, costing tens of millions of dollars, and not very visible in terms of higher defence votes-submarine and frigate purchases are the kinds of things that get all the publicity-are quite large and add to the working efficiency, comfort, sense of decency, and self-respect which the armed forces are entitled to have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These decisions are always made too late. If we look at the dates for these works, we will see that it will be the latter half of 1990-91 before phase A will be started and that phase B will not start until after 1994. So people should not get too excited. I know that the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), in whose electorate these works are being conducted, will want to have quite a big electoral impact from them in the forthcoming election. But the House should be reminded that there is quite a big time delay in works of this kind. If the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), a colleague of the honourable member for McEwen, has his way, the Defence vote will be quite substantially cut back if the Labor Government is re-elected and these works may well never see the light of day. That is the kind of difficulty that I think the forces have to face in this kind of exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to remark on the newly formed logistic battalion at Puckapunyal. Some of the works before us are related to that newly formed battalion. There is a lot of activity going on in respect of logistics in the armed forces, and I have made a lot of comments about the efficiency and the cost effectiveness of the logistics in the three armed services. I have visited quite a few of the logistic operations in the Army. I have not visited this particular one, but it will be on my visiting schedule. I pay tribute to those who have to manage these antique facilities. The accommodation in pretty well all the ones I have visited is quite ancient. A week or two ago I visited the establishment at Moorebank and saw warehouses that had not changed since I was an officer cadet and a national serviceman in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Those things are gradually being changed. The people who are in charge of them are doing their very best, within existing arrangements, to make something of them. But even in Moorebank where a brand new warehouse is being built and will be opened in April next year, I learnt to my dismay that the computer systems, the control systems, are being designed by a totally different part of the Department of Defence. They are not coordinated and the brand new facility at Moorebank will be opened in April without the necessary computer control facilities to make it efficient. I hope that in the planning of improved works to be used by the newly formed logistic battalion at Puckapunyal, this problem will not be met. That is one of the things that I shall examine on my continuing series of visits. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing tonight is for the House-and I am sure that the honourable member for McEwen will join me in this-to support this reference, to support the allocation of funds that are required to upgrade these facilities to make the working conditions and living conditions of our armed services more satisfactory and at a level which people in the private sector would regard as their every day right but which, regretably, is not the case in many military situations. I am not being partisan in this. With the honourable member for McEwen I acknowledge that various governments of various persuasions have been lax in looking at these less visible areas of defence expenditure. The House tonight should support this reference in the hope that these works can be speeded up. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a proposal to construct a purpose built computer centre on Commonwealth land at Bruce in the Australian Capital Territory. The Australian Taxation Office is undergoing a complete modernisation of its business operation and has an urgent requirement to accommodate its new computer equipment in a secure and stable environment. The existing taxation computer facility in the Treasury building has outlived its functional usefulness and cannot provide for expansion needs over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed building of 6,300 square metres will consist of two levels: the computer mainframe and operations will be on the upper floor level, while plant, dispatch, loading dock, storage, staff amenities and office accommodation will be on the ground floor level. The Bruce site adjacent to the Fern Hill Technology Park development was found to be the most satisfying and effective location for meeting the Australian Tax Office's needs now and in the future. A limit of cost for the proposal is $21.85m at December 1989 prices. I table all drawings of the proposed works and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Nobody would deny that we should have an Australian Taxation Office that does its job properly. We very badly need to have the resources, the people, and the funds available to the Australian Taxation Office so that it can do its job properly. If it cannot do that, and if the Government continues to deny those resources to it, we will find that the Australian Taxation Office, as directed by the Government will continue to come under increasing public pressure in order to be fair and equitable. The Government's failure to provide those resources has resulted in this extraordinary and ongoing criticism of the Australian Taxation Office. It is typical of the Government that it has squeezed the resources of the Australian Taxation Office on the one hand, whereas on the other hand it has failed to deal with some of the abuses of the system as exemplified by a document that was tabled today in the House, although it had been previously tabled in the Senate, which shows that in the area of Austudy about $40m worth of abuse is going on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am subjected to incredible duress, not the least of which is the persuasive look of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand), who is sitting at the table, to ensure that my remarks are brief. On the basis of the Minister's persuasive comments to me, I will substantially truncate my remarks. Nevertheless, I do wish to do justice to these reports for a number of reasons; first of all because of my responsibilities to the Parliament, and in particular to the House of Representatives; my responsibilities to the staff of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts who have put in well over a year of work on a number of these reports; and also my responsibilities to members of the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the 300th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts regarding reports of the Auditor-General, I draw attention to the statements made by my fellow members of the Committee in the Senate concerning this report and the responsibility of the Committee to follow up issues raised by the Auditor-General which have efficiency and effectiveness implications. This report outlines the issues which concerned the Auditor-General in his two reports of 1988 and in his April 1989 report. In particular, it highlights a number of areas which the Public Accounts Committee will continue to follow up. </PARA>
<PARA> Report No. 301 contains 21 Finance Minutes covering a broad range of Commonwealth Government activities. One important feature of that report is that the Committee will in future table Finance Minutes as soon as practicable in order to allow parliamentary and public debate on these matters. This report was the subject of many months of detailed work by Mr Rod Power of the Committee's secretariat. I thank him and Mrs Jacqui McConnell, who produced both this report and the earlier report that I referred to, the 300th report. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to report No. 302 concerning the engagement of external consultants by Commonwealth departments, despite the lateness of the hour it is necessary for me to do justice to this report by making a number of comments on it. This report was produced by the Committee following a number of adverse comments by the Auditor-General in relation to the management of external consultants by Commonwealth Government departments. I stress that the report was not an exercise in bashing consultants. It did not have a predetermined agenda. It was about getting the best value for the Commonwealth dollar from the use of consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the evidence taken by the Committee revealed a situation with respect to consultants that was both confused and inconsistent across the public sector. Of particular concern to the Committee was the fact that, although there were Service-wide guidelines for the engagement of consultants, scant attention had been paid to them. We had what I would consider that Monty Pythonesque situation whereby the Committee was making available to prominent consultants and to senior departmental representatives copies of the Commonwealth's own guidelines for the management of consultants, some of which they had never even seen before. The Committee, I wish to emphasise, does not have an obsession with adherence to detailed guidelines in the form of a manual of procedure. We found in the course of this inquiry that nobody challenged the guidelines put forward by the Commonwealth. It was left to the Committee to challenge aspects of the guidelines. We took the view that certain aspects of those guidelines ought to be mandatory in the sense that, if they were not followed, poor management practices were likely to lead to a waste of public money and failure to achieve desired results from the use of consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> An obvious principle that ought to be mandatory was the issue of evaluation. Believe it or not, that was not a compulsory requirement in relation to the use of consultants. We took the view that surely a major objective ought to be the development and implementation of monitoring and accountability mechanisms, both for the department's own purposes and to ensure that public funds were not wasted. The Committee found that no procedures were in place to ensure that a consultancy which performed poorly in one department was not going to be engaged by another. We therefore recommended that post-performance reviews be required for consultancies, hardly a revolutionary recommendation but one which is not followed under the current regime. </PARA>
<PARA> We found in the course of our inquiry that there were a number of legal requirements which had not been complied with. Not for a period of one or two years but for 15 years consultants had been engaged contrary to the law of the Commonwealth. The Committee also recognised that there would obviously be a continuing need for consultants. This is a bipartisan view, I believe. Therefore, the Committee sees merit in developing a public sector management consultancy within the Public Service as an option or alternative to using private sector consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, the Committee considered that there would be value in expanding the Development Consultants, which is an agency within the Commonwealth Public Service Commission specialising in human resource development issues, into a broad ranging management consultancy bureau along the lines of the Canadian Bureau of Management Consultancy. The Committee also recommended that consultancy units be established to assist in the selection of specialist consultants from outside the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> A further issue of concern was that of public servants leaving the Service to join or establish consultancies in what are sometimes described as revolving door or Monday to Friday syndromes. There was no legislation in place which prevented a Public Service employee from resigning a position only to return as a consultant to do precisely the same tasks at a significantly higher fee. In the United States considerable attention is being paid to this question. The Committee found in essence a total absence of any detailed concern at the Commonwealth level in relation to this matter. We therefore recommend that the Public Service Commission play a role in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee especially noted that the important reforms that have been announced for Commonwealth purchasing are very much dependent for their success on a high level of visibility and the provision of public information on government contracts. That matter was substantially highlighted in the course of the Committee's report. In connection with this report I would like to thank Gillian Gould and Lorraine Brennan for their work throughout the inquiry and their efforts in producing this report. </PARA>
<PARA>for their work throughout the inquiry and their efforts in producing this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to report No. 303, Review of Auditor-General's Efficiency Audits-Department of Defence: Safety principles for explosives and RAAF explosive ordnance. Again I substantially truncate my remarks. I do not draw attention to the major recommendations, which have been referred to elsewhere. I understand that the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) may care to address aspects of this matter at the conclusion of my remarks on all these reports. There are some matters that ought to be of concern to all honourable members. A major finding of the Auditor-General, confirmed by the Committee, was that successive Defence Ministers had not been fully briefed on important matters relevant to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) safety principles. These instances began as early as 1981 when the Department failed to obtain the Minister's approval for the adoption of the safety principles, despite having received advice that such approval should be sought. </PARA>
<PARA> Further instances of failure adequately to brief Ministers were identified in subsequent years. The Committee concluded that explanations offered by the Department of Defence for these failures were unacceptable. The Committee was dismayed-a considered word-to find that, after a mandatory defence instruction was issued requiring ministerial approval for explosive operations that could not comply with the NATO safety principles and which involve some risk to the public should an accident occur, operations were allowed to continue without explicit ministerial approval. The Committee took an extremely dim view of senior, unelected officials in the Department of Defence making decisions to allow non-compliance storage of explosives when, according to its own departmental instruction, having the force of law, such decisions ought to have been made by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that all such instances now have the Minister's approval. The Committee has made recommendations to ensure that in future the Minister's approval is sought in a much more timely manner. The Committee considers the findings of this report to have ramifications for all departments in their relationships with the Executive. It should serve as a reminder to all departmental secretaries of the need to ensure that Ministers are adequately briefed and kept informed. What that means is that, unless senior departmental officers brief Ministers, then this place counts for nothing. It becomes a sham. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole principle of ministerial accountability to Parliament is based on Ministers being briefed, informed and consulted by their departments. If that does not happen, then we may as well turn back the clock and adopt some other form of government other than Westminster parliamentary democracy, because this is about Ministers under conservative governments and Labor governments not being briefed by their departments. It is inexcusable, and I repeat that this report ought to be read by all senior managers. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that I am substantially truncating my remarks and I conclude my remarks on this report by thanking Tom Duncan for his contribution to the inquiry and Celeste Conlan for her efforts in typing the report. This may seem a rather small matter, but when I conclude honourable members will understand why I make special reference to the people behind the scenes. </PARA>
<PARA> The 304th report of the Committee concerns guidelines for departmental annual reports. In this regard, because of the lateness of the hour, I put aside my set remarks and adopt the more informal way of commenting on this report. It has long concerned me as a parliamentarian that the House of Representatives has not had the same opportunity as has the Senate to effectively scrutinise the operations of government departments. Our report sets out to say two things. The first is that reports of government departments ought to be routinely considered by the standing committees of the House of Representatives, and I am pleased to say that that view is endorsed by the Standing Committee on Procedure, which has already reported to the House. My hope is that its recommendation will be dealt with and supported by all members of the House, because at the moment effectively two-thirds of the Parliament is not actively participating in the scrutiny process to the extent that it ought to. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter involved in this report concerns the Committee's recommendations that the performance of government departments ought to be referred to in their annual reports. The position at the moment is that members of the House of Representatives simply do not focus on these questions of performance. If the Department of Finance and others who advance the view that Parliament ought to be more concerned with performance issues-and I share that view-then the best way to achieve that is to involve the two-thirds of the Australian Parliament; namely, the members of the House of Representatives, who at this time have no role at all in relation to that scrutiny. I commend that report to the House and, as I have done in another place, I commend the Procedures Committee and its chairman, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford), for their forthright views on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The final report is the 305th report, which concerns the implementation of the offsets program. I refer the House to comments made by my colleagues in the Senate on this matter. This report and inquiry arose because the Committee was not satisfied with the response of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Department of Defence in response to an earlier report. It is a good example of a committee following up an earlier report to ensure that appropriate reforms are initiated and that accountability occurs. Following that report, the Committee found that in some areas corrective action had either not been implemented or not been completed despite the fact that criticisms had been made several times in the last few years, including by the Auditor-General, the Inglis Committee of Review on Offsets in 1984 and the Public Accounts Committee itself. In respect of civil offsets, there were still no proper procedures to ensure objective valuation of offsets proposals, no definitive procedures manual, no penalties for non-compliance with offsets agreements, and so it went on. </PARA>
<PARA> Of particular concern to the Committee is the matter of notification procedures-a matter which goes to the very heart of the offsets program-where there were still no proper procedures to ensure that the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce was aware of all Commonwealth purchases. To me, it is mind-boggling and beyond my comprehension how senior managers cannot organise a system so that the key government department knows when purchases are being made that fall within the offsets program. Nevertheless, despite all the recommendations of those independent reviews, that system is still not in place. The Committee has made very substantial recommendations, we believe, which will overcome those problems and the other problems referred to in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend those behind the scenes-Julia van der Heide, for her considerable efforts and professionalism in assisting the Committee, and Jackie McConnell for her long hours at the word processor. I remind the House that I have tabled six reports today and, in order to meet those requirements, I believe that a super-human effort was required by the Committee secretariat staff and others. We sometimes refer, with a throwaway line, to the good work of the staff of the House of Representatives' printing office. They worked through the night to produce our report and to do many other things to allow the Committee to finish its work in the course of the year. Therefore, I extend-and also on behalf of this House-personal thanks to Pat Norris, Terry Lyons, Peter Daniel, Andy Reinpacher, Andy Hall, Anne van Limbeek and Carol Kent. </PARA>
<PARA> My own staff having worked until 2 a.m., I was checking to see that the staff of the Secretariat had finished their work, and when I rang the office four or five of them were still hard at it. I came back in the morning for an 8.30 meeting and felt very self-righteous that the Public Accounts Committee office was locked up and here was I back at work and the staff were at home. I found out after some pressed interrogation that the last member of my staff, the staff of the Committee, left the office at half past six in the morning. That person was there out of total dedication, not getting overtime, and out of loyalty to the Parliament. Another staff member actually slept in the car, being so exhausted and tired and having to be back into the office the next day. To me, that really is tremendous professional dedication and shows a great love and commitment to the work of the Parliament. I take my hat off to the sterling effort of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the end of the year and just about the end of my speech. Being Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee is not easy. In the Government party room I sit beside the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). I think I can tell a tale out of school that recently he approached me and said what a good job I was doing as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. I suddenly realised that the reason he was able to say that was that his Department was one of the few departments that the Public Accounts Committee had not had some substantive dealings with in the course of the year. Perhaps we can remedy that in the new year. I tell that story only because I want to indicate that it is often not an easy job. Sometimes it involves taking a stand and it does not always endear me to Ministers of the Government, but in all cases they have allowed me to do my job-I hope with independence and integrity. I thank them and the House. I thank my fellow members of the Committee and, last but not least, the long suffering Secretary of the Committee, Trevor Rowe, who remains in the House to hear this rather longwinded speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Mackellar) (12.29 a.m.)-by leave-It is probably a reflection of the values that have gradually seeped into this House over the years that I, with some trepidation, take a few minutes to say something about the reports that have been introduced by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), but here we are at half-past midnight on the second last day of sitting and only a few days before Christmas receiving into the House some of the most important material that the House would have considered in this session. If we look at the work we have done even today-and I have spent some hours in the House today and, heaven knows, over the course of this session I have spent many hours in the House-there would be very few half hours that I have spent here which have been more worth while than the last half hour in receiving the six reports from the honourable member for Hughes, as the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to be a lot more serious about the way in which we approach government in this country. It is much more important than anybody recognises that the Parliament, itself, take a much deeper interest in the management of government. It is certainly a subject in which I have taken a very deep interest for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a Minister in the previous government for a relatively short time and I very much regretted the absence of adequate committee support for the work I did. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts at that time was a very great support to me. It conducted a number of inquiries into the department which I administered. The Committee was composed of members of three parties, and it carried out work of immense value. As a Minister I had no concern whatsoever about that kind of analysis being extended to Committees of the House of Representatives had they been established at that time, because I believed that the dangers that people see under the political process of members of the Opposition taking advantage of the committee inquiry process being enormously outweighed by the additional arms and legs that that process would give to a Minister in overseeing the extraordinarily complicated workings of his department. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very difficult indeed for a Minister with a very small number of professional staff members in a ministerial office to supervise adequately a department of State which may employ, as in the case of the Department of Health when I administered it, including statutory authorities, about 12,000 people. At that time, my staff spent approximately $4 billion of public money; now it is I think $7 billion or $8 billion. The Minister overseeing the activities of that very complicated mechanism with two professional staff as I had at the time, and with very limited external advice, is a very difficult process. I was grateful for the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts at that time, and the assistance it gave me. It would have been even better had I had, at that stage, committees of the House of Representatives with a full inquiry role. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member says, we must look more into the way in which committees of the House of Representatives can be further integrated into the continuing supervision of departments. Personally, I have no cause for concern about the multi-party nature of those committees. Generally speaking, the impression one gets about members of parliament working together on committees is utterly different from the impression one gets in this chamber at Question Time. The bear pit in this chamber each afternoon bears no relationship to the cooperative working relationship that members normally have and the substantial work they do when they are locked up in private and not subjected to the baleful influence of the press. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to congratulate the honourable member and his committee for the work they have done. I very much regret that it is now between midnight and half past midnight on the second last day that the honourable member has has to introduce this very large number of very important reports. I acknowledge the work that has gone into these reports from his staff in his own private office and the staff of the Public Accounts Committee. I know the amount of work that goes into such reports, and I know the degree of attention that he and the members of his committee would have devoted to the production of those reports. </PARA>
<PARA> The message we ought to leave with the House-and I hope with the whole Parliament-is let us hopefully, in the next Parliament, take a much more constructive approach to these matters and not spend so much of the time of this House every day in totally unconstructive nonsense which, I am afraid, is the hallmark of the way in which the House of Representatives has tended to operate in recent years. I am not being partisan about this. It has happened under more than one government. I hope that if there is a change of government my colleagues and I will devote ourselves to satisfactory change. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first came into this place 12 years ago I was told that after I had been here for a while I would understand that a lot of the procedures and processes that I saw were very worthwhile, and that when I had been here for quite a long time I would understand why they are necessary. I can only say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to Mr Speaker, who is in the chamber, and to the Leader of the House, (Mr Beazley) that after 12 years in the House spent observing these processes and practices I regard them, in many respects, as being even more lunatic than I thought they were when I first arrived. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to address the storage of explosives within Sydney Harbour, as discussed in the 303rd report of the Public Accounts Committee. It was known as far back as 1956 that the Royal Australian Navy was not complying with safety instructions, and that the only solution to that non-compliance was to move out of Sydney. Subsequently, in 1981 and 1984, safety and waivers instructions were issued to allow the Navy to get around this problem. Clearly, at that time, the Navy should have informed the Minister if it could not comply with these instructions and, indeed, should have asked the Minister for approval to continue operations. But, as the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner) has already said, this was not done until 1988-years after the problem arose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee found that time and time again there was a need to obtain approval when compliance with the regulations was not possible and when, as a result, local residents were put at risk from the explosives stored in Sydney Harbour. Again, for years nothing was done. As was stated in the report, Ministers were not briefed. The Committee expressed its dismay at this lack of action by, and lack of information given to, the current Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) and his predecessors. It gives rise to the question of what sort of control the Minister has over his Department with regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost as bad as this was the finding by the Committee that the Navy spent $1.4m installing moorings during 1988 only to come to a decision that, after all this expenditure, explosives did not need, and probably never had needed, to be stored at Spectacle Island as it was possible for them to be transferred from Garden Island to Newington in one day without the overnight rest and recreation, if one can call it that, at Spectacle Island. The Navy ceased storage of explosives at Spectacle Island approximately seven months after the installation of the piles. Presumably, that was a decision made at the time the Navy was spending $1.4m to put in the piles for the barges which were no longer going to store explosives there. </PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing that the Minister did not know what was going on. It seems to me that he could not run a department appropriately-he could not run a game of hopscotch, if the situation is as it appears to be. It is not good enough for the Minister, as he did previously, to palm off the blame onto his Department by saying it kept him in dark. The doctrine of ministerial responsibility clearly means that he is responsible for the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the usage of Spectacle and Snapper Islands. The only remaining use that the Navy has for Spectacle Island, according to the evidence that the Committee received, is in the unlikely case of a major emergency. It was never clear to me why, if an emergency occurred, the Navy could not follow the same procedure as it does at present-that is, transfer any explosives from the ships involved in the emergency direct to Newington. The Navy also claimed that, in any case, it had to store the lifting equipment used for handling explosives at Spectacle Island and, because of this, the whole of Spectacle Island had to be off limits to non-Navy personnel-a restricted zone. This is somewhat mysterious as it seems to imply that the Navy has such top secret lifting equipment that it wants to protect it from the prying eyes of perhaps the KGB. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not understand why the equipment needed to be stored there, and why it could not be stored at Newington or Garden Island. If that were the case the Navy could make one of the most worthwhile gestures possible in this area-both geographically and in regard to the portfolios-and vacate Spectacle Island and return it to the people of Sydney. Clearly, the Navy does not need it for storage of explosives or associated equipment and it does not need it as a contingency for future problems. I would like to point out that this beautiful island is very much a part of our local heritage. For example, there are half a dozen buildings on it which were built before 1865, and approximately 30 which were built before the turn of the century. I believe very strongly that it should be accessible to the people of Sydney, and not jealously guarded by the Navy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I mention Snapper Island, which is approximately 50 metres from Spectacle Island. It is the home of the Sydney Training Department, a corps of sea cadets who largely reclaimed the land from the harbour waters with the use of fill from places such as neighbouring Cockatoo Island. This corps has been part of our community for more than 50 years. It offers our kids worthwhile training, discipline and team spirit and needs to be strongly encouraged. But the Navy, as the owner, if you like, of Snapper Island, took out eviction proceedings in 1987 against the sea cadets because the island was theoretically in the blast line of Spectacle Island explosives. The cadets have now applied for another lease. Clearly now that there are no explosives the Committee found-and states in its report-that there was no apparent reason for the Navy or, more recently, the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Defence, not to renew their lease. The uncertainty about Snapper Island hangs over the head of the sea cadets like a damoclean sword. The Government should remove this problem immediately and renew the lease of the sea cadets which was such a boon to our local youth. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to join with the honourable member for Hughes in taking this opportunity to commend the staff of the Committee for their tireless and exemplary work in relation to this and other reports. In particular, in relation to this report I want to commend Tom Duncan. I would also like to point out the untiring work of Trevor Rowe, who is sitting in the gallery at this moment. I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Hughes in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority has a duty under section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to monitor and review the performance by the National Crime Authority of its functions and to report to both Houses of the Parliament on any matter connected with the performance of the Authority's functions to which, in the opinion of the Committee, the attention of the Parliament should be directed. The Committee fulfils its monitoring and reviewing functions by keeping a watch on what the Authority is doing and examining suggestions that the Authority has not been performing its statutory functions or that it has abused its powers. At the Committee's regular meetings with the Authority, it is briefed on matters such as the Authority's staff and resources, legislative and other constraints which impact upon the Authority's ability to perform its functions effectively, the Authority's relations with other agencies, its strategic planning and procedures, completed investigations and operations which have entered the public domain. The Committee, however, is not briefed on matters which the Authority considers to be operationally sensitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee's regular meetings with the Authority also provide a forum for the Committee to raise with the Authority matters of concern in relation to the Authority's performance of its functions. Thus the Committee has sought explanations in relation to prosecutions arising out of the Authority's investigations which have failed at the committal stage of proceedings, allegations of interference in the Authority's operations by politicians or officers of law enforcement agencies and suggestions of inadequacies in the Authority's arrangements for the protection of witnesses. In addition to the oral briefing provided at its regular meetings with the Authority, the Committee receives written briefing material from the Authority, including detailed briefs on each of the Authority's investigations. The Committee has also sought and received from the Authority specific documents to supplement material provided by way of oral briefing and explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has presented two previous reports to the Parliament pursuant to its monitoring and reviewing function, the first report in November 1985 and the second in November 1986. In May 1988 the Committee tabled a report entitled The National Crime Authority-An Initial Evaluation in which it supported the passage of legislation repealing the sunset clause in the National Crime Authority Act 1984 which would otherwise have resulted in the Authority ceasing to exist on 30 June 1989. However, the Committee considered that it was only possible to make an initial evaluation of the Authority's performance at that time since many of the Authority's investigations were not completed and legal proceedings were before the Courts or pending in a number of matters arising out of the Authority's investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee therefore recommended that a more comprehensive evaluation of the Authority's work and of the success of the law enforcement strategy underpinning the establishment of the Authority be undertaken after the Authority had been in existence for seven years. That recommendation did not mean, however, that the Committee did not intend to continue to fulfil its duty of monitoring and reviewing the performance by the Authority of its functions in the meanwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pursuant to that duty that the Committee presents this, its third report, to the Parliament. Its purpose is to report on matters connected with the Authority's performance of its functions during the period since the Committee presented its second report and, in particular, to report on the Committee's examination of some of the Authority's investigations which may have given rise to public concern that the Authority was not performing its functions properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The report examines in some detail two of the five cases arising out of investigations by the Authority which failed at the committal stage of proceedings in the course of the past year. The Committee had intended to deal with all five of the cases but three of them remain before the courts. The Committee is satisfied that the Authority took action in the two cases dealt with in the report only after careful investigation and after receiving advice from counsel that prima facie cases against the accused existed. The Authority cannot be blamed for the fact that other factors, such as new evidence, arose which resulted in the charges being dismissed or withdrawn. The Committee is confident that the Authority carried out its statutory responsibilities correctly in assembling admissible evidence in relation to these matters and in forwarding that evidence to the responsible prosecution authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The report touches on a number of other matters, including the need for the Authority to be sensitive to the demands it places on individual witnesses appearing before it, the costs of the present system for telecommunications interception and the Authority's resources. It also contains detailed statistics on the Authority's investigations, bringing up to date similar tables which appeared in the Committee's initial evaluation report. </PARA>
<PARA> The period covered by the report saw the end of Mr Justice Stewart's term as the chairman of the Authority and it is appropriate to remark that, as the foundation chairman of the authority, Mr Justice Stewart deserves much of the credit for establishing as a working reality what was a unique and novel concept in law enforcement. This comment is not intended to discount the very significant contribution made by the other members of the Authority over the past five years nor the dedication and hard work of the many members of staff who have helped over that time to build the reputation of the Authority as an effective element of this country's law enforcement machinery. However, nobody can deny that the Authority in its first five years bore the stamp of Mr Justice Stewart's personality nor that, in significant respects, it reflected his experience as a royal commissioner inquiring into the Mr Asia drug syndicate, the Nugan Hand Bank and the illegal interception of telephone calls by the New South Wales police. </PARA>
<PARA> The task that Mr Justice Stewart was set as the foundation chairman of the Authority was a difficult one. Not only was he required to build a new agency, the very existence of which was fiercely resented by many within the existing law enforcement structure of the country but the legislation also contained a sunset clause which would have resulted in the Authority ceasing to exist after a period of five years unless the Parliament passed a further law to the contrary. The Authority was thus under pressure to prove itself and to do so quickly even though the investigation of organised crime is a lengthy process and it takes even longer for the results of investigations to be processed by our criminal justice system. As the Committee commented in its initial evaluation, there was an expectation on the part of the Parliament in establishing the Authority that it would get results-that it would put important or significant criminals behind bars. This the Authority, under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Stewart, did. </PARA>
<PARA> To mention but one investigation, the Authority's Operation Iliad concerns the illegal importation and distribution of drugs, especially heroin, by persons of Chinese origin and their associates, and the financing of the importation and distribution of such drugs. The Australian Federal Police had initiated a similar investigation but had met with little success. At the time the investigation was taken over by the Authority-at the request of the Australian Federal Police-some targets had been identified but no substantive police investigation of them had been undertaken. The Authority's investigation has so far resulted in the charging of 93 people on a total of 198 charges. Sixty-seven prosecutions have been completed, resulting in 39 convictions and 15 deportations. The significance of this investigation is reflected in the amount of heroin seized-almost 60 kilograms-and the severity of the sentences imposed on those persons who have been convicted. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure of the Authority's success lies not only in the number of convictions of significant criminals arising from its investigations but also in the fact that it is unlikely that many of these convictions would have occurred without the Authority. Other agencies had already attempted investigations in some of the cases and had been unable to launch prosecutions, while in the case of former Chief Inspector Barry Moyse in South Australia, for example, it was acknowledged that the offences might not have been uncovered but for the intervention of the Authority. Moreover, in some areas it appears that the Authority has not only broken new ground but that it has stimulated other law enforcement agencies to follow it. The Committee understands that the Authority was the first law enforcement agency in Australia to employ Chinese-speaking officers from Hong Kong to assist in the investigation of criminal activity among Chinese elements in Australia. Now the Australian Federal Police are also experiencing some success in this area, in cooperation with the authorities in Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee considers that the complete change in the membership of the Authority, apart from the member in charge of the Adelaide office, Mr Le Grand, which took place in July 1989 was undesirable from the point of view of continuity in the Authority's investigations, it has undoubtedly given the new Chairman, Mr Peter Faris, QC, the opportunity to place his stamp on the Authority in turn. The Committee looks forward to a continuation of the Authority's record of success under its new Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that I give thanks to the members of the Committee for the work they have done this year, to pay recognition to the work of the Secretary, Mr Giles Short, and to his assistant, Miss Rosa Ferranda, without whose help the Committee would not be able to function. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I have some concerns about the difficulty being experienced in Australian law enforcement because of conflict between existing police forces, both State and Federal, and with the NCA. There does appear still to be a certain amount of jealousy between existing police forces, a certain amount of desire to be the ones who catch the big crooks, and cooperation could well be improved between those bodies. There is also a concern that, with the corruption that exists in some State police forces, law enforcement is still not being properly addressed because of the reluctance on the part of other law enforcement officers to exchange necessary information. I believe that there have been changes and there have been improvements in the police forces in Australia in recent years. With other members of the Committee I look forward to future successes of all law enforcement agencies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 November I outlined to the House what I described as the most outrageous rip-off I have ever encountered as a member of parliament. I tabled documents demonstrating that Dr John Page of Wyong had touted for investments from his patients and that a 60-year-old widow, Mrs Joan Gardiner, had entrusted her life savings, amounting to over $82,000, to Dr Page. Dr Page has now refused for eight months to return her life savings, apart from one measly payment of $250 and a second of $1,000. Mrs Gardiner is destitute and may have to sell her home because of Dr Page's actions. Dr Page refuses to say what has happened to Mrs Gardiner's money but claims that overseas interests represented by James Crowl and Associates are about to pay Dr Page a large sum of money to buy his investment scheme. Yesterday the offices of Dr Page and James Crowl and Associates in Wagga were searched by the New South Wales Police following an investigation of my allegations and other complaints made by people who entrusted money to Dr Page.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that at least a dozen people, including patients of Dr Page, have invested up to six-figure sums with Dr Page. Dr Page's wife on A Current Affair on 24 November described the investment scheme as a mathematical system which could be applied to racing and was an absolute certainty. Dr Page has often boasted to people in my electorate that he had developed the perfect betting system, using computers to record past performances of horses. Mrs Gardiner and many other investors were never told that their money was being used to fund Dr Page's betting bank. I am pessimistic that investors will ever see their money again. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of Dr Page's elderly patients, Mr and Mrs Pearce of Tuggeranong, were personal friends of mine. Sadly, they passed away last year. Bert Pearce suffered from a severe sight disability. I believe that they invested more than $50,000 with Dr Page. However, Dr Page has cleverly avoided giving investors any detailed documentation on their investments. Dr Page now claims that Mr and Mrs Pearce invested only $10,000 and that he had verbal instructions from the Pearces to invest part of their money in a horse racing syndicate. I find it hard to believe that any doctor would stoop so low as to persuade one of his sick and elderly patients to invest money in a horse syndicate. Dr Page has not only betrayed the trust of his patients by touting for investments and seeking financial gain for himself, I believe he has also set out to milk the assets of elderly people such as Mr and Mrs Pearce by persuading them to put their life savings in such risky schemes as this horse racing syndicate. I seek leave of the House to table a number of documents concerning Dr Page. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Letters A to I are correspondence between Dr Page and the lawyers acting for the estate of Mr and Mrs Pearce. They demonstrate that Mrs Gardiner is not the only person who received letters from Dr Page promising payment but never delivering. Dr Page's wife, Mrs Colleen Page, ran the surgery office for her husband and also kept his records. Letter J is a pyramid style letter which Dr and Mrs Page sent to Dr Page's patients, their neighbours in Wyong and even friends from the local kindergarten, seeking to make money from this scheme. It is a typical chain letter which asks people to send money to Mrs Page and others so that the recipients can learn how to get money from other people. These chain letters are illegal, and I believe it is grossly improper for any doctor to seek to use pyramid selling techniques to make money by sending this type of material to his own patients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have also received information that in 1985 Dr Page was found to have in his possession approximately 40 Medicare cards belonging to the residents of a nursing home in my electorate. Dr Page handed out a letter, which I have also tabled, to residents after being made to return the Medicare cards. Anyone reading that letter would see how despicable Dr Page's behaviour has become. I believe it is improper for any doctor to have in his possession the Medicare cards of nursing home patients. I call on the Health Insurance Commission and the New South Wales Medical Complaints Unit to investigate this and the other improper activities which I have detailed tonight and last month. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Page has assured patients that their investments are safe because he is about to sell his perfect investment scheme through Mr James Crowl and Associates of Wagga. I have received information that Mr James Crowl has been a bankrupt for some time. I am very concerned that anyone could believe that Mr Crowl would be able to assist Dr Page to repay the investments. Dr Page has also told patients that he intends to sue me for speaking out about the way he has ripped off Mrs Gardiner and other elderly constituents of mine. I challenge Dr Page to do his best to sue me. I would welcome any opportunity for Dr Page to be forced to come clean on what he has done with the hundreds of thousands of dollars he took from central coast residents. If Dr Page's threat to sue me proves to be as empty and hollow as his promises to repay money which he owes to my constituents, I am sure the residents of the central coast will quickly form their own opinion as to who to believe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very conscious of the hour and I do not intend to delay the House. If it is possible to truncate my remarks, I do not intend to take even my five minutes. The matter I want to bring to the attention of the House and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) concerns the Riverland areas of South Australia, an area with which I am very familiar and in which I have spent the greater part of my life. During the last week the Riverland area of South Australia has been in turmoil. Two of the commodity groups in the area, namely, the dried apricot growers and the citrus growers, have been most concerned about the difficulty they are facing from what they see as unfair imports of goods from overseas in both the citrus concentrate juice area and the dried apricot area. In the case of citrus concentrate juice, the source of the juice is Brazil; the source of dried apricots into the Riverland is Turkey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So concerned have apricot growers been that over the past week they have been picketing the canners and the dried and vine fruit receival place in the area, refusing to deliver fruit to these places unless the price for the fruit is raised. I happen to think, If I can be pardoned the pun, that is a rather fruitless exercise. But the growers do have some cause for concern, and I want to bring that cause for concern to the attention of the House tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of imported Turkish dried apricots we need to realise that the Turks produce something like 30,000 tonnes of dried apricots a year. If we consider how much effort is required to take a dried apricot, which is a relatively small item, and produce 30,000 tonnes, that is a large exercise. It makes the Turks the largest driers of apricots in the world. The second largest drier of apricot fruit in the world is Australia, which dries little more than 6,000 or 7,000 tonnes in a good year. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern that Australian growers have is twofold. Firstly, they have expressed a concern that the fruit coming into Australia under import standards does not meet the same rigorous standards as are applied to our export fruit. I want to bring that to the attention of the appropriate Minister. Secondly, not only are they concerned because the price is depressed but they also believe that the Turks enjoy an unfair advantage in that they are recognised as a developing country and so are accorded developing country status in tariff terms. One could observe that Turkey seems to have spent about 2000 years as a developing country. </PARA>
<PARA> Citrus growers in the Riverland are similarly concerned because they face competition from Brazilian imports. The Brazilian citrus growers produce only fruit for juice and it is concentrated citrus juice that comes into Australia. The Australian citrus industry is export oriented and what is exported is whole fruit against competition from other producers around the world. However, the Brazilians do not have an export industry in the whole fruit sense; they are simply the exporters of juice fruit. In order for the Australian industry to be an effective exporter it must select its best fruit for export, which means that an overrun inevitably finds its way into the juice market. Just as the apricot growers are concerned about the developing country status accorded the Turks, the citrus growers are concerned that the Brazilians, who are far and away the world's most efficient producers of oranges and concentrated orange juice, are also afforded developing country status and so provide an unfair competition to the existing Australian growers. </PARA>
<PARA> I bring both of these matters to the attention of the House because it is summer, the height of the apricot season. The Minister ought to be aware of the competition that apricot growers are feeling and of the turmoil currently being experienced in the Riverland area about these two potential export industries. </PARA>
